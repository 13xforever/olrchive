00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. It is February 12th, 2006 and this is part B, the second half of episode number 174.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Thank you guys so much for joining us and

00:31.640 --> 00:35.440
Incentive for you guys to listen live on Sunday nights if you can those you guys out there

00:35.440 --> 00:40.940
I mean we podcast for a reason we know not everybody can listen live some nights, but Sunday nights when we do do this live

00:41.560 --> 00:44.960
We play music during the breaks when we do this show and tonight

00:44.960 --> 00:49.940
We played some pieces in that break from some classic Super Nintendo and Genesis titles

00:49.940 --> 00:51.560
We played a song from Secret of Mana

00:51.560 --> 00:56.840
in there one of the songs from the beginning of the game and then we played the emerald hill zone song from Sonic the hedgehog 2

00:56.840 --> 01:00.320
too and the reason why I'm bringing this up we can't play this stuff on the

01:00.320 --> 01:05.080
podcast because of copyright stuffs but I brought it up because it inspired some

01:05.080 --> 01:08.600
comments here in our chat room www.orangelanterino.com click on chat

01:08.600 --> 01:13.880
vxjasonxv who also happens to be our lovely webmaster he listens to he

01:13.880 --> 01:17.560
says a lot of games just don't have memorable music like this anymore

01:17.560 --> 01:25.320
catchy but not memorable agree disagree I I can't I don't worry I there is the

01:25.320 --> 01:33.320
It's a rare standout hit, granted, but you know, one Katamari doesn't make up for a lot of, you know, very memorable Super Nintendo games they had back then, you know?

01:34.320 --> 01:35.320
Genesis.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.320
There was also Space Channel 5.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
True.

01:38.320 --> 01:40.320
Then again, the game was pretty much all music, wasn't it?

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
True. True.

01:41.320 --> 01:46.320
But I mean, I understand what he's saying, is that with a lot of current titles, you either have licensed music, too.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.320
You play a game like Burnout, everything you're hearing is licensed, same stuff you hear on the radio.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.320
Or, you know, it's not like the same it used to be.

01:53.320 --> 01:58.920
I don't know I I kind of see where he's coming from I kind of agree on that so the same care

01:58.920 --> 02:03.620
Isn't being put into it. Yeah, I think that when you have limiting

02:04.720 --> 02:06.720
limiting circumstances

02:06.840 --> 02:08.840
When you do something

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
when you do something that

02:11.520 --> 02:14.760
Excels, you know under those limiting circumstances

02:15.540 --> 02:18.720
People are going to recognize they're gonna see the effort that went into it

02:18.720 --> 02:23.720
Nowadays, you can make something that sounds really good with minimal effort.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.720
True, so maybe it's harder to stand out above the pack in that case?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.720
I really think so.

02:28.720 --> 02:32.720
Well anyway, just a little side topic, I just thought that was interesting.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
I love when our chat room inspires conversation here.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.720
See, we're an interactive show, truly interactive.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.720
We'll open up the Skype line a little later in the show, hopefully we have some time,

02:43.720 --> 02:46.720
and of course there's always ye olde mailbag.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.860
Anyway, we were talking about game music. Now, one game that had at least a great

02:50.860 --> 02:55.280
intro song, if not a really good soundtrack, all together was Halo 2.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.160
But sometimes the other soundtrack that you're hearing when you play on Xbox

03:00.160 --> 03:01.800
Live ain't so great, right, Loki?

03:01.800 --> 03:05.120
Exactly. There was a profanity study done this week

03:05.120 --> 03:08.960
for Halo 2, and I love the way that they intro this.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.560
What exactly is a profanity study? It's studying the frequency of profanity in

03:13.560 --> 03:14.480
Halo 2

03:14.480 --> 03:20.480
during online games. Anyways, I love the way they intro this. It's basically, when you

03:20.480 --> 03:25.160
log into Xbox Live, more often than not, you're greeted by a 14 year old that learned a new

03:25.160 --> 03:32.160
word on the playground that day. It's great. Anyways, this study, here's what they've basically

03:33.540 --> 03:40.540
come up with over the course of 33.9 hours. Anyways, the number one word, of course, that

03:40.540 --> 03:47.760
word of course that appeared would have been fuck with 43% of the time with an

03:47.760 --> 03:59.640
average of 8 and 8.11 uses per hour that's it total per the 33.9 hours would

03:59.640 --> 04:07.260
have been 275 uses of the word fuck fucking or the rocker etc ok the number

04:07.260 --> 04:14.700
Number 2 being shit or you know something to that extent.

04:14.700 --> 04:19.060
Of course some of the other colorful language that was in there, 9% of them were racial

04:19.060 --> 04:27.100
slurs, 7% of them were sexual slurs including you know, I wanna fuck your mom, that type

04:27.100 --> 04:28.100
of stuff.

04:28.100 --> 04:35.300
Wait a minute, does I wanna fuck your mom count as the usage of the word fuck or a sexual

04:35.300 --> 04:37.220
usage of the word?

04:37.220 --> 04:43.060
Well basically uh sexual it says sexual phrases which were not homosexual fuck was not included

04:43.060 --> 04:50.000
in this unless it was directed at a person i.e. your mom so how how many times did frack

04:50.000 --> 04:53.380
appear that's what i want to know i don't know that's how they do it on tv seven percent

04:53.380 --> 04:59.540
of them were homosexual references in other words you're gay you suck you homo um number

04:59.540 --> 05:06.300
damn appear three percent of the time, bitch seven percent of the time, and ass five percent

05:06.300 --> 05:13.300
of the time, you know, being asshole and assbag, asshat, et cetera. And they actually...

05:15.580 --> 05:22.380
I know why you wanted to do this story tonight. You just wanted an excuse to say assbag and

05:22.380 --> 05:27.340
sound professional. Hey, assbag? Come on, what the hell was that?

05:27.340 --> 05:33.660
a dirty job at something. Overall in the course of the, like I said, the period of the study,

05:33.660 --> 05:40.660
shit was used 121 times, followed by, you know, ass at 35 times, and then of course,

05:40.740 --> 05:45.260
you know, racial slurs, etc. But it's very interesting that they actually broke it all

05:45.260 --> 05:52.260
down three at a time. So, yes, you know, game experiences may differ during online play.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.820
That I guess does make sense now.

05:54.820 --> 05:56.820
I prefer Oh Poopy.

05:56.820 --> 06:01.460
Well thank you very much Loki for earning this episode an explicit tag!

06:01.460 --> 06:02.460
Good job!

06:02.460 --> 06:03.460
Woooo!

06:03.460 --> 06:09.300
Cause, you know, I'm gonna pwn you, you fucking noob.

06:09.300 --> 06:13.260
Now wait, wait, remind me, okay, before you say all these words again, what was the point

06:13.260 --> 06:14.260
of this study?

06:14.260 --> 06:17.380
Again, just basically the point- Scat's Whores or what?

06:17.380 --> 06:20.420
Like just, I was curious how many times people really do say fuck.

06:20.420 --> 06:24.880
Is basically it was that the rating they're trying to kind of I

06:25.400 --> 06:31.040
Guess bring this to light, you know, all these stupid people are on Xbox Live and stuff and kind of that

06:31.040 --> 06:33.040
You know, maybe that they should

06:33.560 --> 06:39.280
This isn't exactly a plea, you know for the government to crack down or tighten and control and gaming industry. It's just basically

06:40.200 --> 06:44.560
Information that parents can educate themselves with that. This is how much you know

06:44.560 --> 06:48.880
fucking language they're going to hear during the course of Halo 2.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.440
Interesting. Which is why Halo 2 is the number one Xbox Live game.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.120
How much more do they hear in their house? I don't know.

06:56.120 --> 07:00.280
I like this. Tweek in our chat room says, Asshat is my Xbox's name.

07:00.280 --> 07:04.880
Well good for you buddy.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.080
Dan's Halo team was called Badass Ninjas

07:08.080 --> 07:12.760
but it was AZZ. Interesting. Oh let's see here.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.400
alright I don't know alright anyway

07:16.400 --> 07:20.800
fine great study hooray hooray alright let's go to a more serious halo 2

07:20.800 --> 07:22.360
related article shall we

07:22.360 --> 07:26.120
Jamie for the love of God please save us

07:26.120 --> 07:29.760
try not to use ass bag in your story well

07:29.760 --> 07:32.840
about ass 2 on PC

07:32.840 --> 07:37.560
stop it okay halo 2 on PC according to xbox.com

07:37.560 --> 07:41.560
xbox

07:41.560 --> 07:51.560
The Xbox game, uh, Halo 2 is being put on PC, but there's a hitch on that one, that it's not for Windows XP, but for Windows Vista.

07:52.560 --> 07:59.560
So, uh, you'll be able to do playing on that one, uh, well, next month, I suppose.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.560
In other words, uh, buy Windows Vista, please. Here's an excuse to upgrade to Windows Vista.

08:04.560 --> 08:10.560
So you can freakin' play Halo 2, which really would be better if you had an Xbox anyway.

08:10.560 --> 08:15.520
Being half the computers right now anyways, can't run Windows Vista's default theme.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.680
Sad. SAD!

08:19.420 --> 08:21.420
Microsoft is not learning anything!

08:22.300 --> 08:24.300
You know where our chat room is going with this now?

08:24.300 --> 08:29.780
I'm back on the swearing thing, but this is, you know, this is a good indication by our chat room here.

08:29.780 --> 08:33.740
They're bringing up, have you guys ever seen that video on the internet of the kid?

08:33.740 --> 08:36.820
And I don't know if it was staged or not. People say it's legit, but whatever.

08:36.820 --> 08:42.420
Some kid is playing on Xbox live and he left his voice chat on or whatever and you can hear him yelling at his mom

08:42.420 --> 08:44.780
And people are quoting it in our chat room right now

08:45.960 --> 08:47.140
Let's see

08:47.140 --> 08:52.380
It looks like SSJ 100 Matt and fire bomb are going back a little a little bit back and forth and chair over there mom

08:52.380 --> 08:55.060
I want my fucking chocolate milk. You promised me you bitch

08:55.060 --> 08:58.420
I'm gonna climb the hatch you said I could get whatever I wanted and I said chocolate milk

08:58.420 --> 09:02.460
But now I want Mountain Dew have you ever heard that? Oh my gosh. It's so

09:02.460 --> 09:07.220
sad I don't know how else to describe it. I've heard children talking to their

09:07.220 --> 09:12.540
parents this way though. That's crazy. Anyway, I just had to bring that because it made me think of that and those

09:12.540 --> 09:17.180
guys are on it too. Anyway, let's talk about something pure and wholesome and

09:17.180 --> 09:22.700
good in the world like Oprah. Okay, maybe that's a controversial subject and you're

09:22.700 --> 09:26.780
probably wondering what in the hell does Oprah have to do with gaming? Is she gonna

09:26.780 --> 09:32.700
have video games on her show no not yet but who knows because Nintendo has their

09:32.700 --> 09:40.620
sights on Oprah this was Reggie Phil's aim speaking at DICE he said that

09:40.620 --> 09:45.980
Nintendo is considering using new marketing outlets such as Oprah and

09:45.980 --> 09:51.340
Ellen he said a quote blue ocean of opportunity through new types of

09:51.340 --> 09:56.260
gameplay end quote so obviously Nintendo's trying to attract a whole new

09:56.260 --> 09:59.860
set of gamers here and I think we've kind of seen this in the early releases

09:59.860 --> 10:04.020
for the revolution I seem to remember them saying well this controller looks

10:04.020 --> 10:08.420
like a TV remote everybody's used the TV remote so we're trying to expand to a

10:08.420 --> 10:11.780
whole new base of gamers you can see that Nintendo is being very aggressive

10:11.780 --> 10:16.380
with this stuff also he went on to point out that Nintendogs was a great success

10:16.380 --> 10:23.740
brain training in Japan sold 2.5 million by the way brain age train your brain in

10:23.740 --> 10:28.860
minutes a day is coming out here on April 17th I'm very interested to check

10:28.860 --> 10:37.420
this out so very interesting there on how Nintendo's being aggressive there

10:37.420 --> 10:42.300
with their marketing they don't they feel I guess not enough moms are playing

10:42.300 --> 10:49.340
you know the Nintendo systems I suppose not all right that'd be great mom why

10:49.340 --> 10:57.260
pony noobs on you know smash brothers revolution all right Jamie what do you

10:57.260 --> 11:04.900
have for us next um did you have the games like porn I don't know what games

11:04.900 --> 11:10.060
you play but I know you said you and Dan kind of have some fond memories over

11:10.060 --> 11:14.900
games but I hope this isn't the kind of me screaming at him for being a okay

11:14.900 --> 11:18.340
every time that we played like Street Fighter and he wins uh-huh he has to

11:18.340 --> 11:20.340
talk shit, you know like

11:21.340 --> 11:24.420
You suck. Well, I'm like, I'm not gonna play with you again then

11:25.180 --> 11:28.860
I'd be you know, if it were me, I'd be all push. I am putting out tonight. I'd be like

11:29.420 --> 11:33.700
Bitch, you watch out. I'll use cami. All right. He hates when he's cami by the way, huh?

11:33.700 --> 11:39.140
Cuz I I own him every time. Okay. No, I did not know. I'm sorry. Let me take your bait. No, Jamie

11:39.140 --> 11:41.500
I didn't know the games are like porn. What do you mean?

11:43.260 --> 11:45.260
Well, there's been a

11:45.260 --> 11:56.860
a bit of a talk going around about how games are being marketed but there's been this obsession

11:56.860 --> 12:02.040
going around with basically making them all cinematic that game pitches are being done

12:02.040 --> 12:09.060
like you know like it's like this movie or it's like this movie and then you know they've

12:09.060 --> 12:14.380
got to go out and use a different media to market the games you know you sit and watch

12:14.380 --> 12:19.720
you'd be watching a movie trailer at the theater and you get a game thing up

12:19.720 --> 12:25.800
there like I'm not watching movie I'm watching a video game ad you know

12:25.800 --> 12:34.040
there's actually a a quote out here by a as his last name pronounced J for Joff

12:34.040 --> 12:40.960
David Joff who was the creator of God of War mm-hmm but he's basically putting

12:40.960 --> 12:46.960
down the video game industry to imitate Hollywood movies and not offer you know

12:46.960 --> 12:51.560
the decent wages that you find amongst the Hollywood industry because the games

12:51.560 --> 12:55.320
are being marketed just the same way so are they saying they're not saying games

12:55.320 --> 13:00.440
are like porn take that literally but they're saying games is like how porn is

13:00.440 --> 13:04.200
viewed in the entertainment industry is that what I mean okay interesting good I

13:04.200 --> 13:08.320
was kind of wondering if this is going back to the resin trans vibrator thing

13:08.320 --> 13:13.040
again no I have a story on that coming up later awesome but I love this quote

13:13.040 --> 13:18.540
here was referring to the tie-in with Peter Jackson's King Kong and this is a

13:18.540 --> 13:23.920
quote a lot of reviews praise King Kong's lack of HUD but what what's wrong

13:23.920 --> 13:28.920
with an HUD what's wrong with a health bar that raises good to the player when

13:28.920 --> 13:32.960
he replenishes it and why are we applauding the in the press for been

13:32.960 --> 13:37.360
abandoning the native language of video games there's also another quote here

13:37.360 --> 13:43.540
I'm about the obsession with cinema and he admitted I am guilty of that as well because God of War was inspired by Raiders of

13:43.540 --> 13:44.440
The Lost Ark

13:44.440 --> 13:44.940
however

13:44.940 --> 13:51.900
he explained he wanted the game to give players the experience of watching Indiana Jones as a ten-year-old rather than being Indiana Jones themselves and

13:52.800 --> 13:56.020
Now this is where the porn industry thing ties in another quote

13:56.120 --> 14:01.900
It's like the porn industry sort of I read about this guy who had this topless review that he's trying to add art to and

14:01.900 --> 14:05.000
It's bombing maybe games fall into that slot some days

14:05.000 --> 14:08.740
I think games can be something else the next great entertainment media and then days

14:08.740 --> 14:13.000
I feel like it's just like porn or motion rides where there's no capability to reach high emotional levels

14:14.000 --> 14:15.320
Wow

14:15.320 --> 14:17.320
That's a very interesting quote

14:18.080 --> 14:20.320
And I have to sit on I don't have an immediate reaction

14:20.320 --> 14:23.080
I don't have to sit on that sit on that one and think about it for a little bit there games

14:23.080 --> 14:28.360
So that's how games are like porn is that when you try to be artsy with porn people don't buy into it

14:29.120 --> 14:30.120
hmm

14:30.120 --> 14:35.420
You know, he also said you have to wonder what would happen if we had more people with creative sensibilities

14:35.420 --> 14:39.020
If more games had a soul had something to say something that resonates

14:39.420 --> 14:44.260
He also was a resentful over the fact that people that create games receive

14:44.500 --> 14:48.800
You know pretty meager wages compared to how Hollywood directors and screenplays receive

14:48.980 --> 14:54.640
He said I'm really frustrated with the way the industry is structured. There is a sense of kind of being exploited

14:54.860 --> 14:59.540
It's an industry problem, but he has of course no intention to leave the industry

14:59.540 --> 15:03.540
He said if Sony came to me and told me we're making God of War 2 I might have to decline

15:03.540 --> 15:08.780
He said before admitting I can stand up here and say I I won't do it until they kick me out. I'm not going anywhere

15:11.180 --> 15:17.580
Huh, but you know, but I you know my whole thing with that is you know, like I'd said earlier not only is it that

15:18.820 --> 15:25.260
We're seeing the same type of standard in video games. That's expected, you know, if movies were seeing them marketed the same way to

15:26.020 --> 15:27.260
You know

15:27.260 --> 15:30.500
Right up along there with your feature flick. You've got the game to go with it

15:30.500 --> 15:35.300
You have other games being marketed in the same genre. Why aren't they getting the same type of of?

15:36.340 --> 15:39.640
You know pay that anyone in the cinematic industry would receive

15:41.940 --> 15:46.880
Interesting I don't I don't have an easy answer for that right now. It gives us something to think about though

15:46.880 --> 15:48.880
I'm curious what the chat room thinks about that

15:48.980 --> 15:52.700
Orange loves radio.com click on chat. Maybe we'll get some Skype calls about that later. I don't know

15:53.380 --> 15:55.380
Thank you for that story. That was a good one

15:55.380 --> 16:00.060
Alright let's move on and talk about Sony. In part 8 tonight we talked a lot about the

16:00.060 --> 16:02.180
DS and Xbox and stuff but we didn't

16:02.180 --> 16:06.580
talk a whole lot about Sony so Loki save the day here give us some Sony news.

16:06.580 --> 16:10.540
Okay basically one of the first things we have is

16:10.540 --> 16:14.220
could the PlayStation 3 kill Sony because if you think about it this thing is taking

16:14.220 --> 16:15.220
forever to come out

16:15.220 --> 16:19.540
so you kinda have to look at it a little bit. One of the things that's being brought up

16:19.540 --> 16:22.900
is you know the approach where they're taking it this is an

16:22.900 --> 16:27.540
all media platform type thing it's like you can play videos on it you can

16:27.540 --> 16:31.180
you know look at your pictures browse the internet yeah but what about the

16:31.180 --> 16:34.340
games the games it's a gaming system game should be first

16:34.340 --> 16:37.380
you know let's not focus on it being a blu-ray player but

16:37.380 --> 16:41.780
you know seriously the other thing is it slices it dices what is the cost of this

16:41.780 --> 16:43.260
console going to be I mean

16:43.260 --> 16:46.780
they're saying oh it might be you know four hundred dollars could be five

16:46.780 --> 16:47.980
hundred dollars I mean

16:47.980 --> 16:52.300
people don't have that kind of money to drop on these console systems like that

16:52.300 --> 16:57.020
Plus, you know, with Blu-ray coming out and stuff, not many people

16:57.020 --> 16:59.740
feel the need that they need Blu-ray because you're not going to see a big

16:59.740 --> 17:03.420
difference unless you own a high-def TV and only 24 percent of the market out there

17:03.420 --> 17:06.780
owns a high-def TV, so who cares?

17:06.780 --> 17:10.060
I think that number's going to increase though, certainly, throughout the next few years.

17:10.060 --> 17:15.500
Oh yeah, it will, but I agree. Sony needs to drop the price hint already, so people stop

17:15.500 --> 17:19.420
theorizing about this, and Game Developers Conference would be a good time to do that hint-hint,

17:19.420 --> 17:23.500
but we all know we're gonna be waiting until E3 to see the real meat of this.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.860
The other thing is, and I think this is probably gonna change right now,

17:26.860 --> 17:31.660
that we haven't really seen much in games right now, nothing's really been finished,

17:31.660 --> 17:35.900
and just right now I think the whole point is everyone's starting, you know, to kinda,

17:37.500 --> 17:41.180
you know, think all doom and gloom about the PS3 because they don't know anything yet.

17:41.180 --> 17:46.060
So, you know, they figured that the lack of information is a bad sign that the system

17:46.060 --> 17:49.960
isn't going to be ready or it's going to be launched too high they're not going

17:49.960 --> 17:52.660
to launch the system for like seven hundred dollars because that'd be

17:52.660 --> 17:56.980
ridiculous and the fact that it's also supposed to be like you know a DVR as

17:56.980 --> 18:02.020
well is it though people are paying that on eBay for Xbox 360 so we're is that a

18:02.020 --> 18:05.860
crazy price point it is a crazy price point I think so too but I'm just saying

18:05.860 --> 18:09.620
they're people will pay it yeah people pay if that's you know over retail

18:09.620 --> 18:13.460
whether you be charging for these if there's a shortage Oh $2,000 there you

18:13.460 --> 18:19.460
go but I don't know I think that they need to come out with some information

18:19.460 --> 18:24.140
that's for sure sooner the better well is it possible there might be any shows

18:24.140 --> 18:27.820
coming up where we could see some of this information there is actually at

18:27.820 --> 18:36.020
the TGS show not the Tokyo game show but the Taipei game show 2006 Sony will be

18:36.020 --> 18:41.460
showcasing their next-gen console featuring numerous booths 80 booths

18:41.460 --> 18:47.300
actually, um, covering all the games, um, they're gonna be coming out, and, uh, 20 of

18:47.300 --> 18:49.380
them exclusively for the PS3, so.

18:49.380 --> 18:52.180
I don't, I think, I think it's just gonna be recycled stuff.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.180
I really don't, yeah, I, you would, why would they announce something new at this show?

18:56.180 --> 18:59.620
Except, no, the new thing added is going to be the, uh, Boomerang competition using the

18:59.620 --> 19:00.620
controller.

19:00.620 --> 19:05.580
Boomerang controller has been redesigned, actually, so, there was an article put out

19:05.580 --> 19:10.860
by, um, I believe that there was some gaming group that got to, um, test out the PS3 and

19:10.860 --> 19:15.600
three of the games that have been made so far on the dev console obviously and the controller

19:15.600 --> 19:20.320
being used does not look like a boomerang so interesting okay they're basing it more

19:20.320 --> 19:24.600
around the dualshock type of thing good because dualshock were if it ain't broke why fix it

19:24.600 --> 19:29.840
well it could be an ergonomic dualshock obviously the boomerang of death is probably not gonna

19:29.840 --> 19:36.760
be the controller all right and even if it was the boomerang of death that was the controller

19:36.760 --> 19:40.620
third-party people are gonna make a dualshock looking one anyway so you can always buy that

19:40.620 --> 19:46.140
about prices Sephiroth1215 in our chat. Remember back when PS1 was like $500?

19:46.140 --> 19:49.660
People paid that when that first came out.

19:49.660 --> 19:53.300
It would be insanely stupid for the PS3 to be $700.

19:53.300 --> 19:57.060
It's murder for their system right there.

19:57.060 --> 20:01.500
Alright.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.340
Okay, we'll go ahead and move on here, get into another story.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.380
Actually, it kind of relates to the PlayStation 3. It's just a real brief thing I have here.

20:09.380 --> 20:12.780
Activision has revealed that they will be releasing

20:12.780 --> 20:17.060
three titles at launch for the Sony console and of course one game for the

20:17.060 --> 20:18.220
revolution as well.

20:18.220 --> 20:22.460
As far as what games those are, well that we don't know.

20:22.460 --> 20:25.740
For whatever reason those are being kept well under wraps. I would say

20:25.740 --> 20:29.420
everybody's holding on to it so they can now blow their load at E3.

20:29.420 --> 20:32.840
I think E3 is going to be an avalanche of information.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.940
You know if it's not that

20:35.940 --> 20:39.460
it's gonna be murder for the publicity of the systems

20:39.460 --> 20:42.580
I mean there's so much hype around this year's E3 with these two systems

20:42.580 --> 20:46.700
Revolution and PS3 that both companies better be prepared to

20:46.700 --> 20:50.460
lay it all out on the table I think yeah so

20:50.460 --> 20:54.340
this is interesting because the article on this site or that this ran on here

20:54.340 --> 20:58.500
gamersreports.com where we found this says you can guarantee that one of these

20:58.500 --> 21:02.100
games will be Tony Hawk something

21:02.100 --> 21:06.420
and certainly that would make sense. A new Tony Hawk game on

21:06.420 --> 21:09.780
PS3 at launch. Successful series, why not?

21:09.780 --> 21:14.300
Good theory. Alrighty, what else

21:14.300 --> 21:18.740
might the PS3 bring us, Loki? Hopefully lots of violent games.

21:18.740 --> 21:21.900
I know Grand Theft Auto IV is going to be for the PS3, but

21:21.900 --> 21:25.500
one of the things that we've been actually seeing, there was a

21:25.500 --> 21:29.220
British, or yesterday,

21:29.220 --> 21:33.660
actually at the British Embassy in Tokyo, there was a seminar on British gaming

21:33.660 --> 21:34.460
and

21:34.460 --> 21:38.340
demonstrated how the powerful graphics of the PS3

21:38.340 --> 21:41.900
can display lots of violence.

21:41.900 --> 21:45.220
Oh yes, from headshots to

21:45.220 --> 21:48.540
body shots, they had basically

21:48.540 --> 21:53.620
this developer, they were kinda showing off

21:53.620 --> 21:57.620
how, you know, realistic the physics can be in this.

21:57.620 --> 22:04.260
One of the things that they showed was, you know, the meat of being stripped off the bones

22:04.260 --> 22:10.100
as a bullet penetrates a body, and just, you know, the ripping off of flesh.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.100
Ew!

22:11.100 --> 22:12.100
Awesome!

22:12.100 --> 22:13.100
That's great.

22:13.100 --> 22:20.320
But, I mean, honestly, this is a duh for me, because as graphics get better, so will the

22:20.320 --> 22:21.320
detail of violence.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.460
And you know what else is gonna get better?

22:23.460 --> 22:26.620
The tits and ass will be more realistic as well.

22:26.620 --> 22:35.820
duh sorry but you know they need to come out of the game tits and ass headshot

22:35.820 --> 22:42.200
that's the selling the tits and ass headshot game hell yeah coming to ps3

22:42.200 --> 22:47.500
exclusively maybe that will be do a beach volleyball too on a 360 we'll see

22:47.500 --> 22:53.140
moving on I know that if the ps3 does usher in a lot of violent games you know

22:53.140 --> 22:59.460
who's gonna love this you know who's gonna love that me well not just you but

22:59.460 --> 23:05.620
our old buddy Jackie poo Jackie poo as I think that's is that our new name for

23:05.620 --> 23:08.460
him that's our new name form is Jackie poo all right what's up with Jackie poo

23:08.460 --> 23:14.940
this week other than being an anally retentive asshole um oh did I say that

23:14.940 --> 23:17.780
on air the views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge radio do not necessarily

23:17.780 --> 23:22.500
reflect those of the staff but are of the individuals themselves nice

23:22.500 --> 23:28.260
disclaimer. You're welcome. I applaud you. I came up with that laptop in my head, based on what I'd seen in movies. Good.

23:28.260 --> 23:37.500
Alright. Jackie P. Robano. Robano? Yeah. Why? What does he have to do with games? You do know we're a video game show, right? Because he's one of

23:37.500 --> 23:48.900
Elevation's key investors. Elevation Partners. Oh. Because they're trying to obtain Take Two. Oh, okay. So Jack Thompson hates Take Two. Bono wants to buy

23:48.900 --> 23:51.860
somebody who's got a do okay okay so what do you say in the letter do we know

23:51.860 --> 23:57.140
dear Bono the letter begins I write you as a fellow brother in Jesus Christ

23:57.140 --> 24:02.460
appreciative of your bold witness to the transforming truth of the gospel in both

24:02.460 --> 24:06.420
your words and your deeds I write to encourage you respectfully and in the

24:06.420 --> 24:10.340
spirit of brotherly love not to purchase take to interactive software incorporated

24:10.340 --> 24:15.100
all right my brain is burning it's because you're going to hell that's okay

24:15.100 --> 24:19.320
We all got our spot. I think you should have ro bono went, you know in the name of love

24:20.980 --> 24:22.980
Don't forget it

24:23.020 --> 24:26.780
You know what the the whole terminology there. I I admit

24:28.220 --> 24:30.660
That it's I think that it's just a very

24:32.180 --> 24:35.080
Poorly masked attempt to as

24:35.820 --> 24:37.700
I obviously

24:37.700 --> 24:43.940
Well, besides the get publicity thing, to try to use religion as a front for his own

24:43.940 --> 24:47.820
personal agenda, which I find horribly insulting.

24:47.820 --> 24:48.820
Yeah.

24:48.820 --> 24:53.620
And if you're a religious person, you should probably find this insulting too, I think.

24:53.620 --> 24:57.940
Well, he's also said in the letter that Take Two is lied to the investment community in

24:57.940 --> 25:03.160
its latest SEC filing and wards that ongoing criminal investigations have put the publisher's

25:03.160 --> 25:07.420
very survival at risk despite the fraudulent assertations in the recent

25:07.420 --> 25:15.760
SEC filing that they are all without merit you know first of all if he had

25:15.760 --> 25:20.540
done any actual research into this he would realize that he doesn't have

25:20.540 --> 25:25.980
grounds to stand on it's it's documented with the Department of Justice there is

25:25.980 --> 25:30.780
not an epidemic the only reason there's an there's anyone's thinking there's an

25:30.780 --> 25:35.800
epidemic is because of people like him in other words Jackie boo shut up sit

25:35.800 --> 25:39.780
down shut up you know he needs to just you know cry me a river build a bridge

25:39.780 --> 25:44.380
and get over it all right and Loki did you want to look into did he ever get

25:44.380 --> 25:48.540
our flowers I mean I know they weren't our flowers but we helped and our name

25:48.540 --> 25:51.780
was on the little signature of the letter yes it was the host orange lounge

25:51.780 --> 25:55.340
radio do you ever get those day ever get those flowers yes he didn't forward him

25:55.340 --> 26:03.140
on to the offices of what was it rock star and I believe the attorneys

26:03.140 --> 26:08.540
representing rock stars I'll bet he never even looked at him yeah even take

26:08.540 --> 26:12.980
a minute to smell the flowers they were pretty did he well that's good they were

26:12.980 --> 26:18.300
pretty that's good and he basically called it harassment you know this is

26:18.300 --> 26:23.100
this harassment of me I'll follow stick to and blank Rome's lead in

26:23.100 --> 26:31.180
in characterizing me in the media and in an Alabama's courthouse as variously a bisexual

26:31.180 --> 26:35.340
pedophile, mentally ill, paranoid, and so forth.

26:35.340 --> 26:38.340
Yeah, because I believe that's what the letter said at all.

26:38.340 --> 26:41.740
Anyways, what a dumbass.

26:41.740 --> 26:45.020
How is sending flowers harassment?

26:45.020 --> 26:48.140
Ordering pizza to somebody else, that's harassment.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.140
That's not what happened here.

26:49.140 --> 26:54.800
point of this thing was to do something that was non-harassing because there are

26:54.800 --> 26:59.460
a lot of people that have chosen to respond immaturely to Jack Thompson and

26:59.460 --> 27:06.240
this was supposed to be the ante of that so he completely missed the point and

27:06.240 --> 27:10.760
actually I think that the heart of the point was to still get the point across

27:10.760 --> 27:16.680
right that we're really sick of him he basically here it is here it is my like

27:16.680 --> 27:21.500
My mom always said and I'm sure you guys and Europe brings her this a lot to kill him with kindness

27:22.340 --> 27:28.060
Exactly. Maybe we should send him a puppy. He said right. He said that the flowers were sent

27:28.580 --> 27:30.580
to harass him and

27:30.720 --> 27:37.880
He sent them, you know to them to basically they're forwarded in a memory of the innocence that each of you three men

27:38.120 --> 27:40.000
help kill is

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Jack Thompson put

27:42.000 --> 27:48.600
And, uh, so it's forwarded in the memory of these victims, um, who, whose killers have

27:48.600 --> 27:53.120
yet, I wanna know how many people he thinks have actually been killed by Grand Theft Auto

27:53.120 --> 27:57.980
and how many of these people actually, you know, cause if there's like three people he's

27:57.980 --> 28:02.220
talking about here, and how many millions of people have played this game, I would say

28:02.220 --> 28:09.220
that's a pretty small number, I mean, that obviously would, you know, cause if everybody

28:09.220 --> 28:12.820
was you know learning to kill from these games wouldn't there be millions and

28:12.820 --> 28:16.940
millions of killers out there all right if I can't send him a puppy Ross makes a

28:16.940 --> 28:19.700
good point but I can't send my puppy because the moment the puppy tried to

28:19.700 --> 28:24.220
bite him he'd have the puppy locked up and then put to death poor puppy I knows

28:24.220 --> 28:27.700
we don't send him any puppies I'm sorry no I really don't want to talk about

28:27.700 --> 28:31.580
Jackie all right fine I really do I'm actually seriously thinking about and

28:31.580 --> 28:35.500
compiling the statistical data myself and writing him a letter sweet because

28:35.500 --> 28:42.340
you know when I write a letter to anybody I put statistical data to back up every damn

28:42.340 --> 28:43.340
thing I say.

28:43.340 --> 28:47.700
Well I'm curious now with this whole you know activism thing what what's next for the flowers

28:47.700 --> 28:52.260
for Jack's Jack folks I mean you know they they created a huge thing here well they've

28:52.260 --> 28:57.420
been arguing back and forth with Jack Thompson over email looks like it says get over your

28:57.420 --> 29:02.100
Jack Thompson obsession this is not about me it's about rock stars sale of murder simulators

29:02.100 --> 29:04.840
to children.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.560
We should encourage the parents to do their job.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.800
I hope to god that the next Grand Theft Auto game that comes out is Grand Theft Auto Murder

29:10.800 --> 29:12.720
Simulator for Children.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.720
Alright, what's the website?

29:14.720 --> 29:18.120
Didn't the Flowerster Jack folks get so big they had to make their own new website?

29:18.120 --> 29:20.120
I believe it's pixelantination.com.

29:20.120 --> 29:25.960
And of course pixelanti was a term that Jackiepoo coined.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
So cute.

29:26.960 --> 29:31.120
Alright, so keep tabs on that and we'll be keeping an eye on it too to see what they

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
do next.

29:32.120 --> 29:36.840
We like not to talk about him each week, you know, I know it's news. All right

29:37.840 --> 29:41.320
You know gosh talking about that stuff always gets me in a foul mood

29:41.960 --> 29:43.960
Doesn't it get you in a bad mood too? Grr

29:44.960 --> 29:46.960
so

29:46.960 --> 29:48.960
You know what that means.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.960
My FU of the Week time, Dr. Sakura.

29:57.960 --> 30:08.960
My FU of the Week goes to San Francisco traffic for sucking out the soul that was sitting within me happily after leaving the Kintetsu Mall.

30:08.960 --> 30:18.960
Yesterday I went with my friend Becky to the Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose to go look at the Egyptian exhibit.

30:18.960 --> 30:23.960
And then we went on to San Francisco to go shopping and look for Japanesey stuff.

30:23.960 --> 30:29.960
And after we were done with the shopping, we decided we were going to go find somewhere to eat and I got lost.

30:29.960 --> 30:35.960
Well, I didn't really get lost. The streets there make no sense because you'd be going down the road and all of a sudden,

30:35.960 --> 30:40.600
all of a sudden oh we're gonna split off here and not make any type of real sense in how we go.

30:40.600 --> 30:46.360
So I finally got turned around and got back up and made my way back to mission which I knew would

30:46.360 --> 30:51.400
lead me to Van Ness and we were going up Van Ness going you know what let's see the Hard Rock Cafe

30:51.400 --> 30:57.560
because as far as she remembered it was on Van Ness. It wasn't! So we're like oh crap we don't

30:57.560 --> 31:07.180
don't see it anywhere so we so we headed back to go to to the Fisherman's Wharf

31:07.180 --> 31:11.300
we were gonna try to eat a bubblegum so there's a two and a half hour wait yeah

31:11.300 --> 31:15.580
I know and then we found the Hard Rock Cafe had been moved there so we're like

31:15.580 --> 31:19.780
great so after us saying out of spite we were not gonna eat the Hard Rock Cafe we

31:19.780 --> 31:25.780
ate here anyway it was really yummy and to also make a little follow-up to a

31:25.780 --> 31:29.780
previous F.U. I am in good health today, shut up!

31:29.780 --> 31:33.780
I know what you're talking about. Yes.

31:33.780 --> 31:37.780
Alright. Alright, moving on. Uh

31:37.780 --> 31:41.780
Loki. I got nothing, I'm not really, there's not been

31:41.780 --> 31:45.780
anything actually. What if I threw a book at your head? What if I give you something to be pissed off about?

31:45.780 --> 31:49.780
Okay. Somebody step on Loki's foot.

31:49.780 --> 31:53.780
Fine, you'll stay. You need to get more creative next time.

31:53.780 --> 31:57.780
I didn't want to make anything stupid-sounding, like you usually do.

31:57.780 --> 31:58.780
Yes, exactly.

31:58.780 --> 31:59.780
My F.U.

31:59.780 --> 32:00.780
Oh, yes?

32:00.780 --> 32:01.780
The Ferret has an F.U.

32:01.780 --> 32:02.780
Oh, sure, what's that?

32:02.780 --> 32:06.780
I don't even know if the mics are picking that up anymore.

32:06.780 --> 32:07.780
We'll see.

32:07.780 --> 32:08.780
Moving on.

32:08.780 --> 32:12.780
My F.U. the week goes to the fact that I'm not going to be here for two weeks.

32:12.780 --> 32:13.780
That kind of stinks.

32:13.780 --> 32:17.780
You know, it's for my day job, and I like my day job and all, and getting out of town

32:17.780 --> 32:21.780
once in a while on the company dollars is cool and all, and I get to go teach, which

32:21.780 --> 32:22.780
is what I love to do.

32:22.780 --> 32:27.780
But it still sucks because, you know, I have to put other stuff I like to do, such as this, on hold.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.280
So, that bites.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.280
So, an F-you to that frustration feeling that comes with that.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.280
Grr.

32:35.280 --> 32:38.280
And an F-you to the fact that I probably won't really get to play games while I'm out there.

32:38.280 --> 32:41.280
I'm gonna fall behind on this game, I'll be able to read websites and stuff, but...

32:41.280 --> 32:45.780
My laptop that I'm taking is not that hot, unless I convince Xtuber to let me borrow his.

32:45.780 --> 32:51.780
Um, and, uh, you know, I won't get to play World of Warcraft, I won't get to play Xbox, or PlayStation, or any of that stuff.

32:51.780 --> 32:58.060
I mean I could always rent the Jamie's Cradling her laptop. No, I know I know you won't give up the precious but um, I

32:59.020 --> 33:03.780
Could always rent Nintendo 64 games in the hotel room the last hotel I stayed at

33:03.780 --> 33:08.020
You know that last Hilton I stayed at had that you should take your and your PSC

33:08.820 --> 33:14.460
I'm I I'll probably take the DS. Yeah, I probably will. You know, I I originally can chat with us on animal crossing

33:15.740 --> 33:17.740
Yeah

33:17.740 --> 33:19.740
really good games coming out for the SNL.

33:19.740 --> 33:20.940
But anyway, I'll probably do that stuff.

33:20.940 --> 33:22.540
Jackie P's Stalker on CS.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.140
They do have free Wi-Fi, so maybe I'll actually get back into Animal Crossing.

33:27.900 --> 33:32.460
Anyway, let's get back to the show. I feel better now that I've vented.

33:32.460 --> 33:37.340
I paid off my last loan, by the way. Not my very last loan, but I've got my second room now.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.100
My second downstairs room.

33:39.100 --> 33:39.900
Yep, me too.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.780
Eight hundred and forty-five thousand bells!

33:42.780 --> 33:43.820
That's a lot of fish.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.140
Oh no, I've been using fruit.

33:46.140 --> 33:47.140
Alright.

33:47.140 --> 33:48.140
Fruit.

33:48.140 --> 33:49.140
I have 100,000.

33:49.140 --> 33:50.140
And selling furniture.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.140
Bells and fruit.

33:51.140 --> 33:52.140
Alright.

33:52.140 --> 33:54.980
Let's talk about, we've talked a lot about DS, let's talk about the PSP now.

33:54.980 --> 33:57.540
Matt, you have a lot of stuff in regards to the PSP, right?

33:57.540 --> 34:00.900
Yeah, there's lots of stuff going on with the PSP.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.820
Wonderful franchises making their way over in homebrew stuff and, yeah, yeah.

34:04.820 --> 34:11.860
Anyways, first of course, Tekken is coming to the PSP, so that'd be great, except we

34:11.860 --> 34:15.360
don't know if it's going to be a new Tekken fighting game, which it probably will be,

34:15.360 --> 34:20.400
something crappy like death by degrees you know so anyways I'm looking forward

34:20.400 --> 34:26.480
to that another thing if you missed out on nintendogs you might get your

34:26.480 --> 34:33.200
chance with the dog happy life it's actually a nintendog like game and you

34:33.200 --> 34:40.640
can you know customize your dog's room and so on and so forth teach it stuff so

34:40.640 --> 34:43.840
that'd be pretty cool and actually no it'd be interesting I'm not sure if they

34:43.840 --> 34:50.240
have this, but since they do have the mic, which you can use for the PSP, maybe you can

34:50.240 --> 34:56.760
actually train your dog via voice, voice recognition or something, that would be pretty cool.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.600
No word on that, but one can speculate.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.600
So that would be pretty cool.

35:01.600 --> 35:07.800
And that's scheduled to be released in Japan on the 27th of April, so check that out.

35:07.800 --> 35:13.860
And of course, if you are in the free stuff, there's a nice little transport tycoon clone

35:13.860 --> 35:22.140
out there called OpenTTD and it's actually available for download on PSP updates, it

35:22.140 --> 35:27.460
looks pretty sweet so, you know, pretty cool if you're looking for some free stuff.

35:27.460 --> 35:30.620
The other thing, if you're looking for another free game, you might remember this back in

35:30.620 --> 35:35.380
the days of shareware, Jazz the Jackrabbit's made its way onto the PSP.

35:35.380 --> 35:36.380
Jazz Jackrabbit!

35:36.380 --> 35:37.380
That's so cool!

35:37.380 --> 35:40.740
yes sonic ripoff sonic ripoff with guns

35:40.740 --> 35:45.620
see so actually you can think of maybe saying shadow the hedgehog ripped off

35:45.620 --> 35:46.820
of jazz jackrabbit

35:46.820 --> 35:51.020
at I'm so that's another thing that's available right now

35:51.020 --> 35:55.580
as well for the PSP so pretty cool also available on a PC updates

35:55.580 --> 36:02.300
I'm so I'm by the way those you guys with PSP's

36:02.300 --> 36:06.980
you should be visiting OLR PSP dot com that sites pretty cool

36:06.980 --> 36:09.780
Loki, you're gonna do something nice for the folks at OLRPSP.com.

36:09.780 --> 36:11.880
You need to give them some updates, some new wallpaper or something.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.080
We need to do something for the folks there.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.380
I've been working on stuff.

36:14.380 --> 36:14.880
Alright.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.480
I mean, unfortunately, you know, time constraints.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.680
We just did a photoshoot.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.480
We need folks to be able to put our ugly faces on their PSPs.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.480
No.

36:22.980 --> 36:23.480
No.

36:23.480 --> 36:23.980
No?

36:24.380 --> 36:24.880
No.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.880
They can have pictures of you and Loki, but not me.

36:26.880 --> 36:27.380
Why?

36:27.380 --> 36:28.180
I'm mysterious.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.880
They have the album art already.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.380
Somebody could probably alter that.

36:31.980 --> 36:33.380
You look cute in the pictures.

36:33.380 --> 36:33.880
I do not.

36:33.880 --> 36:34.880
Don't, don't stop.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.180
You-

36:36.180 --> 36:39.580
Guys, send... I look cute all the time. Fanbo... there you go, there you go.

36:39.580 --> 36:42.900
I was like, Fanboy, send Dark Soccer SME an email saying you want PSP wallpaper.

36:42.900 --> 36:46.340
I do not need validation. You... I'm married.

36:46.340 --> 36:50.420
Alright. My husband says I'm hot all the time. Yes, but you need to get used to this

36:50.420 --> 36:54.020
whole, you know, internet thing. Alright, well, whatever. You know, I've been reading

36:54.020 --> 36:57.860
one of Margaret Cho's books, and reading about

36:57.860 --> 37:01.300
what it's like to be a celebrity when you don't expect yourself to be one.

37:01.300 --> 37:04.820
Right. I'm like, oh my god, that sort of happens to me sometimes.

37:04.820 --> 37:08.820
please understand we're not talk we know we we're grounded here we realize we're

37:08.820 --> 37:13.460
not like super celebrities but there is still a teensy bit of recognition that

37:13.460 --> 37:18.500
comes with us a teensy bit I don't expect to say oh I've listened to you

37:18.500 --> 37:22.380
like I found I don't even remember who was I was talking to I was just um on a

37:22.380 --> 37:27.380
message board somewhere and so this oh is that you yeah and actually two of my

37:27.380 --> 37:31.860
friends from college found me through our website Wow see that's crazy I don't

37:31.860 --> 37:36.460
like, what the hell? Hey, it's great though, we love it, we love it.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.660
But do remember guys, A, this isn't our day job, B,

37:39.660 --> 37:43.300
you know, we do this because we love games and talk about them. I joke all the time

37:43.300 --> 37:45.260
about being an internet celebrity but

37:45.260 --> 37:50.580
it's sort of true. But you're grounded with that, you don't really

37:50.580 --> 37:53.860
think. You don't have delusions of grandeur. I go to work,

37:53.860 --> 37:57.300
I go to school, and I go to the gym.

37:57.300 --> 38:01.820
You know, I play my video games and I come talk about it and it just happens to be

38:01.820 --> 38:04.580
be that people all over the world listen to me.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.020
No big thing.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.540
No big whoop, no big whoop, all right.

38:08.540 --> 38:10.580
Five, five, five, four, four, four, four.

38:12.020 --> 38:14.380
Moving on, I got a story on something

38:14.380 --> 38:17.380
we love to play a lot of, and that's sexy games.

38:17.380 --> 38:19.460
Sexy games, one up.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.700
Oh, don't gurry, you're gonna squee at some of this.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.100
This is some good stuff here, all right.

38:23.100 --> 38:25.140
OneUp.com ran an article this week,

38:25.140 --> 38:26.780
and it's actually kind of a spinoff of something

38:26.780 --> 38:29.060
they ran in original PlayStation Magazine.

38:29.060 --> 38:32.900
The Secret History of Video Game Sex.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.260
And they hit on some of the high points

38:35.260 --> 38:37.660
of sex in gaming in history.

38:37.660 --> 38:39.400
And so they have this cute little timeline.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.420
It's available on 1UP.com that starts off

38:41.420 --> 38:43.860
with Custer's Revenge in 1982,

38:43.860 --> 38:47.340
of course being one of the most memorable porno games

38:47.340 --> 38:48.980
on Atari 2600.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.620
And not only porno, but you know, racist and violent,

38:52.620 --> 38:54.080
like all wrapped into one.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.160
I mean, this is your X-rated game if there ever was one.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.660
There will never be anything like it again,

38:58.660 --> 39:05.500
for damn sure. Was Custer's Revenge even really sold anywhere? Maybe 10 copies were made and

39:05.500 --> 39:12.420
one of them got on the internet and now it's this big cult phenomenon? We'll see. River

39:12.420 --> 39:18.260
City Ransom they put in their list because it had the first pixelated butt because remember

39:18.260 --> 39:24.400
when they went to the sauna? You can see the little butt. To its defense, River City Ransom

39:24.400 --> 39:27.600
was actually a Japanese game called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story

39:27.600 --> 39:30.840
where you went, instead of going to the little shops, they actually said,

39:30.840 --> 39:34.720
you know, did all the really cute stuff, and you did go to a bathhouse.

39:34.720 --> 39:38.360
Yeah, but it's more, you know, it's a cultural thing in that case where it's, you know,

39:38.360 --> 39:41.520
but for us here in America that was a bit of a, oh my gosh,

39:41.520 --> 39:45.280
booty! Tomb Raider in 96,

39:45.280 --> 39:50.240
Lara Croft, enough said, Metal Gear Solid in 98 is

39:50.240 --> 39:53.960
cited for Merrill,

39:53.960 --> 39:58.740
because she walks around in her underwear if you go interrupt her changing clothes

39:58.740 --> 40:02.700
yeah alright and moving on the list of course she should also say she's more

40:02.700 --> 40:04.820
comfortable with her desert eagle than with her bra

40:04.820 --> 40:09.060
dead or alive enough said there

40:09.060 --> 40:12.380
is cited bouncy boobs fear effect 2

40:12.380 --> 40:17.300
retro helix because it's got sexy protagonists who are

40:17.300 --> 40:20.660
lovers a little bit of lesbianism

40:20.660 --> 40:26.200
Res in 2001 is cited for a certain peripheral that came with this game.

40:26.200 --> 40:31.420
It's very hard to find now, but it's called the Trance Vibrator, and trust me, when they

40:31.420 --> 40:35.940
developed it, they weren't thinking of the uses that some people have come up for with

40:35.940 --> 40:36.940
this.

40:36.940 --> 40:37.940
Enough said.

40:37.940 --> 40:38.940
The article was hilarious.

40:38.940 --> 40:39.940
Enough said.

40:39.940 --> 40:43.140
BMX XXX in 2002 is cited.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.140
I own that game.

40:44.140 --> 40:49.120
I played this game because you had it, and it was actually a very fun game.

40:49.120 --> 40:54.520
It's like Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX, it's a really cool game though, but it does have strippers

40:54.520 --> 40:59.640
and naked people in it, so it's got that as well, so check it out.

40:59.640 --> 41:03.720
It takes forever to get the boobs on the bike.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.680
It doesn't take very long to get the stripper cutscenes though, there's just these random

41:06.680 --> 41:12.860
stripper cutscenes inserted in the game, that you can get pretty soon, but anyway.

41:12.860 --> 41:17.800
Also on the list here of 1UP.com's Secret History of Video Game Sex, Leisure Suit Larry

41:17.800 --> 41:22.840
from 2004 enough said although I kind of curious why they didn't cite the earlier

41:22.840 --> 41:29.500
games but whatever blood rain simply for the fact that she ended up being in that

41:29.500 --> 41:34.620
Playboy spread that you know virtual girl topless thing Grand Theft Auto San

41:34.620 --> 41:42.720
Andreas hot coffee yeah Playboy the mansion that game was cited here on the

41:42.720 --> 41:48.380
list here and God of War in 2005 because of course you know he had some you know

41:48.380 --> 41:55.440
boob stuff too and lastly UMD pornography making their list here of the

41:55.440 --> 42:02.060
steamy side of gaming's past. I'm looking here in the chat room to see some of the

42:02.060 --> 42:05.260
points that folks are saying here looks like a lot of talk a lot of people are

42:05.260 --> 42:09.740
talking about bubble bath babes where's bubble bath babes from the list?

42:09.740 --> 42:15.540
game sucked all right and then people are talking about hacking your NES roms

42:15.540 --> 42:18.700
to give nudity in the games a lot of those are stupid though like you know

42:18.700 --> 42:25.060
super nude brothers I mean lame I'll never forget the one that was on it was

42:25.060 --> 42:29.860
a game that was never released here but in Japan they had an old old old NES

42:29.860 --> 42:34.460
title called nuts and milk was in his name of the game well somebody hacked

42:34.460 --> 42:38.580
this ROM and you know I just fill in the blank you know what they did in this

42:38.580 --> 42:43.300
game okay the end that's excellent

42:43.540 --> 42:49.660
moving on Jamie please say you have some type of serious story for us here by the

42:49.660 --> 42:53.220

us a call it's nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven but remember that is

43:06.420 --> 43:11.380
a toll call if you're outside the Sacramento area, which I imagine most of you are. So

43:11.380 --> 43:16.060
ask mommy or daddy if you don't own your phone line. But Jamie, first you have a story for

43:16.060 --> 43:25.100
us. New cost porn. Really? No. Oh. Quantic Dream has canned InfraWorld. It's been pretty

43:25.100 --> 43:32.600
much tossed in the garbage, kicked out to the road. Bye. In an interview with the German

43:32.600 --> 43:38.920
website working title William Dave Fonda mere I suppose I pronounce that right

43:38.920 --> 43:43.080
said infra-world at date this canceled the concept did not appeal to publishers

43:43.080 --> 43:49.280
they did say that on the cron 2 which was given the same it was announced at

43:49.280 --> 43:53.520
the same time as infra-world is actually still on track is now titled karma but

43:53.520 --> 43:57.640
it won't be out on shelves until 2009 Quantic Dream is actually working on

43:57.640 --> 44:02.560
another unnamed title at present another quote on here we have production set but

44:02.560 --> 44:07.080
cannot divulge the name or details of the project. It is an original franchise

44:07.080 --> 44:13.240
of ours, a game for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, and PC systems. Speculation is

44:13.240 --> 44:20.680
that it's a sequel to Fahrenheit. Hmm. But no one for world. Bye. Bye-bye.

44:20.680 --> 44:25.860
All right. Our Skype line is open over at www.orangelandrater.com. Click on

44:25.860 --> 44:29.020
interact with us and I'd be picking up a call right now but nobody's calling in

44:29.020 --> 44:34.260
And I'm thinking I'm looking at our chat room and people are doing this they're doing they're collectively doing this

44:34.900 --> 44:36.900
I'm sick

44:36.920 --> 44:41.240
So fine, we'll go on to the next story if you guys don't want to qualify my me low-key

44:41.780 --> 44:46.040
What's on your mind? Well, I can talk about holidays coming up pretty soon here

44:47.100 --> 44:52.220
Well, let's see. Of course. We have to talk about sexy cheats

44:52.900 --> 44:56.020
For sexy games. This is you know, it kind of goes

44:56.020 --> 45:00.680
So, we'll run down the list a little bit here of some of the sexy cheats that are out there

45:00.680 --> 45:02.420
for the sexy games.

45:02.420 --> 45:07.060
First one being Dead or Alive 4, where you can add increased bounciness to the breasts

45:07.060 --> 45:09.060
of the women in that.

45:09.060 --> 45:14.460
Simply enter your age as 99 in your profile and it will make the female character's breasts

45:14.460 --> 45:20.780
bounce more than usual for those dirty old men out there.

45:20.780 --> 45:24.820
Let's see, some other things that they have here.

45:24.820 --> 45:30.100
They actually talk about Meryl's underwear in Metal Gear Solid, which I thought was kind

45:30.100 --> 45:31.700
of funny.

45:31.700 --> 45:41.040
But you can actually put BloodRayne into JUGGY mode by entering JUGGY Dance Squad as the

45:41.040 --> 45:45.140
code to basically unlock this new mode.

45:45.140 --> 45:48.780
I don't know what exactly that does, but it would be interesting.

45:48.780 --> 45:52.060
BMX XXX, they have topless girl mode.

45:52.060 --> 45:59.180
You have to win first place in both competition levels to unlock the topless grill option.

45:59.180 --> 46:04.520
They have Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach Volleyball, Seethrough, Swimsuit, and you can actually

46:04.520 --> 46:16.780
play with Helena, Leifang, and Kristie to get a transparent swimsuit, unfortunately

46:16.780 --> 46:20.460
it is censored.

46:20.460 --> 46:26.700
And of course the guy game if you happen to unlock some of the video that's in there you

46:26.700 --> 46:31.620
can hit triangle deposit and finish I guess.

46:31.620 --> 46:38.520
Ways to spend your Valentine's Day if you are single and you enjoy looking at the women's

46:38.520 --> 46:40.580
lovely.

46:40.580 --> 46:42.780
Thank you for that Loki.

46:42.780 --> 46:46.680
You're cementing that explicit tag for tonight's little portion of the show.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
Thank you so much.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
Appreciate it.

46:48.680 --> 46:56.080
Alright, well, I guess we're going to go on over to DarkSakura, who has some news about

46:56.080 --> 46:57.680
Sonic the Hedgehog.

46:57.680 --> 46:59.720
Oh yeah, Sonic's old.

46:59.720 --> 47:00.720
I'm kidding.

47:00.720 --> 47:05.000
You know, I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog, even though I was a Super Nintendo person

47:05.000 --> 47:14.040
in my younger years, but there actually is a next generation Sonic game that made an

47:14.040 --> 47:15.680
appearance in GamePro.

47:15.680 --> 47:19.280
It's a big world exclusive thing.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.160
Cool.

47:21.160 --> 47:25.800
There is a few interesting points that were made in the article.

47:25.800 --> 47:31.200
The typical Sonic character model was about 1,500 polygons this time around.

47:31.200 --> 47:34.400
It has one million, according to the developers.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.680
Pretty awesome.

47:35.680 --> 47:39.280
The game will also be faster than any previous Sonic game.

47:39.280 --> 47:43.520
That's actually a quote from Nakamura, who is the game creator.

47:43.520 --> 47:44.940
It has motion blur.

47:44.940 --> 47:48.180
You can see it in some of the images that have been out on there.

47:48.180 --> 47:51.540
I think there were some that were published in the magazine, too.

47:51.540 --> 47:58.220
The game will feature huge environments that have night and day cycles as you progress

47:58.220 --> 47:59.220
through the game.

47:59.220 --> 48:04.940
You have morning, noon, night, changing the lighting, you know, sort of how Ocarina of

48:04.940 --> 48:09.260
Time was with the day and night.

48:09.260 --> 48:12.860
It will also use the Havix physics game engine.

48:12.860 --> 48:16.540
Pro mentioned also that there was a sequence where Sonic faced an army of

48:16.540 --> 48:20.620
killer robots and they went flying everywhere with the quote startling

48:20.620 --> 48:24.100
realism. So we'll see what it is when it's finished.

48:24.100 --> 48:29.820
Sounds like it could be pretty sweet. Alright. Alright we're about ready to

48:29.820 --> 48:33.460
wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio but first Loki has a couple quick

48:33.460 --> 48:36.300
stories he wants to go through real quick here some things that fell through

48:36.300 --> 48:39.740
the cracks that he wants to make sure we talk about. Exactly one of the things

48:39.740 --> 48:46.020
that they've actually got on this website nullriver.com for all you Mac owners out there.

48:46.020 --> 48:52.100
If you do have a 360, you're able to share your music back and forth with the 360 using

48:52.100 --> 48:58.380
this program they made called Connect360 and it'll allow you to sync up your iTunes as

48:58.380 --> 49:00.500
well as photos, etc.

49:00.500 --> 49:03.140
So check that out if you own a Mac and a 360.

49:03.140 --> 49:06.940
Aww, that was a nice olive branch from Loki, I think, in a way.

49:06.940 --> 49:08.500
Thank you for that, Loki.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
Okay, just mess anyways

49:10.920 --> 49:17.080
Moving on there are actually more video game movies in production right now, and there's been some updates on those

49:17.680 --> 49:19.680
mainly Max Payne and Alice

49:19.880 --> 49:21.880
They've actually signed on

49:22.040 --> 49:23.240
Oh

49:23.240 --> 49:25.520
God who was it Sarah Michelle Gellar?

49:26.140 --> 49:32.960
To play the role of Alice, which would be pretty sweet and Max Payne. I believe is still in production right now, so

49:33.680 --> 49:35.680
Tell her to gain some weight first

49:35.680 --> 49:38.960
So that'd be pretty cool.

49:38.960 --> 49:45.080
And basically, what was it, Scott Faye said that Doom and BloodRayne are more learning

49:45.080 --> 49:49.960
experiences than, you know, he's kind of apologizing for those movies and promises of the next

49:49.960 --> 49:52.040
ones will be a little bit better.

49:52.040 --> 49:57.740
The new wave of Xbox 360 games that come out may require you to have a hard drive to play.

49:57.740 --> 50:03.480
That's the case with the Japanese game Football Manager 2006.

50:03.480 --> 50:08.280
actually going to be requiring you to have a hard drive to play the game so

50:08.280 --> 50:12.120
you know hopefully you picked up one of those in other words Xbox should have or

50:12.120 --> 50:16.580
Microsoft should have never sold the cores they just should have kept at 400

50:16.580 --> 50:20.280
I mean I understand why they did it but yeah so I believe I can they said when

50:20.280 --> 50:23.120
they said the games there would be no games that were hard drive specific oops

50:23.120 --> 50:26.920
I guess you know that must be first-party games or something yeah that's

50:26.920 --> 50:34.920
That's going to be, I think, for the Japanese or UK systems, so check that out.

50:34.920 --> 50:40.560
There was also, during the Dice Summit that's been going on right now, they've had actually

50:40.560 --> 50:45.420
a list of, they were doing their own awards for it, the Game Awards.

50:45.420 --> 50:49.720
So basically, the winner for Game of the Year this year is going to be God of War.

50:49.720 --> 50:53.440
Oh yeah, I remember we went over the nominees a couple weeks ago, so.

50:53.440 --> 50:59.000
Okay, so God of War 1 for, and actually God of War 1 in a lot of categories, Console Game

50:59.000 --> 51:05.420
of the Year, Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievements in Animation and Original Music

51:05.420 --> 51:09.000
Composition as well as Sound Design.

51:09.000 --> 51:15.200
Some other nominees that won here actually, Outstanding Achievements in Gameplay and Engineering,

51:15.200 --> 51:17.160
there was a tie between Intendogs and Guitar Hero.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.120
Yeah, I heard Guitar Hero a lot of times.

51:19.120 --> 51:26.760
Design, Guitar Hero 1, as well as Best Soundtrack, Guitar Hero 1, that one as well, so that's

51:26.760 --> 51:29.560
pretty sweet.

51:29.560 --> 51:34.340
It's very interesting because amplitude and frequency were such wonderful games that if

51:34.340 --> 51:40.020
you think about it, aren't that much different from Guitar Hero, except for the fact that

51:40.020 --> 51:41.020
you have a guitar.

51:41.020 --> 51:43.560
People really loved it.

51:43.560 --> 51:50.060
A hot coffee thing that hit the internet for actually this was kind of advertising a brand new movie

51:50.460 --> 51:57.460
Running scared with Paul Walker and in this minigame that they have in their website you would pleasure his wife

51:58.540 --> 52:00.540
orally and

52:00.960 --> 52:07.860
Yeah, it was kind of like hot coffee and fortunately got pulled off the site due to its graphic content so

52:08.380 --> 52:10.380
Lovely so much for that

52:10.380 --> 52:14.420
Lego Star Wars 2 is actually going to be coming out, Lego Star Wars 2

52:14.420 --> 52:17.580
return of the original trilogy

52:17.580 --> 52:22.940
and it should be pretty sweet, they've got a bunch of screenshots

52:22.940 --> 52:27.060
from it, looks like it's going to be covering the original trilogy plus

52:27.060 --> 52:27.740
they're going to have

52:27.740 --> 52:32.260
co-op and stuff, quick poll please, I have never played a Lego game in my life

52:32.260 --> 52:35.260
have any of you guys? Lego Star Wars was pretty sweet actually, was it?

52:35.260 --> 52:39.900
yeah it was actually really well done so alright, maybe I missed the boat on

52:39.900 --> 52:45.960
that one somehow. We're checking out and finally dust off your Dreamcast. There's some more

52:45.960 --> 52:52.960
games for you for free. Marathon has been ported over to the Dreamcast and then we have

52:53.780 --> 52:58.880
to thank Bugged for this one. They actually have the Marathon Trilogy you can download

52:58.880 --> 53:05.880
on Dreamcast Evolution or it's dcevolution.net. They have links to that where you can make

53:05.880 --> 53:11.300
make an image to play on there. The only catch is you're going to need a Dreamcast keyboard

53:11.300 --> 53:15.460
and a controller to play the games, but if you're a fan of Halo and you want to play

53:15.460 --> 53:20.320
some of Bungie's early work, check it out. Dreamcast, one of the most horribly underappreciated

53:20.320 --> 53:25.320
consoles ever. That console was capable of more than we ended up really getting to see

53:25.320 --> 53:29.120
from it. And finally, this is kind of my hope that this is going to be in the game. Fight

53:29.120 --> 53:33.600
night round three they've got had an image come on the internet showing the

53:33.600 --> 53:38.740
Burger King in the game what I'm hoping commercially I'm hoping he's a playable

53:38.740 --> 53:42.740
character because doesn't that violate law right there would sell the game for

53:42.740 --> 53:48.560
me it would bite just to play as the Burger King and would so all right well

53:48.560 --> 53:52.640
we're about ready to wrap things up here on orange lounge radio but not until we

53:52.640 --> 54:01.400
get one last story from Loki and this is quite interesting you know I'm glad they

54:01.400 --> 54:06.840
gave this to me because you know ice cream man in the UK was but well I know

54:06.840 --> 54:11.720
you like ice cream so I love ice cream as much as I love pirating things up so

54:11.720 --> 54:15.880
the ice cream man there was an ice cream man in the UK that was actually busted

54:15.880 --> 54:23.220
for running a counterfeit piracy operation and he'll serve 200 hours of

54:23.220 --> 54:28.580
community service for selling fake video games CDs and DVDs out of his ice cream

54:28.580 --> 54:38.620
van and I believe 4,000 pirated DVD CDs and games were seized during the raid on

54:38.620 --> 54:44.500
him so unfortunately see I thought you know when I hear ice cream and I think

54:44.500 --> 54:55.980
of sweet tooth you know yeah they need a new twisted metal game all right what's

54:55.980 --> 55:00.500
this world come to nowadays when an ice cream man an honest ice cream man has to

55:00.500 --> 55:06.580
turn the piracy to make a buck at least it wasn't drugs at least it wasn't drugs

55:06.580 --> 55:12.000
all right that's it we're done with this week's episode and we're gonna say

55:12.000 --> 55:18.200
goodnight now first though a couple quick notes I am going on vacation not

55:18.200 --> 55:22.360

55:27.460 --> 55:32.680
itself stay tuned to the podcast stream we'll have something new for you guys up

55:38.400 --> 55:42.960
you know we've been doing this show every week for the podcast at least no

55:42.960 --> 55:47.520
matter what there's been a new podcast every week for like at least over a year

55:47.520 --> 55:52.360
now so if we take a little break this once please forgive us I think we I

55:52.360 --> 55:56.000
think we earned it and it's a slow news month anyway until we get to e3 and the

55:56.000 --> 56:01.040
