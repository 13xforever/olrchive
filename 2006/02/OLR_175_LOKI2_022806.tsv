16172	19373	Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio, that's right.
20393	22753	Rob and Jamie are both still out.
23174	27455	Jamie's actually feeling a bit under the weather right now, and her microphone is broken.
27715	33536	And Rob was trying to record a podcast on an iBook, and well, that didn't work out too much, you know.
34436	36056	So much for those Mac products.
36357	39977	Anyways, I'm here to deliver another podcast for you guys.
39997	42778	There's so much news, I couldn't possibly pass it up.
43536	48237	Anyways, I'm going to start things off like I start off every week with how my gaming week was.
48777	59259	Once again, I've been playing full auto all week long, and I've gotten to the point now where I'm almost done with the game, about 90% done, and it's gotten goddamn frustrating.
59499	67100	I have slammed controllers, cursed at my 360, and literally almost broke the game in half.
67200	71421	It's just really annoying, especially when you get to the part where the gang war's
72338	79621	and you have to work with some AI that's completely retarded and they want to end up blowing you up and you get penalized if you blow them up.
79741	86104	It's just really frustrating to get a gold in that and I'm really trying to do it but I just have to really take breaks from it.
86244	90285	I've been playing a little bit of Hex HD a little bit and it's an okay game.
90326	96248	Tried a little bit of the Xbox Live Arcade Gauntlet and man do I suck at the original gauntlet.
96883	101405	Of course, been playing a little bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Deathmatches.
101565	107609	Finally finished up February's runnings, and unfortunately I came in second this time around.
107729	110210	So, well, better luck next month, I guess.
112031	115793	Alright, let's start things off with Microsoft's Origami Project.
116213	119615	This is a brand new device put out by Microsoft.
119635	121296	They've been teasing it a little bit here.
121896	125598	The full details are supposed to hit the internet on March 2nd.
127278	134163	Right now they did have a teaser, kind of a concept video if you will, showing off what this thing can do.
134283	149052	It can basically play music, show some pictures, link up with the internet, has GPS, also a media PC extender, Wi-Fi, touchscreen, and of course they showed a little bit of gaming going along with it.
149092	153455	So I'm thinking they're trying to use this as a PSP killer.
154361	155962	Possibly an iPod killer.
157622	161924	Just trying to combat all the portable gaming and media systems out there.
162024	164245	Should be interesting to see how this pans out.
164525	181272	It did look a little bit big, so I'm not really sure if they're going to be trying to pass it off to the same market as maybe people that have iPods, but definitely a good alternative to a laptop or a media PC or, I don't know, just something that you can take with you on the go, browse your email and that type of thing.
181672	183293	So, kind of interesting.
184429	187331	Now, got a little bit of a scoop for you guys.
188231	195336	We have Activision's 2006 and 2007 lineup for their upcoming games.
195576	200239	And it's actually going to be something that they're going to be debuting at the Destination PlayStation show.
201820	204341	Some of the notable features on here.
204661	208984	We've got some of the movie expansions coming out.
210447	215339	also Quake Enemy Territory coming out on the PC of course that one looked really sweet
217096	218257	Tony Hawk, Downhill Jam Marvel Legends
240599	263693	Some of the other games coming out, of course, Call of Duty 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, X3, you know, tying in with the new X-Men movie, as well as some really interesting titles, including Pimp My Ride, the game, and Kabbalah's African Safari, as well as the History Channel Civil War first-person shooter game.
264214	266875	I don't know how that's going to work, but it should be interesting.
266975	269897	If you do happen to have, though, a PSP or a Nintendo DS,
270282	271723	They haven't forgotten about you either.
272044	278189	Gun is coming to the PSP, as well as Call of Duty 3 should be very interesting.
279590	281592	Or Call of Duty is going to be heading to the PSP.
281852	285055	Not sure if it's going to be Call of Duty 3, but probably a port of something or other.
286756	291360	Also, they have Over the Hedge, which is going to be tying in with the DreamWorks movie.
292702	294163	And Pimp My Ride as well for that.
294984	295204	So...
295754	296316	Interesting.
297118	300005	Looks like the DS is also getting Spider-Man Kids.
300125	303393	I have no idea what that is, but sounds pretty cool.
304572	310813	Speaking of the revolution, though, there's been some more titles announced for it as well, one of them being Pennant Chase.
311654	318055	Pennant Chase is actually a baseball game that was slated for August of last year, and it's been pushed back and pushed back.
318375	321315	Well, now they're talking that it's going to come out on the revolution.
322236	328637	Whether it be a launch title or not should be interesting to find out, but I don't know.
329338	337563	Anyways, speaking of the revolution, the cost of the revolution has definitely been one of the points that everyone's been looking at.
337603	343387	They're debating whether it's going to be about $200 to $150 retail when it comes out.
344087	346809	And a little bit of news that's actually going to back that up.
346849	352272	The software development kits have been priced, and they're only going to be costing developers $2,000.
352372	353333	Now, in comparison here,
355404	361266	The PlayStation 2 software development kit when it first came out was $20,000 per kit at launch.
361426	365247	In fact, the original PlayStation was only $4,000 to $5,000 at launch.
365347	367047	So they're even cutting that in half.
367768	374369	That's only backing up the fact that they're trying to lower development costs and basically just lower the price of games as we know them.
375270	377190	So that's something to look forward to.
377630	382932	Of course, more stuff about the revolution is coming our way in E3 this year.
383499	389102	And one of the rumors that we're going to see at E3, and I've been saying this before, is going to be some sort of virtual reality.
389783	393224	And, well, we've got some more hints at that.
393665	403610	A member of IGN's forums, going by the name of Discrete here, actually posted some information about what's going to be coming out.
404191	408133	And the information that he posted, well, it was about...
409252	413673	This brand new 3D technology brought out by a company called 3DH.
414453	422915	And 3DH is basically a company that's developing hollow projection as well as the glasses to use this.
423115	426816	And some of the pictures that they show on the website look pretty sweet.
426876	432558	So imagine using a 3D controller with this hollow projection system, possibly the glasses.
433458	437579	You can see that the revolution is going to stand in a class all by itself.
438095	439396	So that's going to be really sweet.
440317	446701	Another title that's also rumored to be coming to the revolution, of course Nintendo's denying it, would be Zelda.
447242	450524	Zelda is actually the brand new Twilight Princess.
451204	452645	It's been delayed until November.
453626	455868	Now we all thought it was because of the launch.
456708	461492	And of course, as I've been saying week after week, it's because they're adding something special to it.
461612	465955	So this has been confirmed that they're adding some added functionality to
467497	468438	GameCube title.
468878	475020	Now, no word if it's actually going to be on the Revolution, but still a game that's going to be launching with the Revolution.
476360	479321	Now, on to another Nintendo platform here.
480021	487824	We have Metroid Dread DS, a 2D Metroid sequel, rumored to be in the works for the new DS.
489344	495346	Fansite DSX is basically saying that the rumored non-3D sequel
495922	501525	of the Metroid series is still in the works, but still, you know, rumor right now.
502105	502505	I don't know.
502666	516593	Still looking forward to the brand new Metroid Prime Hunter, which is going to be coming out on the DS here in March, as well as, if you haven't played it yet, Metroid Prime Pinball, which I hear is okay, but I don't know how well pinball games do on the DS.
517613	523156	In other news, The Legend of Zelda has reached its 20th anniversary.
523236	524877	That's right, 20 years of Link.
525478	526979	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
554834	556695	And that's pretty sweet.
556715	560437	That's going to be coming out here only a couple days prior to E3.
560717	562318	So it'll be worth checking that one out.
563258	566580	Now, another little thing here about the DS.
566880	570862	There's been a lot of rumors going around about a brand new revision to the DS.
570902	577186	And of course, we're all familiar with the DS Lite, the brand new slimmed down DS with a brighter screen.
578666	586214	There's still possible a third revision to the DS, and actually there was a patent discovered this week that kind of backs that up.
586754	595563	The patent is for a brand new portable gaming system from Nintendo, and it actually shows dual touch screens.
596524	598666	Now, not necessarily saying
599315	606278	Two screens that are touchscreens, but actually being able to point two positions simultaneously on the touchscreen.
606398	607618	Now, why is this important?
607638	622763	If you think about it, for example, one of the demonstration photos that they had on there was like of a flight sim, and you'd put your fingers on the tips of the wing and basically be able to maneuver your plane through whatever obstacles that you might encounter.
623224	627045	Very similar to a Nintendo Revolution controller.
628186	629086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
654960	655800	DS Lite Game Boy Advance
674127	675128	PSP2, 8GB NAND Flash Hard Drive
696664	698685	Anyways, that should be interesting.
698905	713955	Another rumor going around about the PSP2 is that it will be containing a video camera, a new webcam, and now this will be used actually as a mobile camera, or possibly to put yourself in the game, kind of like an
714725	715847	Sony Ericsson Mobile Phone Camera
730632	735715	will be placed on the PSP's screen right about now where the PSP logo is currently found.
736075	737216	Now, I don't know if that's a good idea.
737296	744180	Personally, I would like to see it at the top of the system where you could rotate it around to possibly use this as, say, a digital camera.
744460	746541	Because personally, I could use a good digital camera.
747622	758088	Now, to kind of back up the PSP camera rumor, there's actually been some ads spotted on London trains recently that kind of point towards possibly a camera coming out.
758601	768489	Now the advertisement shows basically a blank screen with the words, View, no way, delete, view, oh my god, delete, view.
768629	769870	I don't remember taking that.
770071	773714	Delete, view, at last, a decent one store here.
774434	781200	Now that sort of sounds like they're viewing digital photos, so kind of pointing towards maybe that the camera is coming out.
781820	783782	Should be interesting, good addition to the PSP.
785234	786617	X-Box Live Camera and Microphone
795826	803811	The camera is going to be able to shoot 640x480 video at 30 frames per second and take 1.3 megapixel still photos.
804211	815218	The camera will support built-in video chat and video messaging on Xbox Live, plus being able to use it as sort of an iToy type of peripheral, being able to put yourself in the games and that type of thing.
815838	818620	Still got one more peripheral for the Xbox 360 owners.
820273	824477	This one's going to be an Xbox 360 transfer kit from Daytail.
825558	835807	The transfer kit's basically going to be just like the Exchange 360 site, where you can transfer your game saves from your Xbox 360 to your PSP.
836548	839750	It's pretty interesting that they're going to come out with something like this.
839870	844074	The only problem, though, is you can only dump the whole card at one time.
844655	846116	It's expected to retail about $14.99.
848121	849442	On to a completely different topic.
849542	852884	Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, is coming to American cell phones.
852904	863872	That's right, the popular DS title, which was a remake of the Japanese Game Boy Advance title, Gaikuten Saiben, and the only one of the three-part series to get the official U.S.
864092	865913	English translation.
865993	869996	Gaikuten Saiben 2 and 3 are now being localized for the U.S.
870076	871497	as downloadable content.
872798	877781	In other news, some of your favorite old-time games from Sierra are coming back.
878220	884363	That's right, Sierra's classic adventure games are being re-released to run on the Windows XP.
884403	889866	Everything from Space Quest to Police Quest to, of course, Leisure Suit Larry.
890746	892667	Should be very interesting to see those come out.
893027	897910	They're going to be retailing at about $20 each, so look for those coming soon.
898730	900631	Speaking of titles being re-released,
901209	908474	The Sonic 360 director has been hinting that Dreamcast titles could possibly make their way onto Xbox Live's arcade.
910255	917259	Masato Nakamura was asked if Sega had any plans to release Sonic on the Xbox Live Arcade.
917319	920821	He did reply, Yes, we hope we can do something like it.
921342	925504	Was this a hint towards Dreamcast games being released on Xbox Live Arcade?
925785	929627	Or possibly some re-release of an old Sonic the Hedgehog game?
930180	932361	on the 15th anniversary of the series.
933202	933782	We'll have to see.
934763	943288	Alright, for all you folks who are fans of the show, you'll know that my favorite topic of discussion is the PSP homebrew scene, and we've got some good stories for you this week.
943688	946870	The first is going to be the brand new Super Nintendo emulator.
947330	955875	SNES 9 version 0.4 has been updated, and this time the brand new feature is going to be wireless gameplay.
955895	959357	That's right, you can do multiplayer via Wi-Fi ad hoc.
960314	961455	So it should be pretty cool.
961635	965377	One of the games that they've been able to run so far on it has been Street Fighter 2.
966338	970760	And it's been able to run at 60 frames per second while playing versus over Wi-Fi.
970880	972241	So that's amazing.
972922	974603	Can't wait to try that one out, actually.
974623	978825	Another homebrew game that we've got coming out here is going to be Commander Keen.
978845	981267	That's right, everyone's favorite shareware game is back.
982107	985329	They've actually added emulation for all games.
985748	986449	DarkSakura.com
1015895	1017716	The emulator for your PSP.
1017816	1023700	You can actually run some of the Zork games, including Zork 1, 2, and 3.
1024561	1029704	You can find out more information on that on PSP Updates, of course, and check it out.
1029724	1038790	I believe you need Zork 1 for DOS, and then they basically walk you through on how to be able to run that as a Game Boy ROM, so check it out.
1039050	1042172	Alright, let's switch focus here and talk about...
1043084	1044305	Game System, Infinium Labs, Phantom
1072878	1073418	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1095839	1101284	News station WGN has apparently stumbled onto video game addiction.
1101564	1118938	They've actually run a piece, Philadelphia's Channel 6, showing how video games could be like the next version of crack, the way they basically have portrayed video games, showing how kids ignore their families and ignore their dog.
1119399	1120199	You know, who cares?
1120299	1123182	Dogs don't need attention anyways, especially when it comes down to video games.
1123769	1129390	But the whole story is just a blatant ratings ploy, basically.
1130291	1132531	And huge backlash over that.
1132831	1138912	Alright, so you've spent a lot of money, you've got your brand new TV to go with that new snazzy next-gen system.
1139533	1147334	Well, if you're thinking about buying a Blu-ray or HD DVD video player, think again.
1149095	1149715	Basically...
1150596	1154178	3 million HDTV owners out there are going to be screwed.
1154258	1155479	Why are you guys going to be screwed?
1155499	1165384	Well, that's because the brand new next-gen systems, or at least the video systems, are only going to have HDMI or DVI connections.
1166065	1170087	So your standard HDTV is not going to have that.
1170547	1174169	Sorry, guess you should have bought a more expensive TV.
1175010	1179192	So screw you, Sony, and screw you, Toshiba.
1179704	1185269	And since we're on the topic of screwing people, let's talk about screwing Electronic Arts.
1185709	1195217	That's right, if you haven't pre-ordered Black, then you probably didn't know that there was actually a hidden code to get a brand new gun in the game.
1195357	1197659	The big fucking gun, as you would put it.
1198584	1199064	5SQQ-STHA-ZFFV-7XEV
1220765	1223889	Have fun, enjoy the big fucking gun, and blow up a lot of people.
1224450	1225812	Alright, well that about does it.
1226332	1228375	So I will see you guys later.
1228796	1232941	Enjoy this podcast, and we'll be back live again on March 5th.
1233342	1233983	Talk to you later.
