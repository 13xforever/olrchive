00:00:00,362 --> 00:00:04,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to the podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:11,638
[SPEAKER_08]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to listings with past episodes.

3
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:13,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And now the conclusion of episode number 173 for February 5th, 2006.

4
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:25,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're back here for the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 173.

5
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,353
[SPEAKER_09]: For this, February the 5th of 2006.

6
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you guys are doing well.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,357
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a pretty fun first half, very long first half.

8
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:38,542
[SPEAKER_09]: As you may or may not have heard, hopefully you guys have all went back and downloaded part A of the show, for those of you guys listening on the podcast.

9
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:41,224
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was having a little bit of printing drama.

10
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,506
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't able to print my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow.

11
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:47,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki finally got the damn thing to work, and we printed my boarding pass during the break.

12
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy.

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if I do have a crappy B-Pass, damn you, Southwest and your stupid system.

14
00:00:52,792 --> 00:00:54,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if I have a crappy B-Pass, at least it works.

15
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:55,493
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Loki.

16
00:00:56,634 --> 00:00:56,914
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

17
00:00:57,854 --> 00:00:58,175
[SPEAKER_09]: No mic?

18
00:00:58,195 --> 00:00:59,195
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

19
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:05,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Christopher, like, you tangled me up in the chair.

20
00:01:05,518 --> 00:01:07,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

21
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:12,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, if you didn't hear Part A, also, I'm in a very angsty Xbox 360 mood tonight.

22
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:14,542
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not going there again.

23
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,143
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll just have to download Part A to figure out why.

24
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,524
[SPEAKER_09]: But if I sound bitter, I have a good reason.

25
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:20,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get back into it though.

26
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about something else that makes a lot of people bitter.

27
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:25,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's lack of Advent Children.

28
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:27,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know we were supposed to have this movie out like months ago.

29
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:29,757
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, what did you do with it?

30
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:32,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it months ago.

31
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but what did you do with the rest of our copies?

32
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's our English version of it?

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,740
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do with it?

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,541
[SPEAKER_01]: I ate it.

35
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:41,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Barf it up so we can have it.

36
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: No, really.

37
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is Advent Children for the USA?

38
00:01:45,323 --> 00:01:47,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I...

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:59,123
[SPEAKER_01]: We're supposed to be getting it sometime this year according to the digital bits, which is basically what's been said about it.

40
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:00,504
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a quote.

41
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:07,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taking a little extra time to work with the director to get all of the supplemental elements finished, which is why it's delayed.

42
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:16,649
[SPEAKER_01]: For as long as it's taking us to get it, I feel really awful for our friends in the UK who are probably not even getting it until after we do.

43
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:18,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, it's February.

44
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:18,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my Advent Children?

45
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:18,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

46
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:46,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't get it.

47
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

48
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:50,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this thing going to still sell when it comes out?

49
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,263
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have to have a lot of extras.

50
00:02:52,283 --> 00:02:53,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, people are going to buy it.

51
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:54,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they will.

52
00:02:55,224 --> 00:03:00,866
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I'm very much in a wait and see mode over this.

53
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:02,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it.

54
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:03,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I can watch it whenever I want.

55
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:09,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to be too pushy on it.

56
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,209
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to see the stuff on the desks.

57
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:14,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to watch it on my computer the first time.

58
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:19,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to watch it on a TV, a big TV, as big as possible, for the first time.

59
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,312
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want it pixelated or none of that.

60
00:03:21,352 --> 00:03:22,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I want it beautiful.

61
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:24,094
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

62
00:03:24,494 --> 00:03:25,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's actually a full DVD rip.

63
00:03:26,776 --> 00:03:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn you people.

64
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:29,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks pretty on my screen.

65
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,540
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to be legit with this here, okay?

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,921
[SPEAKER_01]: I legitimately downloaded it.

67
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:40,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to support Square and Sony here, but I'm finding it harder and harder to as this thing keeps getting delayed.

68
00:03:40,566 --> 00:03:42,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever the problem is, fix it.

69
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:45,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else?

70
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:48,297
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's to my credit, I have removed it from my hard drive.

71
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:49,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what?

72
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:53,278
[SPEAKER_09]: You had a release date on this at one point, and now it's shot again.

73
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they keep pulling it.

74
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez.

75
00:03:56,059 --> 00:04:01,681
[SPEAKER_07]: There was even a rumor going around saying that they're redoing all the animations to match the English dubbing.

76
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:06,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I guess that would be a good reason why it's taken so long.

77
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that might be a decent reason.

78
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:11,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, I don't think that's what the reason is.

79
00:04:11,705 --> 00:04:12,025
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um,

80
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:18,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the UK was actually, there was an article I think out this week about the UK and they're getting theirs in 2006 as well.

81
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:26,655
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I'd imagine they don't have to do any sort of localization for a UK release.

82
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:36,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's move on and talk about something that's going on in Japanese arcades right now, but not US ones.

83
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:36,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, what's going on?

84
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,609
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on is Soul Calibur 3.

85
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,771
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation 2 exclusive game is finally hitting the arcades where it needs to be.

86
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:55,935
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to actually have all the same characters from the home version along with some redesigned versions of three bonus characters from that version.

87
00:04:56,035 --> 00:04:59,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Amy, Li-Long, and Wong-Syung-Kyung.

88
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that's how you pronounce that.

89
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:02,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways...

90
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,872
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it should be pretty cool.

91
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Will I be able to take my custom dancer character and use it in the arcades?

92
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:12,759
[SPEAKER_07]: That I'm not sure.

93
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:21,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It says when the player finishes the game of Soul Calibur 3 Arcade Edition, the screen will display a barcode symbol and password.

94
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:28,114
[SPEAKER_07]: This will be used to join an online mobile phone-based Soul Calibur 3 game called Mobile Conquest Mode.

95
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:44,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, by taking a snapshot of the barcode symbol with the person's mobile phone and using the password, players can register their characters and challenge other players throughout the country via Soul Calibur 3's mobile phone website.

96
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:46,344
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of unique.

97
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:47,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That is unique.

98
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:53,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I realize mobile phone is way bigger in other countries than it is here, but that's kind of neat.

99
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:55,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish it would take off here, but whatever.

100
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:03,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Game is slated for release in the fall in Japan and should be coming out here I'm sure at some point.

101
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,170
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see Soul Calibur 3 in the arcades.

102
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I know everybody said, oh, PlayStation 2 exclusive, but you know what?

103
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:11,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Exclusive Windows up.

104
00:06:11,132 --> 00:06:11,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get that.

105
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:14,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Soul Calibur 2 is a great, great arcade game.

106
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:18,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to see 3 hit the arcades, although I kind of think it should have been the arcades first.

107
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:18,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But whatever.

108
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:26,439
[SPEAKER_09]: If they can come up with these kind of cool features like it sounds like they're doing, if they can carry some of that coolness over to the US, I won't have such an issue with this.

109
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

110
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:28,831
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

111
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:32,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you know, we were talking also in the first half because we had an email about it.

112
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,836
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we started as a DDR-centric station.

113
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So, of course, music and rhythm games, we love them.

114
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And, Loki, you have an article to hit the Internet this week about rhythm games, right?

115
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

116
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,303
[SPEAKER_07]: GameSpot ran the 10 spot, the top 10 rhythm games.

117
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, another list.

118
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:48,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

119
00:06:49,164 --> 00:06:50,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody loves lists.

120
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:53,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Lists are what they do when news gets slow.

121
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways.

122
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:55,869
[SPEAKER_07]: It's human interest.

123
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:56,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

124
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,710
[SPEAKER_07]: First,

125
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:58,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Samba de Amigo

126
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:07,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is pretty good.

127
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Number 9, right?

128
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:08,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

129
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this in order or is this just 10?

130
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is just 10 in no particular order.

131
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,875
[SPEAKER_07]: This one actually was on the DS.

132
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:16,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Osu!

133
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:24,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Tatake Uiden, which was for Nintendo DS, was kind of a game we never saw.

134
00:07:24,198 --> 00:07:25,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard of this game, though.

135
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,159
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are importing it.

136
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,520
[SPEAKER_07]: It's different.

137
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

138
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar-O-Man.

139
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:31,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Woohoo!

140
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Guitar-O-Man!

141
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:32,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

142
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:33,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Vib-Ribbon.

143
00:07:35,012 --> 00:07:41,653
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that they're not excluding import titles and things that weren't released here because there were a lot of good stuff that weren't released here.

144
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:59,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the original guitar favorite, Guitar Freaks, Busta Groove, or Busta Move, however you want to call it, Frequency, then Guitar Hero, and you know, let's see here, of course, Dance Dance Revolution.

145
00:07:59,877 --> 00:08:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: And they named third mix specifically, right?

146
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say Third Mix was definitely a peak.

147
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:05,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It had so many great licenses.

148
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember way back in your old apartment of doom.

149
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:10,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

150
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time I ever got a little bod thing.

151
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:18,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching you play DDR, not DDR, playing the Jungle Book game on the Jungle Book pad.

152
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Baby's first dancing game.

153
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,174
[SPEAKER_09]: That was me.

154
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I had my little mini for midgets.

155
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,135
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a DDR pad for midgets for the Jungle Book dancing game.

156
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:25,636
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

157
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:26,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie Fix.

158
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:27,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

159
00:08:27,897 --> 00:08:28,597
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that it?

160
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:29,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Was that ten?

161
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:30,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it.

162
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:30,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's Beatmania?

163
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Get Guitar Freaks off that list.

164
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Put Beatmania in there instead.

165
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:34,752
[SPEAKER_09]: No crap.

166
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:39,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can all say the Guitar Hero kind of improved on Guitar Freaks, so there's no need for both of them on the list there.

167
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get rid of Guitar Freaks and put Beatmania in there instead.

168
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:42,457
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up with that?

169
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:43,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

170
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else missing?

171
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:45,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

172
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think otherwise it's a pretty solid list.

173
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:48,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Channel 5?

174
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:49,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, good call.

175
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,364
[SPEAKER_09]: That should have been somewhere on there.

176
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:51,904
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about that.

177
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:52,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, good call.

178
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:54,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Space Channel 5 is a great game.

179
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:58,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have said Amplitude over Frequency.

180
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at least glad there's a little bit of Harmonix love in there.

181
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Karaoke Revolution's not on the list.

182
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,380
[SPEAKER_09]: In which two, it's Loki says, good!

183
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like their game.

184
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:09,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

185
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,764
[SPEAKER_09]: comments from the chat room here.

186
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:14,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we've got folks saying no Beatmania.

187
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:18,471
[SPEAKER_09]: PKakira88 says no Pump It Up, no In The Groove.

188
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:21,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Rini says, where's poppin' music?

189
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:22,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

190
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots of interesting choices.

191
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:30,224
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the thing about lists, you guys, is so that they can leave something off just to ruffle your feathers about it.

192
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:31,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it work?

193
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:31,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it work?

194
00:09:32,714 --> 00:09:38,557
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

195
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I love reading Kojima's blog.

196
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,465
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that he's a pretty interesting person.

197
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:09,446
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of cute.

198
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:13,808
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like the pictures up there with his little foxhound thing on the side.

199
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:26,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of interesting insight into what he's got going on, as well as opinions of certain other people, which I'll leave for somebody else to bring up.

200
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:27,675
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really cool.

201
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:30,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also apparently just...

202
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:36,070
[SPEAKER_01]: has all kinds of things sneaking out in his blog, along with changes.

203
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you notice a couple?

204
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:39,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly haven't really read it.

205
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,374
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will visit it now that it's hit your list.

206
00:10:45,276 --> 00:10:50,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also, though, you can find the link to Kojima's podcast.

207
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:53,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right, and I have a quick little follow-up on the podcast.

208
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:57,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I do know something about that because I saw something on another site about it.

209
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:02,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, that podcast is going to be delivered in English soon.

210
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:06,388
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Hideo Kojima is not going to suddenly start speaking English for you guys.

211
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:12,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, what's going to happen is that it's going to be handled by the international manager, Ryan Payton.

212
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Payton's going to summarize Kojima's podcast and bring on guests and give behind-the-scenes information on the latest happenings of the company.

213
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:25,855
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not really like a word-for-word blog, but it's, you know, it's like the English spinoff, I guess you could say.

214
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,555
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's pretty cool.

215
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:29,915
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you want to give the address there for folks who want to look up that blog?

216
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:34,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, and I'm going to give the link to the English blog.

217
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:46,484
[SPEAKER_01]: It's www.blog.konami.jp slash gs slash hideoblog underscore e. All right.

218
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:47,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Visit it.

219
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it, because DarkSakura said so.

220
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:50,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

221
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,549
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one thing that will not come up on the Hideo Kojima blog ever again...

222
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,202
[SPEAKER_07]: What's this, Loki?

223
00:11:56,582 --> 00:12:07,893
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be an Uwe Boll adaptation of Metal Gear Solid, and to which I will paraphrase, because he says, absolutely not, over my dead body, fuck you, Uwe Boll.

224
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,236
[SPEAKER_07]: He did not say fuck you, Uwe Boll, you're not paraphrased.

225
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:18,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, basically, there's no way, they didn't contact him on it, they would never let him touch that property, so...

226
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:20,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

227
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: because Alone in the Dark sucked ass, as did other movies like Blood Rain, which only pulled in $2.4 million over 30 days.

228
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:49,600
[SPEAKER_07]: If I made $2.4 million in 30 days, that would be a great thing, because then I could fund my evil empire.

229
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,281
[SPEAKER_09]: But for a movie in Hollywood to make $2.4 million over 30 days and not be like an arthouse movie type thing...

230
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:18,004
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not saying much considering that the production budget of the movie is $25 million and the marketing costs apparently reached about $22 million putting it a good They marketed that movie?

231
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I maybe saw one billboard.

232
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:20,166
[SPEAKER_07]: That was it.

233
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:20,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Like ever.

234
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:22,688
[SPEAKER_07]: That puts it in the hole quite a bit.

235
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:33,069
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, if you still want to see more Weevil wonderful movies and stuff, there's In the Name of the King, two-part Weevil.

236
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop plugging that.

237
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody wants to see it.

238
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't plug it.

239
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:37,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Epic movie.

240
00:13:37,731 --> 00:13:38,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Three hours of crap.

241
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:39,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't plug it.

242
00:13:40,393 --> 00:13:41,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out in November.

243
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,360
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura

244
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:28,377
[SPEAKER_01]: My FU of the week goes toward my own body for betraying me in a most heinous fashion.

245
00:14:29,057 --> 00:14:38,965
[SPEAKER_01]: I went over to one of my co-workers house to help her and her son with their mp3 player and I forgot about her dogs.

246
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Now normally if I'm around a dog I'll get sniffy.

247
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:44,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I might itch a little bit.

248
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally I take like a Benadryl before I go over there and I'm fine.

249
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:50,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

250
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:51,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

251
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there for all of ten minutes and I start to feel the sniffy.

252
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start to feel my eyes itch a little bit.

253
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, it's allergies.

254
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm leaving in a few minutes.

255
00:15:02,981 --> 00:15:11,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, within not even five minutes of that, suddenly my eyes were swollen shut.

256
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,225
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bloodshot.

257
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:16,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I burst two blood vessels in my left eye.

258
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:21,849
[SPEAKER_01]: and my eyes had swollen so much they were pulling the skin tight around my eyes.

259
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:22,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Ew!

260
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really disgusting and then they were all gumming up and it was all bloody.

261
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:30,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And many podcast listeners just threw up in their mouths there with that.

262
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:30,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

263
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:30,995
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

264
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:32,776
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very disgusting.

265
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:38,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going into detail so that people will understand my level of rather well-contained rage right now.

266
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,603
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you know, I wasn't really, you know, my friend kept apologizing.

267
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:45,404
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not her fault.

268
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:45,924
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she...

269
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:46,777
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

270
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:13,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my glasses off at that point, and I turned and looked at her, and she was like, OH MY GOD!

271
00:16:13,966 --> 00:16:15,267
[SPEAKER_01]: And started to get out of the car.

272
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:19,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Tia!

273
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:20,088
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

274
00:16:20,228 --> 00:16:21,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have zombie eyes.

275
00:16:23,469 --> 00:16:26,070
[SPEAKER_01]: My eyes, I actually took a picture of it.

276
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,651
[SPEAKER_01]: How it was after, get this.

277
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you post it on the website?

278
00:16:29,671 --> 00:16:29,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.

279
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Three doses of Benadryl.

280
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:39,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And all kinds of eye drops, including, I got those neat Japanese minty eye drops, though, that make your eyes feel all cold.

281
00:16:40,100 --> 00:17:03,136
[SPEAKER_01]: and I slept with a cold compress on my face for two days I went to the doctor yesterday because it actually the bone around my left eye started to hurt and so he gave me some lovely drugs and now most of the swelling is down but it's still there I looked yesterday like I got punched in the eye Dan proceeded to say well that's what you get for not ducking my husband

282
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, fuck you to my jeans.

283
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,992
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame mommy and daddy and all the drugs they did in the 70s.

284
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:13,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Loki, your turn.

285
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:18,854
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU this week goes to the restaurant chain known as Hooters.

286
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:23,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you for your really crappy service and your really crappy food.

287
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:28,176
[SPEAKER_07]: I went there actually on Saturday to get some food and, you know, because...

288
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:30,787
[SPEAKER_07]: People wanted to go to Hooters to check it out.

289
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:31,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Nellie had never been.

290
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got there, and I give them my name.

291
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,048
[SPEAKER_07]: They write my name down as Ben.

292
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, it's Matt.

293
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:38,709
[SPEAKER_07]: They write down Max.

294
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,749
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, that's close enough.

295
00:17:41,349 --> 00:17:43,390
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting.

296
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, we get seated and stuff.

297
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,090
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes them a half an hour to take our order.

298
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Then afterwards, we're waiting, waiting, waiting.

299
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:53,651
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes an hour for us to get our food.

300
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:57,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And they hadn't even delivered the wings we had ordered, which were going to be an appetizer.

301
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,503
[SPEAKER_07]: On top of all that, just the people there were retarded.

302
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:05,986
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just completely retarded.

303
00:18:06,106 --> 00:18:14,773
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to talk to these people, and their coke was really watered down, and their burgers weren't that great, and the wings, you know what, even if they are world famous, they sucked ass.

304
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:17,475
[SPEAKER_07]: So, fuck Hooters, I will never be going back there.

305
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:22,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Arsef in the chatroom says, who goes to Hooters for the food?

306
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's definitely not for the intelligence.

307
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,061
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

308
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Hooters!

309
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to add on Loki's hatred for Hooters.

310
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:29,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's not that great.

311
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Their food isn't that good.

312
00:18:55,353 --> 00:18:59,274
[SPEAKER_05]: and the girls are like, thank you for coming to here.

313
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:02,455
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, they have more brains in their boobs than they do in their head.

314
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,156
[SPEAKER_05]: You can address those cards and letters to extifer at orangelaunchradio.com.

315
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

316
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:14,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Email me your amazing, you know, stories on how I meant something in your life.

317
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:15,618
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

318
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,139
[SPEAKER_05]: In this debut here on Orange Launch Radio.

319
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

320
00:19:23,188 --> 00:19:33,176
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, speaking of something meaningful, Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very meaningful game to some of us, and we've been waiting to hear some news on the US version, but do you got something for us?

321
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, actually I've got a confirmed list of some of the voice actors in the game.

322
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:41,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

323
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:45,810
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have Haley Jo Osment, of course, as Sora.

324
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:49,674
[SPEAKER_01]: For Aerith, it's Mena Suvari from American Beauty.

325
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:54,538
[SPEAKER_01]: One I don't want to say because it's very, very spoilery.

326
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:56,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I spoil?

327
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:56,620
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

328
00:19:58,184 --> 00:19:59,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, plug your ears real quick.

329
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,510
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in it for like a very short time.

330
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:02,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

331
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So close your eyes.

332
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:05,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Close your ears.

333
00:20:06,616 --> 00:20:07,497
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three.

334
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:08,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Tifa.

335
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:09,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

336
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Rachel Lee Cook from Antitrust.

337
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:13,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, open your ears again.

338
00:20:13,585 --> 00:20:14,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they heard that.

339
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:37,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Riku, David Gallagher, Kyrie, Hayden Panettiere, Ruxus, Jesse McCartney, Namin, Brittany Snow, Hades, James Woods, Chicken Little, Zach Boff, Cloud, Steve Burton,

340
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:46,548
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do not see anything about bringing back my man as my man.

341
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:47,969
[SPEAKER_05]: David Boreanaz as Squall?

342
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:48,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

343
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Leon, remember.

344
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry, Leon.

345
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Not bad.

346
00:20:51,331 --> 00:20:52,911
[SPEAKER_05]: On IMDB they had him listed.

347
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, by IMDB.

348
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: IMDB lies.

349
00:20:54,772 --> 00:20:58,934
[SPEAKER_01]: IMDB, all they did was copy the same people who played whoever in whatever.

350
00:20:59,094 --> 00:20:59,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

351
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:04,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, IMDB is a... I will not say lying piece of crap.

352
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,398
[SPEAKER_01]: I will just say inaccurate source.

353
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:07,138
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.

354
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:09,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I do agree.

355
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:11,006
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the stuff that's already out, they're pretty reliable.

356
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:18,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And no Pirates of the Caribbean voice actors, unfortunately.

357
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:19,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, nothing listed there.

358
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And no Lance Bass.

359
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:25,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no reason scheduling conflicts to their new movie.

360
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:36,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, in an article that I read, they were taking great care to capture some very Keith Richards-like motion for how he would walk.

361
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:52,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, all this talk on Kingdom Hearts, I think we need to bring back a segment, because we've been doing this new format for a little while, and part of the reason we went to the new format is so we could bring segments from our live show we used to do, and one of those segments is...

362
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:55,951
[SPEAKER_03]: List lists!

363
00:21:56,351 --> 00:21:57,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Woohoo!

364
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:03,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now I know our podcast listeners are hearing list lists for the first time, so we're going to kind of set this up for you guys.

365
00:22:03,674 --> 00:22:07,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Those of you guys listening live tonight on Sunday night, you guys get to directly participate in this.

366
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:10,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Your votes will come up with the lists.

367
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,078
[SPEAKER_09]: As we've been talking about in the show, people love to make lists.

368
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,978
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're no different here at Orange Lounge Radio.

369
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:21,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Once in a while, we like to take a topic, and we like to come up with the definitive list.

370
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:23,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

371
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:54,455
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bet you're all dying to know tonight's topic and see how this works here.

372
00:22:55,617 --> 00:23:02,869
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic for tonight is World I Most Want to See in Kingdom Hearts 3.

373
00:23:04,278 --> 00:23:05,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Now here's the catch.

374
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:08,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't have to be related to Disney or Square.

375
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,721
[SPEAKER_09]: We're living in a fantasy world right now, okay?

376
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:14,563
[SPEAKER_09]: We realize that it's got to be Disney or Square to realistically be in a Kingdom Hearts game, but that's okay.

377
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:22,828
[SPEAKER_09]: We live in a fantasy world here at Orange Lounge Radio, so we're opening it up to any fandom, any cartoon, whatever you want, any type of Kingdom Hearts world you think ought to be in the game.

378
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's your chance to name it.

379
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to come up with the Orange Launch Radio definitive list.

380
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,690
[SPEAKER_09]: One other small little teensy weensy change.

381
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,411
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing a list list from the way we used to do it.

382
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:39,093
[SPEAKER_09]: When the chat room votes, you will be able to pick not just one, but now you can pick a number one and a number two.

383
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:41,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can actually pick two things from the top list.

384
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,435
[SPEAKER_09]: But you do have to tell me what's your number one and what's your number two.

385
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:47,316
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't specify, I'll assume the first thing you listed was your number one.

386
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:47,816
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

387
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:49,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Enough chatter.

388
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get to the list, shall we?

389
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start making our list here.

390
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

391
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,004
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your number three pick for a world you would most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 3?

392
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:02,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Doom.

393
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:04,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Doom?

394
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Now would this be with The Rock or not?

395
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:08,528
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be hell.

396
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we have Doom on the list.

397
00:24:13,091 --> 00:24:14,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other reasons why you want to see Doom?

398
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to put the characters in hell?

399
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:15,873
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

400
00:24:16,644 --> 00:24:18,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like to see really fucked up things.

401
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:20,187
[SPEAKER_09]: No kidding, lady.

402
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.

403
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:23,529
[SPEAKER_07]: You're number three.

404
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:29,574
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually picking more Disney-themed stuff, so Darkwing Duck.

405
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,555
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

406
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:32,637
[SPEAKER_07]: The Darkwing Duck level.

407
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:33,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I like that.

408
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:35,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the terror that flaps in the night?

409
00:24:38,246 --> 00:24:44,130
[SPEAKER_09]: My number three pick is, I didn't have a better name for this, so I'm calling it Secret of Mana World.

410
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,272
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's another great square game that ought to be given some love.

411
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:48,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So Secret of Mana World.

412
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:52,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Dare I ask, Extrofer, what's your number three pick?

413
00:24:53,397 --> 00:24:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be pretty predictable.

414
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:56,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to choose Silent Hill World.

415
00:24:58,308 --> 00:24:58,668
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

416
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:30,616
[SPEAKER_01]: My number two, Labyrinth.

417
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:35,100
[SPEAKER_01]: With David Bowie.

418
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:36,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And his member.

419
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:38,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, and his member.

420
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:41,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there were two stars, there were three stars in that movie.

421
00:25:41,187 --> 00:25:44,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Jennifer Connelly, David Bowie, and David Bowie Schlong.

422
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:49,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And each of the characters will be dressed up in tight pants with giant packages.

423
00:25:50,036 --> 00:25:50,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

424
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:58,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And your special helper will be the little dog on the other dog.

425
00:25:59,284 --> 00:26:00,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Bluto.

426
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,766
[SPEAKER_09]: So bad!

427
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:05,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's keep it moving.

428
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:09,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your number two pick for worlds you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3.

429
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:13,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Since all the answers have been quite ridiculous, how about we do Hello Kitty world.

430
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Sanrio world, there we go.

431
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:21,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello Kitty, Chrono Trigger World, and then traveling in time.

432
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:21,868
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be complex.

433
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:50,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Xtifer, your number two pick.

434
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:55,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that I'm going to go with Serenity World.

435
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:01,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Because... And this is collective Joss Whedon fanboy coming out.

436
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:05,820
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have Mal as your... Cat in tight pants as your partner.

437
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

438
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,681
[SPEAKER_05]: He's going to age you and maybe have a hot sex scene too.

439
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Against the men with blue hands.

440
00:27:14,642 --> 00:27:14,982
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

441
00:27:16,044 --> 00:27:17,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Time for the number ones.

442
00:27:17,165 --> 00:27:17,746
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready for it?

443
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one worlds.

444
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,868
[SPEAKER_09]: We're making the definitive list.

445
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:22,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we've done this, this is done.

446
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,111
[SPEAKER_09]: This is all sealed and done.

447
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:26,173
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sending it to Square and saying this is what we want.

448
00:27:27,274 --> 00:27:28,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to what anybody else says.

449
00:27:28,776 --> 00:27:30,197
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the top three right here.

450
00:27:30,537 --> 00:27:33,460
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your number one fantasy world for Kingdom Hearts 3.

451
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time world.

452
00:27:37,764 --> 00:27:41,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Not any of that crap water world crap from Dreamwaker.

453
00:27:43,516 --> 00:27:44,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So Legend of Zelda World.

454
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:47,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, something that would never happen, the Nintendo thing on the Sony.

455
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:52,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anyone looks at my DeviantArt profile, I have done fan art for this.

456
00:27:53,643 --> 00:27:54,343
[SPEAKER_09]: That's hardcore.

457
00:27:54,763 --> 00:27:55,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

458
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Hardcore nerd.

459
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:56,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

460
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your number one pick.

461
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: This was tough.

462
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:08,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to go more realistic and do like, you know, Treasure Planet or Rocketeer, speaking of fighting Nazis.

463
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:12,819
[SPEAKER_07]: But since we're going ridiculous, DOA Beach Volleyball World.

464
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost put that one on there.

465
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:19,085
[SPEAKER_09]: DOA Beach Volleyball World.

466
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:21,346
[SPEAKER_09]: So what exactly would you be fighting?

467
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You would be fighting clothing.

468
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:25,190
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

469
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:31,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I just see this doing nothing but playing volleyball there, because when you go to the undersea level in Kingdom Hearts 2, all you do is sing.

470
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:32,868
[SPEAKER_01]: You sing under the sea.

471
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

472
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:38,649
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one pick is Microsoft World.

473
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:42,410
[SPEAKER_09]: And in Microsoft World, things glitch out.

474
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,072
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to fight the evil glitches and things that disappear.

475
00:28:46,452 --> 00:28:50,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And the world just disappears suddenly on you and things go blank.

476
00:28:51,575 --> 00:28:52,695
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real crazy level.

477
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:55,756
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that one game on GameCube that totally messed with you?

478
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:57,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Eternal Darkness, was that it?

479
00:28:57,197 --> 00:28:58,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it Bitterness World?

480
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,579
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Microsoft World actually is what this is.

481
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be glad the Tron world is not powered by Microsoft.

482
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:05,206
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my number one pick.

483
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:06,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Extifer, your number one pick.

484
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:09,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you I know what this is.

485
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have a feeling.

486
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:18,376
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need to go that one step further in my Joss Whedon fandom and create once more with Feeling World.

487
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were just going to say Buffy World.

488
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,983
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was the musical episode of Buffy.

489
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:31,027
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great, especially with the whole hot lesbian scene with Tara and Willow.

490
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:33,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do so much with that world.

491
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:40,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's see, now here's the part where the chatroom yells at us for the things we didn't put on the list, and guess what guys, it's gone.

492
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:41,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't have this anymore.

493
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:48,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, we have Minimi283 says Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy World, Legend of Zaku, YTMND World.

494
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:51,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

495
00:29:52,646 --> 00:30:00,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Roz says, Beer Pong World, Nintendo Maniac 64, Hentai World, Sephiroth 1215, Oregon Trail World.

496
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,155
[SPEAKER_01]: We all die of dysentery or a bear eats us.

497
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:04,976
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great one.

498
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:15,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Fireboma, Pleasure Island, Monkey Island, coming from MiniMe283, PKAcura88, Dragon Ball Z. Lots and lots of great picks from you guys.

499
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Rio World World.

500
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:18,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad, because here it is.

501
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:23,691
[SPEAKER_09]: So now's the fun part, because this is where we get mad at each other, because we're going to take off some from the list.

502
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is as it stands right now, the top 12.

503
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:44,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Doom World, Darkwing Duck, Secret of Mana World, Silent Hill World, Labyrinth World, Hello Kitty or Sanrio World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, Zelda Ocarina of Time, DOA Beach Volleyball, Microsoft World, and Buffy the Musical World.

504
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Once more with Feeling World, if you so choose.

505
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:50,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so DarkSakura, one of these has got to come off the list.

506
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:51,687
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going off the list?

507
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Move your hand out of my way.

508
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:54,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

509
00:30:54,627 --> 00:30:54,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

510
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:56,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Microsoft World, sorry.

511
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,288
[SPEAKER_09]: You evil little bitchling.

512
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:01,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did you take that one off?

513
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:04,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want to play a reality game.

514
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to play something for fun.

515
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm okay with that answer.

516
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Loki, what's coming off this list?

517
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:15,891
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm just going to have to take off

518
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:17,985
[SPEAKER_07]: D.O.A.

519
00:31:18,005 --> 00:31:19,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Beach Volleyball World

520
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,361
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one.

521
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:45,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Sora was going to become a man.

522
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:47,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You took that away from him.

523
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:48,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

524
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:48,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done.

525
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:49,268
[SPEAKER_09]: It's done.

526
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:50,029
[SPEAKER_09]: What's done is done.

527
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:52,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he'll never get any because he's never going to find Kairi.

528
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Extra Pearl, what's the last one coming off this list?

529
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to go with Hello Kitty World.

530
00:31:59,897 --> 00:32:01,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Hello Kitty World.

531
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:01,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a good one.

532
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,340
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

533
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:09,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's your turn to vote.

534
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:15,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your top two.

535
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:16,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Your number one and your number two.

536
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:18,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

537
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:30,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Doom, Darkwing Duck, Secret of Mana World, Silent Hill World, Labyrinth World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, and Zelda Ocarina of Time World.

538
00:32:30,873 --> 00:32:37,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Tell us what worlds would you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3, assuming that, you know, Disney and Square only is out of the picture, your fantasy world.

539
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:42,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Send those over private message and we'll reveal the answers a little later in the show, the definitive list.

540
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,362
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, more news.

541
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:49,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to go on over to Loki, who's going to tell us what's going on

542
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,680
[SPEAKER_09]: with the Sony PSP.

543
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talked about some of this in the first half, but you had a little more like PSP also.

544
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:55,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going on?

545
00:32:55,582 --> 00:33:01,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, basically they're just boasting that their online service is going to be better than Microsoft.

546
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:05,705
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, so they said that this time it's very real.

547
00:33:07,045 --> 00:33:16,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony is dead serious about their online service and it's being designed to match the service of Xbox Live and exceed it.

548
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:23,621
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be basically, as mentioned before, linking a lot of the PSP and PS3 stuff together.

549
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:26,647
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, promises, promises.

550
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:28,350
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I have to say about that.

551
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:35,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a little bit too much too late?

552
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:40,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Xbox Live has already established themselves as the definitive... Well, but you know what?

553
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:45,816
[SPEAKER_09]: If Sony puts out something better, there's no reason they can't take the crown.

554
00:33:45,896 --> 00:33:53,542
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not necessarily going to be their big thing, though, because you can have beta, which is better than VHS.

555
00:33:54,243 --> 00:34:00,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, their plan of, you know, fuck it, we don't need a plan, didn't really work out too well with the PS2, so...

556
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:06,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to try it again.

557
00:34:06,723 --> 00:34:09,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And, oddly enough, wasn't Beta by Sony?

558
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to think about there.

559
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move on.

560
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:24,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go over to DarkSakura, who likes to keep tabs on what's going on overseas because we love our listeners throughout the world, not just those here in America.

561
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:31,793
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we love the America ones, we love the Canada ones, and all the other countries, but the UK doesn't get enough love from a lot of gaming things out there because they get games late and stuff.

562
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:32,233
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks.

563
00:34:32,553 --> 00:34:34,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So, DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?

564
00:34:35,294 --> 00:34:40,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, the first thing we have up is that Daedalus is doing a new Xbox 360 hard drive.

565
00:34:45,612 --> 00:34:50,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be 2 inches square, weighing 4 ounces.

566
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:54,796
[SPEAKER_01]: The drive will be able to store thousands of songs and over 5,000 images.

567
00:34:55,296 --> 00:35:03,959
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is you can transfer MP3s from your PC to your Xbox 360 or whack all of your JPEGs and use your TV to watch them all.

568
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a 4 gigabyte USB drive that's shaped like the power button on the 360.

569
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:14,186
[SPEAKER_07]: and Close.

570
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:20,989
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually giving a speculated price of £99.

571
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,052
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkPlanets is already taking pre-orders for £74.99.

572
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,753
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in pounds.

573
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:34,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, though, they still have not yet confirmed the price point.

574
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:40,778
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still working with the distributors, but an official price will be out along with their release date next week.

575
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:41,418
[SPEAKER_05]: So about $150 USD

576
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:44,848
[SPEAKER_05]: About 150 US.

577
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:55,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there is a very interesting bit of news about Dead or Alive 4.

578
00:35:56,715 --> 00:36:03,699
[SPEAKER_01]: It has basically removed Need for Speed Most Wanted from the top position and has taken number one.

579
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,524
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's a pretty game, but I don't know how it got to be number one.

580
00:36:13,745 --> 00:36:14,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.

581
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:16,066
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.

582
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:22,627
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I saw about it, because I saw very little of it, because, you know, Rob's Xbox broke.

583
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:26,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I say that Rob's Xbox broke.

584
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

585
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:28,328
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

586
00:36:28,348 --> 00:36:29,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the reminder.

587
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:29,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

588
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:31,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, his Xbox broke.

589
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:36,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, basically, when I saw it, though, it did look really pretty, but I don't think I would ever play it.

590
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, whatever.

591
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:39,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was pretty.

592
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:45,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're saying that all across the board, the top three titles in the charts are all on Xbox 360.

593
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:53,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, four Xbox 360 exclusives have come into the top 20 for the first time since the December 2005 launch.

594
00:36:53,821 --> 00:36:59,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Call of Duty 2, we have Project Gotham Racing 3 at number 7.

595
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:04,128
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Perfect Dark Zero that hopped up from 27 to be at number 14.

596
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:12,339
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sega's Condemned is also back in the top 40.

597
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's coming in actually at number 18, they said.

598
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I thought Condemned was a really good game.

599
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:21,162
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be higher up there.

600
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:26,624
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, people are liking what they're playing for those with working systems.

601
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: One other bit of news, too, is that there are

602
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:50,967
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about there were doing some layoffs here in the US, so it probably has a lot of people over there on edge, but not going to happen, hmm?

603
00:37:51,912 --> 00:37:52,793
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's looking like.

604
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Their UK studio is in Chertsey.

605
00:37:57,257 --> 00:38:02,922
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's coming out without the job cuts that we're all seeing over here in the US.

606
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:09,429
[SPEAKER_01]: The studio is supposed to be cutting off, I think, 5% of their global workforce.

607
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,632
[SPEAKER_01]: There haven't really been any indications.

608
00:38:14,032 --> 00:38:19,816
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their spokespersons said that they cannot confirm that there's not any that might come up.

609
00:38:20,696 --> 00:38:23,558
[SPEAKER_01]: To go ahead and give the quote, every division is going through evaluation.

610
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:34,105
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking around the company to see how to best align teams everywhere against what needs to happen for future growth, which means we're giving you a noncommittal answer because we can.

611
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:47,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, about 350 people were cut in the U.S., laid off from the Vancouver, Redwood Shores, and Tiburon jobs.

612
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,201
[SPEAKER_01]: The joys of corporations.

613
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: It happens.

614
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:52,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad.

615
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wish the U.K.

616
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:56,807
[SPEAKER_01]: employees a good bit of luck.

617
00:38:57,948 --> 00:38:59,910
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, another bit, actually...

618
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:06,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like February 17th, Shadow of the Colossus will be out in the UK.

619
00:39:08,005 --> 00:39:10,507
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty neat game from what I understand.

620
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played it myself.

621
00:39:11,988 --> 00:39:17,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get too into it, but it's kind of one of those games, try it out, because it's kind of a polarizing game.

622
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,773
[SPEAKER_09]: People either really like it or they don't get it.

623
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:22,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, certainly for those of you guys who have been really wanting to check this game out, you're going to get a chance.

624
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So good for opportunity.

625
00:39:24,877 --> 00:39:25,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe in choices.

626
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:26,498
[SPEAKER_09]: So go for it.

627
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:27,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Breath of Fire 3 for the PSP

628
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:53,155
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Breath of Fire.

629
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:57,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Command & Conquer, the first decade, also, that's on PC.

630
00:39:58,057 --> 00:39:59,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Dora the Explorer on GBA.

631
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,799
[SPEAKER_01]: EA Sports Rugby 2006, full auto, Xbox 360.

632
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:06,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Is Dora the Explorer popular over there, too?

633
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,301
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an early childhood game.

634
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:13,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry if she's popular over there, although it's a great Halloween costume.

635
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw some Dora Halloweens, funny.

636
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:17,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they would only get Nickelodeon by Sky Satellite.

637
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:17,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well.

638
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:33,014
[SPEAKER_01]: Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Party 7, Space Invaders Evolution on the PSP, Star Wars Empire at War on PC, Tales of Eternia on PSP, The Rub Rabbits on DS.

639
00:40:33,814 --> 00:40:34,355
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?

640
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:35,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard it.

641
00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:35,875
[SPEAKER_07]: It must be something over there.

642
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:38,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear UK listeners, please tell me what The Rub Rabbits are.

643
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:42,539
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rub Rabbits would be the sequel to Philly the Magic.

644
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:45,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I thought that had... Change names.

645
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, I thought it was something really perverted.

646
00:40:49,063 --> 00:40:50,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do babies come from?

647
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:50,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, where do babies come from?

648
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:51,526
[SPEAKER_01]: You have bunnies!

649
00:40:52,346 --> 00:40:52,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw.

650
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:56,010
[SPEAKER_01]: And last up, Totally Spies for the Game Boy Advance.

651
00:40:56,911 --> 00:41:02,297
[SPEAKER_01]: I, however, am feeling very happy for our friends over there because on the 17th they get Guilty Gear Yusuka.

652
00:41:04,013 --> 00:41:05,294
[SPEAKER_01]: That game is cool.

653
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:06,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very cool.

654
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:10,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And Super Monkey Ball Touch and Go comes out on the 17th as well.

655
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,542
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will be going more into detail when the time comes.

656
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:18,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, do you have some release dates for the U.S.?

657
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course I do.

658
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:23,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming this week, we'll be getting Arena Football in the...

659
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:24,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's Ride Silver Buckle

660
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Stables, crappy game for the Game Boy Advance.

661
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:41,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Resident Evil Deadly Silence coming to the Nintendo DS, which should be good.

662
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Rub Rabbits also coming to the Nintendo DS.

663
00:41:44,322 --> 00:41:47,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max coming to the PSP.

664
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love those Street Fighter titles.

665
00:41:49,805 --> 00:41:56,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Tales of Legendia coming to the PS2, which kind of combines a fighting game and RPG in the one, which is really neat.

666
00:41:57,189 --> 00:42:01,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, our favorite company, Konami, World Soccer Winning 11.9 coming to PS2, Xbox, and

667
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:04,212
[SPEAKER_07]: PSP.

668
00:42:04,913 --> 00:42:16,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Later on the month, of course, we've got Drakengard 2, Grandia 3, Mark Echo's Getting Up, State of Emergency 2, which will be fun, also dropped down to $29.99, which is pretty cool.

669
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:18,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Fight Night Round 3, really big boxing game.

670
00:42:19,478 --> 00:42:23,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Touka Race Driver 3, which will be cool.

671
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Exit, Sonic Riders coming to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.

672
00:42:29,443 --> 00:42:32,067
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a bunch of other stuff as well.

673
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:34,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, we'll cover those once we get closer to it.

674
00:42:36,664 --> 00:42:37,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Lots and lots of stuff.

675
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:38,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We're starting to get back into it.

676
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:40,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, summertime will be really big too.

677
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:43,247
[SPEAKER_09]: March is going to be a big month as far as stuff coming out.

678
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:44,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay tuned.

679
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you also have a little bit of a follow-up to something DarkSakura talked about.

680
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:51,810
[SPEAKER_09]: She was talking about DOA4's success over in the UK.

681
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,851
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on with DOA4?

682
00:42:54,191 --> 00:42:54,991
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing an update.

683
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:58,253
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a patch which is coming out in mid-February.

684
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:04,135
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to be happening is they're going to be balancing some of the characters as well as

685
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:33,418
[SPEAKER_07]: fixing the bug with lots of save games and one of the rumors is going to be that they're changing the interface and adding a new character one of the new characters that they're talking about here well at least rumored is going to be a Taekwondo character basically one of the things that they found out between you know kind of browsing some of the data files on there seeing a big section of characters missing and just some other stuff so that would be something to look forward to

686
00:43:34,742 --> 00:43:37,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming mid-February.

687
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:48,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Something else that's going to be coming out soon, and this is according to Pacific Business News, is that an online version of the classic puzzle game Tetris is going to be coming out soon.

688
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:51,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm kind of thinking, wait, don't we already have Tetranet?

689
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:52,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, why would you want to pay?

690
00:43:52,589 --> 00:44:00,312
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing is that Tetris Online is going to allow people to do this game and other casual games for just $3 a month.

691
00:44:00,372 --> 00:44:03,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're trying to put this at like a super low price point for folks to do this.

692
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:06,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Still say, though, you got Tetranet for free that's still out there.

693
00:44:06,975 --> 00:44:10,276
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's going to have to have some features to make this worthwhile.

694
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:15,438
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know if this is trying to ride on the coattails of projected success for Tetris DS or what.

695
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:17,439
[SPEAKER_09]: But nevertheless, this is coming out soon.

696
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:29,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that should be noted is that this is being funded by Hank Rogers, who sold his interest in the blue lava wireless mobile phone company Jamdat in 2005.

697
00:44:30,488 --> 00:44:36,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That stock sale will net him another $108 million via Jamdat's upcoming sale to Electronic Arts.

698
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:43,357
[SPEAKER_09]: His partner for Tetris Online will be former Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa.

699
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:45,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

700
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:51,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Good minds coming together because the mobile phone Tetris is actually pretty good for a mobile phone game.

701
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:53,778
[SPEAKER_09]: So promising things coming out of this.

702
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:56,459
[SPEAKER_09]: This may not be just crappy Tetris knockoff.

703
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:57,360
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be pretty good.

704
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

705
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,061
[SPEAKER_09]: We shall see.

706
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:01,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did need to make a statement on something.

707
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:02,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

708
00:45:03,303 --> 00:45:05,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to go and also correct myself.

709
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:11,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually told you wrong regarding the subsistence.

710
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:12,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm doing it.

711
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:12,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsistence.

712
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,173
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just call it Metal Gear 3 S. Subsistence.

713
00:45:19,513 --> 00:45:20,534
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

714
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:21,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Mistakes happen.

715
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:24,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, moving on.

716
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:29,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you sometimes look at what's going on in the hacking and cracking world.

717
00:45:30,056 --> 00:45:30,916
[SPEAKER_09]: What's been hacked now?

718
00:45:31,617 --> 00:45:35,998
[SPEAKER_07]: First thing is the original Xbox DVD firmware has been hacked.

719
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:37,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is that important?

720
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, with the hacked firmware...

721
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:44,240
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox doesn't realize a game is burned or is an original copy.

722
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can pop anything in there without a mod chip and it will run.

723
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:50,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that's coming out.

724
00:45:51,142 --> 00:45:59,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's important about that also is the firmware on the original Xbox is very similar to the firmware that's in the new Xbox 360.

725
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're thinking that maybe they can break it the same way.

726
00:46:03,695 --> 00:46:04,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Rise of the Triad

727
00:46:23,762 --> 00:46:27,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to check that out, PSP Updates has a download for you for that.

728
00:46:28,306 --> 00:46:34,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, for the Nintendo DS Linux, they actually have added Wi-Fi support, which is pretty cool there.

729
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:38,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you've got a modded DS, definitely check that one out.

730
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:43,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, the PSP has some more functionality added to it.

731
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:48,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they have a homebrew program to use your PSP as a universal remote.

732
00:46:49,637 --> 00:46:51,819
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, one last thing here, P6, the

733
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:38,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Shell coming to the PlayStation firmware 1.5 has been released and that's actually kind of a new GUI that they've added and a lot more functionality is going to be going into that as well so look for more updates from us and also you'll probably hear some more things on PSP updates as well and let's see finally they've had some rumors about new firmware updates coming which are going to allow email and GPS to be added to

734
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:42,586
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP's list of enhancements.

735
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,527
[SPEAKER_07]: So email and GPS possibly coming later on.

736
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:03,393
[SPEAKER_09]: 916-226-9067

737
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:24,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So please ask Mommy and Daddy if you don't own the phone line.

738
00:48:24,672 --> 00:48:26,532
[SPEAKER_09]: If you own the phone line, hey, do what you want.

739
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:29,793
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, but we're going to be taking Skype line calls very soon.

740
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:35,994
[SPEAKER_09]: But since there's a bit of a delay, before we go to that, we want to go ahead and announce tonight's listless winners.

741
00:48:36,835 --> 00:48:37,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Votes are in.

742
00:48:39,355 --> 00:48:42,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, this is the Kingdom Hearts 3 world we would most like to see.

743
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:44,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And, of course, we're living in a fantasy world.

744
00:48:44,856 --> 00:48:46,917
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't have to be square or square.

745
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:48,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Disney-related.

746
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,280
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be anything.

747
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So here it is.

748
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,522
[SPEAKER_09]: The votes are tallied, and this is the definitive list through this highly scientific process.

749
00:48:55,003 --> 00:49:03,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three world we most want to see, the Zelda Ocarina of Time world is the number three world they most want to see.

750
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:09,689
[SPEAKER_09]: The number two world the kids most want to see is the Doom world.

751
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:10,770
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to see them go to hell.

752
00:49:12,304 --> 00:49:17,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and the number one world, as voted by our chatroom, this is something that could actually happen, too.

753
00:49:18,509 --> 00:49:22,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Chrono Trigger World is the number one voted answer there.

754
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:23,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool, very cool.

755
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:26,635
[SPEAKER_09]: No love for Serenity, extrovert, sorry.

756
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it got some pity votes.

757
00:49:29,016 --> 00:49:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you say, the Silent Hill World?

758
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill World, I think, was a close fourth, I think.

759
00:49:37,344 --> 00:49:39,567
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually Silent Hill World was kind of trailing.

760
00:49:39,587 --> 00:49:40,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Darkwing Duck almost made it though.

761
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,991
[SPEAKER_09]: That was number four.

762
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:43,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus Christ.

763
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:44,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

764
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:45,156
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

765
00:49:48,103 --> 00:49:49,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll do a list list again soon.

766
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,644
[SPEAKER_09]: You know we have to do match games sometime too.

767
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:51,525
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done that in forever.

768
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:52,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe next week.

769
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:52,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

770
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,026
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we have interviews or not next week.

771
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:57,147
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all time pending stuff.

772
00:49:57,287 --> 00:50:00,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's go to the Skype line and hear from you guys.

773
00:50:00,489 --> 00:50:04,350
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, it's 916-226-9067 or you can call us on Skype.

774
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It's username OrangeLoungeRadio is who you want to call.

775
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:07,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the Skype line.

776
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:09,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

777
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:10,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

778
00:50:10,513 --> 00:50:11,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

779
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,074
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Xander from Florida.

780
00:50:13,154 --> 00:50:14,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Xander, you call us too damn much.

781
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:15,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

782
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:16,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what's on your mind this week?

783
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:17,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing better to do on Sunday night.

784
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:18,454
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

785
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:18,855
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

786
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:25,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to point out real quick, you're saying that Chrono Trigger could actually appear on Kingdom Hearts 3.

787
00:50:27,098 --> 00:50:27,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't.

788
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

789
00:50:29,899 --> 00:50:35,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Hypothetically, they could do one of those loophole things, or are you talking about it's a rights issue?

790
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:38,543
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the characters... They could, but Nomura won't.

791
00:50:39,243 --> 00:50:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy is strictly background cameo stuff in Kingdom Hearts.

792
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:43,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It will never be a world in Kingdom Hearts.

793
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:46,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any idea where I could get Vibra Bun?

794
00:50:46,651 --> 00:50:46,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Any idea?

795
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:14,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Do they still push new copies of that around on some of the import sites?

796
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:15,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

797
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:20,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I ordered one so, so long ago that I don't know if they still sell this anymore because it's a PS1 title.

798
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:24,167
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would say probably your best bet is going to be something like eBay.

799
00:51:24,468 --> 00:51:26,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be afraid to try Yahoo Auctions, but the Japanese one.

800
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:32,961
[SPEAKER_09]: might be a good place to try.

801
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:39,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, you're going to pay more money to get shipped over here, but if you really want the game bad enough... I didn't expect that.

802
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:41,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other suggestions you guys have?

803
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:41,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Liksang?

804
00:51:42,144 --> 00:51:43,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Liksang, maybe.

805
00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:43,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

806
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:49,086
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's going to be hard to find because it's PS1, but if you want a PS2 title that's similar, you can always try Mojib Ribbon.

807
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

808
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:53,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it's very language intensive.

809
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:54,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

810
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a different game as well, so I don't know.

811
00:51:57,829 --> 00:51:59,249
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's close.

812
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,410
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the closest thing you're going to get.

813
00:52:04,393 --> 00:52:05,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck to you, Xander, finding that.

814
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:08,755
[SPEAKER_09]: If you find a copy, let us know so we can tell our listeners where you found it.

815
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:10,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

816
00:52:12,077 --> 00:52:12,237
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

817
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:12,857
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

818
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:14,878
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Xander.

819
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:15,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for calling in.

820
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:15,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

821
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:17,079
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

822
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:17,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

823
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another call here.

824
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

825
00:52:22,301 --> 00:52:22,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

826
00:52:22,982 --> 00:52:23,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, who's this?

827
00:52:26,584 --> 00:52:27,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello!

828
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:33,869
[SPEAKER_09]: It's General Psy, I got the name there, but you're breaking up just a little bit, but go ahead and get your questions out.

829
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:34,949
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

830
00:52:37,311 --> 00:52:41,574
[SPEAKER_06]: First and foremost, I'm kind of angry at my computer.

831
00:52:42,634 --> 00:52:49,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get... Yeah, we're kind of angry at your computer right now, too, because it keeps cutting you out.

832
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:49,979
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't hear you, buddy.

833
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

834
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:52,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, buddy.

835
00:52:52,411 --> 00:52:53,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to let you go.

836
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:55,172
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just kind of not there.

837
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:55,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

838
00:52:56,433 --> 00:53:02,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I think somebody should call in and do the... Have you checked the children?

839
00:53:02,756 --> 00:53:03,817
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do one more call here.

840
00:53:04,477 --> 00:53:04,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

841
00:53:05,598 --> 00:53:07,979
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all the net traffic's tied up because of the stupid bull.

842
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's try going to another call.

843
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

844
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you already know who this is.

845
00:53:14,183 --> 00:53:15,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Could this be the legend of Zaku?

846
00:53:16,384 --> 00:53:17,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're on the mark.

847
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:18,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's set aside ten minutes.

848
00:53:19,026 --> 00:53:20,707
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind, Zaku?

849
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:33,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, since I started that, you know, since I started a, you know, a weekend habit of just playing 2DX really drunk, I kind of need, I kind of need suggestions of, of liquors that would go great with that sort of activity.

850
00:53:33,493 --> 00:53:34,694
[SPEAKER_02]: How old are you, young man?

851
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:35,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 21.

852
00:53:35,474 --> 00:53:38,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been 21 for about, for over a month.

853
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:42,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, just wanted to make sure you're of age, because we can't encourage this if you're under 21.

854
00:53:42,516 --> 00:53:45,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, liquors that go good with playing 2DX.

855
00:53:45,616 --> 00:53:45,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

856
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:46,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

857
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:47,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Guinness.

858
00:53:48,187 --> 00:53:49,108
[SPEAKER_09]: I do enjoy Guinness.

859
00:53:49,248 --> 00:53:49,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Vodka?

860
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:51,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard liquors.

861
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything 40% alcohol.

862
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:56,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Take a shot of 151 and drop it in a glass of Guinness.

863
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:57,974
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called an Irish Car Bomb.

864
00:53:58,014 --> 00:54:01,076
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

865
00:54:02,237 --> 00:54:09,082
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, besides that, I'm surprised that they charge money for cell phone games.

866
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:16,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though as a person who happens to make them for a senior project in order to get it out of college, I find it appalling.

867
00:54:17,082 --> 00:54:37,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And people charge, you know, that company's charged monthly for a damn game Yeah, the monthly fees is a little bit, now I'm like, okay, well obviously you can charge money for a game Because, you know, that's how, that's what funds these people's paychecks Yeah, but I mean, I thought most games were just like, you know, two, three dollars and that was it But then they have the gall to charge you monthly

868
00:54:37,702 --> 00:54:41,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the repeat thing's a little lame for the cell phones, especially when they're bad games.

869
00:54:43,166 --> 00:54:50,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I know companies like Sprint that they charge a certain amount of money for a certain amount of time, and then you have to keep paying it again.

870
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:52,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't buy them.

871
00:54:53,134 --> 00:54:54,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't support that crap.

872
00:54:54,295 --> 00:54:54,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.

873
00:54:54,755 --> 00:54:57,477
[SPEAKER_09]: If I see a game that they want to charge a monthly fee, I say, screw it.

874
00:54:57,497 --> 00:54:58,138
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to buy it.

875
00:54:58,258 --> 00:55:00,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as I said, certain phone providers and game contractors

876
00:55:06,383 --> 00:55:06,763
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

877
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:06,903
[SPEAKER_02]: See...

878
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:32,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's up to the programmer.

879
00:55:32,148 --> 00:55:33,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anything else on your mind, Zaku?

880
00:55:34,689 --> 00:55:39,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, a lot hasn't been touched up on Supernova yet.

881
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Since location testing already happened and the next one is going to be

882
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:46,670
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

883
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:03,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good, good.

884
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, fixed bugs.

885
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:05,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine by me.

886
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's the idea of dual locations.

887
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:09,102
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only what I've been hearing from other places.

888
00:56:09,622 --> 00:56:13,063
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, you know, it's a little bit of rumor at this point.

889
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:13,484
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

890
00:56:13,544 --> 00:56:15,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the game will be fine when it comes out.

891
00:56:15,864 --> 00:56:16,245
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

892
00:56:16,505 --> 00:56:17,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hopefully, hopefully.

893
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,166
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Zaku, time's up.

894
00:56:19,206 --> 00:56:19,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm letting you go.

895
00:56:19,786 --> 00:56:20,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one.

896
00:56:20,486 --> 00:56:21,167
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, bye.

897
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:24,468
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that was the Skype line, boys and girls.

898
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,948
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all for you.

899
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:27,449
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you do the Skype line.

900
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,430
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we do it here at Orange Lounge Radio.

901
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:36,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're getting towards the end of the program here, but not until we bring you one last story.

902
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:37,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Couple more stories.

903
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:42,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yes, Loki, why don't you start us off then, since you must have found some late additions here.

904
00:56:42,704 --> 00:56:42,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

905
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:46,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody loves making fun of Jack Thompson.

906
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:48,930
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember his Modest Game Proposal?

907
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin, I thought we could go one week without that name.

908
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:52,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I'm not talking about Jack Thompson.

909
00:56:52,632 --> 00:56:54,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about his Modest Game Proposal.

910
00:56:55,214 --> 00:56:59,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And someone else finished one of their games for the Modest Game Proposal.

911
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:02,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called I'm Okay, a Murder Simulator.

912
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:10,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can check it out, actually, at... Unfortunately, the website that was hosting it went down, so they have it mirrored here.

913
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: It's...

914
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:33,105
[SPEAKER_07]: 67.15.42.30 slash I'm okay and you can check it out there it's a 12 meg download has nice Super Nintendo looking graphics and you basically murder and murder and murder and murder and lots of murdering and it's great so definitely check that out

915
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:57,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, for those people who are fans of Burnout, they're doing a promo now with the retail kiosk that you can find out there for the Xbox 360, where you can bring your memory card to the location and download an exclusive Burnout Revenge card that's actually going to be Xbox 360 themed, as well as a dashboard theme and gamer pick.

916
00:57:58,068 --> 00:57:59,069
[SPEAKER_07]: So check that out.

917
00:58:00,834 --> 00:58:03,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Just wanted to say, I got a quick tip here from a chatter.

918
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:04,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mike.

919
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:07,715
[SPEAKER_09]: He says that JapanVideoGames.com has VibRibbon.

920
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:11,096
[SPEAKER_09]: So Xander, go take a look there, and hopefully you can get it.

921
00:58:11,556 --> 00:58:13,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to say, I've ordered through them.

922
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:14,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're good.

923
00:58:14,416 --> 00:58:16,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought Beatmania through them.

924
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:17,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought my Drummania through them.

925
00:58:17,877 --> 00:58:19,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Their prices usually tend to be very comparable.

926
00:58:19,677 --> 00:58:20,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no free advertising.

927
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:30,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, as I don't want to misguide any of our listeners, and we have gone through a number of importers among us, avoid buy-write at all costs.

928
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:34,295
[SPEAKER_09]: They suck!

929
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:35,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

930
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,135
[SPEAKER_01]: They owe me $70.

931
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:40,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can take me with you.

932
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:44,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you could fly to the country and buy it there.

933
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:45,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And take me with you.

934
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's an option.

935
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:49,478
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get on to our last story tonight.

936
00:58:49,518 --> 00:58:49,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, Loki?

937
00:58:50,038 --> 00:58:50,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Last story.

938
00:58:50,938 --> 00:58:51,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, no more stories, Loki.

939
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:52,438
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no more.

940
00:58:52,558 --> 00:58:52,938
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, good.

941
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:56,859
[SPEAKER_09]: So DarkSakura, this is a good note to finish up on tonight.

942
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,200
[SPEAKER_09]: What's coming our way pretty soon?

943
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:05,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this has to do with our good friend Itadaki of Team Ninja, who...

944
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:19,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there was an interview with Famitsu Xbox 360 regarding the Dead or Alive franchise where they spoke with Itagaki about the delays.

945
00:59:21,328 --> 00:59:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: He did actually make an apology for the last minute postponements that were going on over it.

946
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:30,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there was a mention about...

947
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,491
[SPEAKER_01]: DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2.

948
00:59:42,854 --> 00:59:51,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I get into that, I am going to make a mention that there were plans to release new outfits for the DOA 4 characters via the Xbox Live Marketplace.

949
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:58,690
[SPEAKER_01]: However, due to budget and staff issues, they had to put that on hold.

950
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:00,111
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where the bikinis went.

951
01:00:00,452 --> 01:00:04,574
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is still interest in doing it, but they may have to do that for a charge.

952
01:00:05,155 --> 01:00:05,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

953
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:21,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as I was bringing up DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2, Team Ninja is working on the opening and ending scenes for the game, currently implementing some changes to the original design

954
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:27,453
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is not a release date being mentioned.

955
01:00:27,853 --> 01:00:39,929
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it will be an action game but that it won't necessarily they're also working on an action game that's not really going to be in the Ninja Gaiden franchise but

956
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:46,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Progressive, Dead or Alive, Code, Cronus, or another title.

957
01:00:46,704 --> 01:00:48,365
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the key word is interactivity.

958
01:00:48,385 --> 01:00:52,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that Team Ninja does, Team Ninja, in my esteem, is up there with treasure.

959
01:01:10,575 --> 01:01:11,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Some pretty, pretty games.

960
01:01:11,976 --> 01:01:15,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially that DOA 4 on my Xbox 360, you know, when it worked.

961
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:17,179
[SPEAKER_09]: When it worked.

962
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:20,781
[SPEAKER_09]: And on that note, I think it's time to wrap up tonight's program.

963
01:01:21,442 --> 01:01:23,343
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

964
01:01:23,423 --> 01:01:29,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Extifer, thank you so much for being on the show tonight and giving us your 50 cents or so.

965
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:30,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for having me.

966
01:01:30,547 --> 01:01:31,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thought.

967
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:33,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

968
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

969
01:01:37,912 --> 01:01:38,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

970
01:01:39,192 --> 01:01:39,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

971
01:01:39,513 --> 01:01:40,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything.

972
01:01:40,495 --> 01:01:44,137
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is that stupid shipping box is going to get here tomorrow when I'm out of town.

973
01:01:44,918 --> 01:01:46,318
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be here to collect.

974
01:01:47,979 --> 01:01:49,080
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

975
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons.

976
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:51,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Think for yourself!

977
01:01:53,022 --> 01:01:54,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Britney Spears does.

978
01:01:55,904 --> 01:02:03,168
[SPEAKER_09]: From us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys, have a great week and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
