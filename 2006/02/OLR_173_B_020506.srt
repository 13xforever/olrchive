4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we're back here for the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 173 for this, February the 5th of 2006.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,440
Hope you guys are doing well. We had a pretty fun first half, very long first half.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,780
As you may or may not have heard, hopefully you guys have all went back and

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,740
downloaded part A of the show for those of you guys listening on the podcast, but

8
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,740
I was having a little bit of a printing drama. I wasn't able to print my boarding pass for my

9
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,620
flight tomorrow.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,060
Loki finally got the damn thing to work and we printed my boarding pass during

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,460
the break. I'm very happy.

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,420
Even if I do have a crappy bee pass, damn you Southwest and your stupid system.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,620
Even if I have a crappy bee pass, at least it works. So thank you, Loki.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,260
Alright, no mic? There you go.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,940
Sorry, Christopher, like, you're a little...

16
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Yeah, you tangled me up in the chair. That's alright.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,780
And of course, if you didn't hear part 8, also, I'm in a very angsty

18
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,140
Xbox 360 mood tonight, and I'm not going there again. You'll just have to download

19
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,660
part 8 to figure out why, but if I sound bitter, I have a good reason.

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,900
Alright, let's get back into it, though. Let's talk about something else

21
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,220
that makes a lot of people bitter,

22
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,220
And that's lack of Advent Children, because you know, we were supposed to have this movie out like months ago.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,220
Dark Soccer, what did you do with it? Did you take it?

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,220
I had it, I had it months ago.

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,220
Yeah, but what did you do with the rest of our copies? Where's our English version of it? What did you do with it?

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,220
I ate it.

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,220
Oh.

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,220
Barf.

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,220
Barf it up so we can have it. No, really. No, really. Where is Advent Children for the USA?

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:53,300
Well, you know, we're supposed to be getting it sometime this year, according to the Digital

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,940
Bits, which is, basically what's been said about it is, this is a quote, it's taking

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,740
a little extra time to work with the director to get all of the supplemental elements finished,

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,620
which is why it's delayed.

34
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,540
You know, for as long as it's taking us to get it, I feel really awful for our friends

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,860
in the UK who are probably not even getting it until after we do.

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,780
Well, hell, most people that really want it bad enough have already downloaded it.

37
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,500
I can't... whoa. A little error on our end.

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,740
Not time for that yet. Um, I'm a little surprised here because I think most

39
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,220
people that really have wanted the movie bad enough have already gotten it through

40
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,740
illegal means. I'm surprised Sony sat on this for this long.

41
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,980
Well, remember, Squintix told us it was going to be out in May 2005.

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,100
um hi it's February

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,340
where's my Advent Children?

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,860
I don't get it. That's okay. Is this thing gonna still sell when it comes out?

45
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,060
They're gonna have to have a lot of extras. Yeah people are gonna buy it I know they will

46
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,980
however you know I

47
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,060
I'm very much in a wait and see mode over this

48
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,860
I have it I can watch it whenever I want so I'm trying not to

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,460
to be too pushy on it I held out. But I want to see the stuff on the discs

50
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,460
I've held out. I don't want to watch it on my computer for the first time. I want to watch it on a TV

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,580
a big big TV as big as possible for the first time. I don't want it pixelated or none of that. I want

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,380
beautiful

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,940
what? Mine's actually a full DVD rip

54
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,540
Damn you people. It looks pretty on my screen. I'm trying to be legit with this here

55
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,060
okay I want to support. I legitimately downloaded it. I want to support

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,940
Square and Sony here but I'm finding it harder and harder too as this thing keeps

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,180
getting delayed. Whatever the problem is, fix it!

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,420
Anything else anyone want to say?

59
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,380
If it's to my credit I can- I have removed it from my hard drive.

60
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,060
Loki, what- you had a release date on this at one point and now it's shot again.

61
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,500
Yeah, they keep pulling it.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,820
Jeez. There was even a rumor going around saying that they're

63
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,900
redoing all the animations to match the English dubbing.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,900
I guess that would be a good reason why it's taken so long.

65
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
Okay, that might be a decent reason, but still.

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
Nah, I don't think that's what the reason is.

67
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
But I think the UK was actually...

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,900
There was an article, I think, out this week about the UK,

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
and they're getting theirs in 2006 as well.

70
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,900
See, I'd imagine they don't have to do any, you know, sort of, you know,

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,900
localization for a UK release, so...

72
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,900
All right.

73
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Yeah.

74
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,820
Let's move on and talk about something that's going on in Japanese arcades right now, but

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,220
not U.S. ones.

76
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,100
Loki, what's going on?

77
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,400
What's going on is Soulcalibur III.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,180
The PlayStation 2 exclusive game is finally hitting the arcades where it needs to be.

79
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:52,780
They're going to actually have all the same characters from the home version, along with

80
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,900
some redesigned versions of three bonus characters from that version, Amy, Li Long, and Wang

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,020
Seong Seong Gyeong I believe that's how you pronounce that anyways um so it

82
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,940
should be pretty cool will I be able to take my custom dancer character and use

83
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,060
it in the arcades uh that I'm not sure okay um it says though when the player

84
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,880
finishes the game of Soulcalibur 3 arcade edition the screen will display a

85
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,540
barcode symbol and password this will be used to join an online mobile phone

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,460
based Soulcalibur 3 game called Mobile Conquest Mode. Basically by taking a

87
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,680
snapshot of the barcode symbol with the person's mobile phone and using the

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,660
password players can register their characters and challenge other players

89
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,540
throughout the country via Soulcalibur 3's mobile phone website. That's kind of

90
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,260
unique. That is unique. Never would have heard that. I mean I realize mobile phone

91
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,260
is way bigger in other countries than it is here but that's you know kind of neat.

92
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:00,040
I wish it would take off here, but whatever. Yeah, the game is slated for release in fall in Japan and

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,960
Should be coming out here. I'm sure at some point I

94
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,020
Would like to see Soulcalibur 3 in the arcades. I know everybody said Oh PlayStation 2 exclusive, but you know what exclusive windows up

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,100
Let's get that Soulcalibur 2 is a great great arcade game. I'd love to see 3 hit the arcades

96
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,540
Although I kind of think it should have been the arcades first

97
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,860
But whatever and they can come up with these kind of cool features

98
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,440
like it sounds like they're doing if they can carry some of that coolness

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,700
over to the US I won't have such an issue with this I don't know all right

100
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,500
now you know we were talking also in the first half because we had an email about

101
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,060
it you know we've started as a DDR centric station so of course music and

102
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,860
rhythm games we love them and Loki you have an article to hit the internet this

103
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,820
week about rhythm games right yes game spot ran the 10 spot the top 10 rhythm

104
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,820
games. Oh, another list. Yes, everybody loves lists. Lists are what they do when news gets

105
00:06:53,100 --> 00:07:00,100
slow. Anyways. It's human interest. Yes, first on the list of course we had, or I should

106
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,820
say in the 10 spot here, Prop of the Rapper. Of course, now everybody loves that game.

107
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,860
Samba de Amigo, which is pretty good. Number 9, right? Yes. Is this in order or is this

108
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,060
just I think this is just 10 in no particular order this one actually was

109
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:23,560
on the DS osu! tatake! oiden! which was for a Nintendo DS was kind of a game we

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,280
never saw so I heard of this game though it a lot of people are importing it it's

111
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,260
it's different yeah Gatoro man definitely guitar man yeah

112
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,060
Vib ribbon I love that they're not they're not excluding import titles and

113
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,380
things that weren't released here because there were a lot of good stuff that weren't

114
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
released here.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:49,540
Of course the original guitar favorite, Guitar Freaks, Bust a Groove, or Bust a Move, however

116
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:58,660
you want to call it, Frequency, then Guitar Hero, and you know, let's see here, of course

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,940
Dance Dance Revolution.

118
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,980
And they named Third Mix specifically, right?

119
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,980
Yeah.

120
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,820
I would say Third Mix was definitely a peak, had so many great licenses.

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,380
I remember way back in your old apartment of doom

122
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,580
I know the first time I ever got a little watching you play

123
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,620
DDR not DDR playing the Jungle Book game

124
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,420
my on the Jungle Book pad baby's first dancing game that was that was me I had

125
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,780
my little mini for midgets it was a DER pad for midgets for the Jungle Book

126
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,220
dancing game

127
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,260
that's okay Jamie Fixx I know I know so is that it was that 10

128
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,580
that was it where's Beatmania get guitar freaks off that list but Beatmania in there

129
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,820
instead I think no crap

130
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:39,620
I think we can all say that Guitar Hero kind of improved on Guitar Freaks, so there's no need for both of them on the list there.

131
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,700
Let's get rid of Guitar Freaks and put BeatMania in there instead. What's up with that?

132
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,020
I don't know.

133
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,180
Anything else missing? I don't know. I think otherwise it's a pretty solid list.

134
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,540
That's Space Channel 5.

135
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,420
Ooh! Good call! That should have been somewhere on there. I don't know about that. Ooh, good call.

136
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,260
Space Channel 5 is a great game.

137
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,180
Interesting. I would have said Amplitude over Frequency, but I'm at least glad, you know, there's a little bit of harmonics love in there.

138
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,780
karaoke revolution is not on the list

139
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,120
and there's too much loki says good

140
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,860
i don't like their game

141
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,240
whatever

142
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,900
uh... comments from the chat room here of course you know we got folks saying

143
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,740
uh... no beatmania

144
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,820
uh... pk akira eighty eight says no pump it up no in the groove

145
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,420
uh... reni says where's papa music

146
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,240
interesting

147
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,540
lots of interesting choices

148
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,700
that's that's the thing about list you guys is to so that they can leave

149
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,580
something off

150
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,660
just to ruffle your feathers about it

151
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
Did it work?

152
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Did it work?

153
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
All right.

154
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,500
One thing that never ruffles any feathers, though, ever, ever, is Dark Sakura.

155
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,420
And Dark Sakura brings us her very non-controversial and very politically correct website of the

156
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,020
week every week.

157
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Right Dark Sakura?

158
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
Of course I do.

159
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
All right.

160
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,980
So what website did you pick for the kids this week?

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,580
Well, I figured as there are certain important things regarding the site going on, I would

162
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:04,980
have to go with Kojima's blog. I love reading Kojima's blog. I think that he's

163
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,860
pretty interesting person and kind of cute. I just like the pictures up there

164
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,140
with his little foxhound thing on the side. Lots of interesting insight into

165
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,060
what he's got going on as well as opinions of certain other people which

166
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,500
Allie for somebody else to bring up, but it's really cool, and he also

167
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,620
apparently just

168
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,140
Has all kinds of things sneaking out in his blog along with changes didn't you notice a couple? I?

169
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Mean I haven't really read it

170
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,260
But I will visit it now that it's hit your list

171
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,580
Well also though you can find the link to hit it to Kojima's podcast oh

172
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,580
The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas

173
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,820
Goldstein, Profile Investment Services, Ltd., or Israel National News.

174
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Readers should consult with a professional financial advisor before making any financial

175
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
decisions.

176
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,660
It's going to be handled by the international manager Ryan Payton.

177
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,580
Payton is going to summarize Kojima's podcast and bring on guests and give behind the scenes

178
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,500
information on the latest happenings of the company.

179
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,380
So it's not really like a word for word blog, but it's like the English spinoff, I guess

180
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
you could say.

181
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
So that's pretty cool.

182
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,260
So you want to give the address there for folks who want to look up that blog?

183
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Absolutely.

184
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,340
And I'm going to give the link to the English blog.

185
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:44,100
It's www.blog.konami.jp slash GS slash Hideo blog underscore E.

186
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,980
Visit it, love it, because DarkSakura said so.

187
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
Exactly.

188
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:56,060
Alright, one thing that will not come up on the Hideo Kojima blog ever again, what's this

189
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Loki?

190
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,660
It would be an ooey bull adaptation of Mill Your Cellot, and to which I will paraphrase

191
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,720
kajima when he says absolutely not over my dead body

192
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,420
fuck you ui bowl he did not say fuck you ui bowl you're gonna paraphrase all

193
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,420
right anyways basically there's no way they didn't contact them on it they

194
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,580
would never let him touch that property so he sucks that's all you need to know

195
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,740
about that but the ui bowl fun doesn't stop there does it Loki no and if it's

196
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,860
not a surprise Uwe Boll is nominated for Razzie for worst director thanks to

197
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,540
Alone in the Dark. So Razzies are like the opposite of the Oscars right? Exactly.

198
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,500
Because Alone in the Dark sucked ass as did other movies like Blood Rain which only

199
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,340
pulled in 2.4 million dollars over 30 days and and that's nothing for like if

200
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,380
I made 2 point what 2.4 did you say if I made 2.4 million dollars in 30 days that

201
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,980
would be a great thing because then I could you know fund my evil empire but

202
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,260
for a movie in Hollywood to make 2.4 million over 30 days and not be like an

203
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,460
arthouse movie type thing that's bad that's not saying much considering that

204
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,020
the production budget of the movie is 25 million dollars in the marketing costs

205
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,980
apparently reached about 22 million dollars putting it a good that movie I

206
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,100
think I maybe saw one billboard that was it like ever that puts it on the whole

207
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:28,820
quite a bit and so but hey if you still want to see more we will wonder full

208
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,400
movies and stuff there's in the name of the king two parts we will stop plugging

209
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,780
that nobody wants to see it just don't plug it epic movie three hours of crap

210
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,100
don't plug it coming out in November now you might notice we've had just a little

211
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,580
bit like a tiny bit not much but like a little bit of angst this week I don't

212
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,900
if it's just me maybe you've noticed it like you know especially Dark Sakura this

213
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,780
week no I'm just kidding it's it's totally me but Dark Sakura this is her

214
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,660
baby after all it's her segment and we intrude on it it's called the FUs of the

215
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,560
week and it's the part of the show where we're allowed to get a little mean right

216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,020
Dark Sakura oh yes

217
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:28,980
My F.U. of the week goes toward my own body for betraying me in a most heinous fashion.

218
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,980
I went over to one of my co-workers house to help her and her son with their MP3 player

219
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,860
and I forgot about her dogs.

220
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,540
Now normally if I'm around a dog, I'll get smithy, I might itch a little bit.

221
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,300
Normally I take like a Benadryl before I go over there and I'm fine.

222
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,940
Oh my god, okay.

223
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,940
I'm there for all of 10 minutes and I start to feel the smithy and I start to feel my

224
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,140
eyes itch a little bit and I was like yeah it's allergies, I'm leaving in a few minutes.

225
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:12,180
Well within not even five minutes of that, suddenly my eyes were swollen shut.

226
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
They were bloodshot.

227
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,660
I burst two blood vessels in my left eye and my eyes had swollen so much they were pulling

228
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,020
the skin tight around my eyes.

229
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Ew!

230
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,780
It was really disgusting and then they were all gumming up and it was all bloody.

231
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,860
And many podcast listeners just threw up in their mouths there with that.

232
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,860
Thank you.

233
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Sorry.

234
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,100
I'm going into detail so that people will understand my level of

235
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:42,100
Rather well-contained rage right now. So and you know, I wasn't really you know

236
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:49,340
My friend kept apologizing. It's not her fault. You know, she didn't you know say let's give her the genes that make her look at your dogs

237
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,180
You know, I'm sort of allergic to my cat too, but I'm used to her

238
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:01,640
So she went and gave me some Benadryl in these like little sanitary allergy eye drops and it seriously took about

239
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,000
about 20 minutes before I could open my eyes.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,720
And so I went to go pick up Tia.

241
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,240
And she got in the car.

242
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,720
I had my glasses off at that point.

243
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,960
And I turned and looked at her, and she was like, oh my god!

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,360
And started to get out of the car.

245
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,200
I was like, Tia, no!

246
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,440
I just have a zombie eye.

247
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,800
My eyes, I actually took a picture of it,

248
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,720
how it was after, get this.

249
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
Will you post on the website?

250
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,600
I will.

251
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,220
three doses of Benadryl

252
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,380
and all kinds of eye drops. I got those neat Japanese minty eye drops that make your

253
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,040
eyes feel all cold

254
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,000
and I slept with a cold compress on my face for two days. I went to the doctor yesterday

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,820
because it actually the bone around my left eye started to hurt

256
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,840
and so he gave me some lovely drugs and now most of the swelling is down but it's still there

257
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,800
I looked yesterday like I got punched in the eye

258
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,440
Dan proceeded to say, well that's what you get for not ducking.

259
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
My husband.

260
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,640
So yeah, fuck you to my jeans.

261
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,200
I blame mommy and daddy and all the drugs they did in the 70s.

262
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Whoa, okay.

263
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,480
Loki, your turn.

264
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,660
My nephew this week goes to the restaurant chain known as Hooters.

265
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,080
Fuck you for your really crappy service and your really crappy food.

266
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,040
Um, I went there actually on Saturday to get some food and, you know, cause people wanted

267
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,520
to go to Hooters to check it out, you know, they had never been.

268
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,280
So we got there, and I give them my name, they write my name down as Ben.

269
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,660
I'm like, no, it's Matt.

270
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,300
They write down Max.

271
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm like, that's close enough.

272
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,400
So we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, finally we get, you know, seeded and stuff,

273
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,900
and it takes them a half an hour to take our order.

274
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,840
Then afterwards, we're waiting, waiting, waiting, takes an hour for us to get our food.

275
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,680
and they hadn't even delivered the wings we had ordered, which were going to be an appetizer.

276
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:05,680
On top of all that, just the people there were retarded. I mean, just completely retarded.

277
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,220
You're trying to talk to these people, and their Coke was really watered down, and their

278
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,000
burgers weren't that great, and the wings, you know what, even if they are world famous,

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,800
they sucked ass. So, fuck Hooters, I will never be going back there.

280
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,080
Marceph in the chat room says, who goes to Hooters for the food?

281
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
Well it's definitely enough for the intelligence.

282
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
Alright, let me give an FU real quick.

283
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Welcome to Hooters!

284
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,520
Let me give an FU real quick, I think this shouldn't come as much surprise to anybody

285
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,320
who listened to part A, but FU to Microsoft for making 360's and getting me all excited

286
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,640
that I finally have a 360 and then making one that would crash on me after 24 hours.

287
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,200
That was very kind of you Microsoft.

288
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:55,200
I just want to add on Loki's hatred for Hooters, because it's not that great. Their food isn't that good.

289
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:04,200
And the girls are like, thank you for coming to Hooters! They have more brains in their boobs than they do in their head.

290
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You can address those cards and letters to extfer at orangeonshredge.com

Dark Sacris, we can have something meaningful

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very meaningful game to some of us

299
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Oh yes

300
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
And we've been waiting to hear some news on the US version

301
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
But you got something for us?

302
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:40,920
Well yeah actually I've got a confirmed list of some of the voice actors in the

Aerith it's Mena Suvari from American Beauty. One I don't want to say because

305
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,960
it's very very spoilery. Should I spoil? Okay plug your ears real quick.

306
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,700

Chicken little Zach Braff. Yay cloud Steve Burton and

I do not see anything about bringing back my man as my man

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,040
David Boreanaz as Squall?

316
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,180
As, yes. Leon, remember. Oh, sorry, Leon. Not bad.

317
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,600
On IMDB they had him listed. Yeah, by IMDB. I already realize.

318
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,000
IMDB, all they did was copy the same people who played whoever and whatever.

319
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,880
Oh, really? So, yeah, IMDB is a...

320
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,580
I will not say lying piece of crap, I will just say

321
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:09,180
inaccurate source. They are. I do agree.

322
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,520
But for the stuff that's already out, they're pretty reliable. And, uh, no, um...

323
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,420
Noah of Pirates of the Caribbean voice actors

324
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,960
unfortunately. Yeah, nothing listed there, and no Lance Bass.

325
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, no, the recent scheduling conflicts to their new movie.

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,520
Yeah, although in an article that I

327
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,000
read they were taking great care to capture some very Keith Richards-like

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,120
motion for how he would walk.

329
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,520
Alright, all this talk on Kingdom Hearts,

330
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,040
I think we need to bring back a segment because, you know, we've been doing this new format

331
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,040
for a little while and part of the reason we went to the new format is so we could bring

332
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:56,200
segments from our live show we used to do and one of those segments is List List.

333
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Alright, now I know our podcast listeners are hearing List List for the first time so

334
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
we're going to kind of set this up for you guys.

335
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,520
Those of you guys listening live tonight on Sunday night, you guys get to directly participate

336
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
in this.

337
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,840
Your votes will come up with a list.

338
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,040
As we've been talking about in the show, people love to make lists and we're no different

339
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

340
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,560
Once in a while we like to take a topic and we like to come up with the definitive list

341
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,200
through a very scientific process where we nominate things for your consideration and

342
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
then we take them away.

343
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
So here's how it's going to work.

344
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,760
There's four people participating in tonight's list.

345
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,400
List Xtaphir, Loki, Dark Soccer, and myself and we're going to give you our top three

346
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,080
and then we're going to go around.

347
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,220
So we'll have a list of 12 at that point, then we're going to go around and each person

348
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,760
takes one thing off the list oh snap so that leaves a list of eight which you

349
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,120
the chat room get to vote on and give us your definitive top three for the list

350
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,640
from that eight so I bet you're all dying to know tonight's topic and see

351
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:01,640
how this works here the topic for tonight is world I most want to see in

352
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,560
Kingdom Hearts 3 now here's the catch doesn't have to be related to Disney or

353
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,220
square we're living in a fantasy world right now okay we realize that it's got

354
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,280
to be Disney or square to realistically be in a Kingdom Hearts game but that's

355
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
okay we live in a fantasy world here at Orange

356
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Lounge Radio so we're opening it up to any fandom any cartoon whatever you want

357
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,560
any type of Kingdom Hearts world you think ought to be in the game here's

358
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,960
your chance to name it and we're gonna come up with the Orange Lounge Radio

359
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,240
definitive list one other small little teensy-weensy change we're doing a list

360
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,680
list from the way we used to do it when the chat room votes you will be able to

361
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,800
pick not just one but now you can pick a number one and the number two so you can

362
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,440
actually pick two things from the topless age but you do have to tell me

363
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,400
what's your number one and what's your number two and if you don't specify I'll

364
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,520
assume the first thing you listed was your number one all right enough chatter

365
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,200
let's get to the list shall we let's start making our list here and Dark

366
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,560
Sakura why don't you start us off what's your number three pick for world you

367
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:06,560
would most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 3? Doom. Doom? Now would this be with, this would

368
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,640
be hell. Alright, we have Doom on the list. Any other reasons why you want to see Doom?

369
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,040
Just put the characters in hell? I just like to see really fucked up things. No kidding

370
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,160
lady. Alright, let's go over to Loki, you're number 3. I was actually picking more Disney

371
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:32,160
theme stuff. So Darkwing Duck. That would be cool. The Darkwing Duck level. Alright

372
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,360
I like that. Are you the terror that flaps in the night? My number 3 pick is uh, I didn't

373
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,240
have a better name for this so I'm calling it Secret of Mono World. You know it's another

374
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,520
great square game that ought to be given some love. So Secret of Mono World. Dare I ask

375
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,920
extra fur what's your number three pick I'm gonna be pretty predictable I'm

376
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,720
gonna choose Silent Hill world now see that would never happen in the actual

377
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,640
game but that's okay it's our fantasy we get whatever we want

378
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,120
Pyramid Head you know you got your Henry in the room great so now we're gonna

379
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,920
have like totally effed up Kingdom Hearts 2 and Silent Hill your special helper

380
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:18,920
character will be a magical girl Heather all right yeah I would I would love to

381
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,600
see Silent Hill World just to see a Sora take on Pyramid Head that'd be pretty

382
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,220
badass all right let's go to the number twos number twos Dark Sakura my number

383
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:39,120
two labyrinth with David Bowie and his member and oh yes because there were two

384
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,960
stars there were three stars in that movie Jennifer Connelly David Bowie and

385
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,120
David Bowie schlong and each of the the characters will be dressed up in tight

386
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:57,780
pants with giant packages. And your special helper will be the little dog on the other

387
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:07,100
dog. Or Bluto. So bad! Alright, let's keep it moving. Loki, your number two pick for

388
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,380
worlds you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3. Since all the answers have been quite ridiculous,

389
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:19,480
How about we do Hello Kitty World, Sanrio World, there we go, where it teams up with

390
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,960
Hello Kitty to take on, you know, the evil Bad Bats Maru and things.

391
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,600
They should fight Nazis, because I think that would be appropriate.

392
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,200
They should, that's a good concept there.

393
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,600
My number two pick, Chrono Trigger World, and you do the whole time traveling thing,

394
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,480
another great Square franchise, I think people would screen their panels as they could see.

395
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,280
I had a feeling someone else was going to mention that, which is why I didn't.

396
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,680
Alright, so there it is. Chrono Trigger World.

397
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,520
It would be like traveling to different universes and THEN traveling in time.

398
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,600
Alright. That would be complex.

399
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,500
Uh, Extifer, your number two pick.

400
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,420
Um, well, I-I think that I'm gonna go with Serenity World.

401
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,720
Because...

402
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,880
I can't- And there's this collective Joss Whedon fanboy, eeee, coming out. Yeah, I can't be- But you have Malzure.

403
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,280
Cat in Tight- Cat in Tight Pants is your partner. Yes.

404
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,920
And he's going to aid you and maybe have a hot sex scene too against the men with blue

405
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
hands.

406
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,200
All right.

407
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Time for the number ones.

408
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
You ready for it?

409
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Number one world.

410
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,140
So we're making the definitive list.

411
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Once we've done this, this is done.

412
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,220
This is all sealed and done.

413
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,460
We're sending it to Square and saying this is what we want.

414
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,880
Don't listen to what anybody else says.

415
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
This is the top three right here.

416
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,060
Dark Sakura, your number one fantasy world for Kingdom Hearts 3.

417
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,860
Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time world.

418
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,560
any of that crap Waterworld crap from Dream Waker.

419
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,920
So Legend of Zelda World, again something that would never happen, the Nintendo thing

420
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
on the Sony, but it's our units to tell the world.

421
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,820
But if anyone though looks at my DeviantArt profile, I have done fanart for this.

422
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
That's hardcore.

423
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Yes.

424
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
Hardcore nerd.

425
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
Alright.

426
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,720
Loki, your number one pick.

427
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
See this was tough.

428
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,680
I wanted to go more realistic and do like, you know, Treasure Planet or Rocketeer, speaking

429
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,680
to fight nazis, but since we are going ridiculous, DOA beach volleyball world.

430
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:22,680
DOA beach volleyball world. What exactly would you be fighting? You would be fighting clothing.

431
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,600
I just see it as doing nothing but playing volleyball there because when you go to the

432
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:34,960
undersea level in Kingdom Hearts 2 all you do is sing. You sing under the sea.

433
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,400
My number one pick is Microsoft World.

434
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,640
In Microsoft World, things glitch out.

435
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,480
Occasionally you have to fight the evil glitches and things that disappear and the world just

436
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,680
disappears suddenly on you and things go blank.

437
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,880
It's a real crazy level.

438
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,960
What was that one game on GameCube that totally messed with you?

439
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Eternal Darkness?

440
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Was that it?

441
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Was it Bitterness World?

442
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
No, no.

443
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,960
Microsoft World actually is what this is.

444
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,520
Let's be glad that Tron World is not powered by Microsoft.

445
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:18,520
I just need to go that one step further in my Joss Whedon fandom and create Once More with Feeling World.

446
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I thought you were just going to say Buffy World.

447
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,520
No, it was the musical episode of Buffy.

448
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,520
That was great, especially with the whole hot lesbian scene with Tara and Willow.

449
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
You can do so much with that world!

450
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,040
Labyrinth World, Hello Kitty or Sanrio World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, Zelda

451
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:44,940
Ocarina of Time, DOA Beach Volleyball, Microsoft World, and Buffy the Musical World, once more

452
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,040
with Feeling World if you so choose.

453
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,880
Alright, so Dark Sakura, one of these has got to come off the list.

454
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
What's going off the list?

455
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,320
Move your hand out of my way.

456
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
Sorry.

457
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Thank you.

458
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Um, Microsoft World, sorry.

459
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,360
You evil little bitchling.

460
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,400
Why did you take off my...

461
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,680
did you take that one off because i don't want to play a reality game i want to play

462
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:11,040

463
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:21,120

464
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:30,000
world oh oh snap oh loki burn you know i could take off serenity world and really be me but

465
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,140
I think this one's mostly filler.

466
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,360
No, this one, I'm sorry guys, this one has to go DOA Beach Volleyball World.

467
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,280
I'm sorry, that's uh...

468
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,600
I like that one!

469
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,520
Sor was gonna become a man!

470
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,560
You took that away from him!

471
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,080
I'm sorry, it's done, it's done, what's done is done.

472
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,320
Now he'll never get in because he's never gonna find Kyrie.

473
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,600
Extra Pro, what's the last one coming off this list?

474
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
Um, I think I'm gonna go with Hello Kitty World.

00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,060
Zelda Ocarina of Time world. Tell us what worlds would you most want to see in

480
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,780
Kingdom Hearts 3 assuming that you know Disney and Square only is out of the

481
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,940
picture, your fantasy world. Send those over private message and we'll reveal the

482
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,900
answers a little later in the show, the definitive list. In the meantime, more

483
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,780
news and we're going to go on over to Loki who's going to tell us what's going

484
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,940
on with the Sony PSP and we talked about some of this in the first half but you

485
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,480
had a little more like PSP also so what's going on? Yeah basically they

486
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,680
They're just boasting that their online service is going to be better than Microsoft.

487
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,160
So anyways, they said that this time it's very real.

488
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:14,400
Sony is dead serious about their online service and it's being designed to match the service

489
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,740
of Xbox Live and exceed it.

490
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,280
And they're going to be basically, as mentioned before, linking a lot of the PSP and PS3 stuff

491
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
together.

492
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Yeah, promises, promises. That's what I have to say about that.

493
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,800
Isn't that a little bit too much too late? I mean, Xbox Live has already established

494
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,720
themselves as like the definitive...

495
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,320
Well, but you know what? If Sony puts out something better, there's no reason they can't

496
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,120
take the crown, especially if their system works.

497
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,480
That's not necessarily gonna be their big thing, though, because, I mean, you can have

498
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,120
beta, which is better than VHS.

499
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,400
Yeah, basically their plan of, you know, fuck it, we don't need a plan, didn't really work

500
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,400
out too well with the PS2, so, gonna have to try it again.

501
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,720
And, and, oddly enough, wasn't Beta by Sony?

502
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,600
Something to think about there.

503
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,240
Let's move on, let's go over to DarkSakura, who likes to keep tabs on what's going on

504
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,960
overseas, because we love our listeners throughout the world, not just those here in America,

505
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,040
I mean, we love the America one, we love the Canada ones, and all the other countries, but

506
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,800
the UK doesn't get enough love from a lot of gaming things out there because they

507
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,360
get games late and stuff, it sucks.

508
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,640
So, DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK? Well,

509
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,040
actually the first thing we have up is that Daedal's doing a new

510
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,280
Xbox 360 hard drive.

511
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,080
It's supposed to be two inches square,

512
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,120
weighing four ounces. The drive will be able to store thousands of songs and

513
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:59,760
over 5,000 images. The idea is you can transfer MP3s from your PC to your Xbox 360 or whack

514
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,560
all of your JPEGs and use your TV to watch them all.

515
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:14,560
It's basically a 4GB USB drive that's shaped like the power button on the 360. And close.

516
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:23,640
They are actually giving a speculated price of 99 pounds.

517
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:31,520
Dark Planets is already taking pre-orders for 74.99, that's in pounds.

518
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,920
Also though, they still have not yet confirmed the price point, they are still working with

519
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,000
the distributors, but an official price will be out along with the release date next week.

520
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:54,240
about 150 us about 150 us also excuse me there is a very interesting bit of news

521
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,520
about dead or alive 4 it has basically removed a need for speed most wanted

522
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:09,520
from the top position and has taken number one basically it's you know it's

523
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,520
It's a pretty game, but I don't know how it got to be number one.

524
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,540
It's hard. I mean...

525
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,560
From what I saw about it, because I saw very little of it, because you know, Rob's

526
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:25,600
Xbox broke. Again, I say that Rob's

527
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Xbox broke. Thank you for the reminder. Appreciate it.

528
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,640
Also his Xbox broke. And so basically when I saw it though,

529
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,660
it did look really pretty, but I don't think I would ever play it.

530
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,380
you know whatever but it was pretty well they're saying though all across the

531
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:46,880
board on the top three titles in the charts are all on Xbox 360 also for

532
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,580
Xbox 360 exclusives have come into the top 20 for the first time since the

533
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:57,420
December 2005 launch we've got Call of Duty 2 we have project Gotham Racing 3

534
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:04,540
at number 7 there's also perfect dark zero that hopped up from 27 to be at

535
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:14,640
number 14 and Sega's condemned is also back in the top 40 so it's a coming in

536
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,480
actually number 18 they said but you know actually I thought condemned was a

537
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,920
really good game that should be higher up there but but honestly people are

538
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:34,240
liking what they're playing for those with working systems okay one other bit

539
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:42,580
news too, is that there are going to be no UK studio layoffs yet for EA even

540
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,600
though they are in development jobs. I heard about they were doing some layoffs

541
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,520
here in the US so probably has a lot of people over there on edge but not gonna

542
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,840
happen. That's what's looking like their UK studio is, I hope I say this right, is in

543
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,600
Chertsey. It looks like it's coming out without the job cuts that we're

544
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,640
all seeing over here in the U.S. The studio is supposed to be cutting off I

545
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:14,080
think 5% of their global workforce. There haven't really been any indications. One

546
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,000
of their spokespersons said that they cannot confirm that there's not any that

547
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,760
might come up. To go ahead and give the quote, every division is going through

548
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,840
evaluation. We're looking for, we're looking around the company to see how to

549
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,400
best align teams everywhere against what needs to happen for future growth.

550
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,840
which means we're giving you a non-committal answer, because we can. So far, about 350 people

551
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:50,440
were cut in the US, laid off from the Vancouver, Redwood Shores, and Tiburon jobs. The joys of

552
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,760
corporations. It happens, too bad. Well, I wish the UK employees a good bit of luck.

553
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:04,140
and then another bit actually a looks like February 17th Shadow of the

554
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:10,460
Colossus will be out in the UK it's a pretty neat game from what I understand

555
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,100
I haven't played it myself I didn't get too into it but it's kind of one of

556
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,460
those games try it out because it's it's kind of a polarizing game people either

557
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,100
really like it or they don't get it so you know certainly for those of you guys

558
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,820
who have been really wanting to check this game out you're gonna get a chance

559
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,960
so I good for opportunity I believe in choices so go for it

560
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,200
oh I'm you know I'm glad to see some of the releases finally filtering out

561
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,700
because there are some good games out there in fact speaking of releases

562
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,940
coming out February 2006 actually already out as of the third there's they

563
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,700
got alien hominid on the Gameboy Advance and I I needed to get that game I've

564
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,340
just been so busy but yeah good I'm coming out on the 10th breath of fire

565
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:56,900
3 for the PSP I love breath fire command and conquer the first decade also that's

566
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:04,440
on PC Dora the Explorer on GBA EA Sports Rugby 2006 full auto Xbox 360 Dora the

567
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:11,040
Explorer popular over there too I an early childhood I'm sorry I'm sorry if

568
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,880
she's popular there although it's a great Halloween costume I saw some Dora

569
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,840
Halloween's funny well they would only get Nickelodeon by satellite by sky

570
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,840
I don't know.

571
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I don't know.

572
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Oh, well.

573
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,680
Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Party 7, Space Invaders Evolution on the PSP, Star

574
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,400
Wars Empire at War on PC, Tales of Eternity on PSP, The Rub Rabbits on DS, what's that?

575
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
I have never heard it.

576
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
It must be something over there.

577
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
Dear UK listeners, please tell me what the Rub Rabbits are, thank you.

578
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,800
The Rub Rabbits would be the sequel to Fill The Magic.

579
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,960
Oh, I thought that had changed names.

580
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,100
I thought it was something really perverted. Where do babies come from?

581
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,960
Yeah, where do babies come from? You have bunnies! And last up,

582
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,160
totally spies for the Game Boy Advance. I,

583
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,320
however, am feeling very happy for our friends over there because on the 17th

584
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,440
they get guilty, Girisuka.

585
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,480
That game is cool.

586
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,000
Very, very cool. And Super Monkey Ball Touch and Go comes out on the 17th as

587
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,400
well.

588
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Alright. But I will be going more into detail

589
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,440
When the time comes all right

590
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,820
Loki do you have some release dates for the u.s.. Of course I do

591
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,940
Coming this week. I will be getting arena football the

592
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
football series that no one really watches

593
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,240
Put out by EA, but it's a nice budget. Tell a 29 99

594
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,400
We've got for those horse fans. Let's ride silver buckle

595
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,200
stables

596
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,160
Crappy game for the let's not game. We're in Resident Evil deadly silence coming to the Nintendo DS

597
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,880
which would be good. Rob Rabbits also coming to Nintendo DS. Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max

598
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,120
coming to the PSP. I love those Street Fighter titles. Tales of Legendia coming to the PS2

599
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,320
which kind of combines a fighting game and RPG in the one, which is really neat. And

600
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:03,360
of course our favorite company Konami, World Soccer winning 11.9 coming to PS2, Xbox, and

601
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,640
PSP. Later on the month, of course, we've got Drakengard 2,

602
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,000
Grandia 3, Mark Echoes getting up,

603
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,580
State of Emergency 2, which will be fun. Also dropped down to $29.99, which is

604
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,160
pretty cool.

605
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,320
Fight Night Round 3, really big boxing game.

606
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,460
Tokka Race Driver 3, which will be cool.

607
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,880
Exit, Sonic Riders coming to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube,

608
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,200
and then a bunch of other stuff as well.

609
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,740
Of course we'll cover those once we get closer to it.

610
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:38,840
Alright, lots and lots of stuff. We're starting to get back into it.

611
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,340
Summertime will be really big too. March is going to be a big month as far as stuff coming out.

612
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,440
Alright, stay tuned. Now you also have a little bit of a follow-up to something

613
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,560
DarkSakura talked about.

614
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:52,000
She was talking about DOA4's success over in the UK.

615
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,040
What's going on with DOA4? They're doing an update. There's going to be a patch

616
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,360
which is coming out in mid-February. What's going to be happening is they're going to be

617
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:06,800
kind of balancing some of the characters as well as fixing a bug with lots of save games.

618
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,400
And one of the rumors is going to be that they're changing the interface and adding

619
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,080
a new character.

620
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,760
One of the new characters that they're talking about here, well at least rumored, is going

621
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,500
to be a Taekwondo character.

622
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,560
Basically one of the things that they found out between kind of browsing some of the data

623
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,660
files on there, seeing a big section of characters missing, and just some other stuff.

624
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,420
So that would be something to look forward to coming mid-February.

625
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,780
Alright, sweet.

626
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:42,620
Something else that's going to be coming out soon, and this is according to Pacific Business

627
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:48,180
News, is that an online version of the classic puzzle game Tetris is going to be coming out

628
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,180
soon.

629
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,420
Now I'm kind of thinking, wait, don't we already have Tetranet?

630
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,700
I mean, why would you want to pay?

631
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,860
But here's the thing is that Tetris Online is going to allow people to do this game and

632
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,420
other casual games for just $3 a month.

633
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,140
So they're trying to put this at like a super low price point for folks to do this.

634
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:07,620
Still say though, you got Tetranet for free that's still out there, so it's going to have

635
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:11,540
to have some features to make this worthwhile, but I don't know if this is trying to ride

636
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,620
on the coattails of projected success for Tetris DS or what, but nevertheless this is

637
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,780
coming out soon.

638
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,640
Something that should be noted is that this is being funded by Henk Rogers, who sold his

639
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:30,620
interest in the Blue Lava wireless mobile phone company Jamdat in 2005.

640
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:37,060
That stock sale will net him another 108 million via Jamdat's upcoming sale to Electronic Arts.

641
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:45,260
His partner for Tetris Online will be former Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa.

642
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,560
So we'll see, good minds coming together, because the mobile phone Tetris is actually

643
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,540
pretty good for a mobile phone game, so promising things coming out of this, this may not be

644
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:00,220
your crappy Tetris knockoff, this could be pretty good, so we'll see, we shall see.

645
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:05,440
Actually I did need to make a statement on something, I did want to go and also correct

646
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:14,960
myself, I actually told you wrong regarding the subsistence, now I'm doing it, the subsistence!

647
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,240
We'll just call it Metal Gear 3 S. Subsistence.

648
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
That's alright.

649
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Mistakes happen.

650
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,140
Moving on, Loki, you sometimes look at what's going on in the hacking and cracking world.

651
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,880
What's been hacked now?

652
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,960
First thing is the original Xbox DVD firmware has been hacked.

653
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,460
Why is that important?

654
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,920
Well with the hacked firmware, the Xbox doesn't realize a game is burned or is an original

655
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
copy.

656
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,360
pop anything in there without a mod chip and it will run.

657
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:54,320
So that's something that's coming out and what's important about that also is the firmware

658
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,200
on the original Xbox is very similar to the firmware that's in the new Xbox 360 and they're

659
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,720
thinking that maybe they can break it the same way.

660
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,400
So that's interesting.

661
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,720
Moving on to more of a portable stance here, we've got Rise of the Triad coming out on

662
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,660
the PSP as a homebrew program, Rise of the Triad for those who might not remember was

663
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,360
a really cool game kind of followed up Doom, kind of wacky and a little bit had the dog

664
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,840
mode in there as well.

665
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,540
So if you want to check that out, PSP updates has a download for you for that.

666
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:34,340
Also for the Nintendo DS Linux, they actually have added Wi-Fi support which is pretty cool

667
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,340
there.

668
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,480
So if you've got a modded DS, definitely check that one out.

669
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,540
Also the PSP has some more functionality added to it.

670
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:50,840
Now they have a homebrew program to use your PSP as a universal remote and can control

671
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:57,220
most of the TVs out there as well as there's another program made later that week which

672
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:04,040
will use your PSP as a remote for your PlayStation 2 which is also cool.

673
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:13,720
And finally, one last thing here, P6, the shell coming to the Playstation firmware 1.5

674
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:18,860
has been released and that's actually kind of a new GUI that they've added and a lot

675
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,320
more functionality is going to be going into that as well so look for more updates from

676
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:28,080
us and also you'll probably hear some more things on PSP updates as well.

677
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:35,620
And finally, they've had some rumors about new firmware updates coming, which are going

678
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:42,780
to allow email and GPS to be added to the PSP's list of enhancements.

679
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,220
So email and GPS possibly coming later on.

680
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:47,220
Alright.

681
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,260
Sounds exciting.

682
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,300
Busy week for those guys over in the hacking world.

683
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,300
Alright.

684
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,100
We're going to be opening up our Skype line very, very soon.

685
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,700
We're almost done with the show, but we need to get feedback from you guys.

686
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,180
We want to hear what you guys have to say on tonight's story.

687
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:03,900
To call us, go to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us, or you can

688
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:09,060
pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.

689
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,520
I should point out, we also have voicemail there, so even if you're listening to podcasts,

690
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,300
you can call that number and leave us voicemail any time throughout the week.

691
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,220
But please note, that's not an 800 number, that's a local number to our area, so you

692
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,860
probably will be assessed a toll for the call, so please ask mommy and daddy if you don't

693
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,860
own the phone line.

694
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,860
You own the phone line.

695
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,860
Hey, do what you want.

696
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,820
All right, but we're going to be taking Skypline calls very soon, but since there's a bit of

697
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:36,300
a delay, before we go to that, we want to go ahead and announce tonight's listless winners.

698
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,700
Votes are in.

699
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:43,220
Remember, this is the Kingdom Hearts 3 world we would most like to see, and of course we're

700
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,900
living in a fantasy world.

701
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:48,620
It doesn't have to be Square or Disney related.

702
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,660
It could be anything.

703
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,660
So here it is.

704
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,500
The votes are tallied, and this is the definitive list through this highly scientific process.

705
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:03,500
Number three world most want to see the Zelda Ocarina of Time world is the number three world they most want to see.

706
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:10,500
The number two world the kids most want to see is the Doom world. They want to see them go to hell.

707
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:17,500
And the number one world as voted by our chat room, this is something that could actually happen too.

708
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,500
Chrono Trigger world is the number one voted answer there.

709
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:29,500
there

710
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,420
We'll see if we have interviews or not next week.

711
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,340
It's all time-pending stuff.

712
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,540
All right, let's go to the Skype line and hear from you guys.

713
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,460
So again, it's 916-226-9067, or you can call us on Skype.

714
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,900
Its username, OrangeLoungeRadio, is who you want to call.

715
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
Let's go to the Skype line.

716
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

717
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
Hello.

718
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,900
Hi, who's this?

719
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,900
This is Xander from Florida.

720
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Xander, you call us too damn much.

721
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,900
I know.

722
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:16,900
All right, well, what's on your mind this week?

723
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,180
Nothing better to do on Sunday night.

724
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,180
That's all right.

725
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,180
What's up?

726
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:25,900
I'd like to point out real quick and you're saying that Chrono Trigger could actually appear on Kingdom Hearts 3

727
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,540
It can't I know

728
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,500
Hypothetically, you know, they could do one of those like loophole things or you talking about it's a rights issue the characters they could

729
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,980
But Nomura won't

730
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,520
Final Fantasy strictly like background cameo stuff and Kingdom Hearts. It will never be a world

731
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,060
Look, they can do whatever they want

732
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,460
It's just that they they refuse to do it because they're bastard people. That's what it is

733
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,740
We can but they won't well

734
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,220
In our fantasy world they should is there there's there's nothing wrong with that

735
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,860
All right, okay, what else is on your mind Xander one quick thing

736
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:10,140
Do you have any idea where I could give everyone I mean any idea?

737
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,620
Do they still push new copies of that around on some of the import sites?

738
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:18,900
I don't know. I haven't I ordered one so so long ago that I don't know if they still sell this anymore

739
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,020
This is a ps1 title. So I would say probably your best bet's gonna be something like eBay

740
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:30,620
Don't be afraid don't don't be afraid to find it. Don't be afraid to try like yahoo auctions, but the Japanese one

741
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,380
Might be a good place to try

742
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:37,180
And yeah, you're gonna pay more money to get shipped over here. But you know, if you really want the game

743
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
I did that

744
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:43,540
and other suggestions you guys are saying saying maybe I don't know

745
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,220
I think it's gonna be hard to find his ps1 but if you want to ps2 title that's

746
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,180
similar you can always try mojib ribbon

747
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,220
but I don't know it's it's a it's very on

748
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,540
it different language intensive yeah it is it is it's just a different game as

749
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,260
well so I don't know but

750
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,620
it's it's close it's the closest thing you're gonna get so

751
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:07,260
I well good luck to use and are finding that if you find a copy let us know so

752
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,860
we can tell our listeners where you found it

753
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,860
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

754
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,620
No, all right

755
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:20,980
All right, Xander. Thanks for calling in. Take care. You too. Bye. Let's go to another call here. Hello. You're on orange launch radio

756
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,020
Hello. Hi, who's this?

757
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,780
Hello

758
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,740
It's general sigh I got the name there, but you're breaking up just a little bit, but go ahead and get your questions out

759
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,740
What's what's on your mind?

760
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:45,740
First and foremost, uh, I'm kinda angry at my computer, let me get...

761
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,140
Yeah we're kinda angry at your computer right now too because it keeps cutting you out,

762
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,100
we can't hear you buddy, um, I'm sorry buddy, I'm gonna have to let you go, you're just

763
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,380
gonna not there, sorry.

764
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:02,740
I think somebody should call in and say, and do the, how do you check the children?

765
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,100
We're gonna do one more call here. I don't know. It's it's all the net traffic's tied up because of the stupid Bowl. Um

766
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,080
Let's try going to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio

767
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:18,860
Obviously, you already know who this is. It could this be the legend of Zaku. Well, you're on the mark set aside ten minutes

768
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,860
What's what's on your mind Zaku?

769
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,940
Since I started that, you know, I started you know a weekend habit of just playing 2dx really drunk

770
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,180
I kind of need the kind of need suggestions of

771
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:37,200
liquors that would go great with that how old are you young man I'm 21 21 for

772
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,440
about over a month all right just wanted to make sure you're of age because we

773
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,400
can't encourage yeah if you're under toilet liquors that go good with playing

774
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,400
2dx yes Guinness I I do enjoy Guinness vodka hard liquors like you know

775
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,280
anything 40% take a shot of 151 and drop it in a glass of Guinness it's called an

776
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:05,980
Irish car bomb it's great but anyways also besides that why I mean I'm

777
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:11,520
surprised that they charge money for cell phone games even though as a person

778
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,120
who happens to make them for for a senior project in order to get out of

779
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,000
college I find it appalling and people charge what you know that companies

780
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,680
charged monthly for a damn game oh yeah I the monthly fees is a little bit now

781
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,680
I'm like okay well obviously you can charge money for a game because you know

782
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:32,860
That's how that's what funds these people's page. Yeah, but I mean, but I mean I thought I thought most games were just like

783
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:37,360
You know two three dollars and that was it but then they have the goal to charge you monthly

784
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,640
Yeah, the repeat things a little lame for the cell phones, especially when they're bad games

785
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,060
I know I know like companies like sprint that they charge like, you know

786
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,380
A certain amount of money for like a certain amount of time and then you have to keep paying it again

787
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,120
Don't buy them on the right scripting model. Don't support that crap

788
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,380
I don't if I see a game that they want to charge a monthly fee. I say screw it

789
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:04,500
I'm not gonna buy it. Yeah, they you know, they said certain certain phone, you know, certain phone phone providers and game

790
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,480
You know contract and contact

791
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,340
Content distributors do that sort of thing trying to milk money out of you know, people like myself who own nice and

792
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,440
Who nice cell phones when it when enough when enough people don't buy the game?

793
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:24,680
They'll get the message that that type of distribution system isn't working and people don't want to pay monthly ease for subpar cell phone games

794
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,000
Exactly. Where's my game? I probably might go open source

795
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,840
See, well, that's that's up to the programmer. All right anything else on your mind Zaku. Well, hopefully

796
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,080
We have a lot hasn't been touched up on supernova yet

797
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:45,440
But you know since location testing already happened and the next one is gonna be in in Illinois

798
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:54,520
I know, but what I'm hearing is that it's being delayed from boomers all the way to

799
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,160
the next location test because from what I hear right now is that they're trying to

800
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,800
fix the bugs that were found in the first location test.

801
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,000
Okay, good, good, sure, fix bugs, fine by me, I mean that's the idea of the location

802
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
test.

803
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,280
That's only what I'm hearing from other places.

804
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,960
It's a little bit of rumor at this point, we'll see, I'm sure the game will be fine

805
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,440
when it comes out, we'll see. Yeah, hopefully, hopefully. Alright, Zaku, time's up, I'm letting

806
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,600
you go, have a good one. Alright, bye. Alright, that was the Skype line, boys and girls. That's

807
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,440
all for you, the listener. That's how you do the Skype line. That's how we do it here

808
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,280
at Orange Lounge Radio. Alright, we're getting towards the end of the program here, but not

809
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:39,360
until we bring you one last story. Couple more stories. Oh yes, Loki, why don't you

810
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:44,580
start us off then, since you must have found some late additions here. I did. Everybody

811
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,860
loves making fun of Jack Thompson, but remember his modest game proposal?

812
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:51,140
Just when I thought we could go one week without that name.

813
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,300
Hey, I'm not talking about Jack Thompson, I'm talking about his modest game proposal.

814
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,860
And someone else finished one of their games for the modest game proposal.

815
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:02,900
It's called I'm Okay, a murder simulator.

816
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:09,140
And you can check it out actually at, unfortunately the website that was hosting it went down

817
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,100
so they have it mirrored here.

818
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:20,440
It's 67.15.42.30 slash I'm OK and you can check it out there.

819
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,440
It's a 12 meg download.

820
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:26,820
It has nice Super Nintendo looking graphics and you basically murder and murder and murder

821
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:31,320
and murder and lots of murdering and it's great.

822
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,300
So definitely check that out.

823
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:38,400
And finally for those people who are fans of Burnout, they're doing a promo now with

824
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,920
with the retail kiosk that you can find out there for the Xbox 360, where you can bring

825
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:51,080

826
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:58,120
going to be Xbox 360 themed, as well as a dashboard theme and gamer pic.

827
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,960
So check that out.

828
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,680
Just wanted to say, I got a quick tip here from a chatter, thank you Mike.

829
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,120
He says that japanvideogames.com has Vibribin.

830
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,680
So Xander, go take a look there, and hopefully you can get it.

831
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,680
And just to say, I've ordered through them?

832
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,680
Yeah, they're good.

833
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,120
I've bought Beatmania through them.

834
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,920
I've bought my Drummania through them.

835
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,560
Their prices usually tend to be very comparable.

836
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
Oh, no free advertising.

837
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
I'm not.

838
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:27,040
I'm just saying, as I don't want to misguide any of our listeners, and we have gone through

839
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,520
a number of importers among us, I would buy right at all costs.

840
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,440
They suck!

841
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:44,040
suck I know if we've they owe me $70 or you could fly to the country and buy it

842
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,800
there and take me with you I don't know if that's an option all right let's let's

843
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,800
get on to our last story tonight right Loki last story

844
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:55,420
Loki no more stories look I have no more all right good so dark Sakura this is a

845
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:01,200
good note to finish up on tonight what what's coming our way pretty soon well

846
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:10,640
this has to do with our good friend Itadaki of Team Ninja. Basically there was an interview

847
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:17,380
with Famitsu Xbox 360 regarding the Dead or Alive franchise where they spoke with Itadaki

848
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:26,320
about the delays. He did actually make an apology for the last minute postponements

849
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,420
that were going on over it.

850
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:36,980
Also though, there was a mention about DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2, since we had the

851
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:43,060
other one mentioned on the show.

852
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:47,640
But before I get into that, I am going to make a mention that there were plans to release

853
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:54,060
new outfits for the DOA 4 characters via the Xbox Live Marketplace, however, due to budget

854
00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:00,580
and staff issues they had to put that on hold that's where the bikinis went but

855
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:04,580
there is still interest in doing it but they may have to do that for a charge

856
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:11,620
interesting hmm also now as I was bringing up do a extreme beach volleyball

857
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:16,860
to Team Ninja is working on the opening and ending scenes for the game currently

858
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:26,660
implementing some changes to the original design, and there is not a release date being

859
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,660
mentioned.

860
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,940
He said it will be an action game, but that it won't necessarily...

861
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,900
They're also working on an action game that's not really gonna be in the Ninja Gaiden franchise,

862
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,900
but...

863
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:48,500
I'm sorry, I choked up for a moment, it said it will either be project progressive, thinking

864
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:55,220
about ninja guide and got y'all declined, no I'm still my allergies, but project progressive

865
01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:03,220
dead or alive code cronus or another title, he said the key word is interactivity, anything

866
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:10,700
that team ninja does, I have to say, team ninja in my esteem is up there with treasure,

867
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:15,360
pretty pretty game so put especially that do a forum on my xbox 360 you know

868
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,680
when it worked when it worked and on that note I think it's time to wrap up

869
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,080
tonight's program but we have to go around and get everybody's final

870
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,280
