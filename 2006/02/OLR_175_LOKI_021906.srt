00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello everyone, this is Loki, it is Sunday, February 19th.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,800
This is episode 175, part 1 of 3 episodes that will be coming out this week and next.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,660
Dark Sakura and Sky are out this week. Sky is on the East Coast cosplaying it up. And

4
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:39,900
Dark Sakura is off visiting relatives. Anyways, it's been a crazy week. I'll start off like

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,240
we start off every episode with telling you how my gaming week was. Basically this week

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,020
has been only one game and that game is full auto. I'm about halfway through the game and

7
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,220
what can I say so far? It is frustrating. The game is really fun. It does have a lot

8
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,800
of really good graphic elements to it, plus it combines both Twisted Metal and Burnout,

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,980
which are some of my favorite games.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,820
Definitely one of those games that you're going to need to have a lot of patience for.

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,540
It does get extremely hard towards the end of the game, and it's really, I've been yelling

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,240
and throwing controllers, so definitely something to think about, but one of the best ones for

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,380
the 360 so far.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,620
Anyways, let's start things off here.

15
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:32,180
First up, we've got some news here coming out from Capcom's Gamer Day and basically

16
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,540
this is kind of a press only event that they have here.

17
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,240
They've announced a lot of different games coming out this week.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,320
Let's start off here.

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,060
We've got Capcom's classic collection remix which is kind of a reiteration of the collection

20
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,620
that they had on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox now for the PSP.

21
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,460
One of the other games that we had coming out which is pretty sweet is Capcom Puzzle

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,800
World and it actually has a bunch of really cool games in it.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,460
The first one being Puzzle Fighter, one of my all time favorite games for the Playstation

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,260
2 and Arcade.

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,380
The other thing that they've got is Block Block and Buster Brothers.

26
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,540
So if you're a really big puzzle fan that's going to be one that you're looking for.

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,600
That's going to be coming out looks like on the PSP which is going to be pretty sweet.

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,540
One of my other favorites that came out of that is going to be the Power Stone collection.

29
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,560
Now for those of you who haven't played Power Stone, it's actually a pretty sweet arcade

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
game.

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
It came out in the Dreamcast for a little bit.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,760
They had a one and two.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,040
And it's a three on three, just slugfest basically.

34
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,560
You collect these different gems that make you super powerful and you can pull off different

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
moves.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,840
Well they actually are bringing out the collection now on the PSP, which is going to have ad-hoc

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,520
multiplayer as well as a bunch of minigames. So that's definitely going to be one to look

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,960
forward to. What was missing though was some of the bigger names in the games of course.

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,680
That would be Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4. Unfortunately those weren't looks like

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,960
ready at the time. They did have a big push behind their next gen games, Lost Planet and

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,540
upcoming mech assault for the Nintendo DS, or actually it's mech assault style shooter

42
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,320
for the 360.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,280
It's kind of neat, it's kind of a, it reminded me a bit of a Resident Evil with mechs in

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
there so it should be pretty sweet, and of course Dead Rising, the complete rip off of

45
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,360
Dawn of the Dead, but still going to be a pretty cool game.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,120
And finally, one of the last games, also an old time favorite, is Ultimate Ghosts and

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,660
Goblins, which is definitely a throwback to the original side scrolling game.

48
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,520
They've added a few different things this time.

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,880
You can actually use a shield and they have a magic system in there as well.

50
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,400
Should be pretty sweet.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,540
Definitely a lot of support for the PSP this time around and a couple 360 games, so worth

52
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,500
checking out.

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,020
Let's see, also another thing that wasn't really announced but they showed a little

54
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
bit of it.

55
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,940
Street Fighter II on Xbox Live, it's actually rumored to be coming out now on February 26th

56
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,220
and this comes to us from GameSpot actually and should be pretty sweet.

57
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,440
Definitely one of the best games on Xbox Live Arcade.

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,140
Now I'm not sure if that date's accurate but we should see you here pretty soon.

59
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,480
Finally to kind of coincide here with the Xbox Live stuff, we've got a few more updates

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,540
coming to some of the games that are already out.

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,540
One of them being co-op over Xbox Live for Cameo which should be interesting.

62
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm not sure how that's going to make the game any better but should be pretty fun anyways

63
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,320
and also some more multiplayer maps for Perfect Dark Zero which should be pretty cool as well.

64
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,980
That game I actually haven't even touched since I bought it but here it's a pretty good

65
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
game.

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,060
Now let's see here, some other stuff coming to the 360 later on, the first thing is going

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,140
to be Bomberman Act Zero, which is, you know, your favorite Bomberman type of game, except

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,180
this time he's basically on steroids and is taking it from a little cartoon character

69
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:18,180
to some hardcore first person Bomberman game. Definitely a different take on the whole series,

70
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:25,380
but should be pretty cool. Alright, now to kind of pull it back into what we used to

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,740
talk about, which would be a lot of music gaming, we have Guitar Hero, which is rumored

72
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,580
to be coming to the Xbox 360 as well.

73
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,100
That's right, Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.

74
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,280
Red Octane's Dean Ku told MCV, I think Guitar Hero would be a great game on other platforms

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,540
as a Playstation 2 and Xbox 360.

76
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,860
We're exploring other opportunities.

77
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,700
That sounds like a lot of rumor to me, but it should be still pretty interesting.

78
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,980
One game we do know that is coming out on the 360 is going to be Phantasy Star Universe.

79
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,620
It should be really cool.

80
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,620
actually going to be having where you can interact with the other consoles and be able

81
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,620
to transfer your character online.

82
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:12,540
Different stats are going to be saved on the Sega servers and should actually appear on

83
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,900
the 360 which is going to be a few months after the PS2 installment.

84
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,660
So definitely going to be another good MMO for the 360 since we don't have any right

85
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,700
Now we have Final Fantasy XI, which is going to be kind of borderline okay, more of a port

86
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,620
than anything.

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:38,120
So speaking of the 360, we do have some news regarding the Xbox shortages.

88
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,780
This time they are blaming the memory chip makers, and one in particular, Infineon, having

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,660
trouble making the right speed chips.

90
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,260
Peter Morra refused to blame any one particular supplier, but he did blame the shortages on

91
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,260
the component shortages. So, you know, take it as you want, but I think it's a big excuse.

92
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,900
Anyways, speaking of the 360 a little bit more, one of the interesting developments

93
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:09,280
that's actually come out of one of the recent edition of the Xbox Magazine is DirecTV coming

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,440
to the 360. What they're talking about is actually being able to download episodes on

95
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,800
to your 360 or possibly being able to use as a DVR, which they've actually were talking

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,600
about during this year's CES, so it should be interesting.

97
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm not sure if this is going to sell any more systems as it is, it's going to be hard

98
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
enough to manufacture the ones that they have.

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,680
Now speaking about delays, we've got to go to another system here, this one being the

100
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,040
GameCube, and the delay this time is going to be Twilight Princess, and unfortunately

101
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,940
you know it was supposed to come out back in November, now it was being pushed back

102
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,240
to May.

103
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,260
This time is going to be coinciding with the launch of the revolution and that's going

104
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,300
to be all the way into November again.

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,620
One whole year wait for this game.

106
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,860
Now that's really interesting that they're going to be launching a next gen system with

107
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,180
a current gen title, but it is official, you know, straight from the mouth of the head

108
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:17,300
of Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime, told, basically, this guy Jeff Knightley, that the long-awaited

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,780
GameCube title, Legends of the Twilight Princess, will be released this fall, and, you know,

110
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,620
one can only hope that, because of these rumored features that are going to be in the game,

111
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,020
we're going to be able to use the revolution controller for the sword and shield and that

112
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
type of stuff.

113
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,380
It'll be interesting to see, you know, the revolution's going to be, you know, definitely

114
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,200
a really good system and the fact that the price point is going to be cheap as well but

115
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,760
hopefully we're not going to see current gen stuff on this system and hopefully they are

116
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,340
going to be pushing the envelope a little bit.

117
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:53,620
Now speaking about the revolution, Tekko's first revolution game has been revealed and

118
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,500
the game actually is going to be sort of a mini golf affair.

119
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,620
Definitely interesting, it's coming out here.

120
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,660
Looks like the game's going to be entitled Pangya, and it's very interesting looking,

121
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,580
very current-gen looking though, but it's got an interesting cast of characters, and

122
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,780
I don't know what more you can do with a mini-golf game, but I guess you're sort of a hot-shots

123
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,420
golf type of game, so should be pretty cool.

124
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:29,260
Also on the Nintendo front, they've announced a web browser for the DS as well as a TV tuner.

125
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,240
The web browser is going to be based on Opera and will support most web features except

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,860
for Macromedia Flash, and it will be released in Japan in June for roughly $32.

127
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,780
Well, it's pretty sweet that it looks like they're supporting the DS with a web browser.

128
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,700
I really think that's going to be a good addition to it.

129
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Now, on the topic of Sony here, a few things were announced about the PS3.

130
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,200
The first being the PS3 online service to be called Sony Hub.

131
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,720
This service is supposed to mimic the service of Xbox Live and is supposed to be comparable

132
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,200
if not exceeding that of what is on Xbox Live.

133
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, we'll have to see about that since, you know, Sony's plan for action for their

134
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:22,280
online service has been very lacking, especially with the PlayStation 2.

135
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,020
Other things, you know, talking about Sony here, the PS3 is definitely not going to have

136
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,020
a hard drive.

137
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,700
Yes, a hard drive will be available, but not sold with the system.

138
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:37,740
They're mainly doing this to keep the cost down on the system, which right now, analysts

139
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,300
are saying is going to be upwards of $800 per unit.

140
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,820
Now whether this is actually going to be passed on to the consumer, that is, you know, us

141
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,180
to see, I guess, when it eventually comes out.

142
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:57,960
Now the main cost of the unit right now is the Blu-ray drive which is costing about $350.

143
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,160
No word on what the official price is, it's going to be when this thing launches but hopefully

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,560
it's not going to be too expensive.

145
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,360
One game though that is going to be coming out for the Playstation 3 and a favorite is

146
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,880
Hot Shots Golf V.

147
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,480
It is confirmed for the Playstation 3 and looks pretty sweet.

148
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,800
Don't know how well next-gen graphics are going to do for this game but still a really

149
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,460
fun game.

150
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,760
Now one thing we are going to be looking at though is seeing how well the system launches

151
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,680
and Sony is expecting shipments for the Playstation 3 to be in 2006 and they're definitely saying

152
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,520
that there's not going to be any shortages.

153
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,980
Well promises promises, we'll have to see though.

154
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,920
Now as far as other games coming out for the Playstation 3, you have your normal big hits

155
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,820
It's for the PlayStation SoCom.

156
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,700
The series is going to see its fourth edition for the PlayStation 3.

157
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,660
This is actually going to be at E3 this year.

158
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,240
Should be pretty interesting.

159
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,840
Of course, not a surprise to most people, God of War 2 is also slated for the PlayStation

160
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
3.

161
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,280
Whether it's going to be a launch title or not, that is to be seen.

162
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,840
It should be pretty interesting though.

163
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,080
Now as far as other next gen systems, one system that's going to be coming out eventually

164
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,480
is going to be the Playstation Portable 2 and Samsung says it's actually in the works

165
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
right now.

166
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,320
They're making more flash memory chips for it and it should be interesting that they're

167
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,600
saying that in addition Samsung is making flash memory hard drives instead of a UMD

168
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,560
player for the new PSP.

169
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,400
Now it'll be interesting to see if this is just rumor or if it's actually going to happen.

170
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,360
I know that especially with the larger memory chips, they've actually had problems with

171
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,320
piracy and stuff, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of.

172
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,680
Now I don't know about most of you people, but I know that my games tend to get scratched

173
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,300
pretty bad, and one of the things, you know, especially looking at the Blu-ray discs and

174
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,560
how they're in their own cases, that's going to be pretty cool, whereas you're not going

175
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,320
be able to scratch it as easily and also with the UMD I think it's a really good idea the

176
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,880
way they did that where you can't scratch the CDs as easily.

177
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,700
Well that might not be a worry coming soon.

178
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,860
There's actually a company called Scratchless that is bringing a brand new version of the

179
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,680
CDRs and DVD media to the market.

180
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,160
Right now they're working on technology that is a basically you can do anything with this

181
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,520
and you cannot scratch it.

182
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:40,200
They have a four micron layer of polymer that's being developed by GE right now, and there

183
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
is nothing you can do to scratch this.

184
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,860
And right now, with nearly a million dollars in funding, this should be coming to market

185
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,340
pretty soon in their own line of blank media.

186
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,360
Speaking of DVDs, there was a story this week about Ooey Bull and how he's fed up with the

187
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,560
the gamers and hating on his gaming movies. Well, mainly most of the internet he's fed

188
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,900
up with. Um, the dangerous thing right now is that a lot of people bash me without thinking

189
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,680
about the movies, he says. It's fashionable to hit on a weebull and this is what I don't

190
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,440
get. And I don't get why this comes so harshly from the game press. Well, maybe it's because

191
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,680
your movies suck ass. That's probably why. Now, one of the things he's also mentioned

192
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,400
in the article is that he might actually stop making video game movies. We can only hope

193
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:42,720
that this will actually happen. But, you know, it's not really a bad thing that games are

194
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,480
being made into movies. Of course, the Silent Hill movie is coming out right now, and it's

195
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,640
going to be a really awesome movie. Also, you know, with games being made right now,

196
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,000
that are more cinematic and more realistic as far as how violent and stuff they are.

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,240
It should be no surprise that they're passing a law in Utah that they're, you know, grouping

198
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:12,320
games in with porn, actually. Utah Representative David Hoge attempts to lump violent games in

199
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,040
with obscene pornography under law that has passed through Utah House Committee by a 7-2 vote.

200
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:27,680
Basically, the law defines the offending games as those featuring inappropriate violence

201
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,000
and lacking serious literary and artistic, political, and scientific value for minors.

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,200
Well, that's pretty vague, and unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be constitutional

203
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,560
and probably won't get put to place, but it'll be interesting to see.

204
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,560
Now speaking of porn, the strangest group of individuals to bash on Grand Theft Auto

205
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,840
has hit the news this week.

206
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:58,040
Prostitutes are actually calling for a ban of Grand Theft Auto based on the way players

207
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,720
can pick up prostitutes and then kill them and steal their money.

208
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,780
Apparently they didn't think too highly of that.

209
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,560
Now speaking of Grand Theft Auto, take two.

210
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,240
They're in more hot water as it is.

211
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,320
Take 2 is being sued by its shareholders in a class action lawsuit against Take 2 basically

212
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,200
for the loss of money due to the hot coffee incident and they're holding them responsible.

213
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,340
Speaking of bad news, EA is in shock as Black has been leaked to the internet.

214
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,560
That's right, the first person shooter that's going to be probably one of the best games

215
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,340
for February has leaked to the internet, not a huge surprise actually.

216
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,060
But what is a surprise is who they think the culprit is.

217
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,600
They think it's actually one of their employees that they just recently let off.

218
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,600
One of the 350 hardworking employees that stuck the proverbial knife in the back of

219
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
EA.

220
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,280
Well, it should be interesting.

221
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,520
Not too surprised though.

222
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,680
The game is slated to hit store shelves though at the end of February, so check it out if

223
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,160
you can legally.

224
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,240
Now on a more positive note, it was announced that Play is going to be seeing one of our

225
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,280
favorite artists out there, and that would be Akira Yamaoka.

226
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,800
He's going to bring Silent Hill Live to Play.

227
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,480
It's going to be actually featured at the Chicago venue.

228
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,200
He'll be accompanied by a full orchestra, and together they'll be performing a wide

229
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,440
selection of music from the Silent Hill series, including the theme of Laura.

230
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,440
So stay tuned.

231
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:42,340
If you are in the Chicago area, though, you can find tickets for that concert at play-symphony.com.

232
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,200
Also announced this week will be the World Series of Video Games with $1 million in cash

233
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,860
to be given away.

234
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,800
The competition will begin in Louisville, Kentucky at the Kentucky Exposition Center

235
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,300
from June 15th through the 18th, followed by four additional events throughout the year,

236
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,620
ending with the championships in December 2006.

237
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,580
Each event will span 3-5 days and will be open to the public and they'll be sponsored

238
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,440
by Xbox 360 and presented by Intel.

239
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,000
So it should be very interesting to see how big this ends up being.

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,820
And finally, I'm going to wrap up the podcast with my topic of stuff that I like talking

241
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,820
about and that would be the hacking and cracking world there.

242
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,480
Starting off with 360gamesaves.com, the website is open now and you can actually exchange

243
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,920
game saves from your 360 with the community online.

244
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,580
They have a FAQ online as well as how to build an interface to transfer those saves from

245
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,820
your Xbox 360 to the internet.

246
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,260
Other rumors are saying that you're going to be able to use this to share and possibly

247
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,740
pirate the Xbox Live arcade games.

248
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,620
Now of course they don't condone the piracy, but they do condone the sharing of the save

249
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,280
So, if you don't feel like beating your Call of Duty 2 or Need for Speed Most Wanted, definitely

250
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,540
check out the website.

251
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:08,520
That would be xbox360gamesaves.com or actually 360gamesaves.com is what you want to check

252
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
out there.

253
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,100
Now, of course, my favorite topic here, the PSP.

254
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,140
One of the games we do have coming out for the PSP is a long time favorite on the PC

255
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,020
and that's going to be the Myst series.

256
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,740
The first game is going to be put out there.

257
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,560
They're going to have bonus content in the form of new adventure scenarios as well as

258
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:34,060
updating the game's visuals for the PSP widescreen format.

259
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,420
No release date yet for that.

260
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,980
Speaking of the PSP, one of the brand new homebrew emulators that's been brought to

261
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,540
the scene is going to be an Atari Jaguar emulator for the PSP.

262
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:53,460
Yes, all of those Jaguar owners out there are probably so happy, all five of you.

263
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,580
Should be interesting though, right now the emulator is still very early in development

264
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,740
and doesn't exactly run many carts.

265
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,260
Now at this time of course we want to plug the Orange Lounge Radio PSP website, that

266
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,940
would be at OLRPSP.com and you can check out our podcasts on there as well as check out

267
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,920
the shout line we have on there, our nice little chat feature there.

268
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:25,100
Now of course if you're more into the instant messaging chat, you'll be happy to know that

269
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,480
AOL Instance Messenger has been brought to the PSP, that's right.

270
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:39,160
Go to www.aimonpsp.com and you'll actually be able to chat to all your AIM friends straight

271
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,420
on your PSP.

272
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,100
So definitely worth checking out.

273
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,900
And finally, everyone's favorite website this week has definitely been the Katamari Flash

274
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,940
game.

275
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,200
And if you haven't checked it out yet, then what the hell are you waiting for?

276
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,580
You need to go check it out right now.

277
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:06,700
It's going to be at katamari-demasi.jp slash qa underscore data slash katamari dot html.

278
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,740
So definitely check it out, see how big you can get the katamari there.

279
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,120
It's a lot of fun, at least waste a few minutes of your time.

280
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,640
And finally this week, though, if you're looking for some new games, it's a good week for you.

281
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,960
Got one of the biggest ones of the month coming out, Fight Night Round 3.

282
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,040
It's going to be coming out on the 21st here, so definitely check that out.

283
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,600
Especially on the 360, it looks pretty sweet.

284
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,160
And Sonic Riders as well is going to be coming out, a very good Sonic the Hedgehog racing

285
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
game.

286
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,120
simulator racing game Toka race driver 3 is going to be coming out and that game

287
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,880
is amazing you race from everything from big rigs to monster trucks to sprint

288
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,320
cars to even riding lawnmowers so definitely check that out if you're in

289
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,760
the racing games well that's it I hope you enjoyed the solo affair for the

290
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,840
orange launch radio episode 175 part 1 Scott will be coming to you guys

291
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,920
probably a little bit later this week more on Wednesday and Jamie on Sunday so

292
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:13,040
