00:00.000 --> 00:20.960
Today, February 5th, 2006, new details emerge on the PlayStation 3, do American games always

00:20.960 --> 00:27.960
fail in Japan and a special ode to Kingdom Hearts.

00:50.960 --> 00:58.400
host mr. ferret and that's it we fired the other two no just kidding say hello

00:58.400 --> 01:04.520
to dark Sakura Jamie summers I got a ferret me yes you do it would it send

01:04.520 --> 01:08.240
your burrito was the name of the fair in your burrito your burrito one night I

01:08.240 --> 01:20.440
fed my ferret some beer say hello also to z1 and only Loki hi how you doing bad

01:20.440 --> 01:24.440
Bad Rob! Bad Rob. Printer sucks.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.440
Let me set up a little background. I know we're a video game show, but let's face it,

01:27.440 --> 01:29.440
we gotta talk about our personal lives once in a while too.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.440
Okay, I just bought a cheap printer today because for work I'm going down to L.A. on Monday

01:35.440 --> 01:37.440
and I have to fly out at six o'clock in the morning.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.440
Well, I'm flying Southwest. You know how Southwest has those, like, boarding pass systems where

01:41.440 --> 01:45.440
depending on what time you print your boarding pass from the internet, you get an A, B, or C pass, right?

01:45.440 --> 01:48.440
So I bought a printer so I could have myself an A pass.

01:48.440 --> 01:53.880
Well, I screwed up. I thought you couldn't print your passes until after midnight and then like literally 30 minutes before the show

01:53.880 --> 01:57.280
I realized oh crap. You can actually print them up to 24 hours in advance

01:57.280 --> 01:59.880
so I'm hooking up the printer in this furious frenzy and

02:00.400 --> 02:05.840
Now the damn thing won't even print and Loki stuck over there because I have his computer frozen up with the boarding pass sitting

02:05.840 --> 02:13.080
Yeah, because because this wonderful printer that you bought didn't come with a black cartridge because that would have been too expensive and the prayers

02:13.080 --> 02:16.920
Like no, I don't want to prove that black cartridge. Fuck you. That's what it's saying

02:16.920 --> 02:22.440
So now I'm gonna have to leave that up and try to run and get a black cartridge after the show

02:22.440 --> 02:24.120
so I can have my stupid boarding pass.

02:24.120 --> 02:26.840
And here I brought Kingdom Hearts 2.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.880
I know, and I totally missed a chance to check it out before the show

02:29.880 --> 02:33.720
because I made a mistake in Southwest's stupidy-doopity policies.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.920
Maybe we could look at it during the break.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.680
I'm getting the look of disbelief, so...

02:36.680 --> 02:39.720
Yes. Oh, say hello to, joining us in our fourth chair tonight,

02:39.720 --> 02:42.280
say hello to somebody who also has a show here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.880
Say hello to Extofer.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.640
Hey, Rob Ofer.

02:45.640 --> 02:46.520
How you doin'?

02:46.520 --> 02:48.520
Not bad. And you?

02:48.520 --> 02:50.520
Good. First time on the podcast.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.520
My podcast debut.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.520
How you doing?

02:54.520 --> 02:56.520
I'm doing well. You asked me that.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.520
Already. But I'm well now.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.520
I'm a little flustered, okay?

03:00.520 --> 03:02.520
I'm under a tad bit of stress

03:02.520 --> 03:04.520
because now I'm like, shit, what if that boarding pass

03:04.520 --> 03:06.520
gets lost? I'm gonna cry.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.520
That would be funny. I mean, it would be sad.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.520
No, it would not be funny. Then I'd be stranded and my boss would murder me.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.520
Yeah, it'd still be funny.

03:12.520 --> 03:14.520
Anyway.

03:14.520 --> 03:18.840
let's not talk about my personal crisis is for a minute let's talk about

03:18.840 --> 03:23.040
our gaming weeks and how that's been going I'll start off with the lovely

03:23.040 --> 03:27.360
dark soccer with how was your gaming week I'm staring at the pretty precious

03:27.360 --> 03:30.800
I have in my hands Kingdom Hearts 2

03:30.800 --> 03:35.480
which I've been playing a little bit of enough to realize that Roxas

03:35.480 --> 03:39.720
sucks and that I'm glad that I don't have to use him the entire game

03:39.720 --> 03:43.280
um hmm it's gotta

03:43.280 --> 03:46.400
it's very interesting it looks very very pretty on my TV

03:46.400 --> 03:49.800
except it's still you know on the ps2 so it's

03:49.800 --> 03:54.840
got jagged ease all to hell and back but the CG scenes look really pretty

03:54.840 --> 03:58.880
I loves me some Kingdom Hearts yep

03:58.880 --> 04:02.800
I've also been playing lots of Animal Crossing of course

04:02.800 --> 04:06.720
and Dan picked up Maverick Hunter X

04:06.720 --> 04:12.160
the Mega Man X remake and it's pretty damn cool

04:12.160 --> 04:15.840
I mean it they completely redid the game for the PSP

04:15.840 --> 04:20.680
it's fabulous and also if you beat the game you get to get this little sorta

04:20.680 --> 04:24.040
OAV of how things led up to the situation

04:24.040 --> 04:28.020
that actually the dubbing in it is not horrendous which surprises the hell out

04:28.020 --> 04:28.500
of me

04:28.500 --> 04:33.680
it's very very well done I'm very pleased and then you can play as a

04:33.680 --> 04:35.680
The first guy that you fight

04:36.080 --> 04:39.320
Whose name eludes me at present, but he looks like Boba Fett

04:40.320 --> 04:43.840
And that's the Japanese copy video. Yeah. Oh the American one Wow

04:45.360 --> 04:47.360
and

04:50.080 --> 04:55.980
Maverick hunter Oh Maverick hunter am I yeah, I was wondering how I was playing it then

04:56.800 --> 05:01.440
Purchased at a GameStop. No, no. No, I was talking about Kingdom Hearts

05:01.440 --> 05:03.700
No, go back to the boarding pass Loki make it work

05:04.700 --> 05:10.460
What about Kingdom Hearts is that's the Japanese? Yes, this is okay. Okay. I'm up to speed. This is the Japanese one

05:10.460 --> 05:12.420
And how does that?

05:12.420 --> 05:14.420
How is that?

05:14.580 --> 05:21.460
Beautiful it was pretty but jaggedy. Well, yeah, I mean just you can understand it's it actually plays more like Devil May Cry

05:23.300 --> 05:30.060
In fact you want to play this game on as hard of a level as you can or you will not level up high enough

05:30.060 --> 05:36.740
to beat Zephiroth by the time you get to him because you have to fight and level a whole

05:36.740 --> 05:40.760
lot to do certain things in this game but also you don't get to see a lot of the really

05:40.760 --> 05:44.940
neat attacks if you're playing on the beginner mode because they all just die way too fast

05:44.940 --> 05:49.620
it's like hit dead explosion and then a chain reaction where the others die for you it's

05:49.620 --> 05:56.700
no so um I totally forgot the other games I played all week so because I played other

05:56.700 --> 06:05.800
stuff I play the crap load of puzzle fighter on my gameboy micro which when

06:05.800 --> 06:11.760
you're is sitting in a waiting room having your eye checked out after it is

06:11.760 --> 06:15.840
swollen from an allergic reaction to a dog which I will be getting to later on

06:15.840 --> 06:22.840
in the show and your eye is like in searing throbbing pain it's very hard to

06:22.840 --> 06:31.600
look at a gameboy micro screen I tortured myself for my art alright my

06:31.600 --> 06:35.120
eyes still looks like I got punched in it I didn't I didn't even notice I don't

06:35.120 --> 06:40.640
oh okay a little bit it's not it's not as bad as it was Friday because I looked

06:40.640 --> 06:46.280
like a Romero reject it was all like red bloodshot and then like that clear green

06:46.280 --> 06:52.820
that they only give zombies okay so yeah I look like a Romero reject which means

06:52.820 --> 06:58.140
we have to cut off her head no it's just you're nobody in this room is in any

06:58.140 --> 07:01.740
danger of me eating their brain oh that's that's refreshing thank good I'm

07:01.740 --> 07:06.960
glad yeah I love you guys all right we'll go over to extra fur how is your

07:06.960 --> 07:10.940
gaming week what kind of video games you've been playing this week um the

07:10.940 --> 07:17.340
only one that I've been playing is World of Warcraft and it's been pretty well

07:17.340 --> 07:22.140
what what kind of characters do you have in World of Warcraft I have a night elf

07:22.140 --> 07:26.140
a level 38 night elf

07:26.160 --> 07:30.160
on the Malfurion server. And I also have a

07:30.180 --> 07:34.180
level 29 druid on the

07:34.200 --> 07:38.200
spine breaker server that I've been playing with.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.220
And they are mucho fun to play with.

07:42.240 --> 07:46.240
How are the guilds that you've been joining up in the game? Lots of drama.

07:46.260 --> 07:50.260
I swear, I didn't know that all of this drama in

07:50.260 --> 07:54.100
the world of video games existed but there's a bunch of drama queens in World of Warcraft

07:54.100 --> 08:00.300
totally like like I I got invited to a guild not too long ago on the spinebreaker server

08:00.300 --> 08:05.180
and they the leader kept on giving me gifts or whatever like giving me you know he was

08:05.180 --> 08:12.300
enticing me with gifts and suddenly like last night I'm playing and I knew that there was

08:12.300 --> 08:16.980
a little bit of drama it didn't have anything to do with me or anything like that in the

08:16.980 --> 08:21.540
guild and two people were kicked off recently and then the leader himself

08:21.540 --> 08:25.940
left the guy who invited me so I'm like you know I didn't even talk to anybody

08:25.940 --> 08:29.660
really on that guild anyway and the guy the only guy I talked to was the guy who

08:29.660 --> 08:35.900
was giving me things so I was like you know screw this guild and I left and

08:35.900 --> 08:41.580
then Shane invited me to his or Miklotov which you guys all know yeah he was here

08:41.580 --> 08:50.000
last week um and stuff exciting all right um Loki do you want to stop

08:50.000 --> 08:53.160

08:53.160 --> 08:59.880
hmm no but yeah I will okay I've been played too much I played Ridge Racer 6

08:59.880 --> 09:06.280
a lot as well as some more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and a little

09:06.280 --> 09:10.920
bit of Animal Crossing and that's pretty much it didn't play too much Call of

09:10.920 --> 09:17.840
Call of Duty, really busy week so, lots of Ridge Racer though, I love that game.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.560
I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight if you can't tell.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.880
Haven't you had an off week?

09:22.880 --> 09:25.840
Kinda, you know there's more drama, let me talk about my gaming week because there's

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
a lot more drama.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.560
Yeah, what games have you not been playing Rob?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.320
That would be anything on the Xbox 360.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.240
Oh wow, what happened?

09:32.240 --> 09:37.380
Let me talk about what happened, I got my Xbox 360 this week, I did, I finally found

09:37.380 --> 09:41.960
the Xbox 360 I used the Best Buy locator thing that we talked about on the show

09:41.960 --> 09:46.320
a couple weeks ago and I found out that a Best Buy had the Xbox 360 in stock so I

09:46.320 --> 09:50.240
ran over there to Best Buy and they were out of premiums already at that point

09:50.240 --> 09:54.780
but I managed to score myself a core system yes so I bought a core system and

09:54.780 --> 09:58.440
the the clerk was really nice and she gave me it was really weird like she had

09:58.440 --> 10:01.800
little slips of paper that had core written on it and the managers signature

10:01.800 --> 10:06.120
and I had to take that up to the counter to get one of the core systems unlocked

10:06.120 --> 10:10.440
out of the gate and get my little core system to take home and play. So, you know,

10:10.440 --> 10:19.080
cool. And I picked up Cameo, or Cameo, I want to say Cameo, Cameo, and Dead or Alive 4.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.740
So I got all that and I went home and I had a pretty good time with the Xbox 360.

10:22.740 --> 10:27.500
I was playing Cameo a little bit. It's not quite the game I was expecting,

10:27.500 --> 10:32.820
but it was, it was okay. It's kind of fun, I guess. It's a, it's a decent launch

10:32.820 --> 10:35.660
title. It's a solid launch title. Then I was playing a lot of Dead or Alive 4,

10:35.660 --> 10:40.580
That game was very sexy and you know lots of it's it's a beautiful looking game has lots of boobs

10:40.580 --> 10:47.180
It does it has lots of boobs and the environments are huge. I love the stages in that game. It's so great

10:47.180 --> 10:53.180
It's it's almost like free walking anywhere. I like the Mexican wrestler. Does he have boobs? She knows she

10:53.760 --> 10:59.600
Yes, I like the all-american girl with the the the huge knockers. Yeah, Tina

10:59.600 --> 11:05.080
I like her she was my favorite and her dad Hulk Hogan my my best my best character though was the geisha

11:05.800 --> 11:11.960
Kokoro or whatever. She's she's the best her name means heart. That's right. So I'm the game they all had mega boobs

11:11.960 --> 11:16.960
Yeah, they all have mega boobs. It's awesome. So anyway dead or alive for awesome. So pretty but um

11:17.840 --> 11:25.280
Here's here's the problem is that oh and I download stuff on Xbox arcade to like joust which was awesome

11:25.280 --> 11:28.580
I played Joust co-op online in battle, that was fun.

11:28.580 --> 11:33.160
And I played, what else did I download on there?

11:33.160 --> 11:38.720
Oh, Geometry Wars, which was a lot of fun too, you know, just like what everybody says.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.420
That was all on Wednesday, I got the Xbox 360 on Wednesday, and Thursday I played a

11:42.420 --> 11:43.480
little bit of it too.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.480
I went to my friend's house for a little bit on Thursday because he just moved into a new

11:46.480 --> 11:47.480
place.

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
He was like, Rob, come over and see a new place.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.040
I was like, okay, so I went over and we, you know, had dinner and stuff, and then I came

11:51.040 --> 11:54.120
home and I'm like, okay, I want to play a little bit of Joust before I go to bed, so

11:54.120 --> 11:59.260
So I power up the Xbox 360 and something doesn't look right on it.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.220
It's flashing red.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.060
Like one of the little lights in the lower right hand corner is flashing red.

12:04.060 --> 12:11.680
I look at the TV and it says, System Error, Contact Microsoft Support, Code E74.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.460
And I was like, the fuck?

12:13.460 --> 12:14.460
I just bought this thing.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.660
What the hell is wrong with it?

12:16.660 --> 12:20.700
So I said, okay, you know what, maybe I just, maybe it's just a bad time, I'll just let

12:20.700 --> 12:21.700
it rest.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.700
I'll try it again.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.700
So I let it rest.

12:23.700 --> 12:27.900
unplugged all the cords replugged them all back in still didn't work I thought

12:27.900 --> 12:31.320
okay maybe my systems not getting enough ventilation so I'll put it out in the

12:31.320 --> 12:36.100
open okay unplug all the cords totally re-situate my Xbox 360 plug it back in

12:36.100 --> 12:41.540
still doesn't work okay maybe my Xbox 360 is just being moody so I said okay

12:41.540 --> 12:43.860
fine I'll try this again Friday when I get home from work so I tried again

12:43.860 --> 12:49.660
Friday when I get home from work still nothing still broken not even a day and

12:49.660 --> 12:57.500
and a half after owning my xbox 360 it broke and it has not worked since this is not this is not

12:57.500 --> 13:02.220
one of those like reading it on the internet where oh look at some poor schmuck who their xbox 360

13:02.220 --> 13:08.860
broke right off the bat it was me me my xbox 360 broke and i didn't do anything to it i didn't move

13:08.860 --> 13:11.500
it between the last time i played it because i went to a friend's house came back and powered

13:11.500 --> 13:15.740
it on the same place it was there was nothing possible i could have done to break the system

13:15.740 --> 13:23.100
But you're a coke spilled on it. No, not even that don't and also the lemonade. No, nothing when I say lemonade. I mean

13:23.860 --> 13:25.860
Stop it anyways

13:26.380 --> 13:28.380
No, I was just gonna say, um

13:29.180 --> 13:34.220
You know, we're here when it all I know I know and your reaction was priceless because you were laughing

13:34.220 --> 13:39.900
I was like, I thought you would be just like, you know scary, you know moody Rob

13:39.900 --> 13:44.800
But you were actually like I can't believe this. I think it was disbelief or something like that you're like

13:45.680 --> 13:47.300
Because like most of you out there

13:47.300 --> 13:48.780
I'd read the stories on

13:48.780 --> 13:55.420
Joystick and dig and Kotaku about you know oh these poor bastards their s box 360s broke right after they bought them and

13:55.900 --> 13:57.900
happened to me

13:58.420 --> 14:02.760
And now you have to wait for a box yeah, so I called so I didn't know what to do

14:02.760 --> 14:04.300
I'm like okay. Do I take it back to Best Buy?

14:04.300 --> 14:07.100
Well, what the hell are they gonna do they don't have any more Xboxes to give me

14:07.100 --> 14:11.300
there's still the shortage going on. So I called Microsoft and I sat on the line

14:11.300 --> 14:16.100
for you know a good 10 minutes and some rep came on the line and said yeah you

14:16.100 --> 14:19.300
know you have a hardware error I'm like I can see that on the screen that says

14:19.300 --> 14:23.820
it's a hardware I'm like I didn't do anything to this he's like well I think

14:23.820 --> 14:26.500
like the only thing you're really gonna be able to do is send it back so we can

14:26.500 --> 14:29.860
take a look at it and you know work on it and the whole process takes a week

14:29.860 --> 14:32.980
because obviously they have this thing down to a science right now you know

14:32.980 --> 14:35.780
they're fixing these broken Xboxes because apparently there's a ton of them

14:35.780 --> 14:40.580
out there so I'm now waiting for a box to come to me from Microsoft so I can

14:40.580 --> 14:48.860
send back my Xbox 360 so everybody out there do not play with the box no I take

14:48.860 --> 14:53.860
what happened to me it's a lesson honestly think twice before you buy an

14:53.860 --> 14:59.020
Xbox 360 because obviously Microsoft has tons of issues right now I'm sorry if I

14:59.020 --> 15:03.740
sound a little bitter but I am because I spent like $500 my hard-earned money on

15:03.740 --> 15:08.420
this system and the cords and the games all that garbage for nothing the damn

15:08.420 --> 15:12.420
thing broke you know and I'm sure it says oh you know oh well you know it

15:12.420 --> 15:15.340
happens that's what happens with a first-gen system Rob you should have

15:15.340 --> 15:19.820
waited until you know it was a second wave no Microsoft shouldn't have put

15:19.820 --> 15:24.340
this stupid system out on the market until the damn things worked and

15:24.340 --> 15:28.420
technically it is a second wave or third wave or fourth wave yeah exactly right

15:28.420 --> 15:33.220
now they've had how many months how many months I did nothing I I'm an

15:33.220 --> 15:37.420
intelligent gamer I've been playing games since god knows when I know what

15:37.420 --> 15:41.220
to do and what not to do with the system I know do not put a new system don't put

15:41.220 --> 15:44.780
it on top of other things he can't ventilate I didn't do anything bad with

15:44.780 --> 15:47.020
the system the system was faulty from the start

15:47.020 --> 15:50.220
although I'm wondering though if it's not just something simple wrong with it

15:50.220 --> 15:54.940
because usually it's the three lights flashing that's bad one light flashing

15:54.940 --> 15:59.300
I'm not sure you know it's kind of like code red code yellow the person

15:59.300 --> 16:01.620
Microsoft didn't want to tell me what it really meant they just said it was a

16:01.620 --> 16:04.340
hardware failure, send it back. So that's what I'm going with.

16:04.340 --> 16:11.380
Oh crap, we put original Microsoft motherboard in there. Ugh! Stupid! No, I don't know.

16:11.380 --> 16:17.800
But, yeah. I'm sorry, we can't divulge what errors, what's wrong with your system.

16:17.800 --> 16:23.300
So you'll have to forgive me, if I sound a little bitter about the Xbox 360 stories tonight,

16:23.300 --> 16:24.620
excuse me, but I think I have a reason to be.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.420
I think you saved up your moodiness for tonight.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.820
I did. Well now, and this whole printer malfunction thing just has me even more on edge with the

16:30.820 --> 16:37.060
thing but you get for rearranging my stuff shut up I'm not in a good mood now

16:37.060 --> 16:49.120
angsty hate rage fire burn comfort slash burninate Microsoft I'm so mad maybe I'll

16:49.120 --> 16:52.840
be in a better mood once the damn things fix I'm going out of town tomorrow so I

16:52.840 --> 16:59.680
said that's what you get for playing with the box let's move on to some

16:59.680 --> 17:02.820
gaming news let's talk about something else I want I don't want to open with an

17:02.820 --> 17:07.440
Xbox 360 story tonight because I'm a little pissy so I want to open with

17:07.440 --> 17:10.840
something else so somebody give me a story on something else Loki please tell

17:10.840 --> 17:20.760
me you have a story not related to Xbox 360 so anyways with the 360 no anyways

17:20.760 --> 17:26.880
no we do have a story talking about the revolution and it's low low prices so

17:26.880 --> 17:31.380
crazy anyways um analysts say that the revolution is supposed to be priced

17:31.380 --> 17:36.380
between 200 and 250 which is pretty cool kind of what we already figured though

17:36.380 --> 17:44.660
anyways of course revolution will be launched likely by November so looking

17:44.660 --> 17:50.400
good especially since all the other systems other costs over you know $400

17:50.400 --> 17:54.740
so that's not good or you know $299 for a core system that doesn't even come

17:54.740 --> 17:57.300
with the frickin' chords that I need for my T.P.

17:57.300 --> 18:01.260
Yeah $299, but you need a lot of stuff in order to.

18:01.260 --> 18:08.140
I love how only with the core system do you get the ever rare composite cables minus the

18:08.140 --> 18:09.140
S-video.

18:09.140 --> 18:13.780
If you want S-video, you gotta pay another $29.99.

18:13.780 --> 18:14.780
Not happy.

18:14.780 --> 18:15.780
Go Microsoft!

18:15.780 --> 18:16.780
Not happy.

18:16.780 --> 18:21.660
I'm sorry, if I sound anti-Microsoft tonight, usually I try to be very unbiased when it

18:21.660 --> 18:25.660
comes this whole thing and I you know and I would say overall our listener

18:25.660 --> 18:29.220
base you know because I'm watching the chat room over orange on radio.com click

18:29.220 --> 18:33.080
on chat and our listener base usually they dog on Microsoft I don't see too

18:33.080 --> 18:37.340
many people dogging on Sony or Nintendo and usually I stick up for Microsoft and

18:37.340 --> 18:40.820
I say you know what let's be fair to all the systems and Microsoft does that set

18:40.820 --> 18:43.740
up tonight you know free rein bash Microsoft I want I don't care I'm

18:43.740 --> 18:51.980
turning a blind eye to it. I don't care. Jamie, do you care? Let him have him. Let him bash

18:51.980 --> 18:57.300
Microsoft tonight. I don't care. What? Mine works. I don't care. Mine doesn't. Therefore

18:57.300 --> 19:01.680
I'm angry. Does yours work too, Logie? I bring mine to work every day. Should I open my wound

19:01.680 --> 19:07.120
a little more so you can pour some more salt in there? I toss my boxes inside of a bag

19:07.120 --> 19:10.480
out there and I actually, you know, bring it and toss it in the back of my car every

19:10.480 --> 19:15.760
day and, I don't know, it was one of those rare cases that it worked.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.400
I'm going to stick that fucking ferret in the box.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.400
No you're not.

19:19.400 --> 19:20.400
I'm going to put Senor Burrito in the box.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.240
Well I don't get how they don't know what's wrong with it and they're supposed to be spending

19:22.240 --> 19:24.720
more time on quality control.

19:24.720 --> 19:29.720
I don't know if maybe Joe quality control was taking a break when your Xbox came down

19:29.720 --> 19:30.720
the line.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.360
Maybe he was taking a piss and that's why Rob's Xbox doesn't work.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.320
It worked for a little bit.

19:35.320 --> 19:40.000
Here's what I don't get about the Xbox problems is they'll, you know, you'll be playing this

19:40.000 --> 19:44.720
system fine you shut it off okay everything's peachy you know you come back it doesn't turn

19:44.720 --> 19:50.400
on what you know it's like the xbox can't break itself when you're not playing it i mean that's

19:50.400 --> 19:59.360
really stupid just know that um you're supposed to watch water sports on the tv with your xbox 360

19:59.360 --> 20:07.200
not actually use your xbox 360 you know in the in the whole uh let's let's water sports

20:07.200 --> 20:10.720
Just I'm derailing your joke. Let's see some of the fury in the chat room

20:10.720 --> 20:13.260
Let's see if I have any supporters in chat right now. I'm looking at chat room here

20:13.260 --> 20:20.140
Let's see that the dark knight says Rob it had Windows 3.1 in it. Maybe I don't know. Let's see

20:20.880 --> 20:25.780
What do we have? We have Rini says in communist Russia 360 breaks you

20:28.400 --> 20:29.880
Yeah

20:29.880 --> 20:36.160
Here the George Bush runs on Windows jaded 2006 says actually I'm only biased to Microsoft and tonight

20:36.160 --> 20:42.880
I don't care fine. Go ahead be my ever slip more towards Microsoft Dark Lion xvi says that's why I never buy anything Microsoft. Oh

20:44.920 --> 20:50.160
And now here we go here we go I'll see now now Tony is saying I will dog on Sony and

20:51.040 --> 20:53.260
says luminous overrated

20:54.280 --> 20:56.280
PSP square button her

20:56.640 --> 21:01.080
Rini also wants to know does sky have a period tonight if I do I have a good reason

21:01.080 --> 21:06.080
He has PMS all the time. Just don't read too much into it.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.080
Rob has PMS, putting up with Microsoft shit.

21:09.080 --> 21:11.080
There you go! Thank you! Bravo!

21:11.080 --> 21:16.080
I shake your hand, lady. That's the smartest thing ever said on this show.

21:16.080 --> 21:20.080
Hey! I've said plenty of smart things.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.080
No, it's the smartest thing ever said on this show.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.080
You need to listen. You need to get that Microsoft out of your ears and listen to me a little bit.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.080
Oh, I can't hit you with that.

21:27.080 --> 21:32.600
It's Kingdom Hearts and it's it's the the prettiest thing I have right now. Yeah, you don't want to get it

21:33.200 --> 21:38.620
What with all the with Rob brains? Yeah with all the blood coming out of his vagina. Let's move on

21:39.760 --> 21:45.280
Dark Sakura speaking of Sony. Why do why do we invite you on this show extrovert?

21:45.280 --> 21:47.280
We know it's gonna go down the toilet

21:47.320 --> 21:52.160
Because we need so every so often we need bleached asshole here tonight. I don't care. I don't care tonight

21:52.160 --> 21:58.000
Rob is a mister PMS apathy. Let this be a bad show. It'll match my mood. I don't care. All right. Hey

21:59.120 --> 22:03.760
Dark quality show save us save us and make this a quality show with a good story on Sony

22:04.480 --> 22:06.480
Sony and Microsoft recently Oh

22:11.280 --> 22:16.000
Okay, so basically we've got news about the ps3

22:16.880 --> 22:18.440
Yay

22:18.440 --> 22:23.240
Hooray ps3 my butt anyway. Does it work? That would be exciting news

22:23.680 --> 22:29.680
Well, we will be hearing interesting things about the current dev kits, but that's coming up in a little bit

22:31.320 --> 22:35.360
They're making a new online service called the PlayStation Network

22:36.200 --> 22:37.560
that's

22:37.560 --> 22:42.100
Supposed to take basically what Xbox Live is doing and take it another step

22:42.600 --> 22:47.800
There will be an iTunes like store that you can download films and music

22:47.800 --> 22:51.800
You can use the console as a location-free player.

22:51.800 --> 22:58.800
So you can upload stuff from your PS3 onto your PSP and watch Blu-ray and DVD movies on your handheld.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.800
Also, the PS3 will act as a digital video recorder.

23:03.800 --> 23:08.800
You can save your television programs like you would with TiVo.

23:08.800 --> 23:13.800
You also would be able to control the DVR function using your PSP.

23:13.800 --> 23:21.080
As announced earlier you will it'll play blu-ray, but that's not gonna really affect the price all that much. It's supposed to

23:22.560 --> 23:26.360
They said that the cell and RSX we're gonna be able to take care of most of it

23:26.360 --> 23:31.240
So instead of paying the big prices you would for just a blu-ray machine

23:32.800 --> 23:35.960
Instead you're just gonna pay pretty much top console price

23:36.840 --> 23:42.680
Where you're looking at, of course that we haven't gotten an official word on what exactly that price is going to be

23:42.680 --> 23:47.820
The other couple of things is that the dev kit was running faster than they predicted

23:47.820 --> 23:56.320
and that there are a bunch of games in development that they're putting out publicly for now.

23:56.320 --> 24:02.720
Also the PS3 should be getting regular firmware functionality updates like the PSP does.

24:02.720 --> 24:07.700
You know, one thing nice I'll say about Microsoft for the 24 hours or so that my system worked,

24:07.700 --> 24:12.000
I actually really liked how you could go online and download trailers because I have a high

24:12.000 --> 24:17.920
high-def TV, so I downloaded the X-Men 3 trailer and the Mission Impossible 3 trailer and watched

24:17.920 --> 24:20.360
on the TV, and I thought it was beautiful.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.760
And there's no pixelation or anything, I thought it was great.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.040
So hearing that Sony is developing something similar, especially when you consider that

24:27.040 --> 24:31.120
Sony also has a major movie outlet and stuff with their iTunes-style store, that sounds

24:31.120 --> 24:32.120
pretty exciting to me.

24:32.120 --> 24:37.040
There's also another thing that was stated, which a few people I'm sure should find exciting.

24:37.040 --> 24:42.680
Today, US developers have been told to prepare for a fall release.

24:42.680 --> 24:47.760
So it should be sometime this year, which means that everywhere else in the world will

24:47.760 --> 24:54.000
have to wait until, what, summer 2007, while Japan has been playing it for, you know, most

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
of the year.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
Loki, do you have anything to add to this story about PlayStation 3?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.960
Yeah, we'll be lucky to see it this year.

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
Really?

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
What makes you say that?

25:02.960 --> 25:05.480
They don't have any of the dev kits out yet.

25:05.480 --> 25:11.320
They're especially not the alpha kits or the beta kits, so it's gonna be a while before we see this thing

25:11.320 --> 25:14.680
I'm gonna be guaranteeing that you're not gonna see anything playable at E3

25:15.080 --> 25:20.900
So really you think so I think so and the only thing that I can say about it right now is

25:21.280 --> 25:26.600
If you really want to you'd be still taking they're taking pre-orders on the ps3 games right now retailing around

25:27.920 --> 25:29.920
$59.99 like all the other 360 games

25:29.920 --> 25:35.020
games. People need to realize that just because it's a new console system does not mean that

25:35.020 --> 25:42.020
they need to pay $60 per game for stuff. Just wait a couple weeks and it'll go used.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.920
Any other comments on Playstation 3? You guys excited or you know, just...

25:46.920 --> 25:50.440
I'm trying not to be excited. I'm containing my excitement.

25:50.440 --> 25:55.360
I wish it would come out this year. I mean, the longer they wait, it's kind of... But

25:55.360 --> 25:59.000
you know what? Here's what I've learned. If they'll release a system that works, it's

25:59.000 --> 26:06.300
worth the wait. Here's the race, which will come out first. PlayStation 3 or Advent Children?

26:06.300 --> 26:10.360
I don't know, I don't know. Alright, let's go to a completely different topic. Oh, look!

26:10.360 --> 26:15.040
Look, I got a Microsoft story! I'm so excited! Actually, not really, because it's cross-platform,

26:15.040 --> 26:20.040
so I'll be... I'm specifically addressing the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of Final

26:20.040 --> 26:27.880
Fantasy XI tonight. And Final Fantasy XI recently had this big crackdown on guild sellers.

26:27.880 --> 26:32.140
The other day, folks logged in and noticed if you did a scan of some of the very popular

26:32.140 --> 26:39.400
regions where folks usually are doing their gill farming, such as Kuftal Tunnel, because

26:39.400 --> 26:46.680
that's an area where you can camp Amamet, but there's this monster you can camp there

26:46.680 --> 26:49.160
and the item that drops, you sell for millions.

26:49.160 --> 26:54.460
That's how gill farmers essentially make their money is that they camp these things exclusively

26:54.460 --> 26:58.380
and then drive up the prices of the items that they drop at the auction house, so that's

26:58.380 --> 27:00.040
how they get all their gil.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.800
And this has been a rampant problem in Final Fantasy XI, practically a couple months after

27:03.800 --> 27:07.520
I started playing this was already an epidemic, so I'm kind of looking at this going, gee

27:07.520 --> 27:10.840
I left the game a few months ago and now they're finally cracking down on this stuff?

27:10.840 --> 27:13.960
You know, things that could have been done yesterday, I don't know if it's because of

27:13.960 --> 27:18.800
the impending Microsoft roll out that they thought, oh maybe now's a good time to kind

27:18.800 --> 27:23.120
of pay attention to what's going on here, or maybe with the expansion, or I don't know

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
what.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.480
hear about it at their upcoming expo, but they finally banned all these guild sellers

27:27.480 --> 27:33.440
and good riddance, they were screwing up the economy, it's about time, too little too late

27:33.440 --> 27:36.480
in my opinion though, not enough to get me back to the game, sorry.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.880
Still glad I quit.

27:39.880 --> 27:45.580
In other Final Fantasy XI news though, and relating to the expo 360 version, the beta

27:45.580 --> 27:51.840
will be ending in April-ish, right around the time that the new expansion is about to

27:51.840 --> 27:58.200
So it's set to launch April 18th in North America April 20th in Japan and they're saying the beta will end

27:58.520 --> 28:02.040
Probably about a week before that rolls out. I did hear before my birthday

28:02.040 --> 28:06.600
I did hear rumor though that they would the beta players would be able to transfer their characters over

28:07.560 --> 28:11.480
Well goodie for them. We're gonna be cool, but I'm not gonna buy it

28:11.480 --> 28:14.360
I would have loved to participate in the beta, but I can't right now

28:14.360 --> 28:16.960
You know want to know why want to know why I know why?

28:17.560 --> 28:20.360
the other thing is the beta signups are over so

28:20.360 --> 28:23.360
There's double reasons. You're double screwed.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.860
Hooray. It doesn't matter, you didn't miss out on anything, you just

28:26.860 --> 28:31.360
loaded up and you're like, wow, it's exactly like the other one on the PC and on the PlayStation 2.

28:31.360 --> 28:35.360
I wanted to see it on my pretty high-screen, or high-screen, high-death

28:35.360 --> 28:36.360
widescreen

28:36.360 --> 28:40.360
TV. If you want. I mentioned I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.660
I can hook mine up, you know. I don't care anymore. No, I don't care anymore.

28:43.660 --> 28:46.860
Alright.

28:46.860 --> 28:51.620
Moving on, let's go to another story.

28:51.620 --> 28:54.780
Let's talk about another MMO, and actually a follow-up to something we were talking about

28:54.780 --> 28:55.780
last week.

28:55.780 --> 28:58.340
What's going on in the World of Warcraft, Loki?

28:58.340 --> 29:00.380
Well, a couple things.

29:00.380 --> 29:07.340
First off, gay rights groups are calling Blizzard, saying you need to change your World of Warcraft

29:07.340 --> 29:15.300
policies to basically be more clear on the different types of things.

29:15.300 --> 29:19.620
you know the whole thing is they're saying that you know promoting a you

29:19.620 --> 29:25.460
know gay or lesbian friendly guild as harassment is just retarded and you know

29:25.460 --> 29:29.220
understand that the rules are in place you know for certain things but they're

29:29.220 --> 29:35.420
kind of there the rules are too broad and so that you know they're using this

29:35.420 --> 29:42.940
to basically use it as it's not intended so you know as I said last week if they

29:42.940 --> 29:47.860
just had no warn this player under harassment I don't think it would have

29:47.860 --> 29:50.220
been taken so offensively and I don't think this whole thing would have

29:50.220 --> 29:54.880
mushroom clouded on him essentially is what happened but you know now that all

29:54.880 --> 29:57.140
this has been brought to light you know we kind of already talked about it last

29:57.140 --> 30:01.820
week you know I agree I think Blizzard needs to come out and say where they

30:01.820 --> 30:06.400
stand on these things or I guess they kind of have come out and say where they

30:06.400 --> 30:10.420
stand but they really need to clarify this because they are looking a little

30:10.420 --> 30:14.300
hypocritical with the, you know, slash silly that we talked about last week and all that.

30:14.300 --> 30:20.300
Basically the comment was Stonewall, a group founded in 1989, a professional lobbying group

30:20.300 --> 30:26.780
campaigning for the rights of lesbians and gay men and bisexuals, their spokesperson

30:26.780 --> 30:31.360
Jonathan Finney said, this attempt to create a safe and gay friendly environment should

30:31.360 --> 30:33.380
be welcomed, not blocked.

30:33.380 --> 30:37.900
And hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and would encourage Blizzard to review their

30:37.900 --> 30:43.540
policies and make sure that it has an effect, or has an effect where it needs to be, so.

30:43.540 --> 30:47.900
It's been over a week now, I don't know if Blizzard's ever really going to do anything

30:47.900 --> 30:51.860
else on this, I think they're just going to kind of let this keep going.

30:51.860 --> 30:54.520
I would have thought if Blizzard was going to say something we would have really heard

30:54.520 --> 30:58.620
it by now, besides, you know, we did get a clarification on a message board, but it wasn't

30:58.620 --> 30:59.620
good enough.

30:59.620 --> 31:00.620
So, eh.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.620
Extover, have a comment?

31:01.620 --> 31:03.620
Extover have a comment. I

31:04.440 --> 31:10.100
Was just gonna ask you Rob didn't you didn't you report people in the general chat?

31:10.300 --> 31:16.020
No, I didn't and I I I was gonna do it and then I couldn't I couldn't really figure out it was too complicated

31:16.020 --> 31:22.060
I know I shouldn't I should think I own well that I did I mean the thing is aside from that those that

31:22.700 --> 31:29.580
These people are saying like all kinds of things like in the general chat or whatever that are just really inappropriate

31:29.580 --> 31:39.800
appropriate. It's just blasphemous. It doesn't have any place in the game or whatever, and

31:39.800 --> 31:46.180
yet you see these same people in general chat every day in World of Warcraft, and obviously

31:46.180 --> 31:51.220
they're not getting banned or anything. They're not getting warnings. It's kind of hypocritical,

31:51.220 --> 31:52.220
I think.

31:52.220 --> 31:54.860
You know something I did find interesting, though, is I actually switched servers and

31:54.860 --> 31:57.980
I tried playing on a roleplay server for a little bit this week because I hadn't really

31:57.980 --> 32:01.380
been on a roleplay server yet, and so far I noticed the roleplay folks happen to be

32:01.380 --> 32:02.380
more mature.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.380
At least in my experience.

32:03.380 --> 32:08.820
It might just be the particular servers I've been picking, but in general, the roleplay

32:08.820 --> 32:13.100
server has been more mature overall, and you don't get that bullshit Chuck Norris talk

32:13.100 --> 32:14.660
in the middle of town and stuff that isn't happening.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.980
I don't know if it's because the server's new as well.

32:16.980 --> 32:21.360
I tried out a new RP server, but I don't know.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.280
But to be honest, the longer Blizzard goes without addressing this, I don't know how

32:25.280 --> 32:27.460
much longer I really want to keep playing this game.

32:27.460 --> 32:32.860
in mind that the in the district RP servers you are not allowed to be out of

32:32.860 --> 32:38.780
character at all you can get get kicked basically if you if they catch you being

32:38.780 --> 32:42.940
blatantly out of character without any sort of specific comment toward being

32:42.940 --> 32:46.180
out of character and you know I I actually roleplay a mute character

32:46.180 --> 32:49.100
because I don't ever talk to people that's that's my I roleplay a mute mute

32:49.100 --> 32:56.560
character and I'm doing a very good job actually I play I play an undead and all

32:56.560 --> 32:58.520
All I say is brains.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
Brains!

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
Dork.

33:00.520 --> 33:07.080
Alright, is there another follow-up regarding the whole concepts of sexuality in this MMO,

33:07.080 --> 33:08.080
Loki?

33:08.080 --> 33:09.080
There is.

33:09.080 --> 33:17.000
In Blizzard, there is basically a chat log posted about between a player and a GM confirming

33:17.000 --> 33:23.100
that two female characters could get reported for trying to marry each other.

33:23.100 --> 33:30.020
pretty much blows the whole it doesn't belong in the game argument up there. Anyways, a

33:30.020 --> 33:34.500
couple of the things they were talking about, the one player here was trying to point out

33:34.500 --> 33:41.820
where is this actually in the documents here. And the whole issue of the thing is that other

33:41.820 --> 33:49.140
players might not be mature enough and might take offense to this or start harassing other

33:49.140 --> 33:52.680
players you know saying like this night elf is camping my ass or something like

33:52.680 --> 33:57.540
that and so you know their excuse is basically well there's some players in

33:57.540 --> 34:01.800
World of Warcraft that aren't mature enough for this game and so they might

34:01.800 --> 34:05.360
you know start harassing people so therefore we can't you know give them

34:05.360 --> 34:10.640
some it's basically no they're saying they're flame bait is yeah so clarify

34:10.640 --> 34:12.840
this for you because this is something I didn't even realize last week when I

34:12.840 --> 34:16.080
went off I didn't even realize this and I don't know how much longer I wanna

34:16.080 --> 34:19.120
talk about this this week but but this is new news to me this is something

34:19.120 --> 34:23.280
for the argument, you're saying that male and female characters can get married in the

34:23.280 --> 34:24.280
game.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
Apparently, I guess.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.960
But I thought sexuality had no place in World of Warcraft.

34:27.960 --> 34:32.080
Well, apparently it doesn't unless it's heterosexual.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.720
Oh, I see.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.960
So yet another hypocrisy on Blizzard's part.

34:35.960 --> 34:36.960
Oh, okay.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.760
Just wanted to clarify that, thank you.

34:39.760 --> 34:45.440
Not to mention, though, that Blizzard isn't the only MMO out there that doesn't allow

34:45.440 --> 34:49.280
gay marriage, Final Fantasy XI, and other ones as well.

34:49.280 --> 34:52.360
But every Mithra on Final Fantasy XI is a gay man playing it anyway.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.360
Just teasing.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.360
Don't send the hate mail.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
Just teasing.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.360
I played one.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.360
I know.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.360
I know.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.360
I'm teasing.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
Aren't you a gay man?

35:00.360 --> 35:01.360
Shut up!

35:01.360 --> 35:08.520
Seriously though, I can let that slide in that case because A, Final Fantasy XI doesn't

35:08.520 --> 35:10.720
give a crap about the GLBT guilds and all that stuff.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.000
They let that stuff go on and that's fine.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.740
they can kind of pass it off as, you know,

35:14.740 --> 35:19.740
well, it doesn't really fit the time period of the game.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.520
And I'm okay with that because they don't make an issue

35:24.520 --> 35:25.880
of the guilds and the other stuff.

35:25.880 --> 35:27.440
But now I have a problem with World of Warcraft

35:27.440 --> 35:29.080
because they've made an issue of all this other stuff

35:29.080 --> 35:31.880
saying sexuality has no place in the game yet.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.360
They do allow the, you know, only the opposite sex marriage.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.520
And like in Final Fantasy XI,

35:36.520 --> 35:38.720
you don't know who's really a boy and who's really a girl,

35:38.720 --> 35:40.960
so there's probably same gender weddings happening

35:40.960 --> 35:45.400
the time but you know it's all role-play anyway so oh I've gone cross-eyed of

35:45.400 --> 35:49.240
course you can't marry if you're a gay person in World of Warcraft but you can

35:49.240 --> 35:56.840
register as a domestic partner and then that means did you get insurance and

35:56.840 --> 36:02.480
yeah same yeah the same benefit you just can't call it marriage I look people I'm

36:02.480 --> 36:09.420
going to chat room now let's see uh Ami Damaru flame says I sent a message to an

36:09.420 --> 36:14.380
admin and I was told that's what ignore is for oh that's that's a lovely

36:14.380 --> 36:19.540
response thanks thanks Blizzard another yet another inconsistency on Blizzard's

36:19.540 --> 36:23.800
part let's see what was the other one here is another going Oh Rob way said

36:23.800 --> 36:29.920
the rule should be no explicit sex talk within Wow gay straight or beyond I'd be

36:29.920 --> 36:34.440
okay with that if it was consistent it's not so I know there's there just needs

36:34.440 --> 36:43.340
to be consistency all right moving on new topic let's go over to Jamie

36:43.340 --> 36:49.260
completely opposite different topic about as far away from this whole wow

36:49.260 --> 36:52.680
debate as we can get what's going on I'm sure the entire world really gives a

36:52.680 --> 36:57.720
crap about this but EA signed Tiger Woods for six more years oh so we can we

36:57.720 --> 37:01.620
will continue to have the Tiger Woods golf games and which I don't really get

37:01.620 --> 37:04.820
because you know it would be something if they would actually sort of make

37:04.820 --> 37:08.260
changes in between the games but you know and this will probably make you

37:08.260 --> 37:12.380
happy the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be like crap they didn't it has the

37:12.380 --> 37:15.940
least amount of features to it but they have switched to like a whole analog

37:15.940 --> 37:21.460
scheme for how they're having it play but still do we need more Tiger Woods

37:21.460 --> 37:27.160
games can't he like retire like Madden did whatever you know as long as the

37:27.160 --> 37:31.500
guy's popular games with his name attached to it are gonna sell he is

37:31.500 --> 37:37.740
cute he's you know he sees he's a very respectable sports figure I'm not a big

37:37.740 --> 37:41.940
sports fan I don't really follow any sports for everything from golf to

37:41.940 --> 37:44.900
football notice how we're doing a show the day of the Super Bowl obviously I'm

37:44.900 --> 37:49.180
not following football um but you know Tiger Woods strikes me it's one of the

37:49.180 --> 37:54.100
more respectable type of yeah I would hit that he doesn't know he doesn't have

37:54.100 --> 37:57.460
to worry about what the games are gonna net him because his golfing is still

37:57.460 --> 38:04.460
gonna send money rolling in. Personally, I'd rather play, what was it, Happy Gilmore's

38:05.700 --> 38:12.700
PGA Tour 2006. That'd be a better game. Moving on. I have another Nintendo Revolution story

38:15.580 --> 38:19.700
and it's more of a teaser than anything else, a little bit of a rumor. That has to do with

38:19.700 --> 38:22.740
Game Developers Conference because you know the Game Developers Conference is right around

38:22.740 --> 38:27.380
the corner and Nintendo you know even though they say you know e3 is the time

38:27.380 --> 38:30.380
when they're gonna really show the goods on what the revolution is about there

38:30.380 --> 38:34.980
might be some teasers at the game developers conference because

38:34.980 --> 38:40.860
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata will take time to talk about a couple new

38:40.860 --> 38:44.700
revolution details now doubtful he's gonna actually show any games in

38:44.700 --> 38:49.700
progress probably just gonna be little appetizers just little flavorings he'll

38:49.700 --> 38:52.980
kind of kind of let you smell what's cooking in the kitchen but won't really

38:52.980 --> 38:57.360
let you see what's going on there but nevertheless all the Nintendo fanboys in

38:57.360 --> 39:01.580
the world are going like can't wait just salivating for more information on the

39:01.580 --> 39:06.500
revolution so game developers conference is the the time when there will be some

39:06.500 --> 39:10.840
more hints March 20th is the day of the game developers conference and of course

39:10.840 --> 39:15.700
when the news is unwrapped we will bring it to you here on the show and might

39:15.700 --> 39:21.260
possibly be salivating ourselves. We'll see.

39:21.260 --> 39:26.360
Moving on, Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360 besides them breaking?

39:26.360 --> 39:32.620
Well, actually, they're working on fixing certain problems with systems glitching out.

39:32.620 --> 39:39.040
They've actually had a firmware update or dashboard update to fix some of the guide

39:39.040 --> 39:43.640
problems that they've been having, also increased the accuracy of the last time played thing

39:43.640 --> 39:47.040
on there, which is kind of cool, I guess.

39:47.040 --> 39:53.760
And then another great feature, disabling the kiosk disk from working anymore, so trying

39:53.760 --> 39:56.560
to stomp out more homebrew.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.640
We talked about that a couple of weeks on the show, how the kiosk disk, somebody figured

39:59.640 --> 40:03.040
out how to copy it and play it on the Xbox 360 and they would say, oh, it's going to

40:03.040 --> 40:09.440
be this new way to expose homebrew, well Microsoft just brought down the fist of justice on that,

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
didn't they?

40:10.440 --> 40:11.840
Well, yes and no.

40:11.840 --> 40:18.640
Yes, they have, but no they haven't because the actual files are on the hard drive, the

40:18.640 --> 40:24.400
update, and you could in a sense go back and either edit the update or delete the update

40:24.400 --> 40:26.720
and bring that all back.

40:26.720 --> 40:34.320
It's not like a Sony firmware where you flash an actual chip and then you're screwed, you're

40:34.320 --> 40:35.880
stuck with it.

40:35.880 --> 40:37.840
Okay, interesting.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.280
Alright, what's going on for the rest of the year?

40:41.280 --> 40:44.960
What other things is Xbox 360 going to do this year besides, you know, break more

40:44.960 --> 40:45.440
systems?

40:45.440 --> 40:48.840
Well, they actually have a lot of games coming out. Do I sound bitter? I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?

40:48.840 --> 40:52.320
Yeah, just a little bit. Just a little bit. Lots of games have been announced.

40:52.320 --> 40:57.520
There was actually a huge list here posted on joystick.com. They had pretty

40:57.520 --> 41:00.440
much the whole lineup, or at least what's been announced this year

41:00.440 --> 41:03.480
for the rest of the year. And some really cool stuff.

41:03.480 --> 41:07.960
One I'm looking forward to that's actually coming up here pretty soon

41:07.960 --> 41:11.040
Far Cry Instincts Predator is going to be pretty neat

41:11.040 --> 41:14.160
Though it kind of looks like a rehash of the

41:14.160 --> 41:17.480
first one and then of course

41:17.480 --> 41:21.720
some stuff we're going to be talking about later Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2

41:21.720 --> 41:26.720
which would be kind of good and some other cool stuff Unreal Tournament 2007

41:26.720 --> 41:28.780
probably coinciding with the PS3

41:28.780 --> 41:32.040
launch game. A Newcastle Wolfenstein game

41:32.040 --> 41:36.320
which is awesome and I'm hoping hopefully we'll get Quake Wars because

41:36.320 --> 41:37.800
that one looks really sweet

41:37.800 --> 41:42.120
Alone in the Dark, you know more inspiration for Rui Bull

41:42.120 --> 41:45.320
and SSX4 pretty much just a you know

41:45.320 --> 41:49.720
a whole slew of games, a lot of tie-ins with movies should be

41:49.720 --> 41:54.480
a really good year though and that would be you know what forget it I'm just gonna

41:54.480 --> 41:55.360
sound more bitter

41:55.360 --> 41:59.720
stop being bitter I can't I can't help it that was a lot of money I spent

41:59.720 --> 42:03.920
spent I actually I did have a a comment regarding you people I

42:03.920 --> 42:09.040
I didn't know if we were it had been addressed about the

42:09.040 --> 42:12.720
Metal Gear yeah we're we're a little bit it's coming up later

42:12.720 --> 42:18.040
alright I'm let's go ahead and I go on to

42:18.040 --> 42:21.240
the revolution we just we're just ping-pong in between all the next-gen

42:21.240 --> 42:22.720
systems tonight that's alright though

42:22.720 --> 42:26.800
are confusing me I know I'm sorry try not to go cross-eyed on cross-eyed earlier

42:26.800 --> 42:29.800
I did that the other day.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.800
See, you're bitter about that. So you've got that to be bitter about.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.800
I'm not, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not bitter about it.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.800
It's just I couldn't see for 30 minutes.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.800
Okay, that was scary.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.800
You couldn't see my Xbox 360 not working. That's right.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.800
Someone had to email me about that at work.

42:47.800 --> 42:52.800
Alright, move on. GameDaily.com posted this list called

42:52.800 --> 42:57.400
called 10 obscure Super Nintendo games that we want to play on the revolution

42:57.400 --> 43:01.440
and I don't really know how newsworthy this this is but it may dig and I

43:01.440 --> 43:05.920
thought it's it's it's a good thing to discuss on the show a nice little topic

43:05.920 --> 43:10.200
to kind of bounce around I don't know why people always want to make lists but

43:10.200 --> 43:13.280
here it is another list we're gonna be doing a list actually later tonight so

43:13.280 --> 43:17.240
maybe I shouldn't be bashing it too much here's their list of games they want to

43:17.240 --> 43:20.280
see playable on the revolution in the little like emulation thing is of

43:20.280 --> 43:22.600
course you know the revolution you're supposed to be able to play old games on

43:22.600 --> 43:29.160
it Mario Paint Actraiser I thought Actraiser was a weird game to put on

43:29.160 --> 43:32.200
here because I thought isn't revolution always supposed to do the first-party

43:32.200 --> 43:35.540
games or do we know about I guess we really don't know if third-party I guess

43:35.540 --> 43:40.080
it would be whichever one sign on right so we'll see I guess the possibility

43:40.080 --> 43:46.600
earthbound good choice UN squadron moving on down the list Legend of the

43:46.600 --> 43:51.720
Mystical Ninja also known as going on desert strike jungle strike urban strike

43:51.720 --> 43:56.240
No, even though that's three separate games. They're looping that into one now. See I don't know cuz that's more

43:56.240 --> 44:00.320
That's more of a Genesis thing. I attached those games to Genesis for me, but I don't know

44:00.840 --> 44:02.840
Evo search for Eden

44:03.280 --> 44:04.920
Uniracers

44:04.920 --> 44:07.880
That was one of those like really it kind of I like Gina racers

44:07.880 --> 44:12.100
It was strange but kind of fun Robo cop versus Terminator

44:12.160 --> 44:16.880
Okay, that was retarded and then out of this world and flashback the quest for identity

44:16.880 --> 44:20.920
I did not like out of this world at all. I was like hello 3do game

44:20.920 --> 44:26.560
I don't know why that's on that list, but whatever and I also thought it was weird that they said obscure Super Nintendo games

44:26.560 --> 44:27.900
I'm like earthbound wasn't that obscure

44:27.900 --> 44:29.540
I mean sure they never really you know

44:29.540 --> 44:34.060
They sat on a actually doing a sequel for a long long time and now it may not even come out here

44:34.060 --> 44:38.320
But I don't know if it was obscure, but okay, whatever whatever. I'll look past that

44:39.060 --> 44:44.400
Anything that's missing from this list you think Super Nintendo games that we ought to be able to play on the revolution

44:44.400 --> 44:50.400
Besides the big ones, we all know Metroid, Zelda, besides the big ones, slightly obscure games at least.

44:50.400 --> 44:55.400
Anything that you think is missing. I'll say one. Here's an obscure game I used to love.

44:55.400 --> 45:00.400
I know for a fact this won't be playable in Revolution, though, because it was a Sony game.

45:00.400 --> 45:08.400
Equinox, the sequel to Solstice. I loved that game. I'd love to see that, but that's obviously me living in a fantasy world.

45:08.400 --> 45:10.400
Anybody else want to add anything?

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
What was the Equinox?

45:12.400 --> 45:14.400
Did you ever play Solstice?

45:14.400 --> 45:18.400
I'm having trouble remembering because I remember that.

45:18.400 --> 45:22.400
It was a bit of a puzzle game. It was like 3D, isometric type thing.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.400
And you kind of walked around.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.400
It had square movement.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.400
It was very tactics-y.

45:28.400 --> 45:30.400
It had that edge to it.

45:30.400 --> 45:35.400
A little bit. It was more action-oriented, but I can see it had the tactics look to it.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.400
Certainly did.

45:37.400 --> 45:44.760
I know this one's not obscure, but I would give my, like, left knee cap for, um, Star

45:44.760 --> 45:45.760
Fox.

45:45.760 --> 45:46.760
Okay.

45:46.760 --> 45:47.760
Yeah.

45:47.760 --> 45:48.760
That's a good one.

45:48.760 --> 45:49.760
That's a good one.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.000
Definitely a first-party title a lot of folks want to see.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Loki?

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Nothing?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.240
Um, you know, I didn't play that many Super Nintendo games, and it's really sad.

45:56.240 --> 46:00.160
I liked Super, um, Mario RPG.

46:00.160 --> 46:03.240
I think that'd be one that they would probably do.

46:03.240 --> 46:06.600
Let's see...

46:06.600 --> 46:09.960
Other than that, you know, it really wasn't too much.

46:09.960 --> 46:14.060
I was a huge fan of Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is like kind of like

46:14.060 --> 46:17.320
a cheap version of Sonic the Hedgehog.

46:17.320 --> 46:21.000
That was one of the first games I had, which is weird.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.800
Freaking Dracula X. But the Super Nintendo port was

46:24.800 --> 46:29.240
assy compared to the original. I think that they could have...

46:29.240 --> 46:33.040
It would have been prohibitively expensive because you have this whole

46:33.040 --> 46:36.980
other scenario with maria that they just didn't do maybe they could say okay now

46:36.980 --> 46:39.680
that we have revolution technology here's dracula x the way it should have

46:39.680 --> 46:40.280
been

46:40.280 --> 46:44.960
and of course at all of us who have these three hundred dollar copies of

46:44.960 --> 46:50.160
of uh... dracula x for pc engine are gonna find their copy north fifty bucks

46:50.160 --> 46:53.120
uh... let's see what the chat room has to say over at orange lounge radio dot com

46:53.120 --> 46:55.020
click on chat wonder dog harold says

46:55.020 --> 46:56.480
zombies ate my neighbors

46:56.480 --> 46:58.760
oh my god yes

46:58.760 --> 47:02.800
i'd like to see a new version of their put on xbox lives arcade upgrade or

47:02.800 --> 47:08.640
Smash TV. Super Smash TV. Fire Bulma said Smash TV. There you go. Reenie says Yoshi's

47:08.640 --> 47:16.080
Island. Yes. There you go. Yoshi's Cookie. PK Akira 88, Yoshi Safari, where the Super

47:16.080 --> 47:21.120
Scope won. Wasn't that the Super Scope one where you run around? It's all about the mole

47:21.120 --> 47:26.300
game. Where you shot moles with the Super Scope. I don't remember that. It was just

47:26.300 --> 47:29.080
the generic cartridge that came with it, but either it was like the games, like it was

47:29.080 --> 47:35.400
I don't know. I was pretty ghetto. I had the Sega Menacer dude. Cool. The Menacer was cool because you could take it apart

47:36.160 --> 47:40.080
Yeah, it sucked. I have I still have a minister really. All right

47:40.640 --> 47:46.520
Toe jam and roll. Let's keep it moving. Let's go over that super Turrican. I love that game

47:46.520 --> 47:51.460
So you're cheating you're looking I can't remember the name of it. Okay. Yes

47:51.460 --> 47:57.620
I am brought up a big list to see we're Nintendo games. All right, I'm just messing with you. All right, let's

47:59.300 --> 48:03.300
Let's go over and open up the mailbag cuz you know dark Sakura

48:03.780 --> 48:09.800
She likes to open up your email and you guys send your emails to mailbag at orange laundry calm and she reads them

48:09.800 --> 48:12.980
And then I have a good laugh. Yeah, she laughs at the you know, hate mail

48:12.980 --> 48:15.380
She laughs at the hate mail and then read some of the good ones on air

48:15.380 --> 48:20.080
I don't get before we start before we start get love mail before we start mail

48:20.080 --> 48:22.080
But I see now they're gonna send you hate mail who said you don't know

48:23.920 --> 48:26.440
Before we start mailbag tonight if I may on a personal note

48:27.260 --> 48:33.000
Because I got some emails directly to my personal email address this week and you know last week on the show

48:33.000 --> 48:36.540
I had a coming out of sorts because I never mentioned

48:36.540 --> 48:39.900
You know the fact that I was gay until we talked about the World of Warcraft thing

48:40.340 --> 48:44.340
Although folks have been listening to live show knew it for a long time. I actually thought it was in my bio

48:44.340 --> 48:48.300
I didn't realize that folks have been listening to the podcast for so long didn't know it

48:48.300 --> 48:52.180
So it kind of was a coming out of sorts and I just want to say I got some

48:52.740 --> 48:59.300
Really amazing emails of support from people, you know from all across like it didn't matter if they were straight gay

48:59.300 --> 49:03.680
You know, whatever. I just got some amazing emails that really just

49:04.620 --> 49:06.620
Made me remember why I do this show for free

49:07.220 --> 49:10.940
To simply put it and a lot of them were so long and personal

49:10.940 --> 49:11.800
I'm not gonna read them on the air

49:11.800 --> 49:15.260
But I just want to say thanks and you guys are awesome and we really do have the best listeners

49:15.260 --> 49:19.780
We really don't we're not just saying that we really really do and I would just like to take a moment right here on my

49:19.780 --> 49:24.180

read them and

49:38.780 --> 49:42.540
possibly comment on them yeah except there's a difference see i came out as gay you're coming

49:42.540 --> 49:49.580
out as an asshole that's a bleached one i'm just messing with a bad bad joke yeah that old joke

49:49.580 --> 49:54.380
i like men too where was the mail oh yes there's the mailbag let's let's move on to the mailbag

49:54.380 --> 50:02.780
shall we um hi okay uh i actually i went over my limit because i got a bunch of emails this week

50:02.780 --> 50:08.220
again. So, um, the first one I'm going to bring up is sent by Malice. I'm just going

50:08.220 --> 50:12.420
to read this as a question actually put forth to us. I was wondering if you

50:12.420 --> 50:15.560
people knew about this. I wish to know more about it before I purchase it.

50:15.560 --> 50:21.300
Skipping forward, it seems to be a special edition of Grand Theft Auto San

50:21.300 --> 50:26.340
Andreas with a 30-minute prologue CG or animation. It's apparently a budget title

50:26.340 --> 50:29.500
as it is $20. I want to know what you guys think about it before I show out

50:29.500 --> 50:36.500
the cash. I don't really think anything of Grand Theft Auto.

50:37.360 --> 50:40.540
I defer to Loki because I don't really play these games either.

50:40.540 --> 50:45.720
It's just the platinum hit or greatest hits or whatever version of Grand Theft Auto San

50:45.720 --> 50:49.720
Andreas because they've sold millions and millions of copies, so it came out at a new

50:49.720 --> 50:54.240
low low price of $19.95. And that's all it really is.

50:54.240 --> 50:58.380
And of course every now and then the new trend now, especially with Devil May Cry 3 Special

50:58.380 --> 51:02.700
edition save release you know a little added features as well on top of you

51:02.700 --> 51:07.620
know dropping the price of the game so a little extra something for me I'm gonna

51:07.620 --> 51:11.340
be honest even though I understand why the game gets a lot of critical praise

51:11.340 --> 51:13.900
and all that stuff it's kind of one of those games that's fun for me for a

51:13.900 --> 51:17.540
couple days and then I'm kind of tired of it you know it is a game that you can

51:17.540 --> 51:21.700
literally play up play the mission you know pick up play the missions or just

51:21.700 --> 51:25.420
fuck around and it's really cool it's really fun

51:25.420 --> 51:30.140
Sandra is definitely the best one in the series so far so I mean 20 bucks for that game

51:30.140 --> 51:32.460
You can play for hours and hours and I'll get bored of it

51:32.540 --> 51:38.460
So I say I highly recommend the storylines really good in it too. So let's check out a main character named jizzy

51:39.160 --> 51:46.420
No, it's CJ. Oh, I thought it was jizzy. No, it's I'm calling him jizzy. That's only in the hot coffee mod

51:46.980 --> 51:48.980
Alright next email

51:48.980 --> 51:51.420
Okay, this one comes from me. So sky

51:51.420 --> 51:58.900
Um, it's titled Fantasy Star Universe vs. Final Fantasy XI, as in EKS, EYE, I thought

51:58.900 --> 51:59.900
that was cute.

51:59.900 --> 52:04.340
Um, hello, I love the new format that you guys are giving the show and I kinda want

52:04.340 --> 52:06.940
you to debate on something if you can.

52:06.940 --> 52:10.600
A couple months ago I got Final Fantasy XI for my PC, my father would allow me to play

52:10.600 --> 52:15.100
as long as I got good grades, so there's my copy of Final Fantasy XI sitting in the corner

52:15.100 --> 52:16.940
crying and gathering dust.

52:16.940 --> 52:20.620
I also recently found out about the new Corsair job and I think it looks pretty.

52:20.620 --> 52:24.580
I would buy and play the game just because of the sexy outfits before the course airdrop.

52:24.580 --> 52:28.340
Now I have recently gotten back with my PSO community and they are getting ready for Phantasy

52:28.340 --> 52:29.500
Star Universe.

52:29.500 --> 52:33.860
This game too is also very sexy mainly because of all the new weapons and new character creator.

52:33.860 --> 52:37.500
I would like to stick with one MMO but they seem so good.

52:37.500 --> 52:44.680
I have $70 to waste and importing PSU from my station of playing too is looking very

52:44.680 --> 52:45.680
good right now.

52:45.680 --> 52:48.140
So what do you think?

52:48.140 --> 52:50.980
It's tough because I haven't really played Phantasy Star Universe.

52:50.980 --> 52:55.540
I played a little bit at the E3 demo kiosk, but I can only really go off my experience

52:55.540 --> 52:59.620
with Phantasy Star Online and how it might be a little bit different.

52:59.620 --> 53:00.780
Here's the thing.

53:00.780 --> 53:02.580
Here's the biggest difference between the two games.

53:02.580 --> 53:06.580
It's basically fundamentally how the attack systems work, is that in Phantasy Star you

53:06.580 --> 53:11.780
hit a button to literally swing your sword, so it's more of an action-based MMO.

53:11.780 --> 53:16.620
Whereas in Final Fantasy XI, you're auto-swinging your sword, and you're doing other things

53:16.620 --> 53:20.900
with that such as you know your weapon skills or your magic or whatever it's

53:20.900 --> 53:25.980
more of a quote-unquote traditional style RPG in MMO form it's a little hard

53:25.980 --> 53:29.020
to explain it's not like other Final Fantasies at all because the battle

53:29.020 --> 53:32.300
system is so much different although if you played the 12 demo it's kind of

53:32.300 --> 53:36.700
similar the 12 demo um I think the question is how much action do you want

53:36.700 --> 53:40.940
in your MMO do you want something that's more action based go with fantasy star

53:40.940 --> 53:44.660
you want something that's more strategy based go with Final Fantasy 11 but

53:44.660 --> 53:48.660
That's not to say Phantasy Star doesn't involve some strategy, and Final Fantasy 11 doesn't

53:48.660 --> 53:52.260
involve some action, it's just that Phantasy Star is a little more action-heavy, and I

53:52.260 --> 53:55.420
think if you want to decide between those two, that's where it's going to be.

53:55.420 --> 53:58.860
Also here's the other thing to consider, Final Fantasy 11 is going to be cheaper because

53:58.860 --> 54:02.420
the game's been out for a long time to get started on that on PC, it's only like 20 bucks

54:02.420 --> 54:05.780
right now, whereas Phantasy Star Universe is going to be a little more expensive.

54:05.780 --> 54:11.300
So there's the pros and cons, I can't really say which is better, because they're different.

54:11.300 --> 54:14.260
They're different, and I haven't played enough of Universe to really judge it, but even if

54:14.260 --> 54:19.200
If I'm putting Final Fantasy XI and Phantasy Star side by side, they're just too different.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.100
I can't compare them.

54:21.100 --> 54:23.080
I'd say go play World of Warcraft.

54:23.080 --> 54:24.080
Stop.

54:24.080 --> 54:30.440
No, seriously, if you want a cool actual good game, I mean play World of Warcraft.

54:30.440 --> 54:34.400
Stay away from Final Fantasy XI because it'll just make you sad.

54:34.400 --> 54:38.160
Well, at least don't be a white mage.

54:38.160 --> 54:39.160
Was your experience...

54:39.160 --> 54:40.920
Because you become the bitch of the party.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.040
Yeah, but same thing with a priest and wow.

54:43.040 --> 54:46.920
But did you have a bad experience with Final Fantasy XI Extover?

54:46.920 --> 54:51.960
Well it just seemed like every single time, well I mean, let me just give the game just

54:51.960 --> 54:57.560
a little bit of credit because I did actually enjoy playing it a lot but the thing is it

54:57.560 --> 55:03.160
just got really tiring on having to try and find a party all the freaking time and also

55:03.160 --> 55:07.080
when I was in a party it was just like drama.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.440
It was just so much drama.

55:08.440 --> 55:12.840
I'd rather deal with drama in a guild on World of Warcraft where I can just leave it and

55:12.840 --> 55:18.720
say you know screw you guys I'm going home you know whatever but like on Final

55:18.720 --> 55:24.600
Fantasy 11 I mean you're like black booked if you if you're like really bad

55:24.600 --> 55:29.040
in a party without be intending to be people really remember that and they

55:29.040 --> 55:33.440
don't want you in your party anymore hmm all right next people it kept wanting me

55:33.440 --> 55:39.260
in their stupid party but I hated them I let the tank die on purpose because okay

55:39.260 --> 55:43.140
I told you about the party I was in with the tank who was a jerk. I let him die.

55:43.700 --> 55:47.180
There's jerks in every game though. The rest of the party thanked me. There's jerks in every game.

55:48.460 --> 55:50.460
Next up comes from

55:51.340 --> 55:55.480
Okay for a moment. I could not hear myself on the microphone. This one comes from Steve

55:56.120 --> 56:02.420
Hi, Steve. I think I'm gonna start doing that with all the people that email us. I'm gonna say hi to him. So hi Steve!

56:03.260 --> 56:05.260
Steve is

56:05.300 --> 56:07.940
Actually, I'm going to say right now a very kind soul

56:07.940 --> 56:13.860
for other reasons we might discuss later okay um but he was actually sending me

56:13.860 --> 56:18.540
questions looking for information on Judy Crystal about other songs that she

56:18.540 --> 56:25.580
did okay and I had sort of been into Judy Crystal for a little bit but not

56:25.580 --> 56:32.000
like you know majorly majorly um but she basically Judy Crystal did God of

56:32.000 --> 56:35.860
Romance in new DER here's a little clip of God of Romance just in case you're

56:35.860 --> 56:53.220
not unfamiliar with Judy Crystal, which is actually a remake of Romantu no Kami-sama,

56:53.220 --> 56:55.420
which I've played in pre-shows before.

56:55.420 --> 57:03.460
Maybe I'll put it in next week's pre-show, but at any rate, she did Tokyo already, Baby

57:03.460 --> 57:13.460
love me you can't hurry love and nori nori nori oh yeah but it mostly for

57:13.460 --> 57:19.020
anyone looking for stuff you can go to eurobeatevolution.com they have some

57:19.020 --> 57:24.380
info on various eurobeat artists track listings at energy Express calm I've

57:24.380 --> 57:31.220
been trying to hunt down you remember JB way back oh yeah he's a big Judy

57:31.220 --> 57:36.660
crystal fan oh that's right I'll try to hunt him down he's still I think I know

57:36.660 --> 57:38.980
where to find him to ask me again offline I'll tell you where to find him

57:38.980 --> 57:44.940
okay um but uh but yeah she's been on like a bajillion power power

57:44.940 --> 57:49.620
compilations including a one of the big ones by the power power all-stars so

57:49.620 --> 57:58.180
hope that answers it all right very cool um now we also have received an email

57:58.180 --> 58:09.460
from BigBadRemi, who I had a very interesting email from at first.

58:09.460 --> 58:13.220
I had actually intended on going back and making a public apology to the one who I said

58:13.220 --> 58:16.380
I didn't think is being very professional over the whole Mac thing, being a graphic

58:16.380 --> 58:23.860
artist, given that Mac is the standard for graphic artists, but there are people who

58:23.860 --> 58:33.100
are very prone toward PC maybe had a bad experience with a Mac I'm not going to

58:33.100 --> 58:38.660
even look at Loki right now just call it truce let's let's keep but for the sake

58:38.660 --> 58:44.500
of for the sake of the show I am no longer joining the debate I am going to

58:44.500 --> 58:49.620
buy my I'm actually getting a Mac for my birthday because I intend on being more

58:49.620 --> 58:54.460
serious with my art and I'd see that as a natural progression for myself as an

58:54.460 --> 59:00.420
artist good for you and I say that coffin not only needs to have the last

59:00.420 --> 59:03.980
nail shoved into it whatever you're thinking Loki swallow it and it needs to

59:03.980 --> 59:09.900
be set on fire I like your xbox laugh Loki's laughing at remember their

59:09.900 --> 59:13.820
swallow remember I'm just saying I don't bring it up every week everyone else

59:13.820 --> 59:18.340
brings it up they try to drag me back into this I don't really care you know

59:18.340 --> 59:25.000
it sorry if it seemed offensive I don't aim to offend but that was how I felt

59:25.000 --> 59:30.900
that it just sort of blindsided me because every professional graphic

59:30.900 --> 59:35.960
artist I know and I know a lot of them I live in California every last one of

59:35.960 --> 59:41.140
them uses a Mac so I was just really sort of blindsided by that one but that

59:41.140 --> 59:46.520
was where I came from um in in defense a little bit tiny bit I don't want to go

59:46.520 --> 59:50.380
too far that but I did used to work for a publishing company and we used both

59:50.380 --> 59:54.220
we use both so there's some things you see does better something that might

59:54.220 --> 59:58.700
does better just depends on how you use it I use both and I I don't have a

59:58.700 --> 01:00:04.100
preference actually I like both I'm actually digging the tiger oh the Mac OS

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.980
tiger yeah so yeah you're by computer roll I am I you're totally fine freaking

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:14.140
by all right I'm try computer all right because I have some Linux love now all

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:21.780
alright whoo anyway anyway anyway anyway simultaneous loving baby this is kind of

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:29.780
I'm going to paraphrase because some of it seems a little bit more personal than

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:36.100
I comfortable going into um but uh one of our listeners James sent in an email

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:44.060
hi James you know what Rob I'm gonna show this to you okay you're going

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:49.460
from mr. stress I hate the Xbox to hi I'm trying to turn that angst into

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.900
something more useful as world anyway it's not useful go back to it angst is

01:00:54.900 --> 01:01:03.500
hot except for when it's on read your email that is so hot basically it was

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:12.220
you know saying that things were fairly rough and then DDR was out the DDR

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:22.620
extreme and had absolutely addicted to it but was talking about how it was sort of alienating

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.660
to because when you know you know a lot of us went through that being when we played

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:31.300
DDR there was just an oh you played that game you know oh like the taunting of the other

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:38.780
people at the arcades you know and like oh the you know the fags playing DDR that he

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.840
was playing in a small crowd gathered around we all we know how the crowd goes

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:45.060
and then he met his best friend that way and has met many more friends through

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.940
the game and I was thinking a lot of us were like that you know Loki Dark

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.740
Sakura and I all met through DDR yeah I met my very best friend in the universe

01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:00.940
through DDR you know it's opened all kinds of doors you know not just for me

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:06.780
personally for all of us it's open door we we started off as a DDR show that was

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:13.060
our thing we went to we were we even came up with the concept in the name on

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:20.940
the Bart going to San Francisco to play DDR the metreon if that's not nerdy

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:28.980
enough so I'm sorry for sort of picking a paraphrasing it I I didn't want to

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.300
give a written response to it until I had actually had a chance to read it on

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:38.540
the air but I have to say that good for you it's very good for you and you know

01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:45.020
I love seeing how many people have had their lives better through DDR I know

01:02:45.020 --> 01:02:50.700
people who have pulled themselves out of some serious health issues through

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:55.660
playing DDR just don't get caught up in drama drama revolution oh yeah like DDR

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:05.500
versus itg just ignore it and then no get past it yeah okay um i also got an email from uh danny

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:12.860
hi danny uh she um writes in and says thank you for the rick sanchos interview i'm seriously

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.860
considering a game tap subscription because i think it is the ideal service for a casual gamer

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.900
like me i'd rather much pay for four months worth of game tap service and try a variety of games and

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.940
and pay $60 for one game.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.500
I have four kids who run through games like water and I can't buy them a new game every

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.500
week.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.540
Also, the idea of a service that does the hard work for me is appealing.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:35.140
Folding with an emulator is not my idea of gaming, neither is visiting sites for ROMs

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.900
and having to wade through all the ads with naked anime characters to get to a kid's game."

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:40.900
Agreed.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.780
Did GameTamp plant that email?

01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:43.780
No, I'm kidding.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:44.780
That's great.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.180
They'd be very happy to hear that, and I think that's what they're trying to do, so it's

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.180
great.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:55.860
I also do think there are a few trusted emulation sites that I know of I'm not gonna go into them on the air right now

01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.680
But you you really do if you're new into the emulation scene

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.700
You really do have to wade through piles of crap before you get to the good stuff, you know

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:09.520
So I actually think I think that that is a fabulous idea and on top of that

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:13.660
I think that a lot of the older games that we're seeing through game tap had a lot more

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:22.220
value to them. These were games where they could not focus on graphics. These were games

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:27.020
that had solid gameplay. A lot of the ones that are up on there. A lot of the classics.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:32.980
I swear, I watch Rob play it all the time and I'm very impressed. If I had the money,

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:39.100
I would subscribe to it. But I mean, it's very well done.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:43.160
really I'm actually thinking of doing it if it wasn't that I was in school right

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.440
now I would totally do it but I after the show I get to go home and paint some

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:54.360
more hey um two more all right one of them's from Sakarina hi Sakarina we

01:04:54.360 --> 01:05:02.680
like Sakarina hello Sakarina and this has to do with the gate removal thing oh

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:06.960
and Animal Crossing yes right from what I've read on various gaming blogs the

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.320
removal of gates is caused by a glitch having something to do with pitfall seeds

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:13.760
I've read this couple places do and therefore anyone who falls into a pitfall

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:18.320
somewhere in town could trigger this glitch to remove the gate I thought that

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:21.280
that would be cleared up in case one of the people in our friend code thread

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:29.480
happened to have it happen to them and for the record we do have an open forum

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.800
on our website in our forum section for our Animal Crossing players to share

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.280
friend codes and when you'll have your gate open and blah blah blah okay last

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:50.760
one from Mike hi Mike Mike is awesome um he said you GM did a top 200 games on

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:55.120
their list for their 200th issue mm-hmm I actually I needed to grab that issue

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.880
of EGM because I sort of got it out of EGM but I every so often I pick him up

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:06.020
there was just to see what's going on but now these were their top 10 games

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:12.200
was number 10 was Pong 9 was Grand Theft Auto 3 8 was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.320
Time he said it should be number one 7 was Space Invaders 6 was Super Mario 64

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:24.100
5 Legend of Zelda 4 Tetris 2 sorry 3 Street Fighter 2 2 Pac-Man 1 Super

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:28.400
Mario Brothers I saw that I actually read the magazine the other day that's a

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.800
pretty good list I'm pretty happy with that list as compared to most of these

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.160
top games of all time lists the only one I I'm not big on the Mario 64 as a lot

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.960
of people are I don't know why I love Mario 64 but I also have I wouldn't put

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.720
into my top 10 I have very fond memories of it I know I know a lot of other

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.760
people really into it's just not not my honorable mentions sure 12 Metal Gear

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:55.200
Solid 17 Halo 46 Resident Evil 4 74 Chrono Trigger that should be much

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.980
further up there yeah 92 Super Smash Brothers Melee 196 Guitar Hero which has

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:07.580
been played non-stop in my house all day 178 DDR 172 Katamari Damacy no

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:13.560
version of Puyo Puyo at all and that is a crying shame no Final Fantasy mentions

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.740
well I'm sure it's in the list it's gotta be somewhere but I'm kind of

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:21.240
surprised Final Fantasy 7 didn't crack the top 10 a little bit no Puyo Puyo and I

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.860
you have to have been paying attention to know that I am like this uber peel

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:30.600
peel fan yeah you know we had it as peel pop dr. robotics mean bean machine

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:36.600
Kirby's avalanche huh that breaks my heart but I'm closing the mailbag all

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.200
right pulling the strings mailbag orange laundry calm if you want to send us some

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.440
email and and we might read your email on the air if we feel like it one thing

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.840
that also seems like it's gonna happen whenever somebody feels like it is Duke

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
Duke Nukem Forever.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.560
Loki, what the heck is going on with Duke Nukem Forever?

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:58.920
If you believe it or not, it's actually still being worked on.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:08.080
Right now, they had an interview, I believe it was on 1UP, talking to a co-founder of

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:15.480
3D Realms, and basically in the interview, they brought up Duke Nukem Forever, and actually

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.680
it says that a lot of it's been finished, all the guns are finished, and most of the

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.460
creatures are finished, and it's basically they're putting together the pieces.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:28.280
So they said it's possible, it's possible, you know, cross your fingers, you might see

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:33.480
Duke Nukem 3, or um, forever, coming out in 2006.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.260
Possible, we'll see.

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:40.680
I'm looking at chat room feedback to the top 200 list right now, over at orange-not-a-trader.com,

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.680
click on chat.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.680
Maniac 64 says Metroid Prime, Super Metroid. I think Super Metroid's the game I would have

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.000
had in the top 10 instead of Mario 64. Metroid Prime was in the top 200, though. Super Metroid

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.040
needs to be one of those emulated games. Super Metroid needs to be recognized as one of the

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.640
best video games of all time. It really is. It's an incredible game. I think it was in

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.760
the list, though, too. I also have very positive memories of Super Metroid because I would

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.700
lay on the couch and watch Dan play all the way through it, and that was together time

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:09.700
over video games.

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:10.700
Awww.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.700
I love that game.

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.700
Shut up!

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.700
Any type of Metroid game is good for me.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.700
Rob.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:17.700
Rob.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.700
Rob.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700
Rob.

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.700
Rob.

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.700
Rob.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.700
Rob.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.700
Rob.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:24.700
Rob.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:25.700
Hi.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.700
Hi Jamie!

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.700
I felt it was time to revive that.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:28.700
It's been a standard since this episode.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:29.900
Did I mention it's just one of those shows tonight?

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.340
We're just off tonight.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.740
Anyway, here's a funny link I found this week.

01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:39.480
It's on most of the major gaming sites, you'll find a link to this, but the full link is

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:49.620
redruth.greenbean.org slash tilde ben slash 4cr slash smb underscore super underscore

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.640
synth dot swf.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.100
It's the Super Mario Brothers audio sound super synthesizer, and essentially what they've

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:01.240
done on this, and I'm playing with it right now, is they've taken all these sounds from

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.840
Mario Bros. and basically stripped them all out so that you can make your own remixes.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.480
So I'm going to remix something right here on the air right now, so here we go.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:15.860
Let's all do the Mario, oops I fucked up.

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:22.680
Let's all do the Mario, come on it's time to go, I've got a lot of coins, woo, Mario,

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.240
da da da, swing your hands from side to side.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240
See?

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.200
And I can do this in my room late at night when no one's watching.

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.560
That's the only place you should be doing that.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.560
Yeah.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.280
We'd rather not hear about anything else.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.360
Right.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360
That subject's over.

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.440
Yeah, I won't be doing any more stories since hour.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.440
Let's go over to Loki, who has something of a bit more serious nature.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.000
Yes.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.280
It's another game that's getting more flack from people, and this one is...

01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:04.480
basically Gun. Yes, the Association for American Indian Development calls for the Gun Boycott.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:08.620
And for those who are not in the know, Gun was this game that came out in November that's

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.200
basically kind of a wild west version of Grand Theft Auto. It had a story line about a guy

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:19.760
who was part Indian who was basically scalping people and what not. What's funny though is

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.500
they fail to mention that actually in the game the Native Americans are portrayed very

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:32.240
positively and also it's very accurate to the time period, the actions in the game.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.980
But anyways, that doesn't stop them from wanting a boycott. Basically they said the slaughtering

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:42.560
of renegade Apaches, the atrocity of the Indian scalping and the misinformation of Indian

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:49.300
traditions of killing sacred white animals. The petition requests that Activision remove

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.660
all derogatory harmful and inaccurate depictions of American Indians from gun

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:58.080
and reissue the game not gonna happen because the game's like twenty nine

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.200
dollars right now

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.780
and if they could sell it cheaper they probably would. It wasn't a very good game.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:09.100
Just so you know. Alright. On a completely different note,

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.580
you know when you work for a game company you have to sign what's called

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.800
an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.540
Dark Sakura, tell us about the dark side of NDA's. What happens when...

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.780
Are they drug out in the street and shot? What happens when people violate those NDAs?

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.780
Usually just fired.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.500
But there was a

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:33.180
former employee of Sony Online Entertainment that was

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:38.540
he spoke out about criticizing the PlayStation 3 and was

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:42.940
fired. He was an artist, Josh Robinson.

01:12:42.940 --> 01:12:45.980
Just to give a quote here, all I really did was write a few paragraphs that gave my

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:46.540
opinion

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.500
on publicly released information. I didn't reveal any tech info. I didn't

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:52.060
reveal

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:56.780
different shipping plans. I'm still in awe of the whole uproar over

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.220
what

01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:03.000
amounts to no information. Basically posted in this blog that says our game just

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.900
keeps getting moved back and back and back

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:08.500
and where is the box? Where is the final system? When is it coming out? No one knows

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.100
and in the meantime people in the industry are starting to get just a little salty.

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:18.760
You could always tell where the PS3 dev box was because it's the room that had the f-bomb coming out of it half the day

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.380
But he basically got got sacked for it

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:30.580
Another quote here. I talked with the people on the technical side of the Xbox 360 the consistent comment

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.140
I am hearing from people on my end is the Xbox 360 is better. Oh

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:39.660
Snap they are saying that it is capable of just doing more

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:46.820
He also talked to at least two Sony employees who read the blog entry before it was posted

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.060
and showed it to a producer and he said, again another quote, we were all in agreement that

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:56.100
I was not breaking NDA with what I was saying.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.140
They were just upset that he was bad-knouthing him.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.420
Yeah, I think it's more one of those two.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.240
Tried to find something to sack him with since he opened his mouth and was critical.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.620
How dare he?

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.180
How dare he speak the minds of everybody about this subject?

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:14.100
And might I be the first to say the Xbox 360 can be more powerful than the PlayStation

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.100
3 all at once, but it's going to have to work first.

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.260
There's a little bit more.

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.260
Just another quote.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:21.220
It says, it was something unfortunate to happen.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.300
I sincerely hope Sony isn't damaged by it.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:28.560
In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the CEO and VP of the company.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.900
Did I knowingly break NDA?

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.380
I absolutely did not.

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:34.420
I would never do that and would never want to hurt Sony online.

01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.580
Did I dance in the gray area by even opening my mouth?

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:39.140
Yes I did and I was fired for it.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:42.220
He did say however that he received four or five job offers immediately after leaving

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.020
Sony and got a book deal as a result of the article.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.020
Loser.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:47.020
What?

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.020
Loser.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020
Why?

01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.440
Well first off he's contradicted himself in his own quotes.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:57.420
He says we haven't seen a dev kit or anything like that and he also says that the Xbox 360

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.420
is capable of more.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.360
How do you know it's capable of more if you haven't received the final kit yet?

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:05.040
He said that, from what I read, that his group hasn't received a dev kit.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.400
They did say there was a dev kit because of all the cursing coming from the room it was

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
located in.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.320
Yeah, but it's not a final system yet.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320
That doesn't mean anything.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.880
They don't even have any working, you know, demos.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.720
They're all just live renders and that's it.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.560
So I think it's a bunch of crap.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.960
I think someone's bitter because someone bad mouthed Sony and got fired for it.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.520
Oh, book deal.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.520
Good for you.

01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:27.840
I don't think anyone's going to be buying that one.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.720
Actually, I do believe it is a state law that as long as you do not break your NDA, you

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.960
are entitled to state whatever you want to as long as you are not using your company's

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.080
facilities to do it.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.720
As long as you are posting this as yourself through your own private means.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.800
That's actually in several HR handbooks for different companies I've worked for within

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.800
the state.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.760
At the same time, if he's not a contracted worker, though, most companies have policies

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.400
that we can terminate your employment for any reason we feel like.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.760
But saying that they were doing it over breaking NDA, I think that that's a bit extreme.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.040
The last quote on here is, I guess the new rule for me is don't ever say anything about

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:07.040
anything.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.040
Ever.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.040
Ever.

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.040
Oops.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.040
Too late.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040
When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.280
Gee, you thought that wasn't a bad idea?

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.560
I mean, come on.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560
I know.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.240
In retrospect, I think that it was a really bad idea for him to speak out about it because,

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:28.320
mean seriously he works for a company that he had his post pre-screened but

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.960
that's not gonna do anything I mean that would be like almost as dumb as saying I

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.000
didn't think yelling that I had a bomb in an airport was a bad thing come on I

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.480
checked with the airport this is okay I was just exercising my you know freedom

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.640
of speech all right let's move on speaking of freedom of speech not really

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:51.940
though extra for one reason we had to have you on the show tonight is because

01:16:51.940 --> 01:16:56.080
you you watch American Idol an awful lot right I love you some American Idol I

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.180
don't but I still watch it it's like crack I don't know why did you catch the

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.220
video game somewhat video game or at least anime related reference on

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:07.940
American Idol this week I didn't get this there was this guy who auditioned

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:12.100
on American Idol check out what he did for his audition

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:18.780
What is up with Austin, man?

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:22.620
Yes, he sang the Jigglypuff song for his audition.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:26.100
You remember the Jigglypuff, like from Pokemon, they'd sing the song and put everybody to

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.220
sleep and then you'd draw on your face with a marker?

01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:31.340
What the hell was he thinking?

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:32.700
He just wanted to be on TV.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.700
TV time.

01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:38.700
Remember, in Super Smash Brothers Melee, the sleep attack is the most powerful attack in

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:39.700
the game.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:40.700
It's true.

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:43.740
bitch anything though that was creative editing like maybe he like the producers

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.280
got him to do that and then like spliced in the reaction do that all I know him

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:52.740
on though they do that stuff that show so fake it is we're not everybody that

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.700
shows up at those locations get picked reject reject fault icons right Jamie

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:04.060
yes all of them and set them on fire all right unless they're crack in that case

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.420
watch American Idol and hate it every minute of it but still watch it Loki

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.500
take us to a new topic what's going on with Dragon Quest it's selling like hot

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.460
cakes the Dragon Quest series actually Dragon Quest 8 has crossed the four

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:24.100
million units mark of worldwide shipments and this figure also includes

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:30.420
430,000 shipped to US making it probably one of the best RPGs sold last year

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:35.060
anyways of course this means that the future of the Dragon Quest series in

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:41.060
America is very bright and of course they are planning on doing more sequels

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:46.340
as well as you do have the Dragon Quest Yargas coming out here pretty soon so

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:54.060
Sounds good! I could definitely use another RPG series. Sounds good.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:57.700
You know Dragon Quest is a game that was really big in Japan of course like huge

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:01.660
huge series in Japan that's now catching on over here but that takes us into the

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:06.460
final story for this segment why is it the Japanese games do well over here but

01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:10.420
American games don't do so hot over there I was reading a joystick with a Q

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.420
this week and they were talking about you know some talk on the internet about

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:20.940
this stuff saying basically that if you notice the top 100 best-selling games in

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:28.780
Japan for 2005 only one of them was made for America in comparison the u.s. market

01:19:28.780 --> 01:19:34.040
has a much greater demand for Japanese titles.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.860
The article goes on to say, the cause of this problem appears to be the result of a combination

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:42.380
of ignorance and apathy from American publishers towards the Japanese market.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:46.300
Whereas Japanese publishers are willing to go the extra mile and carry out excellent

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.480
localizations, their American counterparts seem reluctant to even bother getting their

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:52.760
games translated to Japanese.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.860
As a result, the Japanese market is flooded with a multitude of bad American titles mixed

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.640
in with the gains that the Japanese public should be buying.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.640
Thoughts?

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.640
That's America's fault.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640
Thoughts?

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.640
That's been happening for years.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:09.580
I mean, it's just been going on.

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:16.600
They're relying on, you know, if it's from the fact from a corporate standpoint that

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:20.680
they're saying business-wise there is this apathy and they are not taking any steps to

01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:24.360
change it, well, of course, it's going to stay the same.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:31.000
gonna have no incentive because based on numbers there hasn't been any past

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.440
precedent to try to tailor the games to the Japanese market if they're not

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:40.140
buying them anyway but I think that as typical with corporate America they

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:45.800
don't seem to realize the reason behind it all they see are their figures good

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:53.260
point okay anything you want to yeah we just have to you know look at the games

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.740
or the movies and stuff that are coming out over here.

01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:00.400
I mean that's a perfect example of the difference between Japanese and

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.400
American stuff. You've got really crappy video game movies coming out, I mean, and

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.080
then look at

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:08.440
Japanese market, they have really kick-ass, you know, movies based on

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:11.660
anime series and games and whatnot.

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:15.240
But yeah, American movies do very well in Japan. Isn't Titanic their highest grossing

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:15.840
movie too?

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.160
Yeah, but the whole thing is though, let's look at some of these games that are coming out over here.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:19.640
Okay, like

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:23.000
Forza Motorsport or something like that, a very American game.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.080
didn't do so well over in Japan because it, you know,

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.320
or not Forza, what am I thinking of?

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.020
Project Ophthalm 3 did really well over here,

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.680
but not so well over there. Ridge Racer, you know, kicked ass over there because

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:40.700
Ridge Racer is just clearly a better game anyways. But now,

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.480
the whole thing is, I think people, it's like,

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:47.880
ooh, graphics, they're so amazing, the graphics are so amazing, yeah, but the

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.080
game sucks.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:54.400
that's the problem is need we need to focus more on gameplay over here in

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.000
America

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.040
whereas you know right now we're focusing on who can you make the coolest

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.600
graphics and you know

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.920
sound stuff like that we just completely lose sight on

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.680
the game being good. There's been some good games to come out of here though some

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.240
excellent stuff World of Warcraft

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:13.040
uh Halo yeah those games are doing you know pretty well

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:17.800
Grand Theft Auto I don't think that does well over there does I have no idea

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:20.340
Well, no, probably not.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.400
Interesting.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.360
But they probably don't do much to localize it, really.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.200
No.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.040
It's kind of a tough title to localize, wouldn't it be?

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:29.700
All right, I'm sure those of you guys in the chat room

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:31.120
and who are listening to us on the podcast

01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.240

We'd love to hear it.

And speaking of the next segment,

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.880
