Tonight, February 5th, 2006, new details emerge on the PlayStation 3.
Do American games always fail in Japan?
And a special ode to Kingdom Hearts.
Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
It is February 5th, 2006.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Say hello also to the one and only Loki.
Hi, how you doing?
Bad Rob!
Bad Rob!
Printer sucks!
Let me set up a little background.
I know we're a video game show, but let's face it, we've got to talk about our personal lives once in a while too.
Okay, I just bought a cheap printer today because for work I'm going down to LA on Monday and I have to fly out at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Well, I'm flying Southwest.
You know how Southwest has those boarding pass systems where depending on what time you print your boarding pass from the internet, you get an A, B, or C pass, right?
So I bought a printer so I could have myself an A-pass.
Well, I screwed up.
I thought you couldn't print your passes until after midnight.
And then, like, literally 30 minutes before the show, I realized, oh, crap, you can actually print them up to 24 hours in advance.
So I'm hooking up the printer in this furious frenzy, and now the damn thing won't even print.
And Loki's stuck over there because I have his computer frozen up with the boarding pass sitting there.
Yeah, because this wonderful printer that you bought didn't come with a black cartridge because that would have been too expensive.
And the printer's like, no, I don't want to print without a black cartridge.
Fuck!

Let's not talk about my personal crises for a minute.
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and how that's been going.
And we'll start off with a lovely DarkSakura with.
How was your gaming week?
I'm staring at the pretty precious.
I have in my hands Kingdom Hearts 2, which I've been playing a little bit of enough to realize that Ruxus sucks and that I'm glad that I don't have to use him the entire game.
Um...
It's very interesting.
It looks very, very pretty on my TV.
Except it's still on the PS2, so it's got jaggedies all to hell and back.
But the CG scenes look really pretty.
I loves me some Kingdom Hearts.
Yep.
I've also been playing lots of Animal Crossing, of course.
And Dan picked up Maverick Hunter X, the Mega Man X remake.
and it's pretty damn cool.
I mean, they completely redid the game for the PSP.
It's fabulous.
And also, if you beat the game, you get to get this little sort of OAV of how things led up to the situation.
Actually, the dubbing in it is not horrendous, which surprises the hell out of me.
It's very, very well done.
I'm very pleased.
And then you can play as the first guy that you fight, whose name eludes me at present, but he looks like Boba Fett.
And that's the Japanese copy that you have?
No, the American one.
Wow.
Maverick Hunter?
Oh, Maverick Hunter, never mind.
Yeah, I was wondering how I was playing it then purchased at a GameStop.
No!
No, no, I was talking about Kingdom Hearts.
Go back to the boarding pass, Loki, make it work.
What about Kingdom Hearts?
That's the Japanese one.
Yes, this is the Japanese one.
Okay, okay, I'm up to speed.
Yes, this is the Japanese one.
And how does that, um, how is that?
Is it beautiful?
I said it was pretty, but jaggedy.
Well, yeah, I mean, just, you can understand.
It's fun.
It actually plays more like Devil May Cry.
Really?
In fact, you want to play this game on as hard of a level as you can, or you will not level up high enough to beat Sephiroth by the time you get to him.
Puzzle Fighter Game Boy Micro
which when you're sitting in a waiting room having your eye checked out after it is swollen from an allergic reaction to a dog which I will be getting to later on in the show and your eye is in searing, throbbing pain it's very hard to look at a Game Boy micro screen I tortured myself for my art alright, that it?
my eye still looks like I got punched in it
I didn't even notice.
Oh, okay, a little bit.
It's not that bad.
At least it's not as bad as it was Friday because I looked like a Romero reject.
It was all like red bloodshot and then like that clear green that they only give zombies.
Okay.
So, yeah, I looked like a Romero reject.
Which means we have to cut off her head.
No, which is, nobody in this room is in any danger of me eating their brain.
Oh, that's refreshing.
Thank you.
Good, I'm glad.
Yeah.
I have a night elf, a level 38 night elf
on the Malfurion server, and I also have a level 29 druid on the Spinebreaker server that I've been playing with.
And they are mucho fun to play with, let me tell you.
How are the guilds that you've been joining up in the game?
Lots of drama.
I swear, I didn't know that all of this drama in the world of video games existed.
There's a bunch of drama queens in World of Warcraft.
Totally.
I got invited to a guild not too long ago on the Spinebreaker server, and the leader kept on giving me gifts or whatever.
He was enticing me with gifts.
And...
Suddenly, like, last night I'm playing, and I knew that there was a little bit of drama.
It didn't have anything to do with me or anything like that in the guild.
And two people were kicked off recently.
And then the leader himself left, the guy who invited me.
So I'm like, you know, I didn't even talk to anybody really on that guild anyway.
And the only guy I talked to was the guy who was giving me things.
So I was like, you know, screw this guild.
And I left.
And then Shane invited me to his.
or Miklatov, which you guys all know.
Yeah, he was here last week.
And stuff.
Exciting.
All right.
Loki, do you want to stop fighting with my new printer for a minute to tell us about your gaming week?
No, but I will.
Okay.
I didn't play too much.
I played Ridge Racer 6 a lot, as well as some more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories and a little bit of Animal Crossing.
and that's pretty much it.
Didn't play too much Call of Duty, really busy week, so.
Lots of Ridge Racer though, I love that game.
I'm having a little bit of an off night tonight, if you can't tell.
Haven't you had an off week?
Kinda, you know, there's more drama.
Let me talk about my gaming week, because there's even more drama.
Yeah, what games have you not been playing, Rob?
That would be anything on the Xbox 360.
Oh, wow, what happened?
Let me talk about what happened.
I got my Xbox 360 this week.
I did.
I finally found the Xbox 360.
I used the Best Buy locator thing that we talked about on the show a couple weeks ago, and I found out that a Best Buy had the Xbox 360 in stock, so I ran over there to a Best Buy, and they were out of premiums already at that point, but I managed to score myself a core system.
Yes!
So I bought a core system and the clerk was really nice and she gave me, it was really weird, like she had little slips of paper that had core written on it and the manager's signature and I had to take that up to the counter to get one of the core systems unlocked out of the gate and get my little core system to take home and play.
So, you know, cool.
And I picked up Cameo and Dead or Alive 4.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's a beautiful looking game.
It has lots of boobs.
It does.
It has lots of boobs.
And the environments are huge.
I love the stages in that game.
It's so great.
It's almost like free walking anywhere.
I like the Mexican wrestler.
Does he have boobs?
She.
No, she.
And yes.
I like the all-American girl with the huge knockers.
Yeah, Tina.
I like her.
She was my favorite.
And her dad, Hulk Hogan.
My best character, though, was the geisha.
Kokoro or whatever.
She's the best.
Her name means heart.
That's right.
And they all had mega boobs?
Yeah, they all had mega boobs.
It was awesome.
Wow.
So anyway, Dead or Alive 4, awesome.
So pretty.
Here's the problem.
Oh, and I download stuff on Xbox Arcade, too, like Joust, which was awesome.
I played Joust co-op online in battle.
That was fun.
And I played... What else did I download on there?
Oh, Geometry Wars, which was a lot of fun, too.
Just like what everybody says.
Yeah, so much fun.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One of the little lights in the lower right-hand corner is flashing red.
I look at the TV, and it says, System Error.
Contact Microsoft Support.
Code E74.
And I was like, the fuck?
I just bought this thing.
What the hell is wrong with it?
So I said, okay, you know what?
Maybe it's just a bad time.
I'll just let it rest.
I'll try it again.
So I let it rest, tried again.
Still didn't work.
Unplugged all the cords, replugged them all back in.
Still didn't work.
I thought, okay, maybe my system's not getting enough ventilation, so I'll put it out in the open.
Okay, unplug all the cords, totally resituate my Xbox 360, plug it back in, still doesn't work.
Okay, maybe my Xbox 360's just being moody.
So I said, okay, fine, I'll try this again Friday when I get home from work.
So I tried again Friday when I get home from work, still nothing, still broken.
Not even a day and a half after owning my Xbox 360, it broke, and it has not worked since.
This is not one of those like reading it on the internet where, oh, look at some poor schmuck who their Xbox 360 broke right off the bat.
It was me.
Me.
My Xbox 360 broke.
I didn't do anything to it.
I didn't move it between the last time I played it because I went to a friend's house, came back, and powered it on.
The same place it was.
There was nothing possible I could have done to break this system.
Except for the Coke spilled on it.
No, not even that.
And also the lemonade.
No, nothing.
When I say lemonade, I mean...
Stop it.
Anyways, no, I was just going to say, you know, I know, I know.
And your reaction was priceless because you were laughing.
I was like, I thought you would be just like, you know, scary, you know, moody Rob, but you were actually like,
I can't believe this.
I think it was disbelief or something like that.
Because, like most of you out there, I'd read the stories on Joystick and Dig and Kotaku about, you know, oh, these poor bastards, their Xbox 360s broke right after they bought them, and, huh, happened to me!
And now you have to wait for a box.
I think the only thing you're really going to be able to do is send it back so we can take a look at it and work on it.
And the whole process takes a week.
Because obviously they have this thing down to a science right now, fixing these broken Xboxes, because apparently there's a ton of them out there.
So I'm now waiting for a box to come to me from Microsoft so I can send back my Xbox 360.
So, everybody out there... Do not play with the box.
No.
Take what happened to me as a lesson.
Honestly.
Think twice before you buy an Xbox 360 because obviously Microsoft has tons of issues right now and I'm sorry if I sound a little bitter but I am because I spent like $500 of my hard earned money on this system and the cords and the games and all that garbage for nothing.
The damn thing broke.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I did nothing.
I'm an intelligent gamer.
I've been playing games since God knows when.
I know what to do and what not to do with the system.
I know do not put a new system.
Don't put it on top of other things so you can't ventilate.
I didn't do anything bad with the system.
The system was faulty from the start.
Although I'm wondering though if it's not just something simple wrong with it because usually it's the three lights flashing that's bad.
One light flashing, I'm not sure.
It's kind of like
Code Red, Code Yellow
Excuse me, but I think I have a reason to be.
I think you saved up your moodiness for tonight.
I did.
Well, now, and this whole printer malfunction thing just has me even more on edge with the whole thing.
That's what you get for rearranging my stuff.
Shut up.
I'm not in a good mood now.
Aw.
Angsty.
Hate.
Rage.
Fire.
Burn.
Slash comfort.
Slash burninate Microsoft.
I'm so mad.
Maybe I'll be in a better mood once the damn thing's fixed.
I'm going out of town tomorrow.
So I said, that's what you get for playing with a box.
Let's move on to some gaming news.
Let's talk about something else.
I don't want to open with an Xbox 360 story tonight because I'm a little pissy.
So I want to open with something else.
So somebody give me a story on something else.
Loki, please tell me you have a story not related to Xbox 360.
Um, so anyways, with the 360, no.
Ah!
We do have a story talking about the Revolution and it's low, low prices.
So crazy.
Analysts say that the Revolution is supposed to be priced between $200 and $250, which is pretty cool.
Kind of what we already figured though.
Of course, Revolution will be launched likely by November.
Looking good, especially since all the other systems out there cost
Over, you know, $400, so that's not good.
Or, you know, $299 for a core system that doesn't even come with the frickin' cords that I need for my TV.
Yeah, $299, but you need a lot of stuff in order to... I love how only with the core system do you get the ever-rare composite cables minus the S-Video.
If you want S-Video, you gotta pay another $29.99.
Mm-hmm.
Not happy.
Not happy.
I'm sorry, if I sound anti-Microsoft tonight, usually I try to be very unbiased when it comes to this whole thing.
And I would say overall our listener base, because I'm watching the chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.
And our listener base, usually they dog on Microsoft.
I don't see too many people dogging on Sony or Nintendo.
And usually I stick up for Microsoft.
And I say, you know what, let's be fair to all the systems.
And Microsoft does that.
Nope, tonight, free reign.
Bash Microsoft all you want.
I don't care.
I'm turning a blind eye to it.
I don't care.
Jamie, do you care?
Let him bash Microsoft tonight.
I don't care.
What?
Mine works.
I don't care.
Mine doesn't.
Therefore, I'm angry.
I bring mine to work every day.
Should I open my wound a little more so you can pour some more salt in there?
My box is inside of a bag out there and I actually bring it and toss it in the back of my car every day.
I don't know.
It was one of those rare cases that it worked.
I'm going to stick that fucking ferret in the box.
I'm going to put Senior Burrito in the box.
I don't get how they don't know what's wrong with it.
They're supposed to be spending more time on quality control.
I don't know if maybe Joe Quality Control was taking a break when your Xbox came down the line.
Maybe he was taking a piss and that's why Rob's Xbox doesn't work.
It worked for a little bit.
Here's what I don't get about the Xbox problems.
You'll be playing the system fine.
You shut it off.
Okay, everything's peachy.
You come back.
It doesn't turn on.
What?
You know, it's like, the Xbox can't break itself when you're not playing it.
I mean, that's really stupid.
Just know that you're supposed to watch water sports on the TV with your Xbox 360.
Not actually use your Xbox 360, you know, in the whole...
Let's see some of the fury in the chatroom.
Let's see if I have any supporters in chat right now.
I'm looking at chatroom here.
Let's see.
Dark Knight says, Rob, it had Windows 3.1 in it.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Let's see.
What do we have?
We have Rini says, In communist Russia, 360 breaks you.
I hear that George Bush runs on Windows.
Jaded2006 says, Actually, I'm only biased to Microsoft.
And tonight, I don't care.
Fine.
Go ahead.
Be more towards Microsoft.
DarkLionXVI says, That's why I never buy anything Microsoft.
Oh, and now here we go.
Here we go.
I'll see.
Now Tony is saying, I will dog on Sony.
And says, Luminous overrated.
PSP square button hurt.
Rini also wants to know, does Sky have a period tonight?
If I do, I have a good reason.
He has PMS all the time.
Just don't read too much into it.
Rob has PMS.
Putting up with Microsoft shit.
There you go.
Thank you.
Bravo.
I shake your hand, lady.
That was pretty good.
Smartest thing ever said on this show.
Hey!
I've said plenty of smart things.
No, I said smartest thing ever said on this show.
DarkSakura, speaking of Sony.
Why do we invite you on this show, Extover?
We know it's going to go down the toilet when...
Because every so often we need bleached asshole humor.
Because tonight I don't care.
I don't care tonight.
Rob is Mr. PMS apathy.
Let this be a bad show.
It'll match my mood.
I don't care.
Hey!
DarkSakura, save us and make this a quality show with a good story on Sony.
Sony and Microsoft recently... Oh.
Kill!
Okay.
Basically, we've got news about the PS3.
Yay.
Hooray, PS3, my butt.
Good.
Does it work?
That would be exciting news.
Well, we will be hearing interesting things about the current dev kits, but that's coming up in a little bit.
They're making a new online service called the PlayStation Network that's supposed to take basically what Xbox Live is doing and take it another step.
There will be an iTunes-like store that you can download films and music from.
You can use the console as a location free player.
So you can upload stuff from your PS3 onto your PSP and watch Blu-ray and DVD movies on your handheld.
Also, the PS3 will act as a digital video recorder.
You can save your television programs like you would with TiVo.
You also would be able to control the DVR function using your PSP.
As announced earlier, it'll play Blu-ray, but that's not going to really affect the price all that much.
It's supposed to...
They said that the Cell and RSX were going to be able to take care of most of it, so instead of paying the big prices you would for just a Blu-ray machine, instead you're just going to pay pretty much top console price, where you're looking at.
Of course, we haven't gotten an official word on what exactly that price is going to be.
Other couple things is that the dev kit was running faster than they predicted and that there are a bunch of games in development that they're putting out publicly for now.
Also, the PS3 should be getting regular firmware functionality updates like the PSP does.
One thing nice I'll say about Microsoft for the 24 hours or so that my system worked, I actually really liked how you could go online and download trailers.
Because I have a high-def TV, so I downloaded the X-Men 3 trailer and the Mission Impossible 3 trailer and watched it on the TV.
And I thought it was beautiful.
And there's no pixelation or anything.
I thought it was great.
So hearing that Sony is developing something similar, especially when you consider that Sony also has a major movie outlet and stuff with their iTunes-style store, that sounds pretty exciting to me.
There's also another thing that was stated, which a few people I'm sure should find exciting.
U.S.
developers have been told to prepare for a fall release.
So it should be sometime this year, which means that everywhere else in the world will have to wait until, what, summer 2007, while Japan has been playing it for most of the year.
Loki, do you have anything to add to this story about PlayStation 3?
Yeah, we'll be lucky to see it this year.
Really?
What makes you say that?
Really?
You think so?
People need to realize that just because it's a new console system does not mean that they need to pay $60 per game for stuff.
Just wait a couple weeks and it'll go used.
Any other comments on PlayStation 3?
You guys excited?
I'm trying not to be excited.
I'm containing my excitement.
I wish it would come out this year.
I mean, the longer they wait, it's kind of...
But you know what?
Here's what I've learned.
If they'll release a system that works, it's worth the wait.
Here's the race.
Which will come out first?
PlayStation 3 or Advent Children?
I don't know.
I don't know.
All right.
Let's go to a completely different topic.
Oh, look.
Look, I got a Microsoft story.
I'm so excited.
Actually, not really because it's cross-platform.
So I'm specifically addressing the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of Final Fantasy XI tonight.
and Final Fantasy XI recently had this big crackdown on gill sellers.
The other day, folks logged in and noticed if you did a scan of some of the very popular regions where folks usually are doing their gill farming, such as Kuftal Tunnel, because that's an area where you can camp Amunet or something like that.
Amimet?
Amimet?
Amimet?
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I left the game a few months ago and now they're finally cracking down on this stuff?
Things that could have been done yesterday, I don't know if it's because of the impending Microsoft rollout that they thought, oh, maybe now's a good time to pay attention to what's going on here.
Or maybe with the expansion, or I don't know what.
Maybe they don't want to hear about it at their upcoming expo, but they finally banned all these guild sellers.
Good riddance!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I did hear a rumor that the beta players would be able to transfer their characters over.
Well, goody for them.
Which would be cool, but I'm not going to buy it.
I would have loved to participate in the beta, but I can't right now.
Want to know why?
Want to know why?
I know why.
The other thing is the beta sign-ups are over, so there's double reasons.
You're double screwed.
Hooray.
It doesn't matter.
You didn't miss out on anything.
You loaded it up and you're like, wow, this looks exactly like the other one on the PC and on the PlayStation 2.
I wanted to see it on my pretty high screen, or high screen, high def, wide screen TV.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Well, a couple things.
First off, gay rights groups are calling Blizzard saying you need to change your World of Warcraft policies to basically be more clear on the different types of things.
Basically, the whole thing is they're saying that promoting a gay or lesbian friendly guild as harassment is just retarded and
You know, understand that the rules are in place for certain things, but they're kind of, the rules are too broad.
And so that, you know, they're using this to basically use it as it's not intended, so.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I guess they kind of have come out and said where they stand, but they really need to clarify this because they are looking a little hypocritical with the, you know, slash silly that we talked about last week.
Basically, the comment was Stowall, a group founded in 1989, a professional lobbying group campaigning for the rights of lesbians and gay men and bisexuals.
Their spokesperson, Jonathan Finney, said, this attempt to create a safe and gay-friendly environment should be welcomed, not blocked.
and hopefully this is just a misunderstanding and would encourage Blizzard to review their policies and make sure that it has an effect or has an effect where it needs to be.
It's been over a week now.
I don't know if Blizzard's ever really going to do anything else on this.
I think they're just going to kind of let this keep going.
I would have thought if Blizzard was going to say something, we would have really heard it by now.
Besides, you know, we did get a clarification on a message board, but it wasn't good enough.
So, I don't know.
Xtifer, have a comment?
I was just going to ask you, Rob, didn't you report people in the general chat?
No, I didn't.
I was going to do it, and then I couldn't really figure out.
It was too complicated.
I know, I shouldn't have backed down, but I did.
I mean, the thing is, aside from that, though, is that
These people are saying all kinds of things in the general chat or whatever that are just really inappropriate.
It's just blasphemous.
It doesn't have any place in the game or whatever, and yet
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and so far I noticed the roleplay folks happen to be more mature.
At least in my experience.
It might just be the particular servers I've been picking, but in general, the roleplay server has been more mature overall and you don't get that bullshit Chuck Norris talk in the middle of town and stuff.
That isn't happening.
I don't know if it's because the server's new as well.
I tried out a new RP server.
I don't know.
But to be honest, the longer Blizzard goes without addressing this, I don't know how much longer I really want to keep playing this game.
Keep in mind that in the strict RP servers, you are not allowed to be out of character.
At all.
You can get kicked, basically, if they catch you being blatantly out of character without any sort of specific comment toward being out of character.
I actually roleplay a mute character because I don't ever talk to people.
I roleplay a mute character.
and I'm doing a very good job, actually.
I play an undead and all I say is brains.
Brains.
You dork.
All right.
Is there another follow-up regarding the whole concepts of sexuality in this MMO, Loki?
There is.
In Blizzard, there is basically a chat log posted about
and so on.
was trying to point out where is this actually in the documents here.
And the whole issue of the thing is that other players might not be mature enough and might take offense to this or start harassing other players, saying like, this night elf is camping my ass or something like that.
And so, you know, their excuse is basically, well, there's some players in World of Warcraft that aren't mature enough for this game, and so they might, you know, start harassing people, so therefore we can't, you know, give them some, it's basically, you know, they're saying they're flame bait, is, yeah.
So, clarify this for me, because this is something I didn't even realize.
Last week when I went off, I didn't even realize this, and I don't know how much longer I want to talk about this this week, but this is new news to me, so this is something new for the argument.
You're saying that male and female characters can get married in the game.
Apparently, I guess.
But I thought sexuality had no place in World of Warcraft.
Well, apparently it doesn't, unless it's heterosexual.
Oh, I see.
So yet another hypocrisy on Blizzard's part.
Oh, okay, just wanted to clarify that.
Thank you.
Not to mention, though, that Blizzard isn't the only MMO out there that doesn't allow gay marriage.
Final Fantasy XI, another one as well.
Yeah, but every Mithra on Final Fantasy XI is a gay man playing it anyway.
Just teasing.
Don't send the hate mail.
Just teasing.
I played one.
I know, I know.
I'm teasing.
Aren't you a gay man?
Shut up!
But no, seriously though, I can let that slide in that case because A, Final Fantasy XI doesn't give a crap about the GLBT guilds and all that stuff.
They let that stuff go on and that's fine.
And they can kind of pass it off as, you know, well, it doesn't really fit the...
The time period of the game.
And I'm okay with that because they don't make an issue of the guilds and the other stuff.
But now I have a problem with World of Warcraft because they've made an issue of all this other stuff saying sexuality has no place in the game, yet they do allow only the opposite sex marriage.
And in Final Fantasy XI, you don't know who's really a boy and who's really a girl, so there's probably same-gender weddings happening all the time, but it's all roleplay anyway, so I've gone cross-eyed.
Ami Damaru Flame says, I sent a message to an admin and I was told that's what ignore is for.
Oh, that's a lovely response.
Thanks, Blizzard.
Yet another inconsistency on Blizzard's part.
Let's see, what was the other one here?
Oh, Robway said, the rule should be no explicit sex talk within WoW, gay, straight, or beyond.
I'd be okay with that if it was consistent.
It's not.
I know, there just needs to be consistency.
Alright, moving on, new topic.
Let's go over to Jamie.
Completely opposite, different topic.
About as far away from this whole WoW debate as we can get.
What's going on, DarkSakura?
I'm sure the entire world really gives a crap about this, but EA signed Tiger Woods for six more years.
Oh, so we will continue to have the Tiger Woods golf games and...
which I don't really get because you know it would be something if they would actually sort of make changes in between the games but you know and this will probably make you happy the Xbox 360 version was supposed to be like crap they didn't it has the least amount of features to it but they have switched to like a whole analog scheme for how they're having it play but still do we need more Tiger Woods games can't he like retire like Madden did
As long as the guy is popular, games with his name attached to it are going to sell.
He is cute.
He's a very respectable sports figure.
I'm not a big sports fan.
I don't really follow any sports.
Everything from golf to football.
Notice how we're doing a show the day of the Super Bowl.
Obviously, I'm not following football.
Tiger Woods strikes me as one of the more respectable types of folks.
I would hit that.
He doesn't have to worry about what the games are going to net him because his golfing is still going to send money rolling in.
Personally, I'd rather play Happy Gilmore's PGA Tour 2006.
That would be a better game.
Moving on.
Thanks for watching!
Nintendo President Satoru Iwata will take time to talk about a couple new revolution details.
Now doubtful he's going to actually show any games in progress.
Probably just going to be little appetizers.
Just little flavorings.
He'll kind of let you smell what's cooking in the kitchen but won't really let you see what's going on there.
But nevertheless, all the Nintendo fanboys in the world are going...
Can't wait, just salivating for more information on the revolution.
Game Developers Conference is the time when there will be some more hints.
March 20th is the day of the Game Developers Conference.
And of course, when the news is unwrapped, we will bring it to you here on the show.
And might possibly be salivating ourselves.
We'll see.
Moving on, Loki, what's going on with the Xbox 360 besides them breaking?
Well, actually, they're working on fixing certain problems with the systems glitching out.
They've actually had a firmware update or dashboard update to fix some of the guide problems that they've been having.
Also increased the accuracy of the last time played thing on there.
Which is kind of cool, I guess.
And then another great feature, disabling the kiosk disk from working anymore.
So trying to stomp out more homebrew.
We talked about that a couple weeks on the show, how the kiosk disk, somebody figured out how to copy it and play it on the Xbox 360, and they would say, oh, it's going to be this new way to expose homebrew.
Well, Microsoft just brought down the fist of justice on that, didn't they?
Well, yes and no.
Yes, they have, but no, they haven't because the actual files are on the hard drive, the update, and you could, in a sense, go back and either edit the update or delete the update and bring that all back.
It's not like a Sony firmware where you flash an actual chip and then you're screwed.
You're stuck with it.
Okay, interesting.
Alright, what's going on for the rest of the year?
What other things is Xbox 360 going to do this year besides break more systems?
Well, they actually have a lot of games coming out.
Do I sound bitter?
I'm sorry, do I sound bitter?
Yeah, just a little bit.
Lots of games have been announced.
There was actually...
Far Cry Instincts Predator
Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball 2 Quake Wars
Lone the Dark, more inspiration for Ruibull, and SSX4.
Pretty much just a whole slew of games, a lot of tie-ins with movies.
Should be a really good year, though.
And that would be, you know what, forget it.
I'm just going to sound more bitter.
Stop being bitter.
I can't.
I can't help it.
That was a lot of money I spent.
Actually, I did have a comment regarding Yui Bull.
I didn't know if it had been addressed about the Metal Gear.
Yeah, we're going to talk about it.
It's coming up a little later.
All right.
Let's go ahead and go on to the revolution.
We're just ping-ponging between all the next-gen systems tonight.
That's all right, though.
You're confusing me.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Try not to go cross-eyed.
I went cross-eyed earlier.
I did that the other day.
See, you're bitter about that.
So you've got that to be bitter about.
No, no, no.
I'm not bitter about it.
It's just I couldn't see for 30 minutes.
Okay.
That was scary.
You couldn't see my Xbox 360 not working.
That's right.
Someone had to email me about that at work.
GameDaily.com posted this list called 10 Obscure Super Nintendo Games That We Want to Play on the Revolution.
I don't really know how newsworthy this is, but it may dig, and I thought it's a good thing to discuss on the show, a nice little topic to kind of bounce around.
I don't know why people always want to make lists, but here it is, another list.
Oh, we're going to be doing a list actually later tonight, so maybe I shouldn't be bashing it too much.
Here's their list of games they want to see playable on the Revolution in a little, like, emulation thing.
Because, of course, you know the Revolution.
You're supposed to be able to play old games on it.
Mario Paint.
Actraiser.
I thought Actraiser was a weird game to put on here.
Because I thought, isn't Revolution only supposed to do the first party games?
Or do we know about... I guess we really don't know if third party.
I guess it would be whichever ones sign on.
Right?
So, we'll see.
I guess it's a possibility.
Earthbound.
Good choice.
UN Squadron.
Moving on down the list, Legend of the Mystical Ninja, also known as Goemon, Desert Strike, Jungle Strike, Urban Strike.
Now even though that's three separate games, they're looping that into one.
Now see, I don't know, because that's more of a Genesis thing.
I attach those games to Genesis for me, but I don't know.
EVO, Search for Eden, Uniracers.
I don't know why that's on that list, but whatever.
I also thought it was weird that they said obscure Super Nintendo games.
I'm like, EarthBound wasn't that obscure.
I mean, sure, they never really, you know, they sat on a
Actually doing a sequel for a long, long time, and now it may not even come out here, but I don't know if it was obscure, but okay, whatever, whatever.
I'll look past that.
Anything that's missing from this list, you think?
Super Nintendo games that we ought to be able to play on the Revolution.
Slightly obscure.
Besides the big ones.
We all know Metroid, Zelda.
Besides the big ones.
Slightly obscure games, at least.
Anything that you think is missing.
I'll say one.
Here's an obscure game I used to love.
I know for a fact this won't be playable on Revolution, though, because it was a Sony game.
Equinox, the sequel to Solstice.
I loved that game.
I'd love to see that, but that's obviously me living in a fantasy world.
Anybody else want to add anything?
What was Equinox?
Did you ever play Solstice on the regular?
I'm having trouble remembering because I remember that.
It was a bit of a puzzle game.
It was like 3D isometric type thing and you kind of walked around.
It had square movements.
StarFox
Okay, yeah, that's a good one, that's a good one.
Definitely a first party title a lot of folks want to see.
Loki, nothing?
You know, I didn't play that many Super Nintendo games, and it's really sad.
I liked Super Mario RPG.
I think that'd be one that they would probably do.
Let's see, other than that, you know, it really wasn't too much.
I was a huge fan of Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is kind of like,
A cheap version of Sonic the Hedgehog.
Wow.
Now that's obscure.
That was one of the first games I had, which is weird.
Freaking Dracula X. But the Super Nintendo port was assy compared to the original.
I think that they could have, it would have been prohibitively expensive because you have this whole other scenario with Maria that they just didn't do.
Maybe they could say, okay, now that we have revolution technology, here's Dracula X the way it should have been.
And of course, all of us who have these $300 copies of Dracula X for PC Engine are going to find their copy now worth $50.
Let's see what the chat room has to say over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Click on chat.
WonderDog Harold says, Zombies ate my neighbors.
Oh, hell yes.
Oh, my God, yes.
I'd like to see a new version of that or put it on Xbox Lives Arcade.
That would be great.
Or Smash TV.
Super Smash TV.
Fire Bulma said Smash TV.
There you go.
Rini says Yoshi's Island.
Yes.
There you go.
Yoshi's Cookie.
PK Akira 88, Yoshi Safari.
Remember the Super Scope one?
Wasn't that the Super Scope one where you run around?
It's all about the mole game.
Where you shot moles with the Super Scope.
I don't remember that.
It was just the generic cartridge that came with it, but there was like the games like Blasterous and something else.
The Super Scope 6 game.
I don't know.
I was pretty ghetto.
I had the Sega Menacer.
Dude, cool.
The Menacer was cool because you could take it apart.
Yeah, it sucked though.
I still have a Menacer.
Really?
All right.
ToeJam & Earl Secret of Mana!
Let's go over and open up the mailbag because DarkSakura, she likes to open up your email and you guys send your emails to mailbag at orangelaundredo.com and she reads them.
And then I have a good laugh.
She laughs at the hate mail and then reads some of the good ones on air.
I don't get hate mail.
I get love mail.
Before we start mailbag, see now they're going to send you hate mail because you said you don't get hate mail.
No, yes I do.
Before we start Mailbag tonight, if I may, on a personal note.
No.
Because I got some emails directly to my personal email address this week.
And, you know, last week on the show, I had a coming out of sorts because I never mentioned, you know, the fact that I was gay until we talked about the World of Warcraft thing.
Although folks who've been listening to the live show knew it for a long time.
I actually thought it was in my bio.
I didn't realize that folks who've been listening to the podcast for so long didn't know it.
So it kind of was a coming out of sorts.
And I just want to say I got some...
really amazing emails of support from people you know from all across it didn't matter if they were straight, gay, you know whatever I just got some amazing emails that really just
Make Me Remember Why I Do This
Like, to me, to my email, which is X-T-O-F-E-R at orangelonsradio.com I will gladly read them and possibly comment on them.
Yeah, except there's a difference.
See, I came out as gay.
You're coming out as an asshole.
A bleached one.
I'm just messing with you.
A bleached one.
Bad joke.
Bad old joke.
I like men, too.
Where was the mailbag?
Oh, yes, there's the mailbag.
Let's move on to the mailbag, shall we, DarkSakura?
Um...
Hi!
Okay.
I actually went over my limit because I got a bunch of emails this week again.
So the first one I'm going to bring up is sent by Malice.
I'm just going to read this as a question actually put forth to us.
I was wondering if you people knew about this.
I wish to know more about it before I purchase it.
Skipping forward, it seems to be a special edition of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas with a 30 minute prologue CG or animation.
It's apparently a budget title as it is $20.
I want to know what you guys think about it before I shell out the cash.
I don't really think anything of Grand Theft Auto, so...
I defer to Loki because I don't really play these games either.
It's just the platinum hit or greatest hits or whatever version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because they've sold millions and millions of copies.
So it came out at a new low price of $19.95.
And that's all it really is.
And of course, every now and then, the new trend now, especially with Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, they release little added features as well on top of dropping the price of the game.
A little extra something.
For me, I'm going to be honest, even though I understand why the game gets a lot of critical praise and all that stuff, it's kind of one of those games that's fun for me for a couple days and then I'm kind of tired of it.
It is a game that you can literally play up, pick up, play the missions, or just fuck around.
And it's really cool.
It's really fun.
San Andreas is definitely the best one in the series so far.
So, I mean, $20 for that game, you can play it for hours and hours and not get bored of it.
I highly recommend it.
The storyline is really good in it too.
Plus you get a main character named Jizzy.
No, it's CJ.
Oh, I thought it was Jizzy.
No, it's not Jizzy.
I'm calling him Jizzy.
That's only in the hot coffee mod.
Alright, next email.
Okay, this one comes from MisaSky.
It's titled Fantasy Star Universe vs. Final Fantasy XI as in EKS, EYE.
I thought that was cute.
Um...
Hello, I love the new format you guys are giving the show, and I kind of want you to debate on something if you can.
A couple months ago, I got Final Fantasy XI for my PC.
My father would allow me to play as long as I got good grades, so there's my copy of Final Fantasy XI sitting in the corner, crying and gathering dust.
I also recently found out about the new Corsair job, and I think it looks pretty.
I would buy and play the game just because of the sexy outfits for the Corsair job.
Now, I have recently gotten back with my PSO community, and they are getting ready for Phantasy Star Universe.
This game, too, is also very sexy, mainly because of all the new weapons and new character creator.
I would like to stick with one MMO, but they seemed so good.
I have $70 to waste importing PSU from my...
Station of Playing 2 is looking very good right now.
So what do you think?
Well, it's tough because I haven't really played Phantasy Star Universe.
I played a little bit at the E3 demo kiosk, but I can only really go off my experience with Phantasy Star Online and how it might be a little bit different.
Here's the thing.
Here's the biggest difference between the two games.
It's basically fundamentally how the attack systems work.
In Phantasy Star, you hit a button to literally swing your sword, so it's more of an action-based MMO.
Whereas in Final Fantasy XI, you're auto-swinging your sword and you're doing other things with that, such as your weapon skills or your magic or whatever.
It's more of a quote-unquote traditional-style RPG game.
in MMO form.
It's a little hard to explain.
It's not like other Final Fantasies at all because the battle system is so much different.
Although if you played the 12 demo, it's kind of similar to the 12 demo.
Thank you for watching!
I'd say go play World of Warcraft.
Stop.
No, seriously, if you want a cool, actual good game, I mean, play World of Warcraft.
Stay away from Final Fantasy XI because it'll just make you sad.
Well, at least don't be a white mage.
Was your experience... Because you become the bitch of the party.
Yeah, but same thing with a priest in WoW.
Did you have a bad experience with Final Fantasy XI, Extover?
Well, it just seemed like every single time...
Let me just give the game a little bit of credit, because I did actually enjoy playing it a lot.
But the thing is, it just got really tiring on having to try and find a party all the freaking time.
And also, when I was in a party, it was just like drama.
It was just so much drama.
I'd rather deal with drama in a guild on World of Warcraft where I can just leave it and say, you know...
Screw you guys, I'm going home.
You know, whatever.
But, like, on Final Fantasy XI, I mean, you're, like, blackbooked.
If you're, like, really bad in a party without intending to be, people really remember that, and they don't want you in your party anymore.
Alright, next email.
People kept wanting me in their stupid party.
But I hated them, and I let the tank die on purpose.
Because, okay, I told you about the party I was in with the tank who was a jerk.
I let him die.
There's jerks in every game.
The rest of the party thanked me.
There's jerks in every game.
Next up comes from... Okay, for a moment I could not hear myself on the microphone.
This one comes from Steve, who... Hi, Steve!
I think I'm going to start doing that with all the people that email us.
I'm going to say hi to them.
So, hi, Steve!
Steve is... Actually, I'm going to say right now a very kind soul.
Mm-hmm.
For other reasons we might discuss later.
But he was actually sending me questions looking for information on Judy Crystal about other songs that she did.
And I had sort of been into Judy Crystal for a little bit, but not like majorly, majorly.
But basically Judy Crystal did God of Romance in DDR.
Here's a little clip of God of Romance, just in case you're not unfamiliar with Judy Crystal.
Yes.
Summer is a place where we have to be Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy Okay Which is actually a remake of Romance of Nokami-sama Uh-huh Which I've played in pre-shows before Maybe I'll put it in next week's pre-show But at any rate, she also did Tokyo Already, Baby Love Me, You Can't Hurry Love And Nori, Nori, Nori
Oh yeah, yeah, mm-hmm.
JB, way back when.
He was a big Judy Crystal fan.
Oh, that's right.
I'll try to hunt him down if he still keeps up with us.
I think I know where to find him.
Ask me again offline.
I'll tell you where to find him.
Okay.
But yeah, she's been on like a bajillion Parapara compilations, including one of the big ones by the Parapara All-Stars.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
um basically and I had actually intended on going back and making a public apology to the one who I said I didn't think is being very professional over the whole Mac thing being a graphic artist given that Mac is the standard for graphic artists but um there are people who are very prone toward PC maybe had a bad experience with a Mac
I'm not going to even look at Loki right now.
Just call it truce.
Let's keep it moving.
But for the sake of the show, I am no longer joining the debate.
I am going to buy my... I'm actually getting a Mac for my birthday because I intend on being more serious with my art and I'd see that as a natural progression for myself as an artist.
Good for you.
and I say that coffin not only needs to have the last nail shoved into it whatever you're thinking Loki, swallow it and it needs to be set on fire like your Xbox Loki's laughing in the corner there swallow it I'm just saying I don't bring it up every week everyone else brings it up they try to drag me back into this I don't really care you know what
Sorry if it seemed offensive.
I don't aim to offend, but that was how I felt that it just sort of blindsided me because every professional graphic artist I know, and I know a lot of them.
I live in California.
Every last one of them uses a Mac.
So I was just really sort of blindsided by that one.
But that was where I came from.
In defense, a little bit, tiny bit, I don't want to go too far, but I did used to work for a publishing company, and we used both.
We used both.
There's some things PC does better, some things Mac does better, just depends on how you use it.
I use both, and I don't have a preference, actually.
I like both.
I'm actually digging the Mac OS Tiger.
Yeah.
You're bi-computeral?
I am.
You're totally bi?
I am freaking bi.
I'm tri-computeral.
Because I have some Linux love now.
Alright.
Woo!
Anyway.
Anyway, anyway, anyway.
Simultaneous loving, baby.
This is kind of...
I'm going to paraphrase because some of it seems a little bit more personal than I'm comfortable going into.
One of our listeners, James, sent in an email.
Hi, James!
Rob!
You know what, Rob?
I'm going to say this fair to you.
You're going from Mr. Stress, I hate the Xbox, to hi!
I'm trying to turn that angst into something more useful in this world.
It's not useful.
Go back to angst.
Zip it!
Angst is hot.
Except for when it's hot.
Read your email!
That is so hot.
Basically, it was saying that things were fairly rough, and then DDR was out, the DDR Extreme, and I was absolutely addicted to it.
But...
was talking about how it was sort of alienating to you, because when, you know, you know how a lot of us went through that, being, when we played DDR, there was just a, oh, you played that game, you know?
Oh, like the taunting of the other people at the arcades, you know, and like, oh, the, you know, the fags playing DDR, you know, just get over it.
He also said, though, that he was playing in a small crowd gathered around, we all, we know how the crowd goes, and then he met his best friend that way, and has met many more friends through the game.
And I was thinking a lot of us were like that, you know?
We all met through DDR.
I met my very best friend in the universe through DDR.
It's opened all kinds of doors, not just for me personally, for all of us.
We started off as a DDR show.
That was our thing.
We even came up with the concept and the name on the BART going to San Francisco to play DDR at the Metreon.
If that's not nerdy enough.
I'm sorry for paraphrasing it.
I didn't want to give a written response to it until I actually had a chance to read it on the air, but I have to say that good for you.
I also got an email from Danny
Hi Dani!
She writes in and says thank you for the Rick Sanchez interview.
Agreed.
Did GameTamp plant that email?
No, I'm kidding.
That's great.
They'd be very happy to hear that, and I think that's what they're trying to do, so it's great.
I also do think there are a few trusted emulation sites that I know of.
I'm not going to go into them on the air right now.
But you really do, if you're new into the emulation scene, you really do have to wade through piles of crap before you get to the good stuff, you know?
So I actually think that that is a fabulous idea.
And on top of that, I think that a lot of the older games that we're seeing through GameTap had a lot more value to them.
I think these were games where they could not focus on graphics.
These were games that had solid gameplay.
A lot of the ones that are up on there.
A lot of the classics.
I swear, I watch Rob play it all the time, and I'm very impressed.
If I had the money, I would subscribe to it.
But I mean, it's very well done.
I'm actually thinking of doing it.
If it wasn't that I was in school right now, I would totally do it.
But after the show, I get to go home and paint some more.
Two more.
One of them is from Sakurina.
Hi, Sakurina.
We like Sakurina.
Hello, Sakurina.
This has to do with the gate removal thing.
Oh, in Animal Crossing, yes.
Right.
From what I've read on various gaming blogs, the removal of gates is caused by a glitch having something to do with pitfall seeds.
I've read this a couple of places too.
Therefore, anyone who falls into a pitfall somewhere in town could trigger this glitch to remove the gate.
I thought that that would be cleared up in case one of the people in our friend code thread happened to...
have it happen to them.
For the record, we do have an open forum on our website in our forum section for our Animal Crossing players to share friend codes and when you'll have your gate open and blah, blah, blah.
Okay, last one from Mike.
Hi, Mike.
Mike is awesome.
Um,
He said EGM did a top 200 games on their list for their 200th issue.
I actually needed to grab that issue of EGM because I sort of got it out of EGM, but every so often I pick them up just to see what's going on.
But now these were their top 10 games.
Number 10 was Pong.
9 was Grand Theft Auto 3.
8 was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
He said it should be number 1.
7 was Space Invaders, 6 was Super Mario 64, 5 Legend of Zelda, 4 Tetris, 3 Street Fighter 2, 2 Pac-Man, 1 Super Mario Bros.
I saw that.
I actually read the magazine the other day.
That's a pretty good list.
I'm pretty happy with that list as compared to most of these top games of all time lists.
The only one, I'm not big on the Mario 64 as many people are.
I don't know why.
I love Mario 64, but I also have very fond memories of it.
I know a lot of other people are really into it, it's just not my thing.
Honorable Mentions, 12 Metal Gear Solid, 17 Halo, 46 Resident Evil 4, 74 Chrono Trigger, that should be much further up there, 92 Super Smash Bros.
Melee, 196 Guitar Hero, which has been played non-stop in my house all day, 178 DDR, 172 Katamari Damashii, no version of Puyo Puyo,
at all.
And that is a crying shame.
No Final Fantasy mentions.
Well, I'm sure it's in the list.
It's got to be somewhere, but I'm kind of surprised Final Fantasy 7 didn't crack the top 10 a little bit.
But no Peel Peel.
You have to have been paying attention to know that I am like this uber Peel Peel fan.
We had it as Peel Pop, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Kirby's Avalanche.
That breaks my heart.
I'm closing the mailbag.
All right.
Pulling the strings.
Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us some email.
And we might read your email on the air if we feel like it.
One thing that also seems like it's going to happen whenever somebody feels like it is Duke Nukem Forever.
Loki, what the heck is going on with Duke Nukem Forever?
If you believe it or not, it's actually still being worked on.
Right now, they had an interview.
I believe it was on 1UP.
Let's see here.
Yeah, on one up, talking to co-founder of 3D Realms.
And basically, in the interview, they brought up Duke Nukem Forever.
And actually, it says that a lot of it's been finished.
All the guns are finished, and most of the creatures are finished.
And basically, they're putting together the pieces.
So they said it's possible, it's possible, cross your fingers, you might see Duke Nukem Forever coming out in 2006.
We'll see.
I'm looking at chatroom feedback to the top 200 list right now.
Over to OrnisonTrader.com, click on chat.
NintendoManiac64 says, Metroid Prime, Super Metroid.
I think Super Metroid's the game I would have had in the top 10 instead of Mario 64.
Metroid Prime was in the top 200, though.
Super Metroid needs to be one of those emulated games.
Super Metroid needs to be... Yeah, I love Super Metroid.
It recognizes one of the best video games of all time.
It really is.
It's an incredible game.
I think it was in the list, though, too.
I also have very positive memories of Super Metroid because...
I would lay on the couch and watch Dan play all the way through it.
And that was together time over video games.
Aww.
I love that game.
Shut up!
Any type of Metroid game is... Rob.
Yes.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
Rob.
What?
Hi.
Hi, Jamie!
RedRuth.GreenBean.org TildaBen.4cr
slash SMB underscore super underscore synth dot SWF.
It's the Super Mario Brothers Audio Sound Super Synthesizer.
And essentially what they've done on this, and I'm playing with it right now, is they've taken all these sounds from Mario Brothers and basically stripped them all out so that you can make your own remixes.
So I'm going to remix something right here on the air right now.
So here we go.
Let's all do the Mario.
Oops, I fucked up.
Let's all do the Mario, come on it's time to go to Mario I've got a lot of coins, woo, Mario Da da da, swing your hands from side to side See, and I can do this in my room late at night when no one's watching That's the only place you should be doing that Yeah
We'd rather not hear about anything else.
Right.
That subject's over.
Yeah, I won't be doing any more stories this hour.
Let's go over to Loki, who has something of a bit more serious nature.
Yes.
It's another game that's getting more flack from people.
And this one is...
The Association for American Indian Development Calls for the Gun Boycott
What's funny though is they failed to mention that actually in the game the Native Americans are portrayed very positively and also it's very accurate to the time period
The Slaughtering of Renegade Apaches, The Atrocity of the Indian Scalping, and The Misinformation of Indian Traditions of Killing Sacred White Animals
The petition requests that Activision remove all derogatory, harmful, and inaccurate depictions of American Indians from Gun and reissue the game.
Not going to happen because the game is like $29 right now, and if they could sell it cheaper, they probably would.
It wasn't a very good game, just so you know.
On a completely different note, when you work for a game company, you have to sign what's called an NDA, a Non-Disclosure Agreement.
DarkSakura, tell us about the dark side of NDAs.
Are they drug out in the street and shot?
What happens when people violate those NDAs?
Usually just fired.
But there was a former employee of Sony Online Entertainment that was...
He spoke out about criticizing the PlayStation 3 and was fired.
He was an artist, Josh Robinson.
Just to give a quote here, all I really did was write a few paragraphs that gave my opinion on publicly released information.
I didn't reveal any tech info.
I didn't reveal different shipping plans.
I'm still in awe of the whole uproar over what amounts to no information.
Basically, he posted in his blog that says, our game just keeps getting moved back and back and back.
And where is the box?
Where is the final system?
When is it coming out?
No one knows.
And in the meantime, people in the industry are starting to get just a little salty.
You could always tell where the PS3 dev box was because it's the room that had the F-bomb coming out of it half the day.
But he basically got sacked for it.
another quote here I talked with the people on the technical side of the Xbox 360 the consistent comment I am hearing from people on my end is the Xbox 360 is better oh snap they are saying that it is capable of just doing more hmm he also talked to at least two Sony employees who read the blog entry before it was posted and showed it to a producer and he said again another quote we were all in agreement that I was not breaking NDA with what I was saying
They were just upset that he was bad-mouthing him.
Yeah, I think it's more one of those, too.
He tried to find something to sack him with since he opened his mouth and was critical.
How dare he?
How dare he speak the minds of everybody about this subject?
And might I be the first to say the Xbox 360 can be more powerful than the PlayStation 3 all at once, but it's going to have to work first.
There's a little bit more.
Just another quote.
It was something unfortunate to happen.
I sincerely hope Sony isn't damaged by it.
In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the CEO and VP of the company.
Did I knowingly break NDA?
I absolutely did not.
I would never do that and would never want to hurt Sony Online.
Did I dance in the gray area by even opening my mouth?
Yes, I did and I was fired for it.
He did say, however, that he received four or five job offers immediately after leaving Sony and got a book deal as a result of the article.
Loser.
What?
Loser.
Why?
Well, first off, he's contradicting himself in his own quotes.
He says, we haven't seen a dev kit or anything like that, and he also says that the Xbox 360 is capable of more.
How do you know it's capable of more if you haven't received the final kit yet?
He said that, from what I read, that his group hasn't received a dev kit.
They did say there was a dev kit because of all the cursing coming from the room it was located in.
Yeah, but it's not a final system yet.
That doesn't mean anything.
They don't even have any working demos.
They're all just live renders and that's it.
So, I think it's a bunch of crap.
I think someone's bitter because someone bad-mouthed Sony and got fired for it.
Oh, book deal.
Good for you.
I don't think anyone's going to be buying that one.
Actually, I do believe it is a state law that as long as you do not break your NDA, you are entitled to state whatever you want to as long as you are not using your company's facilities to do it.
As long as you are posting this as yourself through your own private means.
That's actually in several HR handbooks for different companies I've worked for within the state.
At the same time, if he's not a contracted worker, though, most companies have policies, we can terminate your employment for any reason we feel like.
But saying that they were doing it over breaking NDA, I think that that's a bit extreme.
The last quote on here is, I guess the new rule for me is don't ever say anything about anything ever, ever.
Oops, too late.
When in doubt, keep your mouth shut.
Gee, you thought that wasn't a bad idea?
I mean, come on.
I know, and in retrospect, I think that it was a really bad idea for him to speak out about it because, I mean, seriously, he works for a company that
He had his posts pre-screened, but that's not going to do anything.
That would be almost as dumb as saying, I didn't think yelling that I had a bomb in an airport was a bad thing.
I checked with the airport, and they said it was okay.
I was just exercising my freedom of speech.
Alright, let's move on.
Speaking of freedom of speech... Not really, though.
Extra for one reason we had to have you on the show tonight is because you watch American Idol an awful lot, right?
I do.
You love American Idol.
I don't, but I still watch it.
It's like crack.
I don't know why.
Did you catch the video game, somewhat video game or at least anime-related reference on American Idol this week?
I didn't.
Get this.
There was this guy who auditioned on American Idol.
Check out what he did for his audition.
Yay!
What is up with Austin, man?
What is up with Austin, man?
I'll bet you anything, though, that was creative editing.
Like, maybe the producers got him to do that and then, like, spliced in the reaction shots.
They do that all the time on that show.
I know they do that stuff.
That show's so fake.
So fake.
It is.
Not everybody that shows up at those locations get picked.
Reject false icons, right, Jamie?
Yes.
All of them and set them on fire.
All right.
Unless they're crack.
In that case, watch American Idol.
And hate it every minute of it, but still watch it.
Loki, take us to a new topic.
What's going on with Dragon Quest?
It's selling like hotcakes.
The Dragon Quest series, actually, Dragon Quest VIII has crossed the 4 million units mark of worldwide shipments.
And this figure also includes 430,000 shipped to U.S.,
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
Dragon Quest is a game that was really big in Japan, of course.
A huge, huge series in Japan that's now catching on over here.
But that takes us into the final story for this segment.
Why is it the Japanese games...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
In comparison, the US market has a much greater demand for Japanese titles.
The article goes on to say, "...the cause of this problem appears to be the result of a combination of ignorance and apathy from American publishers towards the Japanese market."
Whereas Japanese publishers are willing to go the extra mile and carry out excellent localizations, their American counterparts seem reluctant to even bother getting their games translated to Japanese.
As a result, the Japanese market is flooded with a multitude of bad American titles mixed in with the games that the Japanese public should be buying.
Thoughts?
That's been happening for years.
I mean, it's just been going on.
They're relying on
You know, if it's from the fact from a corporate standpoint that they're saying business-wise there is this apathy and they are not taking any steps to change it, well, of course, it's going to stay the same.
They're going to have no incentive because based on numbers,
There hasn't been any past precedent to try to tailor the games to the Japanese market if they're not buying them anyway.
But I think that as typical with corporate America, they don't seem to realize the reason behind it.
All they see are their figures.
Good point.
Loki, anything you want to add?
We just have to...
Look at the movies and stuff they're coming out over here.
I mean, that's a perfect example of the difference between Japanese and American stuff.
You've got really crappy video game movies coming out.
I mean, and then look at Japanese market.
They have really kick-ass movies based on...
Anime series and games and whatnot.
But yeah, American movies do very well in Japan.
Isn't Titanic their highest grossing movie too?
Yeah, but the whole thing is though, let's look at some of these games that are coming out over here.
Okay, like Forza Motorsports or something like that.
A very American game.
Didn't do so well over in Japan because it, you know, or not Forza...
what am I thinking of?
Project Gotham 3 did really well over here, but not so well over there.
Ridge Racer kicked ass over there because Ridge Racer is just clearly a better game anyways.
Now, the whole thing is I think people it's like, ooh, graphics, they're so amazing.
The graphics are so amazing.
Yeah, but the game sucks.
That's the problem.
We need to focus more on gameplay over here in America, whereas right now we're focusing on
Who can, you know, make the coolest graphics and, you know, sound and stuff like that.
And we just completely lose sight on the game being good.
There's been some good games to come out of here, though.
Some excellent stuff.
World of Warcraft?
Halo?
Yeah, but those games are doing, you know, pretty well.
Grand Theft Auto?
I don't think that does well over there, does it?
I have no idea.
Well, no.
Probably not.
Interesting.
But they probably don't do much to localize it, really.
It's kind of a tough title to localize, wouldn't it be?
Hmm.
