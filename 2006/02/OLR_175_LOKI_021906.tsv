13097	14937	Hello everyone, this is Loki.
15218	17598	It is Sunday, February 19th.
17898	24920	This is episode 175, part 1 of 3 episodes that will be coming out this week and next.
25660	28241	Both DarkSakura and Sky are out this week.
28841	31062	Sky is on the east coast cosplaying it up.
32422	34983	And DarkSakura is off visiting relatives.
36023	36463	Anyways...
37139	40241	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
65163	68706	One of those games that you're going to need to have a lot of patience for.
68826	81695	It does get extremely hard towards the end of the game, and really I've been yelling and throwing controllers, so definitely something to think about, but one of the best ones for the 360 so far.
82796	84577	Anyways, let's start things off here.
85298	91302	First up, we've got some news here coming out from Capcom's Gamer Day, and they're
91741	94402	Basically, this is kind of a press-only event that they have here.
94442	97302	They've announced a lot of different games coming out this week.
98122	99123	Let's start off here.
99203	107184	We've got Capcom's Classic Collection Remix, which is kind of a reiteration of the collection that they had on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
107224	113826	Now, for the PSP, one of the other games that we had coming out, which is pretty sweet, is Capcom Puzzle World.
114526	116666	It actually has a bunch of really cool games in it.
116786	120727	The first one being Puzzle Fighter, one of my all-time favorite games for the
121931	123592	PlayStation 2 and Arcade.
124232	127833	The other thing that they've got is Block Block and Buster Brothers.
128313	131634	So if you're a really big puzzle fan, that's going to be one that you're looking for.
132335	136976	That's going to be coming out, looks like, on the PSP, which is going to be pretty sweet.
137576	143398	One of my other favorites that came out of that is going to be the Power Stone collection.
143498	147600	Now, for those of you who haven't played Power Stone, it's actually a pretty sweet arcade game.
147660	149440	It came out in the Dreamcast for a little bit.
149460	150021	They had 1 and 2.
151642	156632	and it's a three-on-three just slugfest basically you collect these
157622	185802	different gems that make you super powerful and you can pull off different moves well they actually are bringing out the collection now on the PSP which is going to have ad hoc multiplayer as well as a bunch of mini games so that's definitely going to be one to look forward to what was missing though was some of the bigger names in games of course that would be Resident Evil 5 and Devil May Cry 4 unfortunately those weren't looks like ready at the time they did
186417	193279	have a big push behind their next-gen games, Lost Planet and the upcoming Mech Assault for the Nintendo DS.
193639	197520	Or actually, it's Mech Assault-style shooter for the 360.
198320	198860	It's kind of neat.
198880	205022	It's kind of reminding me a bit of Resident Evil with mechs in there, so it should be pretty sweet.
205102	211484	And, of course, Dead Rising, the complete ripoff of Dawn of the Dead, but still going to be a pretty cool game.
212358	222927	And finally, one of the last games, also an old-time favorite, is Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins, which is definitely a throwback to the original side-scrolling game.
223547	225429	They've added a few different things this time.
225489	229732	You can actually use a shield, and they have a magic system in there as well.
229772	230753	Should be pretty sweet.
231053	237138	Definitely a lot of support for the PSP this time around, and a couple 360 games, so worth checking out.
238399	238880	Let's see.
239540	239901	Also...
240931	242152	Street Fighter 2 on Xbox Live Arcade
266753	269215	to kind of coincide here with the Xbox Live stuff.
269476	272718	We've got a few more updates coming to some of the games that are already out.
273499	278183	One of them being co-op over Xbox Live for Cameo, which should be interesting.
279724	284548	I'm not sure how that's going to make the game any better, but it should be pretty fun anyways.
284668	289592	And also some more multiplayer maps for Perfect Dark Zero, which should be pretty cool as well.
290233	295017	That game I actually haven't even touched since I bought it, but here it's a pretty good game.
296249	296890	Let's see here.
297590	299852	Some other stuff coming to the 360 later on.
300112	314862	The first thing is going to be Bomberman Act Zero, which is your favorite Bomberman type of game, except this time he's basically on steroids and taking it from a little cartoon character to some hardcore first-person Bomberman game.
315623	319886	Definitely a different take on the whole series, but it should be pretty cool.
321067	321467	All right.
322267	322948	Now, the kind of...
323683	325444	Guitar Hero is coming to the Xbox 360.
325564	326425	Red Octane's Dean Ku told MCV,
346736	350277	That sounds like a lot of rumor to me, but should be still pretty interesting.
350657	354979	One game we do know that is coming out on the 360 is going to be Phantasy Star Universe.
355519	356499	It should be really cool.
356519	364162	They're actually going to be having... where you can interact with the other consoles and be able to transfer your character online.
364242	368863	Different stats are going to be saved on these Sega servers.
369623	374665	And it should actually appear on the 360, which is going to be...
376175	376756	Final Fantasy XI
392557	397300	So speaking of the 360, we do have some news regarding the Xbox shortages.
398020	405684	This time they're blaming the memory chip makers, and one in particular, Infineon, having trouble making the right speed chips.
406625	412468	Peter Moore refused to blame any one particular supplier, but he did blame the shortages on the component shortages.
413088	417630	So, you know, take it as you want, but I think it's a big excuse.
418271	418671	Anyways...
419609	429636	Speaking of the 360 a little bit more, one of the interesting developments that's actually come out of one of the recent edition of the Xbox magazine is DirecTV coming to the 360.
431237	444425	What they're talking about is actually being able to download episodes onto your 360 or possibly being able to use it as a DVR, which they've actually were talking about during this year's CES, so...
445521	446321	GameCube, Twilight Princess
469161	476003	This time is going to be coinciding with the launch of The Revolution, and that's going to be all the way into November again.
476283	478724	One whole year wait for this game.
479604	485626	Now, that's really interesting that they're going to be launching a next-gen system with a current-gen title, but it is official.
486806	494228	Straight from the mouth of the head of marketing, Reggie Fils-Aim√©, told basically...
494926	495666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
516992	526239	Definitely a really good system, and the fact that the price point is going to be cheap as well, but hopefully we're not going to see current-gen stuff on the system, and hopefully they are going to be pushing the envelope a little bit.
527299	536786	Now, speaking about the revolution, Techno's first revolution game has been revealed, and the game actually is going to be sort of a mini-golf affair.
538187	539168	Definitely interesting.
539188	541850	It's coming out here.
542490	546233	Looks like the game's going to be entitled Pena, and it's
547287	550348	The web browser is based on Opera and will support most web features except for Macromedia Flash.
576857	577177	Xbox Live
606148	610853	and it's supposed to be comparable, if not exceeding that, of what is on Xbox Live.
611653	621322	Well, we'll have to see about that since Sony's plan for action for their online service has been very lacking, especially with the PlayStation 2.
622183	627808	Other things, talking about Sony here, the PS3 is definitely not going to have a hard drive.
627968	631131	Yes, a hard drive will be available, but not sold with the system.
631550	641757	They're mainly doing this to keep the cost down on the system, which right now, analysts are saying is going to be upwards of $800 per unit.
642278	649523	Now, whether this is actually going to be passed on to the consumer, that is, you know, us to see, I guess, when it eventually comes out.
650163	655767	Now, the main cost of the unit right now is the Blu-ray drive, which is costing about $350 per
657931	663355	No word on what the official price is going to be when this thing launches but hopefully it's not going to be too expensive.
664536	669899	One game though that is going to be coming out for the PlayStation 3 and a favorite is Hot Shots Golf 5.
670320	675063	It is confirmed for the PlayStation 3 and looks pretty sweet.
675323	680547	Don't know how well next-gen graphics are going to do for this game but still a really fun game.
682448	686891	Now one thing we are going to be looking at though is seeing how well the system launches.
687623	696325	and Sony is expecting shipments for the PlayStation 3 to be in 2006 and they're definitely saying that there's not going to be any shortages.
697365	699165	Well, promises, promises.
699345	700165	We'll have to see though.
700965	708247	Now, as far as other games coming out for the PlayStation 3, you have your normal big hits for the PlayStation.
709147	713907	SOCOM, the series is going to see its fourth edition for the PlayStation 3.
713987	716448	This is actually going to be at E3 this year.
716468	716848	It should be
717349	718750	Pretty interesting, of course.
720311	721711	Not a surprise to most people.
721791	725233	God of War 2 is also slated for the PlayStation 3.
725673	728675	Whether it's going to be a launch title or not, that is to be seen.
729275	730516	It should be pretty interesting, though.
731817	739181	Now, as far as other next-gen systems, one system that's going to be coming out eventually is going to be the PlayStation Portable 2.
740201	743003	And Samsung says it's actually in the works right now.
743323	745704	They're making more flash memory chips for it.
746465	747005	And, um,
747757	757944	Should be interesting that they're saying that... In addition, Samsung is making flash memory hard drives instead of a UMD player for the new PSP.
758505	762367	Now, it'll be interesting to see if this is just rumor or if it's actually going to happen.
762488	772014	I know that, especially with the larger memory chips, they've actually had problems with piracy and stuff, so hopefully they'll have that taken care of.
773295	777038	Now, I don't know about most of you people, but I know that my games...
777677	778558	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
794741	796963	Well, that might not be a worry coming soon.
797563	805489	There's actually a company called Scratchless that is bringing a brand new version of the CD-Rs and DVD media to the market.
805569	812395	Right now they're working on technology that is basically you can do anything with this and you cannot scratch it.
812475	821882	They have a 4 micron layer of polymer that's being developed by GE right now and there is nothing you can do to scratch this.
822302	822943	And right now
823672	825613	with nearly a million dollars in funding.
826433	831154	This should be coming to market pretty soon in their own line of blank media.
832314	842837	Speaking of DVDs, there was a story this week about Ui Bull and how he's fed up with the gamers and hating on his gaming movies.
843117	846978	Well, mainly most of the internet he's fed up with.
847999	849399	The dangerous thing right now
850339	851180	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
880290	884153	It's not really a bad thing that games are being made into movies.
884193	888937	Of course, the Silent Hill movie is coming out right now, and it's going to be a really awesome movie.
889458	906152	Also, with games being made right now that are more cinematic and more realistic as far as how violent and stuff they are, it should be no surprise that they're passing a law in Utah that are grouping games in with porn, actually.
907967	919189	Utah Representative David Hoegs attempts to lump violent games in with obscene pornography under law that has passed through Utah House Committee by a 7-2 vote.
920110	933052	Basically, the law defines the offending games as those featuring inappropriate violence and lacking serious literary and artistic, political, and scientific value for minors.
933772	935273	Well, that's pretty vague.
935293	936493	Unfortunately...
937591	942695	I don't think it's going to be constitutional and probably won't get put in place, but it'll be interesting to see.
944536	951921	Now speaking of porn, the strangest group of individuals to bash on Grand Theft Auto has hit the news this week.
952321	961988	Prostitutes are actually calling for a ban of Grand Theft Auto based on the way players can pick up prostitutes and then kill them and steal their money.
962768	965030	Apparently they didn't think too highly of that.
966775	966975	E.A.
967015	967676	is in shock!
990655	992936	as Black has been leaked to the internet.
993136	993737	That's right.
993797	998739	The first person shooter that's going to be probably one of the best games for February has leaked to the internet.
998779	1000620	Not a huge surprise, actually.
1001220	1004602	But what is a surprise is who they think the culprit is.
1005022	1008964	They think it's actually one of their employees that they just recently let off.
1009565	1016008	One of the 350 hardworking employees that stuck the proverbial knife in the back of EA.
1016928	1018089	Well, it should be interesting.
1018109	1019309	Not too surprised, though.
1019490	1020110	The game is...
1020646	1025728	Slated to hit store shelves though at the end of February, so check it out if you can legally.
1028089	1037173	Now on a more positive note, it was announced that Play is going to be seeing one of our favorite artists out there, and that would be Akira Yamaoka.
1037213	1039174	He's going to be wearing Silent Hill Live.
1040168	1042830	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1068826	1080555	The competition will begin in Louisville, Kentucky at the Kentucky Exposition Center from June 15th through the 18th, followed by four additional events throughout the year, ending with the championships in December 2006.
1081555	1094525	Each event will span three to five days and will be open to the public, and they'll be sponsored by Xbox 360 and presented by Intel, so it should be very interesting to see how big this ends up being.
1094946	1103034	and finally I'm going to wrap up the podcast with my topic of stuff that I like talking about and that would be the hacking and cracking world there
1103618	1104398	XBOX Live Arcade Games
1130697	1141441	Now, of course, they don't condone the piracy, but they do condone the sharing of the save games, so if you don't feel like beating your Call of Duty 2 or Need for Speed Most Wanted, definitely check out the website.
1141481	1148984	That would be xbox360gamesaves.com or actually 360gamesaves.com is what you want to check out there.
1150065	1153026	Now, of course, my favorite topic here, the PSP.
1154066	1160409	One of the games we do have coming out for the PSP is a longtime favorite on the PC, and that's going to be The Mist
1162028	1165671	The first game is going to be put out there.
1165691	1172996	They're going to have bonus content in the form of new adventure scenarios as well as updating the game's visuals for the PSP widescreen format.
1174037	1175839	No release date yet for that.
1176439	1185486	Speaking of the PSP, one of the brand new homebrew emulators that's been brought to the scene is going to be an Atari Jaguar emulator for the PSP.
1185866	1189169	Yes, all of those Jaguar owners out there are probably...
1189767	1191609	So happy, all five of you.
1193310	1194371	Should be interesting, though.
1194591	1202498	Right now, the emulator is still very early in development and doesn't exactly run many cards.
1202698	1207082	Now, at this time, of course, we want to plug the Orange Lounge Radio PSP website.
1207122	1209624	That would be at olrpsp.com.
1210364	1218091	And you can check out our podcasts on there as well as check out the shout line we have on there, our nice little chat feature there.
1218877	1229225	Now, of course, if you're more into the instant messaging chat, you'll be happy to know that AOL Instant Messenger has been brought to the PSP.
1229285	1229885	That's right.
1230405	1240133	Go to www.aimonpsp.com and you'll actually be able to chat to all your AIM friends straight on your PSP.
1240373	1241714	So definitely worth checking out.
1243035	1246157	And finally, everyone's favorite website this week,
1246533	1249315	has definitely been the Katamari Flash game.
1249856	1253099	And if you haven't checked it out yet, what the hell are you waiting for?
1253139	1254820	You need to go check it out right now.
1255481	1267691	It's going to be at katamaridamasi.jp slash qa underscore data slash katamari.html So definitely check it out.
1267851	1269453	See how big you can get the Katamari there.
1269653	1270594	It's a lot of fun.
1270614	1272215	At least waste a few minutes of your time.
1274051	1278153	And finally this week, though, if you're looking for some new games, it's a good week for you.
1278494	1281595	Got one of the biggest ones of the month coming out, Fight Night Round 3.
1281635	1284537	It's going to be coming out on the 21st here.
1284717	1286658	So definitely check that out, especially on the 360.
1287358	1288399	It looks pretty sweet.
1289440	1291841	And Sonic Riders as well is going to be coming out.
1291961	1294202	Very good Sonic the Hedgehog racing game.
1294222	1299085	If you're more into a simulator racing game, Toko Race Driver 3 is going to be coming out.
1299705	1300746	And that game is amazing.
1300806	1302727	You race from everything from big rigs.
1303325	1308173	to Monster Trucks, to Sprint Cars, to even Riding Lawnmowers.
1308333	1311097	So definitely check that out if you're into racing games.
1311939	1312500	Well, that's it.
1312540	1316225	I hope you enjoyed this solo affair for the Orange Lawns Radio episode 175.
