14050	19672	Tonight, February 12th, 2006, will we finally see the Xbox 360 on store shelves soon?
20013	25395	A variety of Nintendo DS updates, and just in time for Valentine's Day, a review of sexy video games.
33177	36418	Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.
36478	40358	Here we are again, live for another week on Sunday night.
40698	45879	But of course, we also reach out to the world at your convenience via our podcast stream.
45899	49140	It all happens at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
49160	53601	Today is February 12th, 2006 and it's episode number 174.
54141	57961	With me, Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, are my lovely co-hosts.
58301	60702	In that corner, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61162	61742	I love salad.
62382	62962	Mmm, salad.
63042	64043	What kind of salad do you have tonight?
64363	72846	I have spinach and tofu and egg and cheese and carrots and black beans and craisins and balsamic vinegar.
72866	73606	That's a hell of a salad.
73646	74066	And granola.
74086	74906	There's a lot of stuff in there.
75486	76247	And yummy stuff.
76347	78147	What do you say to people that go, ew, tofu?
79348	80828	Have you ever had good tofu?
80848	82629	Do you really have good tofu?
82769	85610	I really like miso soup, which has tofu in it.
85630	86930	That's one of my favorite kinds of soup.
87710	89271	Tofu, it all depends on what you cook it with.
89935	91276	I'm making homemade tofu.
91556	92597	Not tofu.
92617	93197	I can't make tofu.
93958	95659	But I'm making homemade miso this week.
95879	97080	Have you ever had a tofu turkey?
97100	98141	Because I used to date a vegan.
98481	98601	Yes.
98621	99762	And one year I got a tofu turkey.
100283	104386	I actually eat tofurkey on my sandwiches.
104746	105907	Because I've become a vegetarian.
105927	109289	I ate meat for the first time last night in like two and a half weeks.
109850	112632	Because we were at Hard Rock Cafe.
113272	113772	It made me sick.
113792	114373	Aww.
114453	114553	Aww.
115171	116271	Hard Rock Cafe is pretty good, though.
116291	117072	I haven't been there in a long time.
117272	117492	Anyway.
117592	118832	I had a 22-ounce bath, too.
118852	119252	It was yummy.
119432	120513	We're a video game podcast.
120533	120913	I'm sorry.
120993	122813	I didn't mean to turn into Food Network there suddenly.
122873	125234	Loki, Tech Master Loki, bring us back to speed here.
125274	125794	How are you doing?
126294	126554	Good.
126874	127215	Good.
128275	128735	Have a good week?
129295	129595	Yeah.
129615	130195	All right.
130736	131936	I didn't want to bring it up because...
132336	133578	Thank you for watching!
145818	148939	Cutting six onions is, you know, you gotta get used to it, I guess.
149720	151440	I don't really cook, like, ever.
151821	152921	It's a miracle to cook.
153101	154282	Well, French onion soup's easy.
154362	156562	It's just onion and beef broth.
156722	157543	I mean, that's all it is.
157563	159524	Well, that's like, I can make onion dip.
160144	162025	Just pour the soup mix in the sour cream.
162065	162585	That's easy.
164185	165366	I'm drinking fermented tea.
166016	168177	I played Grand Theft Auto.
187270	191511	Yeah, haven't gotten a chance to play much of my 360 this week because I've been really busy.
192171	194912	And haven't really been able to snatch the TV away from people.
196112	202694	We have been playing the full auto demo, which just to kind of warm us up to full auto, which I'll be getting on Tuesday.
202814	208536	So it will be a very happy Valentine's Day with full auto.
209056	210036	All right, all right.
211003	213406	They're doing really weird things on Valentine's Day this year.
213446	218070	I just saw a commercial on TV the other day that said Saw 2 is being released on DVD on Valentine's Day.
218130	220592	I'm like, that's just hokey.
220892	224756	I find it funny that the most romantic holiday in existence is based off of a martyr.
226617	228139	Do you have plans for Valentine's Day?
228359	228819	I sure do.
229940	230881	Dan and I both have to work.
232176	235318	But I'm planning on recreating the night that he proposed to me.
236638	236858	Aww.
237239	242161	So I bought sourdough French baguette at Bodine last night.
242781	243281	Mm, so good.
243882	249825	And then I'm going to get some spinach dip and a bottle of the, what's it called, blackberry wine.
250525	252426	Remember, we were very broke when I moved in with Dan.
253566	254627	And we're going to watch UHF.
257048	258489	He proposed to me over Weird Al.
259660	260401	That's awesome.
260661	262042	Either that or we'll just go to Claim Jumper.
263383	264624	Oh, that place is going to be packed, though.
264764	265905	I don't know if we'll go there.
265925	266885	Maybe we'll go get Chinese food.
267426	267926	All right, anyway.
268366	268566	Sorry.
268586	271128	God, it all comes back to food tonight.
271689	272489	What's going on?
273250	274250	We's hungry people.
274711	275111	Eat us.
275972	278413	Any other games that you've been playing, Loki, this week?
280755	284738	I did play briefly, and I mean extremely briefly, this
285259	286199	Super Mario Bros.
286719	287480	3 hack.
288180	291060	It was Mario Adventure or something like that.
291501	295281	And it was okay, but I got bored with it real quick.
296302	300423	I did... Freaking hell, my microphone just fell apart.
300443	302583	Your microphone's kind of falling apart.
302623	304524	Here, let's do a quick switcheroo, Loki.
304664	305344	That was interesting.
305364	307565	Go ahead and use this one here, since we don't have a guest tonight.
308065	311646	Anyways, my microphone literally exploded in my face.
311766	312766	Live radio, it happens.
314385	317166	Um, that's what I get for trying to put that mesh back on there.
317507	326791	Anyways, um, so yeah, I tried actually playing with the Xbox 360 wired controller because I downloaded the Windows XP drivers and it was okay.
327311	328472	It works good as a controller.
328912	335195	It'd be good for like, um, I think Nintendo 64 emulation or something like that, but I don't know.
335775	339737	So I just played a little bit of that and a little bit of, um, I, what was it?
340077	341457	Um, I'm okay.
341798	342778	I played a little bit of that.
345380	347562	Jack Thompson Murder Simulator
370779	373440	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
374101	378123	I played some Animal Crossing at work during my breaks, of course, because I'm a good girl.
379664	383586	We have a really good story on gaming at work tonight, so we have to come back to that later.
384787	396694	I also chatted with some coworkers about PSP games, and I'm still needing to sit down with Maverick Hunter X just because I watched the OAV thing on it, which depressed me utterly, but it was really awesome.
398306	404390	And I played a little bit more Kingdom Hearts, but this week's been really crazy because I'm leaving for Alabama next week.
405651	410794	And have been trying to double up on my schoolwork, so I don't have to have that sitting over my head.
411375	417399	However, I'm also getting Dirge of Sebris, which is the game featuring Vincent, sort of first-person shootery.
418079	420021	And I think I have the name right.
420261	421942	It's SNK Coliseum.
422562	427646	It's supposed to be this massive, big ol' game starring the KOF characters and different SNK characters.
428666	428946	Very cool.
428966	429527	So I'm working on that.
452898	480239	and I'm going to be doing a panel on Bomani and music based video games and it's Sunday at 11am is the time of my panel so those of you guys going to KatsuCon come by, say hi, learn something about Bomani games I have a special treat I'm going to be doing something that I have something special that has not hit the internet that I'm going to be doing at the panel and that's all I can really say about that and it's really cool so come by so check it out and that's in DC at the Omni Shoreline remember Rob's secret is 21 and up
482142	482702	Shut up.
483443	483743	Shut up.
484203	484483	All right.
484683	486844	There's something that is completely off top.
486964	488225	Well, not quite off top.
488265	492207	You mentioned Katsukan and convention-wise.
492767	495268	Something I forgot to mention about my work.
495448	499050	Since I said we're doing a sales push right now, there's a contest involved.
499330	505613	And the contest is with the four salespeople here in Folsom and four salespeople in Dallas.
506293	507334	Two contests for both of us.
508854	523079	The contest is whoever brings on the most accounts gets an all expense paid trip to E3 with a VIP pass VIP pass lets you get into everything Oh, you gotta get that Oh, you might not even be able to go to E3 because of the future wife, huh?
523299	525420	Actually, she gave me the okay Woohoo!
525780	538404	Alright Oh, you gotta get that pass then There's a scoop here on OLR It doesn't matter anyways I'll get a pass, a VIP pass Whether I win the contest or not, they better give me one Rub it in, rub it in Alright
539366	540028	Yes, DarkSakura.
540549	542052	And that's cool because I'll have my media pass too.
542433	543976	Yeah, we need to get media pass.
544557	545339	We're working on it.
545439	546742	March 31st is the deadline.
546782	547363	Behind the scenes.
547624	548486	We're working on it.
548566	548806	Okay.
549007	549227	Alright.
550973	551633	MyGamingWeek.
551774	553495	I've had a lot of requests like in the chat room.
553515	556217	The chat room is lit up right now and I'm getting private messages as well.
556517	560720	People wanting to know follow up to the Xbox 360 debacle that I went off on last week.
560980	564482	You'll notice I'm a lot calmer when it comes to Xbox 360 topics tonight.
565203	573168	I did get the box from Microsoft but because of the fact I was out on business for part of this week, I haven't had a chance to send it back yet but it's going back tomorrow.
573348	574069	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
600658	600998	Let's see.
601458	602539	So that's where my Xbox 360 stands.
602559	604220	So I'll let you know what happens when that comes back.
604500	606901	As far as the rest of my gaming week, it's actually been pretty calm.
607261	611603	I've been doing a lot of other things in my personal life this week, so I haven't had a lot of time for gaming.
612443	615244	I was flying on the plane, and I brought my DS.
615524	616565	I didn't even really touch it.
617545	618886	I was listening to podcasts.
619446	627109	Actually, I brought my iPod, and I listened to other podcasts because I kind of said before on the show that I don't really listen to a lot of other podcasts.
627509	628250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
644161	645742	Blood, Sweat, and Tears Blood, Sweat, and Tears
664369	665170	Ghost Hunter Ghost Hunters
686844	688825	and make them run away scared from the house.
689165	690925	So it's kind of cool, but it's more of a tactical game.
690965	691886	I was kind of surprised.
692146	695647	Like you have a certain amount of points that you can spend on different scare tactics and things.
696147	702169	But I really like the game because it's so cool because you can switch and go to the point of view of the people in the house.
702669	703929	And it's, you know, really fast.
703969	705130	You change between all these graphics.
705150	709011	You can go between all the different points of view of the characters and like the overview of the house.
709271	716053	And so you can watch your characters as they're being scared run around and you hear their little heart beating going, boom, boom, boom, boom.
716613	717393	So this is kind of funny.
717713	718554	It's a really cute game.
718614	719034	I liked it.
719174	719714	It's a good time.
719794	728097	So if you're a fan of scary type games or even the... Although it's not really a scary game because it's all done very comically.
728597	731238	But if you're a fan of those type of supernatural things, you might like it.
731758	735699	Or even strategy and tactical type games, you may find this to be kind of fun.
736079	738860	I don't know if it's a game I'll play all the way through to completion.
739040	741241	I don't know if it's that great for me, but...
741921	742841	I think it'll be fun.
743022	744082	So the game's called Ghost Hunter.
744662	747723	And I want to say it was developed by a UK studio, actually.
748143	752125	Because I think the version my friend had was a UK version somehow.
752185	753345	So that's what I checked out.
753586	755726	That was pretty much my gaming week.
755806	756867	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
757227	757567	Sorry.
757747	761088	You know, I wanted to download new demos on the Xbox 360, but we won't go there.
761208	761369	Why?
761389	761929	I haven't done that.
762129	762909	Yes, DarkSakura?
763209	764390	I actually did play another game.
764530	764810	What's that?
765010	766971	Actually at Walmart.
769632	770392	Was it Deer Hunter?
771312	782197	No, it was this Sega Undersea game that was a lot like... It was in the same, I think, type of series as that... Oh, what was it called?
782217	783058	The Safari Hunter?
783998	786259	But you go, and it's like House of the Dead with fish.
786900	787540	It's underwater.
787980	788721	Undersea Hunter?
788881	790902	The Undersea Adventure.
790922	792622	Is that like the Crocodile Hunter?
793243	799426	No, but you have like this little handheld torpedo things, and you shoot sharks.
800729	803410	and Hydra's, and you just go around shooting fish.
803471	804631	It's like House of the Dead with fish.
806312	808713	When you were talking about Safari game, you made me think of this one game.
808753	812375	Maybe we're talking about the same thing here, but they used to have a little arcade here in town.
813336	816677	Sacramento, the town we live in, has essentially no good arcades anymore.
817077	823861	We used to have a couple good ones, like standalone arcades in the area, and I remember one particular one that was out in Roseville, one of our suburbs,
824681	829462	had this game, and I want to say it was by Sega, and it was a safari game, and it was actually like a sit-down.
829722	831343	You go around in the Jeep and you lasso.
831463	831903	Yeah, that was it.
831923	832223	It was cute.
832283	832943	I liked that game.
832963	835744	But this was in the same series, but you just go around shooting fish.
836084	836444	That's cool.
836604	842485	And like, you know how in House of the Dead when you let people die and you tell the other people there was nothing we could do?
842986	848867	Instead, you see, if you let a shark eat one of the divers, he just sort of hangs in the water like, dead.
849247	850207	And you're like, dot, dot, dot.
850547	851388	Okay.
852768	853088	All right.
853459	856020	Well, that's a little bit about what's going on in our gaming worlds.
856641	861263	And if you want to share what's going on in your gaming world, join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
861303	861884	Click on chat.
862144	863364	You can always send us some email.
863765	870008	We love getting the email from you guys, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we'll read some of those emails a little later on in the program.
872509	874831	Moving to Arcadian42 said Jambo Safari.
875151	878173	That's the name of it, Jambo Safari, not Jambo.
878553	878993	All right, anyway.
879600	881041	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
909534	915379	Basically, what VoiceOver IP is, it's... Imagine playing Phantasy Star Online.
915959	916760	It's about the same thing.
916860	921644	You're doing your... Instead of doing, like, standard phone line, it's actually connecting through the internet connection.
921704	923385	Like Xbox Live, basically.
923786	924366	Yeah, same thing.
925147	926428	Only, of course, this will be wireless.
927689	937277	One of the Nintendo of Europe spokespeople mentioned that they're hoping the VoiceOver IP feature will be included in the European version, also of Metroid Prime Hunters for Nintendo DS.
938335	942235	But they have to work on regulatory and contractual issues before that can be cleared.
942739	943499	Internet Capability
970374	973375	Any type of online play capability, they have voice over IP capability.
974015	976796	Now my old work used to do voice over IP for our entire phone system.
976916	978057	Oh sure, it's a huge thing.
978077	980077	People have voice over IP as their home phone.
980537	980938	Vonage.
980978	981938	Vonage and that stuff.
982518	985399	Right, but also there's a release that's mentioned.
985639	986419	Yeah, Skype's the same way.
987039	992201	It said the game was set for a March 20th release in the US and later on May 5th in Europe.
993473	1002177	They're also mentioning that they're rolling out a series of DS demo kiosks across North America at major retail locations like GameStop, EB Games, GameCrazy.
1003257	1008839	DS owners will be able to wirelessly download games, videos, mini games, sort of like how we did at E3.
1009860	1012901	And they will be available until the handheld is switched off.
1013301	1019544	Actually, exactly like what our downloads were like at E3 when we were playing Electroplankton and everything in line.
1020249	1028093	Now, I heard that they are actually bringing some of those exact same demos over, like Meteos and stuff, too, are going to be some of the launch titles we're going to see in the demo kiosks.
1028153	1028814	There is a list.
1029214	1040039	The first kiosk will offer free demos of Tetris DS, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, Meteos, True Swing Golf, and Pokemon Troze, along with a video of Metroid Prime Hunters.
1041540	1043381	Kiosks will be getting new content every quarter.
1044866	1049509	I remember at E3 you could download the Zelda trailer, and that was a big thing.
1049549	1050430	You could get movies.
1050730	1051831	That was the big thing.
1051891	1052832	Yeah, it was a huge thing.
1053733	1056115	Now, I want to go back to a minute and talk about Metroid Prime Hunters.
1056335	1066143	I'm sorry if I'm repeating something you already said, but I seem to recall reading that you would only be able to actually use the voiceover IP before and after the game.
1066403	1069045	You're not actually going to be able to use it in the game itself.
1069205	1069626	That's correct.
1069646	1070987	It's only available in the lobby area.
1071147	1072528	So you can only trash talk in the lobbies.
1073106	1073967	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1097049	1098933	on their official forums and stuff.
1099253	1105243	It seems like they're trying to protect people from that same, like, you know the stigma that Xbox Live gets?
1105464	1110392	You know, whenever you go online and play Halo, you're going to get called a F-A-G or an N-I-G, right?
1111101	1114883	You're going to get called those things because people are kind of immature on there and Xbox Live has that stigma.
1115203	1116943	I don't think Nintendo wants that same thing.
1117103	1118084	So it's kind of interesting.
1118144	1120185	It's very smart to limit it in that respect.
1122045	1129068	Because, you know, there's been plenty of times where I'd be playing PSO and someone would get lost in our party, which happened all the time.
1129969	1133010	And so someone would just, you know, let out a little curse.
1134130	1137472	And that, you know, you don't want to be stuck in the moment.
1138032	1140233	By having it be before and after, people are usually calmer.
1142262	1149787	I don't mind the occasional fuck or shit because we do the same thing on this show and I think that's just, you know, it's not that bad.
1149827	1151688	It's how people talk.
1152449	1154571	Well, not everybody, but you know, it just depends on your culture.
1154611	1165658	Anyway, but I do hate it when I go on Xbox Live and there's some 13-year-old kid talking about, you know, making up stories about getting drunk and playing the game and calling everybody fag and all that stuff.
1165678	1168260	You know, I don't, that's the part that annoys me.
1168300	1170802	I don't care if people are going to say fuck or shit once in a while, you know.
1172661	1175303	It's just interesting to me that Nintendo is kind of opening that door.
1175363	1181148	It's going to be interesting to see if they try to police this at all, or if they're looking at Xbox and going, you know what?
1181228	1182008	It's successful.
1182469	1183570	Why are we afraid of this?
1183670	1184811	Let's just do it.
1185131	1185811	Let's open it up.
1186992	1187333	We'll see.
1190595	1192557	Let's go over to Loki for a follow-up story.
1193277	1193538	Yes.
1194598	1197901	Well, kind of on the same subject of chatting over the internet.
1198394	1217882	Nintendo has actually applied for a voice-to-text software patent, and basically their reasoning for it is summed up, if a 12-year-old boy is playing the role of a 40-year-old warrior, voice chat can spoil or detract from the gameplay experience, since the warrior ends up having the voice of a 12-year-old.
1218956	1228644	So the solution is that you speak normally and have the software convert the speech into text, which also allows them to censor any naughty words that you be using.
1229144	1231426	So, good idea.
1231606	1235089	Probably, you know, something that they might use for, like, I don't know.
1235609	1240153	I think this would be good for, like, actually Metroid Prime Hunters, because if you can't support...
1240629	1244410	You know, the voice chat or whatever, you can at least do text chat or something.
1244490	1246931	Do you need to be talking in Metroid Prime Hunters, maybe?
1246951	1249132	Because, does Metroid Prime Hunters have a co-op?
1249192	1249932	I don't think they did.
1250092	1251353	At least in the demo, I remember.
1251373	1257755	So maybe the theory is you shouldn't be talking to each other because you should be fighting each other to kill each other and you wouldn't talk to your enemies.
1257795	1259015	I mean, I don't know.
1259155	1260596	Capture the flag, team play stuff.
1260616	1260856	I don't know.
1260876	1263957	I guess it depends what kind of... I haven't touched that demo in forever.
1263997	1264937	It's an interesting idea.
1264977	1266498	Who knows how they'll use it, but...
1267058	1268299	Something else to look forward to, I guess.
1268760	1270261	You know where I think this is all headed?
1270721	1273904	And I think this is actually going to be really, really smart of Nintendo.
1274204	1277687	You know where I think this is all headed with this whole demo kiosk and all this stuff, the demos?
1278187	1285593	I think we're going to see something that's like a copy of Xbox Live on the Xbox 360 with the Revolution, using the Revolution.
1285633	1296202	Because imagine it, you hook up a Nintendo Revolution to the internet and you could download DS demos onto your Revolution, essentially turning your Revolution into a demo kiosk.
1296802	1305227	I think that's kind of where we're headed, where your revolution will be able to play not only revolution demos at some point, but DS demos as well.
1305527	1308909	Beam them over to your DS, and I think that's going to be really powerful.
1308989	1310690	Well, they're going to probably do the same thing with the PS3.
1310730	1317653	They're going to have the game share function that you can use probably with the PS3, where you can download one-level demos of PSP games.
1317873	1320114	Maybe Xbox is wishing they had a handheld right about now.
1320375	1320875	Probably.
1320895	1321095	Probably.
1322361	1322761	Interesting.
1323021	1326464	I kind of see that as the end point for all of this.
1326484	1327604	It's going to be very cool.
1328305	1328525	Oh yeah.
1328645	1329906	Everyone's looking to online.
1330906	1333808	And they've got to, I mean, since they're not pushing high def, so...
1335248	1336529	Online is going to have to be what it is.
1336789	1338010	It's going to have to be innovative.
1338490	1339791	And that's pretty innovative, I guess.
1340772	1342914	I'm going to the chat room and checking it out.
1343154	1347277	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
1347357	1348598	Some interesting comments here.
1349799	1351920	HitStun had a couple good things to say I like here.
1352461	1356023	Nintendo needs to solve the problem with people disconnecting when they're about to lose.
1356464	1358085	Certainly one of their biggest bitches.
1358727	1365170	That can happen with a lot of online games, though, but, you know, certainly maybe should affect their records or something like it does on some Xbox games.
1365570	1369992	Also, HitStun said this, I thought this was good, Nintendo wants people to play, not chat.
1371432	1372593	That's an interesting point.
1373134	1375016	Nintendo has always been about the games
1395896	1398417	MiniMe283 has an interesting comment, too.
1398557	1403499	I think Nintendo would be worse than Xbox Live because some people would be even more immature.
1404360	1408982	Nintendo's target audience, granted, as a whole, is usually younger than Xbox's.
1409422	1410863	So, interesting point.
1411723	1412163	But I don't know.
1412223	1417886	I know a lot of, you know, 20-something gamers and 30-something gamers that are Nintendo fanboys.
1418106	1420707	Usually, the older ones are Nintendo fanboys.
1422003	1423203	That's kind of what I noticed.
1423363	1427064	I think Nintendo doesn't necessarily, may not be focusing on age-wise.
1428324	1431005	I've always seen them as focusing to a more innocent crowd.
1432345	1433865	Hmm.
1434345	1439246	For people who are more looking for the wholesome category of gaming.
1440046	1442627	Or the not quite so racy, not quite so mature.
1443407	1448088	Well, you know, I even hate to think of games as Grand Theft Auto as basically being a mature game.
1449218	1451860	Because honestly, the game strikes me overall as very immature.
1452840	1458023	But in general, I think that it's more for the people looking for the more adult experience.
1458884	1459124	Okay.
1459424	1460425	You know, like Xbox.
1460565	1464467	But GameCube is more of the we want a cleaner type of game.
1465508	1465808	Okay.
1466348	1466608	Okay.
1467148	1467569	I can see that.
1468424	1470146	Game Developers Conference on the Revolution
1486436	1495763	I'm thinking that the announcement we see at Game Developers Conference, this is totally a rumor I'm making up right here, is that it's going to tie into all this other news we're seeing.
1495803	1499666	Is that exactly as I just said it, that the revolution is going to have that capability.
1499766	1501967	I think that'll be the hint that's dropped at GDC.
1502267	1507651	Because that would be a good little teaser that doesn't really spoil the actual revolution, you know what I mean?
1508272	1508532	I don't know.
1509252	1510073	Anyway, my thoughts.
1511980	1514622	Speaking of the DS, we have yet more stuff on the DS.
1514942	1517023	The DS Lite is on its way.
1517583	1519584	DarkSakura, you know some more information on the DS Lite?
1520225	1521505	Why, yes I do, Rob.
1524367	1531291	Nintendo has basically announced three colors for the Nintendo DS Lite, launching in Japan on March 2nd.
1532132	1534593	They're having Crystal White, Ice Blue,
1535200	1536380	and Enamel Navy.
1537060	1540141	And Nintendo has actually put some pictures up on their Japanese website.
1541561	1557605	I'll be able to go ahead and post links to that in our chat room, but also anyone can go onto Nintendo of Japan's site at nintendo.co.jp slash ds slash lite, l-i-t-e slash color slash index.html.
1558585	1559365	And they're pretty.
1560452	1560832	www.DarkSakura.com
1576665	1578487	Well, he's still gone without fast food.
1578507	1579788	We're about four months into it now.
1580268	1582009	And now he's telling me he wants a DS Lite.
1582029	1587073	Because the deal was if he could do it, I would buy him a Nintendo DS because I said he couldn't do it.
1587353	1589475	And now he's saying, I want a DS Lite.
1590175	1591556	I'm like, you can't change the terms.
1591856	1593357	You're going to buy whatever DS I can find.
1593397	1595099	I'll get you a used DS, smartass.
1595139	1596560	Besides, they're not available over here.
1596740	1597160	So, ha.
1597440	1598361	But they'll still play.
1598501	1599121	They will be.
1599182	1599982	You know they will be.
1600062	1600823	Eventually, but...
1601516	1601776	Ha!
1602237	1602557	Not yet.
1602577	1604880	They'll still play any region, so I don't see what the big thing is.
1604900	1608845	You can import them for the same price as it is to actually just buy one retail at a lot of sites.
1609486	1610347	I'm not importing one.
1610887	1614191	If I lose a bet, I'm not going out of my way to make it nice.
1615252	1617195	If they come out with crap colors over here, I'll import one.
1618322	1618642	We'll see.
1619483	1621566	Loki, one more DS story for us.
1622067	1625932	Yes, and this is only appropriate since we're talking about web functions.
1627494	1633701	Actually, Nintendo has come out to say that they are looking into creating a web browser for it.
1634062	1634582	Basically,
1635859	1652805	Reggie, one of the higher ups at Nintendo, is on the record talking to EGM saying that he's looking at a third party licensee to get involved with the web functionality and basically a web browser.
1653626	1661048	But if they would not do it, then definitely that's something that Nintendo's looking at putting out themselves.
1662129	1663449	It could be something we'll see soon.
1663609	1665270	Web browsing on the DS might be
1666365	1667106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1682219	1683820	Not a lot of good games right now.
1683900	1684960	Not a lot of stuff to do with this.
1685060	1686721	PSP's got a lot more functionality.
1686861	1690762	And now it's very interesting to see the DS really starting to raise the bar here against the PSP.
1691003	1698926	Because the PSP's niche and what still makes it a very powerful portable system is the fact that it does do web browsing and movie playing and all this other stuff too.
1698966	1701727	And Nintendo's starting to compensate for that difference a little bit.
1701767	1702467	So it's very interesting.
1703428	1703888	Very interesting.
1703948	1704328	Should be cool.
1705319	1705759	We'll see what happens.
1706019	1706460	Okay, I lied.
1706480	1709121	I have one more DS story for you guys.
1709341	1710222	But this is so cool.
1710242	1710882	You've got to see this.
1711343	1721388	This was posted, and I apologize because I don't remember where, but it's a link to a video on YouTube.com, and it's actually a clip of the new Super Mario Bros.
1721449	1722329	on Nintendo DS.
1722369	1724730	I'm going to show this in studio here to the folks here.
1724750	1725371	You've got to look at this.
1725391	1726672	This game looks sexy here.
1727852	1728373	Okay?
1729013	1732175	So the clip shows it's got the old retro...
1732884	1734505	Uh-oh, it hung up a little bit there.
1736326	1741650	It's got the old retro sounds there and the retro look to it, except Mario's in a very desert-looking world.
1742270	1744912	You can kind of compare it to something you would have seen in Mario Bros.
1745372	1749095	2, except the look of it looks like Mario 1 graphics, but...
1749415	1752457	It reminds me of Super Mario All-Stars, basically.
1752477	1752797	A little bit.
1752837	1754298	It does look kind of like Super Mario Bros.
1754358	1754879	All-Stars.
1755219	1758821	A lot of the same enemies, like you see the little spiky guys and the caterpillar things.
1759282	1761203	And there's these new rings, too.
1761423	1761763	Look at this.
1762064	1764846	Mario goes in the pipe and then flies out of it.
1764866	1765566	That's kind of cool.
1767147	1771170	Like Mario went in the pipe and the pipe bent to allow him to kind of fly out of it.
1772864	1775425	So, this is looking like it's going to be pretty sexy.
1775565	1776265	I like this.
1776365	1778025	I like the... And that's stage four.
1780406	1781706	I recognize what level that is.
1782006	1784867	I don't think this is a redone version of the original.
1785107	1785327	Huh.
1785607	1794709	Well, I wouldn't be surprised if... Well, a lot of it looked like the same type of... Oh, I'm sure... I wouldn't be surprised if there's elements of the classic Mario Brothers put into this game.
1795009	1796830	Because, you know, Nintendo loves their retro stuff.
1796890	1797550	No, it is different.
1797970	1800614	See, because you've got the pipe here, you wouldn't have had that in the original one.
1800634	1800994	Kind of neat.
1801134	1802176	I like that.
1802296	1803818	I like the fade with it being his head.
1804338	1805360	It's really cool.
1805380	1808083	Anyway, so just a little teaser of what's to come.
1808203	1809325	That looks very exciting.
1810017	1810777	I'm very happy about that.
1810797	1816059	Anyway, I'll post the link directly in chat room there so you guys can check out the video as well.
1816379	1820900	I know that's great radio to hear us sitting around talking about it, so go check it out and have a look at it.
1822001	1824681	All right, now let's go on to a completely different topic.
1824721	1825922	Enough Nintendo DS for now.
1826002	1828142	Let's do a follow-up story.
1828843	1832104	Three weeks now we've talked about this?
1832744	1834164	Yes, the drama.
1834344	1835105	All right, what's up?
1837452	1848498	Blizzard basically says, yeah, our bad about the whole gay lesbian guild that was, you know, basically shot down for, you know, trying to advertise.
1848738	1855002	The guild wasn't closed, but it's just that the person who did the shout got the slap on the wrist under harassment policy.
1855022	1858844	And that was the whole big issue was that, you know, was she harassing?
1858984	1859324	No.
1859765	1860785	She wasn't harassing anybody.
1861285	1862086	That was the whole issue.
1862266	1863106	But anyway, sorry.
1863367	1865348	Yeah, it's basically, you know, they're very...
1866008	1870570	She's very happy that Blizzard has owned up to the mistake and has apologized and corrected it.
1871430	1883535	The policy is under review right now and they're trying to make revisions to make it friendly to everybody and clarify things, less vague.
1884426	1900520	I don't know if it's the same story, but I did read, because obviously I've been very curious about this, I did read a follow-up story that said Blizzard did apologize and say that it was not really what it should have been filed under, and I heard that they were going to put all their GMs through sensitivity training.
1902587	1904848	to better identify how to handle these issues in the future.
1905028	1907470	And I thought this was a very creative solution.
1907570	1921919	I don't remember if this was fact or rumor, so take this with a grain of salt, but that Blizzard is going to create another chat channel within the game because right now they have chat channels for general chat, looking for group, trade.
1921979	1922639	They have all these channels.
1922800	1927743	They're going to create a new channel for guild recruitment where this kind of chat would be acceptable.
1927803	1929484	And I think that is a very fair...
1929885	1931094	and very smart solutions.
1931194	1931919	If that's fact...
1933416	1934757	I appreciate Blizzard for doing that.
1934817	1938680	Here's the actual apology letter that Sarah Andrews received from Blizzard.
1939100	1941582	It's from their head of customer service.
1942402	1946205	I'm Thor Biafor, head of Blizzard customer service worldwide.
1946265	1956412	I'd like to thank you for bringing your recent concerns to our attention and extend our apologies for any inconveniences this has caused you or your guild.
1956672	1960515	The action that was taken by our customer service representatives
1960973	1966317	was an unfortunate interpretation of our current policies, which are currently under review.
1967057	1974063	This was ultimately escalated to my attention, and after reviewing all the details, I had the following warning removed from your account.
1974423	1982789	Please accept our apologies for the way our staff characterized your conduct, and rest assured your account will not be penalized in any way for this occurrence.
1983129	1988433	I'll be happy to discuss this with you further, so please feel free to contact me directly.
1992177	1992458	Thank you.
1992718	1993279	Thank you, Blizzard.
1994180	1995041	No, I mean, I'm serious.
1995962	2000469	Even though I kind of wish it had happened a little sooner, I understand that corporations are big, nasty machines.
2000569	2002652	This probably had to be reviewed a thousand times by legal.
2002972	2003573	So I understand.
2004414	2004715	Thank you.
2005205	2005465	for that.
2023237	2025399	First, a couple comments to what's going on in the chat room.
2025439	2027261	Somebody's saying, did I say Gay Chat?
2027301	2028982	They were going to make another channel for Gay Chat.
2029022	2032405	No, no, that was Guild Recruitment Chat, not Gay Chat.
2033707	2035708	Let's see, what was the other one?
2036049	2042935	Oh, another person in the comment, EKIM, which I think is Mike, spelled backwards, says, did they unban her?
2043015	2046618	I just want to clarify, they never banned her.
2046718	2048440	She was warned, not banned.
2048740	2052862	But I believe, I'm almost positive she voluntarily left the game because she was kind of pissed off.
2052922	2054282	And well, you know, I would have been too.
2054722	2056483	So I can't say I blame her for that.
2056523	2057504	But I just want to clarify that.
2057584	2058844	Nobody was banned in that whole thing.
2058904	2059985	Just warned.
2060005	2061625	And the warning was inappropriate.
2062746	2063146	All right.
2063606	2064687	So I'm glad to hear that follow up.
2064727	2066888	And now, you know the best thing about that follow up?
2067408	2068988	We won't ever have to talk about that again.
2070089	2070649	Yay!
2070749	2071089	All right.
2071589	2072710	So next up.
2074005	2075126	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2102643	2104885	We've reviewed 700 accounts and banned them.
2106266	2109107	300 billion gil has been removed from circulation.
2109488	2117613	They realize this is driving up the price of items, and they are doing their best to follow, and they say they have more accounts under review, and they're taking this stuff very seriously.
2118334	2124077	I'm glad they did that, but at the same time, I still go by what I said last week when this originally came up.
2124538	2127840	Why didn't this happen a year and a half ago when things started to get out of hand?
2128060	2129821	I don't understand why it took this long.
2130101	2132323	Now, no review process takes that long.
2132503	2133884	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2149960	2154301	Well, the only delay that I've had so far is I'm waiting for someone to take over the link shell and that's it.
2155262	2155902	Then I'm done.
2156082	2157322	I'm dumping everything.
2157862	2168025	I still will go and check out the game when the new expansion is released because I hear it's going to be a little more solo friendly, like you'll be able to do more stuff on your own.
2168425	2172526	So I'm going to give it another chance because that was one thing Final Fantasy XI was severely lacking for me.
2172967	2175547	Don't get me wrong, I do understand it's an MMO.
2175627	2176748	You have to group sometimes.
2177068	2177908	That's understandable, but
2178709	2179790	All the time.
2180891	2181772	Okay, that was a little much.
2182052	2183774	That was the first thing that sent me to World of Warcraft.
2183814	2185156	Yeah, so we'll see.
2185176	2186978	I'm going to give it another chance, and we'll see.
2187479	2189000	So don't screw this up, Square.
2190842	2191123	We'll see.
2192104	2194907	I seem to be saying that quite a bit where Square is concerned.
2196249	2196669	I know.
2197510	2199052	Anyway, moving on.
2200802	2203183	DarkSakura, she likes to surf the internet.
2203403	2204443	You like the internet, right?
2204783	2206524	Yeah, the internet is serious business.
2206584	2212225	She serves it up and down and brings the very best to you in her Website of the Week.
2213025	2215126	DarkSakura, what's the Website of the Week?
2216206	2223048	Today's Website of the Week is called GetYourHeadOutOfYourBud.com Best name ever for a website.
2223797	2231700	Basically, the site focuses on political issues and then gives an opinion on how the people who are most prevalent in these issues are big idiots.
2233100	2241123	I mean, it really is nothing but political issues, but the whole point of this is if you're going to be in the public eye and say things, don't be a dumbass about it.
2241223	2243064	I actually put some thought into it.
2243404	2252047	A few of the different issues brought over here was more about the Communications Decency Act, more recent developments with that.
2252768	2254209	which actually sort of affects us, you know.
2255590	2258333	Also about issues with the Super Bowl.
2259994	2270103	And this one actually really struck with me about Cindy Sheehan who was arrested for wearing that particular t-shirt at the State of the Union address.
2271064	2277329	How she was basically lost any credibility she might have had for doing that at the most inappropriate time ever.
2278098	2280499	So, yeah, it's a pretty good site.
2280519	2282360	Gives some pretty controversial views on things.
2282640	2284942	There's also another good article in here about the Dixie Chicks, too.
2285822	2289844	But, anyone who happens to be politically and socially minded, check it out.
2289904	2293186	You may not agree with the opinion, but at least it's very intelligently presented.
2293626	2295407	And has the best website name ever.
2296047	2297488	And so, therefore, it's your website of the week.
2297722	2300885	Exactly, it's getyourheadoutofyourbutt.com, all one word.
2301405	2302246	Is it non-partisan?
2302346	2304007	Does it razz on both sides?
2304308	2305589	It seems fairly non-partisan.
2306249	2316998	That's actually another thing that appealed to me, is that it seems, it is a bit more on the liberal-friendly side, but then again, it does also... Because when I looked at it, it seemed a little more on the other side of it.
2317999	2320381	It really floats the line to me.
2320401	2322943	Well, whoever's got their head in their butt this week, essentially.
2323283	2329787	Well, right, and I think that there, you know, I think that the person who writes it, the reason why it appeals to me is because it has a very similar point of view to I do.
2330247	2342014	I've got a very socially liberal mindset, but when it comes to fiscal, you know, circumstances and some borderline social circumstances, I do lean a little conservatively on it just based on my background.
2342794	2345095	But, you know, I think it's very moderate.
2345696	2347036	I'd have to put it as very moderate.
2347297	2347397	Okay.
2347657	2347837	Okay.
2348217	2348537	That's good.
2348798	2351380	Because that kind of stuff is only funny to me when it's both sides being razzed.
2351700	2352661	Oh yeah, I agree.
2353062	2365614	And like I said, they go from everything from pointing fingers at the Patriot Act to pointing fingers at that Cindy lady.
2366014	2366675	Okay, that's cool.
2366775	2367956	I mean, it really does go back and forth.
2367996	2371299	I think it's a very fair point of view, but again, it is the author's point of view.
2371840	2372741	What does that have to do with games?
2373650	2375554	It doesn't, but... I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.
2375594	2384031	Well, no, but every so often I've seen things pop up about the RIAA and... I want to say I saw something about, like, you know, there was even a gaming category in there or something.
2384091	2385594	Like, I seem to recall, maybe I'm...
2386666	2404714	I honestly believe, and this is my social political point of view on this, anything that happens that's in the public eye as far as any type of political or social agenda is eventually going to affect all other aspects of life, including how we communicate, what we do for our leisure, including games.
2405374	2407536	I honestly think that everything is linked.
2407876	2420544	You'll see one thing about so and so, you know, privacy issue and then you'll see all sorts of privacy measures being incorporated into like AOL, Yahoo, Game Chat.
2421185	2425448	This is the reason why I think GamePolitics.com is a horribly overlooked site.
2425748	2432853	I think more people should be keeping a pulse on what's going on over there because it really fuses this politics thing with what goes on with gaming.
2433053	2433233	So...
2433926	2435467	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2463973	2465814	Because it pisses so many people off, probably.
2490842	2492423	I remember Crystal Quest.
2492863	2494104	I want to download this.
2494584	2497145	Well, yeah, one of the first Mac games in color.
2498146	2500066	And so, you know, I don't know.
2500127	2507910	It's too similar to the other games that are out there right now, like Mutant Storm and Jump True Wars.
2508270	2509211	They're just too similar.
2510020	2510500	I love Crystal Castles!
2529368	2531650	And it's even better when you actually have the trackball to play at home.
2531830	2532671	I know, I know.
2532691	2533632	That was fun.
2533752	2535433	You can't play that game with a keyboard.
2535474	2538416	You have to use either your mouse, which is essentially an inverted trackball, or a trackball.
2538436	2539437	I mean, trackball's the bomb.
2539797	2540318	So, anyway.
2541479	2550167	So that, and also another cool demo that's going to be coming out, and that would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter should be coming probably pretty soon.
2550187	2552249	You know,
2552887	2553287	DarkSakura.com
2576229	2577311	I thought this was interesting.
2577351	2581077	Our chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is kind of giggling.
2581138	2588731	They're snickering to themselves because they said essentially that we got Loki to talk about something Mac related and keep the peace.
2589531	2589811	XBOXIC.COM
2611258	2621964	He is talking about the issues regarding these shortages, and this is what he said, quote, Within the next four to six weeks, anybody will be able to walk into a store and buy an Xbox 360.
2622705	2624826	So will we be seeing these shortages come to an end?
2625406	2626287	God, let's hope so.
2626447	2627607	That's an ambitious statement.
2627927	2634391	Yeah, but at the same time, maybe four to six weeks is when you should have launched your system, if that's the case.
2634591	2635932	But what do I know?
2637152	2638693	I'm just some guy with a broken Xbox.
2639234	2642676	Alright, uh... Sorry, I couldn't resist.
2643357	2648401	But whereas you may be able to walk into a store and get one here, though, Loki, what's going on other places?
2649281	2650082	Australia.
2650382	2651623	Gotta love Australia.
2651643	2652003	Of course.
2652344	2659829	And they were supposed to get their 360s, I believe, in the beginning of March, and now it's the end of March, and now it's... Well, you might get some.
2660250	2661090	You might get a couple.
2662111	2663392	But there's gonna be shortages...
2664924	2675272	All those shortages because I guess they're not shipping Australia, they're just going to be shipping the United States, you know, to make that... I was going to say, they took all of Australia's consoles and took them back and tweaked them for US.
2675752	2676293	Put them out here.
2676613	2677093	Sorry, guys.
2677294	2679736	They're all, eh, Australia, not very important.
2680856	2682378	So, I don't know.
2682678	2684159	So, yeah, if you're looking to play the 360...
2686189	2687230	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2716215	2717917	Seriously, what?
2718077	2723481	They sold 600,000 units in the first three months instead of 3 million?
2724402	2725443	Yeah, they're right on schedule.
2726023	2730287	Jaded2006 in our chatroom says, The shortages will actually last another four to six years.
2731347	2731828	I hope not.
2731868	2735571	That's when the Xbox 720 will be out by then or whatever they do next.
2736171	2736492	We hope.
2736672	2737032	We'll see.
2738233	2744278	Yeah, the Xbox 360 is very misleading because it makes it sound like you can rotate the system, but we know it happens.
2745399	2745659	All right.
2746169	2752112	Since we're traveling abroad right now, let's go over to the UK and go over to DarkSakura for the UK report.
2753672	2758274	It looks like the Grim Reaper has visited Gizmondo Europe.
2758955	2766598	It's finally dead, kaput, and filing for bankruptcy.
2766718	2770040	Gizmondo UK has been ordered to liquidate by the High Court.
2770140	2773681	As part of this, the liquidators will probably have to sell off the company's assets.
2774241	2774662	Watch out!
2774922	2775602	You know what that means.
2776777	2778278	Discount Gizmondo!
2802972	2812254	It's just so that when you're going up against the likes of Nintendo, really, you know, we had our Neo Geo make it a little while and die over here.
2812774	2813714	Neo Geo Pocket Color.
2814175	2816715	The Wonderswan never even came out over here.
2817015	2822176	Probably announcing a console revision before you launch the console, not a good idea.
2823077	2824577	Well, at any rate, you know...
2826170	2836295	I feel awful for them because I talked with a few of the reps that were there at E3 and I thought that they were just fabulous and I thought they really tried really hard to make this something that would appeal to people.
2836395	2838256	They believed in it and that's important.
2838997	2840277	But belief only gets you so far.
2840437	2841018	Yeah, it's too bad.
2841158	2844720	So it's kind of, oh well, maybe next time.
2845380	2847221	So what else is going on besides that?
2848542	2850883	Well, you know, my heart still hurts over that though.
2853264	2855085	Do you need a moment of silence for Gizmondo?
2858745	2862407	Now the next thing is that Nintendo is pushing their Wi-Fi online services.
2866570	2867750	Excuse me as I lose my voice.
2868671	2872493	They're doing a video spot for the service which is going worldwide.
2873073	2879757	It's showing worldwide head-to-head playability and it's sort of big news.
2880290	2881630	Okay, it's very epic.
2882250	2884311	Yeah, epic.
2884351	2887131	Worldwide Wi-Fi by Nintendo.
2887211	2888632	Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
2889432	2890352	With monster trucks.
2891652	2900854	But really, I mean, what this raises to question is are they really going for a worldwide market with that?
2901874	2909536	Well, I think as long as you get the big three, it seems like as long as you get the big three, Japan, US, UK, the rest of it kind of falls into place.
2910854	2913215	I just... I don't know.
2913295	2919656	You know, I honestly think that I would love to see something like that go worldwide so that, you know, I have a lot of friends overseas.
2920256	2925618	You know, I would really like to be able to sit down and play my games with my friends overseas if we can overcome the eight hour time difference.
2926978	2931019	But other than that, you know, I think it would be... I'm really hoping that that's their goal.
2931939	2932499	We'll see.
2932839	2933779	It's thought provoking.
2933859	2934560	Truly epic.
2935020	2935440	Oh my.
2937760	2939541	Also coming up, release dates.
2939921	2940141	Sweet.
2941001	2943942	because we like release dates because that means that stuff goes out.
2944942	2952945	So coming up on the 17th, Frogger, Helmet Chaos coming out on the DS.
2953146	2954386	This is, again, UK news.
2955026	2958768	Guilty Gear Isuka, Ico being re-released on PS2.
2960148	2962729	We have Mark Echo's Getting Up content under pressure.
2963269	2970312	Shadow of the Colossus, Shaman King, Master of Spirits 2, SpongeBob SquarePants, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2972820	2976442	Did that blah blah blah stand for Spongebob Squarepants Who Really Gives a Fuck?
2976783	2977223	Exactly.
2977303	2979444	It's the Yellow Avenger.
2979584	2982066	I love Spongebob, but I could care less about the games.
2982106	2983086	I'm like whoopty shit.
2983106	2983667	Yeah, exactly.
2984327	2986689	Also Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll, which makes me happy.
2988129	2990491	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Lockdown.
2991632	2997135	Also coming out, there's actually one on the 19th, which is Too Tough Mission Nadia on DS.
3000609	3001310	Alien Hominid PC
3015126	3034582	America's Army, Rise of the Soldier on Xbox, Unk, Black, Bust a Move DS, Crash Day, EverQuest 2, Galactic Kingdoms 2, Coulomb, Mega Man, Maverick Hunter X, which I recommend to everybody in the universe to play because it's awesome, NARC, Omnimusha 3, Panzer Elite Action, and Project Zero 3.
3036043	3039686	We also have SeaWorld Adventure, Shamu's Deep Sea Adventure.
3041588	3041928	Loki,
3042492	3043293	What's going on with you?
3043313	3043793	Or was that it?
3043833	3044234	I'm sorry.
3044274	3045255	Were you going to do another week there?
3045275	3045315	No.
3045335	3046156	All right.
3046836	3048238	We'll go over to Loki for the U.S.
3048458	3048959	counterpart.
3049019	3049899	What's coming up in the U.S.
3049919	3050580	for release dates?
3051601	3052602	Lots of fun stuff.
3053123	3055986	My favorite, Full Auto, is finally coming out on the Xbox 360.
3056046	3061751	We've also got actually some of the very similar ones.
3063223	3068086	Super Monkey Ball Touch the one for the DS, which would be really cool.
3068986	3071288	We've got, I believe, Mark Echo's getting up.
3071928	3074990	Supposedly, he's coming out, hopefully, because it keeps getting delayed.
3076311	3078712	Drakengard 2, which would be pretty sweet.
3079893	3085536	And I believe those are the big ones for that week, actually.
3086717	3088558	There's a lot of smaller stuff.
3090503	3091603	We don't care about the small stuff.
3092164	3092924	They're all B-titles.
3092964	3095326	Unless there's a sleeper hit in there, but then we'll talk about it later.
3095366	3097428	Well, Dragon Guard 2 is going to be pretty sweet.
3097828	3099890	Everyone remembers the first one.
3099990	3100530	No, I didn't.
3100550	3103212	I never played it.
3103252	3103412	Fine.
3103812	3107615	It's like Panzer Dragoon crossed with Dynasty Warriors type of thing.
3108416	3112839	So you have dragon combat and lots of people versus one person type of thing.
3114500	3115141	It'll be pretty cool.
3116462	3116802	Sounds good.
3117679	3124723	Alright, so let's go back over to Matt to talk about an old classic title coming back for a new resurgence.
3124764	3125324	What's going on here?
3126024	3126505	Lemmings!
3126865	3128146	Everybody remembers Lemmings?
3128466	3129166	Oh, heck yeah.
3129727	3130947	I used to draw Lemmings.
3131168	3131888	Lemmings.
3132228	3133229	Lemmings was awesome.
3133269	3137412	I used to have the old Super Nintendo one, and it was also on the PC.
3137432	3139633	I had like Super Lemmings or something, which wasn't as good, but...
3140962	3142563	The game got kind of hard pretty quick.
3142603	3144404	I think maybe that's what it was I had on PC, Lemmings 2.
3144644	3144924	I don't know.
3145044	3145805	So what's up with Lemmings?
3146225	3149227	Lemmings is available for free to play over the internet.
3149647	3150027	What?
3150047	3150948	What'd you say?
3152208	3158790	Yes, you can actually, it's programmed in DHTML, and you can play it if you have a pretty decent PC.
3159390	3168453	Anyways, just head on over to www.elizium.nu slash scripts slash lemmings.
3168693	3171534	Okay, I have a feeling this isn't endorsed by the official company, is it?
3172034	3174716	This is in a domain that's .nu.
3175277	3177939	I'm kind of thinking this isn't endorsed by the original company.
3178219	3181302	But basically all you need is just a modern browser.
3181722	3190589	It'll work with most recent versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Opera, and a 500 plus megahertz processor.
3190869	3195753	If you've got any computer that's within this decade, you probably can run this.
3195833	3196033	Sweet.
3196654	3196894	Sweet.
3197816	3204780	Some comments from the chatroom there, www.orangelandre.com Tomo Kun says, that's my earliest gaming memory is Lemmings.
3205481	3205601	Aww.
3206801	3208843	And then VxJasonXV, holy futs.
3210103	3210484	Awesome.
3211404	3215287	And just some people doing the bard makes a little XD face over Lemmings.
3215367	3219249	So definitely a title that's fond, very fond with some people.
3219749	3222371	If I may say so, I'd also like to give a shout out to the bard.
3222571	3222791	Yeah?
3223151	3224072	We were college roommates.
3224798	3226699	Wow, alright, cool.
3226759	3229200	I'm glad you finally got to listen to the show.
3229240	3229940	Cool.
3230960	3231460	Oh, now look at that.
3231500	3232201	We lost Loki.
3232241	3233261	He's over there playing lemmings.
3233461	3233881	Look at that.
3234302	3234782	Stop it.
3235102	3235482	Stop it.
3235542	3235822	What?
3236482	3237743	Turn off the crack.
3238603	3244685	Remember, it only hurts the ones you love, and you eventually, because you'll lose liver function from playing lemmings.
3244905	3245125	Oh, boy.
3245406	3247306	And somebody had to make the real bad pun.
3247927	3251848	Xander in our chat room just started singing, We are the lemmings on the run.
3252561	3253562	You know the song from In the Groove?
3253982	3254422	I forget it.
3255382	3255723	Nerd!
3256203	3256523	Alright.
3259304	3260125	Moving on.
3260645	3261885	I want to talk about this story.
3261925	3262886	This is kind of interesting.
3264607	3269789	A solitaire game got a New York City worker fired this week.
3270129	3270749	Here's what happened.
3271210	3273931	Office Assistant Edward Greenwood the 9th
3274909	3275529	Thank you for watching!
3298646	3299668	for playing Solitaire.
3300409	3304016	And Bloomberg said, the workplace is not an appropriate place for games.
3304337	3307403	It's a place where you've got to do the job that you're getting paid for.
3308291	3309252	Greenwood's response.
3309312	3315255	Greenwood, by the way, earned $27,000 a year and had worked in the office for six years.
3315275	3321298	He said, He also said in the interview that he kept his playtime to his one-hour lunch or during his quick breaks when he needed a moment of distraction.
3335546	3339536	or it sounds like in there then he said maybe he'll play for a minute and get back into his work.
3341038	3342779	Two things that surprised me about this story.
3343079	3347301	One, he only made $27,000 a year and he lives in the New York City area?
3347321	3347861	Oh my God.
3347961	3350342	He's probably living in a really crap apartment.
3350442	3354284	Wow, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy, because that's not a great salary.
3354924	3357746	I thought people in that area had to make more, so I'm sorry, dude.
3359026	3359526	But what do you think?
3360067	3364989	The second part that's surprising is that is this just a case of bad timing?
3365049	3369771	Was the mayor just trying to save his butt because somebody snapped a picture and he didn't want...
3370191	3371234	Making an example of him.
3371736	3372398	I guess.
3373702	3377494	At my work, we actually have an internet workstation set up.
3378138	3383621	Just for use during breaks, but they've actually been really cracking down about... They don't even put the games on our systems.
3383942	3385503	They're removed from our whole setup.
3386323	3394608	A lot of places are cracking down about having private files on your computer, about even your desktop wallpaper.
3394808	3398991	These computers are for work use only.
3399711	3404534	If you want to play a game, do it during your break and bring a Game Boy with you.
3405035	3405615	That's what I do.
3405655	3406876	I play my DS in the break room.
3408177	3408517	You know what?
3408537	3419500	You talk about the managed application network, and that's a very similar thing at the place where I work, is that they don't have Solitaire and stuff because it's a managed application distribution system, so you only have access to the programs that you need.
3419860	3423281	But one of those programs at my company you need to do your job is Internet Explorer.
3423581	3425882	And of course, people find their way over to...
3426762	3430084	Games.Yahoo and some of the other stuff and they play Bejeweled and stuff.
3430104	3433506	So I see people doing this on their breaks at my work a lot.
3433846	3434807	Those are blocked at my work.
3435247	3435567	Interesting.
3435587	3442211	What they need to understand is he was playing Solitaire and he's fired for playing Solitaire because Solitaire is a crappy game.
3442931	3444432	And the mayor was trying to make an example.
3444472	3447554	If you're going to play games at my work, god damn it, it's not going to be this piece of shit game.
3447574	3449235	You better play Minesweeper.
3449355	3450696	You need to be playing Minesweeper.
3450736	3453397	Solitaire is so 1990, okay?
3455191	3461273	I think it just shows the simple fact that, and actually this is an issue I have about the American workplace in general.
3461733	3469356	You know, I believe that it's in, I want to say in the Netherlands they offer you something like four months mandatory vacation.
3469536	3471276	No, four weeks mandatory vacation time.
3471677	3475318	You are required by law to take your vacation.
3475658	3475858	Right.
3476394	3481777	Here, you can roll over your vacation to the next year, store it up, but you can only retain like five days of it or something like that.
3482358	3489082	You know, they focus on time is productivity instead of healthy workers are more productive workers.
3489382	3494585	What about the guy's concept of a micro break where he says, you know, I just do it for a minute.
3496605	3507610	In a productivity world, let's say, I don't know what this guy's job was, but let's say he was in an environment where he had, let's say you work a job where you process applications and you have to do 50 applications a day.
3508090	3512592	As long as I'm meeting my 50 applications a day, where's the harm in a little solitaire here and there?
3513072	3518799	Well, it's like the people at various places that I've been at are rewarded for having over 100% productivity.
3519480	3521462	I, on average, have over 100% productivity.
3521963	3525647	And I get up all the time and go to the bathroom.
3525667	3526628	You're a total slacker.
3526788	3527469	I'm not a slacker.
3529211	3539840	But just the thing is, that really gets me about that, in a lot of places, new hire training will actually say, take a five-minute break for every hour that you look at the computer.
3539960	3541741	Ergonomics people will tell you this.
3542422	3548927	Rest your eyes every hour or so for about five minutes so that you will not cause permanent damage.
3548947	3555512	That's why we have such a high rate of people who have to go into the doctor and go on stress leave and are on medication every
3556098	3582209	You bring up a very good point, because I'm a corporate trainer, is what I do for a living, and I teach big classes that usually go on for a several week period, and I usually tell my students, look, on your breaks, you shouldn't be on the internet, because I allow them to do it when they're on their breaks, but I say, you know what, you really need to go up, go outside, walk around the building, go get coffee or something, get away from the computer, because this is where you are the rest of the day.
3583124	3611555	and to kind of support that and then of course you know I totally go against what I say because I have to catch up on my own emails during break usually but you know what they do though sometimes and I've seen people do this is that I've seen people will be I don't catch them on it but I know they're doing it because like I'll walk around and suddenly like somebody hits a button real fast it looks like their screen flickered I know what they're doing they're taking down the game they were just playing or the email they were just writing people get sneaky with this stuff it's very interesting it's corporate technology world
3611946	3612606	It's just the whole thing.
3612887	3614408	People will work through their breaks.
3615148	3627016	I know lots of people who just work through their breaks because they're so worried about their level of productivity, about not having enough hours in the day to get their work done, work overtime without getting paid for it.
3628308	3629229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3645985	3646946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3670204	3678726	Loki, I'm curious if you have anything to add to this, because you work in an environment where it is about games, and you guys are part of your job is being familiar with video games, which is kind of interesting.
3679246	3688067	Yeah, I read a lot of sites, but usually while I'm working, I'll spend the first half an hour a day checking up on all the news sites and posting them on our forums.
3688427	3697509	But still, though, I have to know all the stuff that's going on, because I'll find out about date changes before we even hear about them.
3697749	3698409	I'll be like, hey,
3699022	3701324	They just made a press release that this has changed dates.
3701625	3705869	Check into it, and then we'll get the update for it.
3706710	3712836	Also, we usually take our 15-minute breaks in a six-player deathmatch in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
3714858	3721385	I can't really comment about going outside and getting coffee and stuff.
3722236	3725598	I have to go to the chat room because the chat room is just lighting up with feedback on this here.
3725898	3731260	Bugs in our chat room, he says, If there's a flippin' photo shoot in your cube, close that shit.
3732321	3732781	That's true.
3733381	3738724	I'm being corrected by SSJ100Matt who says, You can live fine in New York City making $30,000 a year.
3739264	3741806	So I stand corrected on that.
3741826	3744047	I always thought the cost of living was way, way higher there.
3744067	3744567	But I guess, you know...
3745643	3750406	New York City is a great place, so I guess it's one of those things where if you can sacrifice... See, I need my space.
3750466	3755148	I need a huge apartment and stuff, but I guess if you can sacrifice a little bit of that, then it works out.
3756509	3759170	I hope nobody was offended by that comment, because I really didn't mean any offense.
3759190	3760351	I was just really surprised.
3760391	3762752	I thought you really had to have more.
3762892	3770956	I have a friend who just moved to New York about maybe six months ago who was complaining about having a one-bedroom apartment for paying $1,200 for it, which is what I pay for a house.
3771076	3772917	Yeah, so it's interesting.
3773918	3774318	Let's see.
3775398	3775778	I like this.
3775838	3780380	MiniMe283 says, you know, once upon a time, Solitaire used to be played with real cards.
3781600	3782440	Very good point.
3783541	3785942	What if he had actually had the cards out on his desk?
3786202	3788823	Would the same thing have happened if he had had playing cards out on his desk?
3788843	3789083	Fired!
3789523	3790643	Do you think he would have still been fired?
3790743	3790863	Yes.
3790903	3791603	I don't think he would have been.
3792404	3794444	I think he would have been because it's still a use of company time.
3794464	3795485	I don't know.
3796125	3796465	Interesting.
3798526	3798966	Let's see.
3799006	3801887	Back in the day, we used to play Minesweeper with real minds.
3802127	3802707	Ha ha ha!
3803702	3806384	HitStun says, yeah, don't use the work PC for games.
3806464	3807925	Use something else like a cell phone.
3808345	3809826	Because a lot of cell phones have games.
3810126	3812307	So even if you don't have a DS, you probably have a cell phone.
3812407	3813588	We have to have our cell phones put away.
3815309	3816530	It would depend on your work environment.
3816570	3818811	Because you're in a call center type area, right?
3818831	3820172	Well, no, I don't work at the call center.
3820212	3824875	I work over in one of our production departments.
3825135	3826596	Very interesting.
3826636	3827096	Interesting.
3827947	3831948	But I did get permission to text message my mother all day when Hurricane Katrina hit.
3831988	3834989	Well, that stuff's different, you know.
3835269	3836110	And you want to know what?
3836130	3838350	I still had 110% productivity that day.
3838471	3838791	Wow.
3840751	3841552	All right, moving on.
3842432	3843672	Now you're just bragging.
3843692	3844713	You're a show-off over there.
3844813	3848194	No, it means that you can still take time for yourself and still get all your work done.
3848414	3848694	All right.
3849704	3855649	One thing that Jamie has plenty of time for and can still get all her work done is checking our mailbag over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3855969	3856710	Send us emails.
3856770	3857530	We love getting emails.
3857590	3860693	It's mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3860733	3866897	And when you guys send in your emails, DarkSakura reads them, and then she'll print some of the ones she likes out and put them on her fridge.
3867117	3868058	I post them in my cubicle.
3869059	3870680	And then she'll throw darts at them.
3871180	3872201	Yeah, uncertain ones.
3872401	3878526	All right, so let's go over to the mailbag, open that stuff up over there, and see what you folks have to say this week.
3878939	3880580	DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?
3880820	3885581	I have once again received a bajillion emails, so I'm taking the eight most relevant ones.
3886001	3886681	Oh, eight's a lot.
3886721	3887462	Let's get started.
3888102	3889662	Okay, first from Chupathingy.
3890042	3891763	I love that name, Chupathingy.
3891783	3892503	That's cool.
3892703	3898905	I received feedback last week that I need to stop saying, Hi, so-and-so, so I'll just kind of smile.
3899025	3899625	Yo, what up?
3899766	3902386	Know that when Jamie reads your name, I'm smiling.
3902907	3905487	Instead of saying, Hi, Chupathingy, so I'm smiling.
3906568	3907528	Hey, Griff, Chupathingy.
3907904	3908124	All right.
3908224	3908504	Okay.
3908845	3909245	Read the email.
3909265	3911046	All right.
3911086	3912827	Man, you all snapped me today.
3914207	3917269	I would like to say I'm fed up with Joseph Lieberman's crap.
3917907	3928634	I've written emails to my state senators, Max Bacchus and Conrad Burns, asking them not to buy into Senator Lieberman's ideals and to reject video game banning laws.
3929014	3931516	I don't know if I will get a form letter or not.
3931596	3935018	However, even if nothing is done about it, it was still worth the effort.
3935058	3936018	Keep fighting the good fight.
3936559	3937920	That is very good.
3938720	3942503	You know, for all the people who just sit and go, I don't like this.
3942823	3943643	I don't like that.
3944284	3945064	Do something about it.
3945104	3945865	You've got senators.
3945905	3946185	Write them.
3948141	3950222	You want your voice heard, you need to make it heard.
3950702	3950962	Agreed.
3951683	3952383	I have nothing else to say.
3952443	3952683	Agreed.
3952783	3954664	So a bajillion kudos go to you.
3954884	3955504	That's awesome.
3955904	3956744	The winner is you.
3957825	3961546	Also, our dear friend Rob, the one that's not you.
3962066	3962386	Yeah, I know.
3962466	3963027	The other Rob.
3963667	3964347	Rob with two Bs.
3964387	3965107	That's how you tell the difference.
3965167	3965848	It's Rob with two Bs.
3966128	3970389	Sent a list of vaporware from 2005, which I think is pretty cool.
3971050	3973070	And I am loading it as it was a link in the email.
3974451	3974631	But...
3976673	3982500	Some of the ones that came up, there was the Optimus keyboard.
3984722	3990168	They actually said the PowerBook G5 was ineligible.
3991508	3993248	Wait, so clarify this for me.
3993288	3994089	This is like a list.
3994289	3999470	I seem to remember I read a similar article, or maybe it was even the same one, just inadvertently.
3999590	4004871	It was something like a list of the top vaporware we didn't see or something like that.
4004971	4005892	Okay, okay, I get it.
4006252	4009693	Number 10 was the high-definition TiVo and TiVo to go for Mac.
4010933	4017755	Number 9, AlphaGrip ergonomic keyboard and trackball, which actually looks kind of neat, but it looks too unwieldy.
4019175	4019655	Next up,
4020981	4022322	As soon as it loads.
4023142	4024302	By the way, this is on Wired News.
4025443	4029845	Blu-ray or HD DVD discs for the end of 2005, which we didn't see.
4030425	4034647	Team Fortress 2, Brotherhood of Arms, Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess.
4034667	4035147	Thank you.
4035867	4036548	That was number six.
4036568	4037948	It should have been number one.
4038208	4040069	Well, let's see what else they came up with.
4040929	4043571	Well, you know, we all drooled over that at E3.
4043591	4044351	Yeah, what number one is?
4046001	4046401	StarCraft Ghost
4059274	4060375	Oh, good call.
4060455	4060635	Yeah.
4061035	4063797	Number four, Microsoft's Vista and Internet Explorer 7.
4064337	4067799	However, in its defense, the beta for 7 did come out last year.
4067899	4070120	And I'm hearing Firefox is still better.
4070500	4071200	I am hearing the same.
4071340	4075122	I know the same thing because I was up on the beta for a little bit.
4075603	4076103	It's still crap.
4077077	4077757	3.
4077337	4077757	Google.
4077917	4078698	Beta is galore.
4080918	4081639	Oh, that's true.
4081679	4083739	Their email is still considered beta, isn't it?
4083799	4084739	Gmail is still beta.
4084900	4085880	Frugal is still beta.
4085980	4088501	Alerts, blog search, book search, Scholar.
4089161	4094683	Google News is the last beta left, but it was still beta in 2005.
4094943	4095923	Good point, then.
4096063	4096903	Okay, that's a good one.
4097744	4100925	Also, we're up to number 2.
4101985	4102545	Phantom.
4103885	4104466	The Phantom.
4104766	4105346	Not a surprise.
4112106	4115408	I stand corrected.
4115468	4116228	No cookie for me.
4116688	4117029	Just kidding.
4117049	4117689	Give me a damn cookie.
4117869	4118730	No, no, no.
4118790	4119430	My cookies.
4119550	4120190	I want a cookie.
4120210	4122272	These are my sugar-free, gluten-free cookies.
4122472	4122992	Give me a cookie.
4123112	4123973	They're actually pretty yummy.
4123993	4124533	Yeah, it tastes like dough.
4124633	4124873	All right.
4127335	4128996	So, yeah.
4130737	4131117	Excuse me.
4132917	4137159	Back to the lovely, fantastic, and mystical world of email.
4137739	4143861	Crispy Creamy writes in and said, Okay, so the actual subject of this is personal game rules.
4144601	4153805	Okay, so every once in a while I'll play Naruto 3 for PS2 with my brother and we've set up this rule where you can't push someone into a corner and attack them continually, preventing them from moving.
4153865	4157866	I was wondering if you guys have any rules you set up with whoever you play with to make the game fair.
4158513	4159194	No snaking!
4160475	4161436	I was just saying the same thing.
4161497	4164040	No snaking on Mario Kart DS.
4164720	4166342	Ooh, gosh, that's so broad.
4166482	4168845	Do not pull up people's radishes in Animal Crossing.
4170247	4173010	There's so many different games I could think of.
4173431	4173511	Um...
4174670	4179256	You know, there's general courtesy laws that come with a lot of MMOs, certainly.
4179677	4191273	You know, things about courtesy, like, you know, especially in a group, you know, even though I was kind of ragging on the group element of Final Fantasy XI earlier, to kind of go back there for a little bit, Final Fantasy XI has such a heavy grouping element that it's like, you know,
4191553	4192674	Super Smash Bros.
4192694	4193695	Melee No Sleep Rule
4218435	4220097	Oh, you can't use the Jigglypuff thing?
4220357	4220537	Yeah.
4220717	4220957	Okay.
4221638	4222799	Alright, well, those are some good ones.
4223039	4226742	And there's actually, sometimes we played with a no Jigglypuff rule at all, because Jigglypuff's annoying.
4226842	4228824	I'll keep an eye on the chat room while you read the next email.
4228884	4230625	I usually end up not being allowed to play Kirby.
4232026	4233708	Because I piss people off when I play Kirby.
4233888	4238652	People get pissed off when I play Ness, because I sit in the corner and go, PK fire, PK fire, PK fire, PK fire.
4238872	4239392	Alright.
4241994	4246058	Um, I also got one that was actually sent to Mailbox, but it's supposed to be Mailbag.
4247159	4247239	Um,
4247947	4256193	That's right, because our awesome webmaster, Jason, digs that stuff out of the black hole of death where those emails go to when they go to the wrong address and forwards them appropriately.
4256233	4256913	So thank Jason.
4258815	4265719	There was an email sent more about Flowers for Jack, which I'm just making a mention on.
4267120	4269022	Oh yeah, we have Flowers for Jack stuff coming up later.
4269442	4273625	Yeah, so I'm going to leave that just that, you know what, forget him.
4275124	4278446	I'm only addressing it for the sake of, he just pisses me off so much.
4278526	4280607	Alright, so that email gets tossed, sorta.
4283529	4284430	We also have...
4286411	4292613	An email from, and he wanted me to do the name a certain way, from Happida.
4294574	4298016	It's a pretty long email, so I'm just going to go over, I'm going to quote certain points on it.
4298456	4299756	It says, hey guys, love the new format.
4299776	4308219	I listen when I'm at work, and it's gotten pretty tough to find enough quality podcasts to get me through the whole day, especially since Air America has gone to charging for its podcasts.
4308720	4309540	Did they really?
4309840	4310360	I guess so.
4310540	4312181	Not smart, not smart.
4314326	4321096	Curious as to what this music-oriented gaming show was all about.
4322117	4326163	Being a strictly podcast listener for the past year, so I can never catch it live with my schedule.
4327429	4335278	We're looking into options about putting out the old shows either for consumption on some type of archive like CD, DVD.
4335298	4339744	The problem is because there was a lot of copyrighted music that came with that, so it's kind of hard for us to do that.
4339784	4343508	We are also looking into possibilities of possibly syndicating our show.
4344029	4345771	We don't really run the archives with
4346031	4349674	with DDR Freak anymore because our show's podcast, so it kind of defeats the purpose.
4350515	4355278	But we may look into a syndication agreement with somebody at some point for the earlier episodes.
4356099	4357080	Anything is possible.
4357360	4366447	Also, with us possibly being gone next week, we don't have a contingency plan in place just yet because we live week to week, just like we live paycheck to paycheck.
4368288	4371471	So we may have a best of, so you can hear some of the highlights from the live show.
4371491	4374433	I think that might actually be a really good idea to put together some of our highlights from
4374993	4376314	The old three-hour show.
4377375	4382199	There's still people that haven't heard Loki play Karaoke Revolution, and we need to put that out to the podcast masses.
4382339	4383880	I'm glad I wasn't here live for that.
4384000	4386522	I was in San Diego sleeping in the Harry Potter closet.
4387222	4387723	You know what?
4389884	4394548	I think this new format, we stay on topic a lot more than we did with the old one.
4394568	4396749	But that can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing.
4397149	4397730	Yeah.
4399302	4400624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4419366	4420886	Well, the second paragraph pertains to you.
4420926	4421026	Uh-oh.
4421046	4421606	Which is true.
4421627	4421767	You did.
4444931	4449454	It was on stage during Jay Allard's keynote speech when he rushed on stage and yelled, Okay, now I'll be serious.
4452356	4459220	I think it was when he was talking about getting some autographs from fans of the G4 people, and I'm pretty sure it was Morgan Webb and what she told the autographs.
4459240	4466045	It wasn't for him, and she said, jokingly, something along the lines of, Sure, as in he just wanted a picture of her or something.
4466425	4471328	Nothing too important, but you guys were bitching about consistency in World of Warcraft, so I thought I'd call you guys on it.
4472069	4472149	Uh...
4472762	4481928	I guess I stand corrected, but also do realize our show, we weren't on iTunes when we did the E3 thing.
4481948	4487732	We weren't on iTunes, I don't think, because iTunes happened in June, I want to say, and that's for all the podcasts.
4487812	4491235	When iTunes rolled out their podcast name, I think that's when a lot of these shows got huge.
4491295	4497199	So maybe that's why I think a lot of people, because I did get a lot of emails from people who didn't know it before.
4497279	4498240	So, you know, whatever.
4498300	4500241	That just means they don't pay attention to you.
4505912	4516901	Anyhow, on the topic of emulation and finding ROMs, not that everyone here would do such an evil thing, I've heard you can find a lot of great ROM sets via torrent sites.
4517521	4522045	In fact, most everything on there are complete sets for different systems.
4522585	4523426	Something too complete...
4525030	4538700	If you're not interested in foreign games that are basically the same thing or you can't understand the language anyway, you might be pretty successful in finding the odd cult classic or insanely popular ROM here and there, but 90% of the time, they're sets.
4539161	4548468	Just wanted to throw out some info as I totally agree with you that ROM sites are 9 times out of 10 BS sites just trying to get more votes on useless top lists so they can get more hits on their hentai banners.
4548528	4549689	Talk about the...
4551121	4553682	Total scum sites of the internet.
4553702	4556023	Like the bottom of the barrel sites.
4556623	4560805	The just hideously horrible things on the internet.
4560865	4562726	I can't think of enough negative words to describe these sites.
4562746	4565046	Are these top so-and-so sites.
4565587	4569288	I shouldn't label all because maybe there's a couple that are okay.
4569728	4571449	But you know what I'm talking about.
4571489	4573150	You know like top 50 ROM sites.
4573230	4575310	Top 10 Nintendo ROM sites.
4575411	4577691	Top 69 porno sites.
4578012	4578432	You know it's...
4580910	4581530	What a bunch of crap.
4581590	4583031	It's banners, banners, banners, banners.
4583051	4586091	I will go ahead and name one of the sites I go through for old searches.
4586351	4586531	Sure.
4586951	4588052	As Zofar's domain.
4588432	4589072	Zofar.net.
4589252	4590032	Yeah, oh yeah.
4590052	4590612	P-H-A-R.
4591232	4592933	Still going as last I checked.
4593013	4593713	One of the best.
4594613	4596753	And... Romnation.net.
4597474	4597774	I believe.
4598434	4600454	Dotnet or dotcom.
4600914	4604135	I remember surfing Zofar's domain when Zofar was actually still there.
4604535	4605315	Years and years ago.
4605335	4606015	I remember being in the chat room.
4606035	4607956	I remember the International House of Roms.
4608156	4608456	Wow.
4608536	4609336	Alright, anyway, anyway.
4610441	4611461	before we age ourselves.
4612902	4617904	I do have one request and that is just call me HappyDah as in email address I'm not going to list.
4618524	4622306	I don't want to have the ladies to start stalking me for my elite emailing skills.
4623346	4627668	But please give a shout out to ARC and tell everyone to give some damn blood for goodness sakes.
4627728	4628588	Free cookies and pop.
4628628	4629629	It's a win-win for everyone.
4630909	4631349	Wait a minute.
4631890	4633130	Is that a local thing?
4635351	4638192	It's someone who actually emailed from the Red Cross.
4639052	4639153	Oh.
4639773	4640253	Red Cross worker.
4640526	4641567	Wow, sweet.
4642568	4647853	So that's a... Because that acronym made me think of something local.
4648153	4649374	I'm sorry, ARC.
4649434	4651676	Yeah, my college, American... Okay, I got thrown for a minute.
4651716	4652437	Okay, now I get it.
4652497	4653178	Okay, I get it now.
4655880	4658102	So yeah, but actually I find that very cool.
4658162	4659684	I actually am not allowed to give blood anymore.
4660745	4660965	Why?
4661565	4664668	Because I actually tested positive for certain antibodies.
4665169	4665389	Okay.
4665908	4667028	That means I can't give blood anymore.
4667369	4668249	That and I hallucinated.
4668449	4672370	Well, you'll just have to give a lot of sweat and tears instead.
4673311	4673531	All right.
4674071	4676472	I will be happy to accept your cookie donations.
4677452	4677812	All right.
4677952	4678512	Is that it?
4678712	4679233	That's all the mail?
4680333	4684454	Well, actually, one of our listeners, Justin, wanted to know the name of the title we use for the FUs of the week.
4684574	4687575	It's the one-winged angel theme from Final Fantasy Advent Children.
4687796	4689856	Yes, and the FUs of the week will be coming up in the next segment.
4690396	4691057	And last one.
4691297	4691457	Yep.
4692297	4694398	It's a message from...
4695764	4696825	I'm going to go by Jaded.
4697825	4699966	Well, you may have already gotten some of this already.
4700026	4704088	Actually, I know you have gotten some of this before, but it is on the whole video game thing.
4704528	4706789	There's an article I found on Slashdot that might be interesting.
4707269	4711791	And pulling that up, video gaming keeps the brain from aging.
4713869	4721751	and is basically stating that a body of research suggests that playing video games provides similar benefits to bilingualism and exercising the mind.
4722311	4730193	Just as people fluent in two languages learn to suppress one language while speaking the other, so too are gamers adept at shutting out distractions to deftly switch attention between different tasks.
4730713	4738315	A new study of 100 university students in Toronto has found out that video gamers consistently outperform their non-playing peers in a series of tricky mental tests.
4738855	4741136	If they also happen to be bilingual, they were unbeatable.
4741816	4741996	Huh.
4743830	4746211	Actually, I have found similar studies to that effect.
4747071	4752093	There was one in one of the psychological journals that I was reading when I was stuck in my doctor's office that they let me keep.
4752113	4761856	It was talking about how gamers have a better grasp of multitasking and puzzle, basically, problem-solving skills.
4762356	4767718	I'm all for stories that say games can make you smart, but I do think it really depends on what kind of games you're playing, too.
4767838	4768778	That's a huge part of it.
4769779	4769979	Anyway.
4770859	4772822	Alright, so is that it for the mailbag?
4772962	4773383	Was that it?
4773503	4774104	Yep, we're good?
4774485	4776668	Alright, you want to send in some email?
4776728	4782817	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Let's close up the old mailbag and get back into some news.
4783759	4785802	And one more thing for you guys before we go to break.
4786042	4792308	This kind of relates to an email bag question because it asked about what was the music gaming live show like.
4792708	4795370	This is a story that definitely would have been brought up on that show.
4795631	4797452	We're not turning our back on the music game scene.
4797472	4799414	We know a lot of you guys are still listening.
4799474	4800475	We love music games.
4800535	4801156	Love them, love them.
4801596	4804058	What's going on with DDR Extreme?
4804358	4805800	The whole title, DDR Extreme.
4805960	4806640	Yeah.
4806780	4812986	Everybody remembers similar kind of thing with the hot coffee with stuff that's left in the game that
4814088	4815829	Not supposed to be in there, but it was in there.
4815869	4816849	People found Memories.
4817309	4820130	And people were wondering, how the hell are we going to unlock Memories?
4820190	4824871	And for those who don't know, Memories is a song that was in the arcade that should have been in the home version, but wasn't.
4825131	4825392	Yes.
4826452	4831273	Well, there has been a Codebreaker code released for it.
4831433	4835455	And Codebreaker is kind of like a GameShark type of device where you use it for cheating.
4836115	4839536	Basically, you just enter this code in, and it's 2A59D741.
4843577	4847499	F1, A5, E096.
4847699	4854781	Enter that in on a version 7.0 or higher code record because most of them are higher than that.
4855761	4857662	And it will unlock memories.
4858142	4864304	Everything including it being in the song wheel, actually having unlock information in the information screen.
4864705	4866965	All you have to do is save your game and you're done.
4867205	4868906	It's permanently unlocked.
4869006	4869366	Wow.
4869586	4871127	I want to know how somebody found that.
4872287	4873988	How did somebody find that code?
4874248	4875469	Carefully, I guess.
