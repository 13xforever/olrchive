00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
And now the conclusion of episode number 173 for February 5th, 2006.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
And we're back here for the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 173 for this, February the 5th of 2006.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.440
Hope you guys are doing well. We had a pretty fun first half, very long first half.

00:32.440 --> 00:35.780
As you may or may not have heard, hopefully you guys have all went back and

00:35.780 --> 00:38.740
downloaded part A of the show for those of you guys listening on the podcast, but

00:38.740 --> 00:42.740
I was having a little bit of a printing drama. I wasn't able to print my boarding pass for my

00:42.740 --> 00:43.620
flight tomorrow.

00:43.620 --> 00:47.060
Loki finally got the damn thing to work and we printed my boarding pass during

00:47.060 --> 00:48.460
the break. I'm very happy.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.420
Even if I do have a crappy bee pass, damn you Southwest and your stupid system.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.620
Even if I have a crappy bee pass, at least it works. So thank you, Loki.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.260
Alright, no mic? There you go.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.940
Sorry, Christopher, like, you're a little...

01:02.940 --> 01:05.940
Yeah, you tangled me up in the chair. That's alright.

01:05.940 --> 01:10.780
And of course, if you didn't hear part 8, also, I'm in a very angsty

01:10.780 --> 01:15.140
Xbox 360 mood tonight, and I'm not going there again. You'll just have to download

01:15.140 --> 01:17.660
part 8 to figure out why, but if I sound bitter, I have a good reason.

01:17.660 --> 01:21.900
Alright, let's get back into it, though. Let's talk about something else

01:21.900 --> 01:23.220
that makes a lot of people bitter,

01:23.220 --> 01:28.220
And that's lack of Advent Children, because you know, we were supposed to have this movie out like months ago.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.220
Dark Soccer, what did you do with it? Did you take it?

01:30.220 --> 01:32.220
I had it, I had it months ago.

01:32.220 --> 01:37.220
Yeah, but what did you do with the rest of our copies? Where's our English version of it? What did you do with it?

01:37.220 --> 01:38.220
I ate it.

01:38.220 --> 01:39.220
Oh.

01:39.220 --> 01:40.220
Barf.

01:40.220 --> 01:45.220
Barf it up so we can have it. No, really. No, really. Where is Advent Children for the USA?

01:45.220 --> 01:53.300
Well, you know, we're supposed to be getting it sometime this year, according to the Digital

01:53.300 --> 02:00.940
Bits, which is, basically what's been said about it is, this is a quote, it's taking

02:00.940 --> 02:05.740
a little extra time to work with the director to get all of the supplemental elements finished,

02:05.740 --> 02:08.620
which is why it's delayed.

02:08.620 --> 02:12.540
You know, for as long as it's taking us to get it, I feel really awful for our friends

02:12.540 --> 02:16.860
in the UK who are probably not even getting it until after we do.

02:16.860 --> 02:20.780
Well, hell, most people that really want it bad enough have already downloaded it.

02:20.780 --> 02:24.500
I can't... whoa. A little error on our end.

02:24.500 --> 02:29.740
Not time for that yet. Um, I'm a little surprised here because I think most

02:29.740 --> 02:33.220
people that really have wanted the movie bad enough have already gotten it through

02:33.220 --> 02:35.740
illegal means. I'm surprised Sony sat on this for this long.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.980
Well, remember, Squintix told us it was going to be out in May 2005.

02:39.980 --> 02:43.100
um hi it's February

02:43.100 --> 02:46.340
where's my Advent Children?

02:46.340 --> 02:50.860
I don't get it. That's okay. Is this thing gonna still sell when it comes out?

02:50.860 --> 02:55.060
They're gonna have to have a lot of extras. Yeah people are gonna buy it I know they will

02:55.060 --> 02:57.980
however you know I

02:57.980 --> 03:01.060
I'm very much in a wait and see mode over this

03:01.060 --> 03:06.860
I have it I can watch it whenever I want so I'm trying not to

03:06.860 --> 03:12.460
to be too pushy on it I held out. But I want to see the stuff on the discs

03:12.460 --> 03:16.460
I've held out. I don't want to watch it on my computer for the first time. I want to watch it on a TV

03:16.460 --> 03:21.580
a big big TV as big as possible for the first time. I don't want it pixelated or none of that. I want

03:21.580 --> 03:22.380
beautiful

03:22.380 --> 03:25.940
what? Mine's actually a full DVD rip

03:25.940 --> 03:31.540
Damn you people. It looks pretty on my screen. I'm trying to be legit with this here

03:31.540 --> 03:35.060
okay I want to support. I legitimately downloaded it. I want to support

03:35.060 --> 03:38.940
Square and Sony here but I'm finding it harder and harder too as this thing keeps

03:38.940 --> 03:42.180
getting delayed. Whatever the problem is, fix it!

03:42.180 --> 03:45.420
Anything else anyone want to say?

03:45.420 --> 03:48.380
If it's to my credit I can- I have removed it from my hard drive.

03:48.380 --> 03:53.060
Loki, what- you had a release date on this at one point and now it's shot again.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.500
Yeah, they keep pulling it.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.820
Jeez. There was even a rumor going around saying that they're

03:58.820 --> 04:01.900
redoing all the animations to match the English dubbing.

04:01.900 --> 04:06.900
I guess that would be a good reason why it's taken so long.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.900
Okay, that might be a decent reason, but still.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.900
Nah, I don't think that's what the reason is.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.900
But I think the UK was actually...

04:13.900 --> 04:16.900
There was an article, I think, out this week about the UK,

04:16.900 --> 04:18.900
and they're getting theirs in 2006 as well.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.900
See, I'd imagine they don't have to do any, you know, sort of, you know,

04:22.900 --> 04:27.900
localization for a UK release, so...

04:27.900 --> 04:28.900
All right.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.900
Yeah.

04:29.900 --> 04:34.820
Let's move on and talk about something that's going on in Japanese arcades right now, but

04:34.820 --> 04:36.220
not U.S. ones.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.100
Loki, what's going on?

04:38.100 --> 04:40.400
What's going on is Soulcalibur III.

04:40.400 --> 04:45.180
The PlayStation 2 exclusive game is finally hitting the arcades where it needs to be.

04:45.180 --> 04:52.780
They're going to actually have all the same characters from the home version, along with

04:52.780 --> 04:57.900
some redesigned versions of three bonus characters from that version, Amy, Li Long, and Wang

04:57.900 --> 05:05.020
Seong Seong Gyeong I believe that's how you pronounce that anyways um so it

05:05.020 --> 05:08.940
should be pretty cool will I be able to take my custom dancer character and use

05:08.940 --> 05:15.060
it in the arcades uh that I'm not sure okay um it says though when the player

05:15.060 --> 05:18.880
finishes the game of Soulcalibur 3 arcade edition the screen will display a

05:18.880 --> 05:24.540
barcode symbol and password this will be used to join an online mobile phone

05:24.540 --> 05:30.460
based Soulcalibur 3 game called Mobile Conquest Mode. Basically by taking a

05:30.460 --> 05:36.680
snapshot of the barcode symbol with the person's mobile phone and using the

05:36.680 --> 05:39.660
password players can register their characters and challenge other players

05:39.660 --> 05:45.540
throughout the country via Soulcalibur 3's mobile phone website. That's kind of

05:45.540 --> 05:49.260
unique. That is unique. Never would have heard that. I mean I realize mobile phone

05:49.260 --> 05:53.260
is way bigger in other countries than it is here but that's you know kind of neat.

05:53.260 --> 06:00.040
I wish it would take off here, but whatever. Yeah, the game is slated for release in fall in Japan and

06:01.100 --> 06:03.960
Should be coming out here. I'm sure at some point I

06:05.060 --> 06:11.020
Would like to see Soulcalibur 3 in the arcades. I know everybody said Oh PlayStation 2 exclusive, but you know what exclusive windows up

06:11.020 --> 06:16.100
Let's get that Soulcalibur 2 is a great great arcade game. I'd love to see 3 hit the arcades

06:16.100 --> 06:18.540
Although I kind of think it should have been the arcades first

06:18.540 --> 06:20.860
But whatever and they can come up with these kind of cool features

06:20.860 --> 06:23.440
like it sounds like they're doing if they can carry some of that coolness

06:23.440 --> 06:28.700
over to the US I won't have such an issue with this I don't know all right

06:28.700 --> 06:32.500
now you know we were talking also in the first half because we had an email about

06:32.500 --> 06:37.060
it you know we've started as a DDR centric station so of course music and

06:37.060 --> 06:40.860
rhythm games we love them and Loki you have an article to hit the internet this

06:40.860 --> 06:45.820
week about rhythm games right yes game spot ran the 10 spot the top 10 rhythm

06:45.820 --> 06:52.820
games. Oh, another list. Yes, everybody loves lists. Lists are what they do when news gets

06:53.100 --> 07:00.100
slow. Anyways. It's human interest. Yes, first on the list of course we had, or I should

07:00.660 --> 07:05.820
say in the 10 spot here, Prop of the Rapper. Of course, now everybody loves that game.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.860
Samba de Amigo, which is pretty good. Number 9, right? Yes. Is this in order or is this

07:09.860 --> 07:15.060
just I think this is just 10 in no particular order this one actually was

07:15.060 --> 07:23.560
on the DS osu! tatake! oiden! which was for a Nintendo DS was kind of a game we

07:23.560 --> 07:27.280
never saw so I heard of this game though it a lot of people are importing it it's

07:27.280 --> 07:32.260
it's different yeah Gatoro man definitely guitar man yeah

07:32.260 --> 07:39.060
Vib ribbon I love that they're not they're not excluding import titles and

07:39.060 --> 07:41.380
things that weren't released here because there were a lot of good stuff that weren't

07:41.380 --> 07:42.380
released here.

07:42.380 --> 07:49.540
Of course the original guitar favorite, Guitar Freaks, Bust a Groove, or Bust a Move, however

07:49.540 --> 07:58.660
you want to call it, Frequency, then Guitar Hero, and you know, let's see here, of course

07:58.660 --> 07:59.940
Dance Dance Revolution.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.980
And they named Third Mix specifically, right?

08:01.980 --> 08:02.980
Yeah.

08:02.980 --> 08:05.820
I would say Third Mix was definitely a peak, had so many great licenses.

08:05.820 --> 08:09.380
I remember way back in your old apartment of doom

08:09.380 --> 08:12.580
I know the first time I ever got a little watching you play

08:12.580 --> 08:16.620
DDR not DDR playing the Jungle Book game

08:16.620 --> 08:21.420
my on the Jungle Book pad baby's first dancing game that was that was me I had

08:21.420 --> 08:24.780
my little mini for midgets it was a DER pad for midgets for the Jungle Book

08:24.780 --> 08:25.220
dancing game

08:25.220 --> 08:29.260
that's okay Jamie Fixx I know I know so is that it was that 10

08:29.260 --> 08:33.580
that was it where's Beatmania get guitar freaks off that list but Beatmania in there

08:33.580 --> 08:34.820
instead I think no crap

08:34.820 --> 08:39.620
I think we can all say that Guitar Hero kind of improved on Guitar Freaks, so there's no need for both of them on the list there.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.700
Let's get rid of Guitar Freaks and put BeatMania in there instead. What's up with that?

08:42.700 --> 08:44.020
I don't know.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.180
Anything else missing? I don't know. I think otherwise it's a pretty solid list.

08:47.180 --> 08:48.540
That's Space Channel 5.

08:48.540 --> 08:53.420
Ooh! Good call! That should have been somewhere on there. I don't know about that. Ooh, good call.

08:53.420 --> 08:56.260
Space Channel 5 is a great game.

08:56.260 --> 09:02.180
Interesting. I would have said Amplitude over Frequency, but I'm at least glad, you know, there's a little bit of harmonics love in there.

09:02.180 --> 09:04.780
karaoke revolution is not on the list

09:04.780 --> 09:07.120
and there's too much loki says good

09:07.120 --> 09:08.860
i don't like their game

09:08.860 --> 09:10.240
whatever

09:10.240 --> 09:12.900
uh... comments from the chat room here of course you know we got folks saying

09:12.900 --> 09:14.740
uh... no beatmania

09:14.740 --> 09:18.820
uh... pk akira eighty eight says no pump it up no in the groove

09:18.820 --> 09:22.420
uh... reni says where's papa music

09:22.420 --> 09:23.240
interesting

09:23.240 --> 09:24.540
lots of interesting choices

09:24.540 --> 09:27.700
that's that's the thing about list you guys is to so that they can leave

09:27.700 --> 09:28.580
something off

09:28.580 --> 09:30.660
just to ruffle your feathers about it

09:30.660 --> 09:31.660
Did it work?

09:31.660 --> 09:32.660
Did it work?

09:32.660 --> 09:33.660
All right.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.500
One thing that never ruffles any feathers, though, ever, ever, is Dark Sakura.

09:37.500 --> 09:43.420
And Dark Sakura brings us her very non-controversial and very politically correct website of the

09:43.420 --> 09:45.020
week every week.

09:45.020 --> 09:46.020
Right Dark Sakura?

09:46.020 --> 09:47.020
Of course I do.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.020
All right.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.980
So what website did you pick for the kids this week?

09:49.980 --> 09:55.580
Well, I figured as there are certain important things regarding the site going on, I would

09:55.580 --> 10:04.980
have to go with Kojima's blog. I love reading Kojima's blog. I think that he's

10:04.980 --> 10:11.860
pretty interesting person and kind of cute. I just like the pictures up there

10:11.860 --> 10:18.140
with his little foxhound thing on the side. Lots of interesting insight into

10:18.140 --> 10:24.060
what he's got going on as well as opinions of certain other people which

10:24.060 --> 10:28.500
Allie for somebody else to bring up, but it's really cool, and he also

10:29.900 --> 10:31.620
apparently just

10:31.620 --> 10:37.140
Has all kinds of things sneaking out in his blog along with changes didn't you notice a couple? I?

10:37.780 --> 10:39.780
Mean I haven't really read it

10:40.140 --> 10:42.260
But I will visit it now that it's hit your list

10:44.900 --> 10:50.580
Well also though you can find the link to hit it to Kojima's podcast oh

10:50.580 --> 10:57.580
The opinions rendered herein are those of the guests, and not necessarily those of Douglas

10:57.580 --> 11:01.820
Goldstein, Profile Investment Services, Ltd., or Israel National News.

11:01.820 --> 11:07.820
Readers should consult with a professional financial advisor before making any financial

11:07.820 --> 11:08.820
decisions.

11:08.820 --> 11:12.660
It's going to be handled by the international manager Ryan Payton.

11:12.660 --> 11:16.580
Payton is going to summarize Kojima's podcast and bring on guests and give behind the scenes

11:16.580 --> 11:18.500
information on the latest happenings of the company.

11:18.500 --> 11:25.380
So it's not really like a word for word blog, but it's like the English spinoff, I guess

11:25.380 --> 11:26.380
you could say.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.380
So that's pretty cool.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.260
So you want to give the address there for folks who want to look up that blog?

11:30.260 --> 11:31.260
Absolutely.

11:31.260 --> 11:35.340
And I'm going to give the link to the English blog.

11:35.340 --> 11:44.100
It's www.blog.konami.jp slash GS slash Hideo blog underscore E.

11:44.100 --> 11:49.980
Visit it, love it, because DarkSakura said so.

11:49.980 --> 11:50.980
Exactly.

11:50.980 --> 11:56.060
Alright, one thing that will not come up on the Hideo Kojima blog ever again, what's this

11:56.060 --> 11:57.060
Loki?

11:57.060 --> 12:02.660
It would be an ooey bull adaptation of Mill Your Cellot, and to which I will paraphrase

12:02.660 --> 12:05.720
kajima when he says absolutely not over my dead body

12:05.720 --> 12:10.420
fuck you ui bowl he did not say fuck you ui bowl you're gonna paraphrase all

12:10.420 --> 12:16.420
right anyways basically there's no way they didn't contact them on it they

12:16.420 --> 12:21.580
would never let him touch that property so he sucks that's all you need to know

12:21.580 --> 12:26.740
about that but the ui bowl fun doesn't stop there does it Loki no and if it's

12:26.740 --> 12:32.860
not a surprise Uwe Boll is nominated for Razzie for worst director thanks to

12:32.860 --> 12:37.540
Alone in the Dark. So Razzies are like the opposite of the Oscars right? Exactly.

12:37.540 --> 12:43.500
Because Alone in the Dark sucked ass as did other movies like Blood Rain which only

12:43.500 --> 12:50.340
pulled in 2.4 million dollars over 30 days and and that's nothing for like if

12:50.340 --> 12:55.380
I made 2 point what 2.4 did you say if I made 2.4 million dollars in 30 days that

12:55.380 --> 12:58.980
would be a great thing because then I could you know fund my evil empire but

12:58.980 --> 13:04.260
for a movie in Hollywood to make 2.4 million over 30 days and not be like an

13:04.260 --> 13:08.460
arthouse movie type thing that's bad that's not saying much considering that

13:08.460 --> 13:12.020
the production budget of the movie is 25 million dollars in the marketing costs

13:12.020 --> 13:17.980
apparently reached about 22 million dollars putting it a good that movie I

13:17.980 --> 13:22.100
think I maybe saw one billboard that was it like ever that puts it on the whole

13:22.100 --> 13:28.820
quite a bit and so but hey if you still want to see more we will wonder full

13:28.820 --> 13:34.400
movies and stuff there's in the name of the king two parts we will stop plugging

13:34.400 --> 13:38.780
that nobody wants to see it just don't plug it epic movie three hours of crap

13:38.780 --> 13:45.100
don't plug it coming out in November now you might notice we've had just a little

13:45.100 --> 13:49.580
bit like a tiny bit not much but like a little bit of angst this week I don't

13:49.580 --> 13:52.900
if it's just me maybe you've noticed it like you know especially Dark Sakura this

13:52.900 --> 13:56.780
week no I'm just kidding it's it's totally me but Dark Sakura this is her

13:56.780 --> 14:01.660
baby after all it's her segment and we intrude on it it's called the FUs of the

14:01.660 --> 14:05.560
week and it's the part of the show where we're allowed to get a little mean right

14:05.560 --> 14:10.020
Dark Sakura oh yes

14:10.020 --> 14:28.980
My F.U. of the week goes toward my own body for betraying me in a most heinous fashion.

14:28.980 --> 14:35.980
I went over to one of my co-workers house to help her and her son with their MP3 player

14:35.980 --> 14:39.860
and I forgot about her dogs.

14:39.860 --> 14:45.540
Now normally if I'm around a dog, I'll get smithy, I might itch a little bit.

14:45.540 --> 14:49.300
Normally I take like a Benadryl before I go over there and I'm fine.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.940
Oh my god, okay.

14:52.940 --> 14:57.940
I'm there for all of 10 minutes and I start to feel the smithy and I start to feel my

14:57.940 --> 15:03.140
eyes itch a little bit and I was like yeah it's allergies, I'm leaving in a few minutes.

15:03.140 --> 15:12.180
Well within not even five minutes of that, suddenly my eyes were swollen shut.

15:12.180 --> 15:13.180
They were bloodshot.

15:13.180 --> 15:19.660
I burst two blood vessels in my left eye and my eyes had swollen so much they were pulling

15:19.660 --> 15:22.020
the skin tight around my eyes.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.020
Ew!

15:23.020 --> 15:27.780
It was really disgusting and then they were all gumming up and it was all bloody.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.860
And many podcast listeners just threw up in their mouths there with that.

15:30.860 --> 15:31.860
Thank you.

15:31.860 --> 15:32.860
Sorry.

15:32.860 --> 15:36.100
I'm going into detail so that people will understand my level of

15:36.780 --> 15:42.100
Rather well-contained rage right now. So and you know, I wasn't really you know

15:42.820 --> 15:49.340
My friend kept apologizing. It's not her fault. You know, she didn't you know say let's give her the genes that make her look at your dogs

15:50.020 --> 15:53.180
You know, I'm sort of allergic to my cat too, but I'm used to her

15:54.580 --> 16:01.640
So she went and gave me some Benadryl in these like little sanitary allergy eye drops and it seriously took about

16:01.640 --> 16:05.000
about 20 minutes before I could open my eyes.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.720
And so I went to go pick up Tia.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.240
And she got in the car.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.720
I had my glasses off at that point.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.960
And I turned and looked at her, and she was like, oh my god!

16:13.960 --> 16:15.360
And started to get out of the car.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.200
I was like, Tia, no!

16:20.200 --> 16:23.440
I just have a zombie eye.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.800
My eyes, I actually took a picture of it,

16:26.800 --> 16:28.720
how it was after, get this.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.960
Will you post on the website?

16:29.960 --> 16:30.600
I will.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.220
three doses of Benadryl

16:34.220 --> 16:38.380
and all kinds of eye drops. I got those neat Japanese minty eye drops that make your

16:38.380 --> 16:40.040
eyes feel all cold

16:40.040 --> 16:44.000
and I slept with a cold compress on my face for two days. I went to the doctor yesterday

16:44.000 --> 16:48.820
because it actually the bone around my left eye started to hurt

16:48.820 --> 16:53.840
and so he gave me some lovely drugs and now most of the swelling is down but it's still there

16:53.840 --> 16:56.800
I looked yesterday like I got punched in the eye

16:56.800 --> 17:02.440
Dan proceeded to say, well that's what you get for not ducking.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.440
My husband.

17:03.440 --> 17:07.640
So yeah, fuck you to my jeans.

17:07.640 --> 17:12.200
I blame mommy and daddy and all the drugs they did in the 70s.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
Whoa, okay.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.480
Loki, your turn.

17:15.480 --> 17:19.660
My nephew this week goes to the restaurant chain known as Hooters.

17:19.660 --> 17:24.080
Fuck you for your really crappy service and your really crappy food.

17:24.080 --> 17:29.040
Um, I went there actually on Saturday to get some food and, you know, cause people wanted

17:29.040 --> 17:32.520
to go to Hooters to check it out, you know, they had never been.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.280
So we got there, and I give them my name, they write my name down as Ben.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.660
I'm like, no, it's Matt.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.300
They write down Max.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.400
I'm like, that's close enough.

17:41.400 --> 17:46.400
So we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting, finally we get, you know, seeded and stuff,

17:46.400 --> 17:48.900
and it takes them a half an hour to take our order.

17:48.900 --> 17:53.840
Then afterwards, we're waiting, waiting, waiting, takes an hour for us to get our food.

17:53.840 --> 17:58.680
and they hadn't even delivered the wings we had ordered, which were going to be an appetizer.

17:58.680 --> 18:05.680
On top of all that, just the people there were retarded. I mean, just completely retarded.

18:05.720 --> 18:10.220
You're trying to talk to these people, and their Coke was really watered down, and their

18:10.220 --> 18:14.000
burgers weren't that great, and the wings, you know what, even if they are world famous,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.800
they sucked ass. So, fuck Hooters, I will never be going back there.

18:18.800 --> 18:24.080
Marceph in the chat room says, who goes to Hooters for the food?

18:24.080 --> 18:25.080
Well it's definitely enough for the intelligence.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
Alright, let me give an FU real quick.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
Welcome to Hooters!

18:27.080 --> 18:32.520
Let me give an FU real quick, I think this shouldn't come as much surprise to anybody

18:32.520 --> 18:38.320
who listened to part A, but FU to Microsoft for making 360's and getting me all excited

18:38.320 --> 18:41.640
that I finally have a 360 and then making one that would crash on me after 24 hours.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.200
That was very kind of you Microsoft.

18:45.200 --> 18:55.200
I just want to add on Loki's hatred for Hooters, because it's not that great. Their food isn't that good.

18:55.200 --> 19:04.200
And the girls are like, thank you for coming to Hooters! They have more brains in their boobs than they do in their head.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.200
You can address those cards and letters to extfer at orangeonshredge.com

19:07.200 --> 19:14.200
Yes, email me your amazing stories on how I meant something in your life

19:15.200 --> 19:16.200
Alright

19:17.200 --> 19:18.200
Shut up

Orangeonshredge

19:20.200 --> 19:21.200
Moving on

19:23.200 --> 19:25.200
Dark Sacris, we can have something meaningful

19:25.200 --> 19:28.200
Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very meaningful game to some of us

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
Oh yes

19:29.200 --> 19:31.200
And we've been waiting to hear some news on the US version

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
But you got something for us?

19:33.200 --> 19:40.920
Well yeah actually I've got a confirmed list of some of the voice actors in the

19:40.920 --> 19:46.920
game. Very cool. So we have Haley Jill Azimut of course for Azasura. For

19:46.920 --> 19:52.480
Aerith it's Mena Suvari from American Beauty. One I don't want to say because

19:52.480 --> 19:59.960
it's very very spoilery. Should I spoil? Okay plug your ears real quick.

20:33.860 --> 20:37.660
Chicken little Zach Braff. Yay cloud Steve Burton and

20:39.140 --> 20:44.760
I do not see anything about bringing back my man as my man

20:44.760 --> 20:48.040
David Boreanaz as Squall?

20:48.040 --> 20:51.180
As, yes. Leon, remember. Oh, sorry, Leon. Not bad.

20:51.180 --> 20:54.600
On IMDB they had him listed. Yeah, by IMDB. I already realize.

20:54.600 --> 20:59.000
IMDB, all they did was copy the same people who played whoever and whatever.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.880
Oh, really? So, yeah, IMDB is a...

21:01.880 --> 21:05.580
I will not say lying piece of crap, I will just say

21:05.580 --> 21:09.180
inaccurate source. They are. I do agree.

21:09.180 --> 21:13.520
But for the stuff that's already out, they're pretty reliable. And, uh, no, um...

21:13.520 --> 21:17.420
Noah of Pirates of the Caribbean voice actors

21:17.420 --> 21:20.960
unfortunately. Yeah, nothing listed there, and no Lance Bass.

21:20.960 --> 21:25.000
Well, no, the recent scheduling conflicts to their new movie.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.520
Yeah, although in an article that I

21:28.520 --> 21:34.000
read they were taking great care to capture some very Keith Richards-like

21:34.000 --> 21:37.120
motion for how he would walk.

21:37.120 --> 21:42.520
Alright, all this talk on Kingdom Hearts,

21:42.520 --> 21:46.040
I think we need to bring back a segment because, you know, we've been doing this new format

21:46.040 --> 21:49.040
for a little while and part of the reason we went to the new format is so we could bring

21:49.040 --> 21:56.200
segments from our live show we used to do and one of those segments is List List.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.800
Alright, now I know our podcast listeners are hearing List List for the first time so

22:01.800 --> 22:03.800
we're going to kind of set this up for you guys.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.520
Those of you guys listening live tonight on Sunday night, you guys get to directly participate

22:07.520 --> 22:08.520
in this.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.840
Your votes will come up with a list.

22:10.840 --> 22:15.040
As we've been talking about in the show, people love to make lists and we're no different

22:15.040 --> 22:16.040
here at Orange Lounge Radio.

22:16.040 --> 22:22.560
Once in a while we like to take a topic and we like to come up with the definitive list

22:22.560 --> 22:27.200
through a very scientific process where we nominate things for your consideration and

22:27.200 --> 22:28.880
then we take them away.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
So here's how it's going to work.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.760
There's four people participating in tonight's list.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.400
List Xtaphir, Loki, Dark Soccer, and myself and we're going to give you our top three

22:35.400 --> 22:37.080
and then we're going to go around.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.220
So we'll have a list of 12 at that point, then we're going to go around and each person

22:40.220 --> 22:45.760
takes one thing off the list oh snap so that leaves a list of eight which you

22:45.760 --> 22:50.120
the chat room get to vote on and give us your definitive top three for the list

22:50.120 --> 22:53.640
from that eight so I bet you're all dying to know tonight's topic and see

22:53.640 --> 23:01.640
how this works here the topic for tonight is world I most want to see in

23:01.640 --> 23:07.560
Kingdom Hearts 3 now here's the catch doesn't have to be related to Disney or

23:07.560 --> 23:11.220
square we're living in a fantasy world right now okay we realize that it's got

23:11.220 --> 23:14.280
to be Disney or square to realistically be in a Kingdom Hearts game but that's

23:14.280 --> 23:16.200
okay we live in a fantasy world here at Orange

23:16.200 --> 23:20.200
Lounge Radio so we're opening it up to any fandom any cartoon whatever you want

list from the way we used to do it when the chat room votes you will be able to

23:34.680 --> 23:39.800
pick not just one but now you can pick a number one and the number two so you can

23:39.800 --> 23:42.440
actually pick two things from the topless age but you do have to tell me

23:42.440 --> 23:45.400
what's your number one and what's your number two and if you don't specify I'll

23:45.400 --> 23:49.520
assume the first thing you listed was your number one all right enough chatter

23:49.520 --> 23:55.200
let's get to the list shall we let's start making our list here and Dark

23:55.200 --> 23:59.560
Sakura why don't you start us off what's your number three pick for world you

23:59.560 --> 24:06.560
would most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 3? Doom. Doom? Now would this be with, this would

24:07.640 --> 24:14.640
be hell. Alright, we have Doom on the list. Any other reasons why you want to see Doom?

24:14.880 --> 24:20.040
Just put the characters in hell? I just like to see really fucked up things. No kidding

24:20.040 --> 24:25.160
lady. Alright, let's go over to Loki, you're number 3. I was actually picking more Disney

24:25.160 --> 24:32.160
theme stuff. So Darkwing Duck. That would be cool. The Darkwing Duck level. Alright

24:33.360 --> 24:40.360
I like that. Are you the terror that flaps in the night? My number 3 pick is uh, I didn't

24:41.080 --> 24:45.240
have a better name for this so I'm calling it Secret of Mono World. You know it's another

24:45.240 --> 24:50.520
great square game that ought to be given some love. So Secret of Mono World. Dare I ask

24:50.520 --> 24:54.920
extra fur what's your number three pick I'm gonna be pretty predictable I'm

24:54.920 --> 24:59.720
gonna choose Silent Hill world now see that would never happen in the actual

24:59.720 --> 25:02.640
game but that's okay it's our fantasy we get whatever we want

25:02.640 --> 25:06.120
Pyramid Head you know you got your Henry in the room great so now we're gonna

25:06.120 --> 25:10.920
have like totally effed up Kingdom Hearts 2 and Silent Hill your special helper

25:10.920 --> 25:18.920
character will be a magical girl Heather all right yeah I would I would love to

25:18.920 --> 25:22.600
see Silent Hill World just to see a Sora take on Pyramid Head that'd be pretty

25:22.600 --> 25:29.220
badass all right let's go to the number twos number twos Dark Sakura my number

25:29.220 --> 25:39.120
two labyrinth with David Bowie and his member and oh yes because there were two

25:39.120 --> 25:42.960
stars there were three stars in that movie Jennifer Connelly David Bowie and

25:42.960 --> 25:48.120
David Bowie schlong and each of the the characters will be dressed up in tight

25:48.120 --> 25:57.780
pants with giant packages. And your special helper will be the little dog on the other

25:57.780 --> 26:07.100
dog. Or Bluto. So bad! Alright, let's keep it moving. Loki, your number two pick for

26:07.100 --> 26:11.380
worlds you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3. Since all the answers have been quite ridiculous,

26:11.380 --> 26:19.480
How about we do Hello Kitty World, Sanrio World, there we go, where it teams up with

26:19.480 --> 26:22.960
Hello Kitty to take on, you know, the evil Bad Bats Maru and things.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.600
They should fight Nazis, because I think that would be appropriate.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.200
They should, that's a good concept there.

26:29.200 --> 26:34.600
My number two pick, Chrono Trigger World, and you do the whole time traveling thing,

26:34.600 --> 26:37.480
another great Square franchise, I think people would screen their panels as they could see.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.280
I had a feeling someone else was going to mention that, which is why I didn't.

26:40.280 --> 26:42.680
Alright, so there it is. Chrono Trigger World.

26:42.680 --> 26:46.520
It would be like traveling to different universes and THEN traveling in time.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.600
Alright. That would be complex.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.500
Uh, Extifer, your number two pick.

26:51.500 --> 26:56.420
Um, well, I-I think that I'm gonna go with Serenity World.

26:56.420 --> 26:57.720
Because...

26:57.720 --> 27:03.880
I can't- And there's this collective Joss Whedon fanboy, eeee, coming out. Yeah, I can't be- But you have Malzure.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.280
Cat in Tight- Cat in Tight Pants is your partner. Yes.

27:08.280 --> 27:13.920
And he's going to aid you and maybe have a hot sex scene too against the men with blue

27:13.920 --> 27:14.920
hands.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.200
All right.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.200
Time for the number ones.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.200
You ready for it?

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
Number one world.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.140
So we're making the definitive list.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.140
Once we've done this, this is done.

27:23.140 --> 27:24.220
This is all sealed and done.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.460
We're sending it to Square and saying this is what we want.

27:27.460 --> 27:28.880
Don't listen to what anybody else says.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.720
This is the top three right here.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.060
Dark Sakura, your number one fantasy world for Kingdom Hearts 3.

27:34.060 --> 27:37.860
Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time world.

27:37.860 --> 27:43.560
any of that crap Waterworld crap from Dream Waker.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.920
So Legend of Zelda World, again something that would never happen, the Nintendo thing

27:46.920 --> 27:48.920
on the Sony, but it's our units to tell the world.

27:48.920 --> 27:53.820
But if anyone though looks at my DeviantArt profile, I have done fanart for this.

27:53.820 --> 27:54.820
That's hardcore.

27:54.820 --> 27:55.820
Yes.

27:55.820 --> 27:56.820
Hardcore nerd.

27:56.820 --> 27:57.820
Alright.

27:57.820 --> 28:00.720
Loki, your number one pick.

28:00.720 --> 28:01.720
See this was tough.

28:01.720 --> 28:07.680
I wanted to go more realistic and do like, you know, Treasure Planet or Rocketeer, speaking

28:07.680 --> 28:14.680
to fight nazis, but since we are going ridiculous, DOA beach volleyball world.

28:15.680 --> 28:22.680
DOA beach volleyball world. What exactly would you be fighting? You would be fighting clothing.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.600
I just see it as doing nothing but playing volleyball there because when you go to the

28:28.600 --> 28:34.960
undersea level in Kingdom Hearts 2 all you do is sing. You sing under the sea.

28:34.960 --> 28:39.400
My number one pick is Microsoft World.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.640
In Microsoft World, things glitch out.

28:42.640 --> 28:47.480
Occasionally you have to fight the evil glitches and things that disappear and the world just

28:47.480 --> 28:51.680
disappears suddenly on you and things go blank.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.880
It's a real crazy level.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.960
What was that one game on GameCube that totally messed with you?

28:55.960 --> 28:56.960
Eternal Darkness?

28:56.960 --> 28:57.960
Was that it?

28:57.960 --> 28:58.960
Was it Bitterness World?

28:58.960 --> 28:59.960
No, no.

28:59.960 --> 29:00.960
Microsoft World actually is what this is.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.520
Let's be glad that Tron World is not powered by Microsoft.

29:03.520 --> 29:18.520
I just need to go that one step further in my Joss Whedon fandom and create Once More with Feeling World.

29:18.520 --> 29:22.520
I thought you were just going to say Buffy World.

29:22.520 --> 29:25.520
No, it was the musical episode of Buffy.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.520
That was great, especially with the whole hot lesbian scene with Tara and Willow.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.520
You can do so much with that world!

30:31.520 --> 30:38.040
Labyrinth World, Hello Kitty or Sanrio World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, Zelda

30:38.040 --> 30:44.940
Ocarina of Time, DOA Beach Volleyball, Microsoft World, and Buffy the Musical World, once more

30:44.940 --> 30:47.040
with Feeling World if you so choose.

30:47.040 --> 30:50.880
Alright, so Dark Sakura, one of these has got to come off the list.

30:50.880 --> 30:51.880
What's going off the list?

30:51.880 --> 30:54.320
Move your hand out of my way.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.320
Sorry.

30:55.320 --> 30:56.320
Thank you.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.320
Um, Microsoft World, sorry.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.360
You evil little bitchling.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.400
Why did you take off my...

31:00.400 --> 31:05.680
did you take that one off because i don't want to play a reality game i want to play

31:05.680 --> 31:11.040
like something for fun i i i'm okay with that answer all right loki what's coming off this

31:11.040 --> 31:21.120
list um you know i'm i'm just gonna have to take off uh so tough um buffy the musical

31:21.120 --> 31:30.000
world oh oh snap oh loki burn you know i could take off serenity world and really be me but

31:30.000 --> 31:32.140
I think this one's mostly filler.

31:32.140 --> 31:37.360
No, this one, I'm sorry guys, this one has to go DOA Beach Volleyball World.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.280
I'm sorry, that's uh...

31:39.280 --> 31:41.600
I like that one!

31:41.600 --> 31:45.520
Sor was gonna become a man!

31:45.520 --> 31:47.560
You took that away from him!

31:47.560 --> 31:50.080
I'm sorry, it's done, it's done, what's done is done.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.320
Now he'll never get in because he's never gonna find Kyrie.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.600
Extra Pro, what's the last one coming off this list?

31:55.600 --> 31:59.360
Um, I think I'm gonna go with Hello Kitty World.

31:59.360 --> 32:09.420
Hello Kitty world that was a good one all right chat room it's your turn to

32:09.420 --> 32:15.420
vote send a private message to sky in the chat room with your top two your

32:15.420 --> 32:23.380
number one and your number two all right doom darkwing duck secret of mono world

32:23.380 --> 32:29.060
Silent Hill world labyrinth world chrono trigger world serenity world and

32:29.060 --> 32:33.060
Zelda Ocarina of Time world. Tell us what worlds would you most want to see in

32:33.060 --> 32:36.780
Kingdom Hearts 3 assuming that you know Disney and Square only is out of the

32:36.780 --> 32:39.940
picture, your fantasy world. Send those over private message and we'll reveal the

32:39.940 --> 32:44.900
answers a little later in the show, the definitive list. In the meantime, more

32:44.900 --> 32:48.780
news and we're going to go on over to Loki who's going to tell us what's going

32:48.780 --> 32:52.940
on with the Sony PSP and we talked about some of this in the first half but you

32:52.940 --> 32:56.480
had a little more like PSP also so what's going on? Yeah basically they

32:56.480 --> 33:02.680
They're just boasting that their online service is going to be better than Microsoft.

33:02.680 --> 33:07.160
So anyways, they said that this time it's very real.

33:07.160 --> 33:14.400
Sony is dead serious about their online service and it's being designed to match the service

33:14.400 --> 33:17.740
of Xbox Live and exceed it.

33:17.740 --> 33:23.280
And they're going to be basically, as mentioned before, linking a lot of the PSP and PS3 stuff

33:23.280 --> 33:24.280
together.

33:24.280 --> 33:31.280
Yeah, promises, promises. That's what I have to say about that.

33:33.280 --> 33:37.800
Isn't that a little bit too much too late? I mean, Xbox Live has already established

33:37.800 --> 33:39.720
themselves as like the definitive...

33:39.720 --> 33:44.320
Well, but you know what? If Sony puts out something better, there's no reason they can't

33:44.320 --> 33:46.120
take the crown, especially if their system works.

33:46.120 --> 33:51.480
That's not necessarily gonna be their big thing, though, because, I mean, you can have

33:51.480 --> 33:54.120
beta, which is better than VHS.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.400
Yeah, basically their plan of, you know, fuck it, we don't need a plan, didn't really work

33:58.400 --> 34:05.400
out too well with the PS2, so, gonna have to try it again.

34:06.400 --> 34:11.720
And, and, oddly enough, wasn't Beta by Sony?

34:11.720 --> 34:13.600
Something to think about there.

34:13.600 --> 34:20.240
Let's move on, let's go over to DarkSakura, who likes to keep tabs on what's going on

34:20.240 --> 34:23.960
overseas, because we love our listeners throughout the world, not just those here in America,

34:23.960 --> 34:27.040
I mean, we love the America one, we love the Canada ones, and all the other countries, but

34:27.040 --> 34:30.800
the UK doesn't get enough love from a lot of gaming things out there because they

34:30.800 --> 34:32.360
get games late and stuff, it sucks.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.640
So, DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK? Well,

34:35.640 --> 34:40.040
actually the first thing we have up is that Daedal's doing a new

34:40.040 --> 34:44.280
Xbox 360 hard drive.

34:44.280 --> 34:49.080
It's supposed to be two inches square,

34:49.080 --> 34:53.120
weighing four ounces. The drive will be able to store thousands of songs and

34:53.120 --> 34:59.760
over 5,000 images. The idea is you can transfer MP3s from your PC to your Xbox 360 or whack

34:59.760 --> 35:04.560
all of your JPEGs and use your TV to watch them all.

35:04.560 --> 35:14.560
It's basically a 4GB USB drive that's shaped like the power button on the 360. And close.

35:14.560 --> 35:23.640
They are actually giving a speculated price of 99 pounds.

35:23.640 --> 35:31.520
Dark Planets is already taking pre-orders for 74.99, that's in pounds.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.920
Also though, they still have not yet confirmed the price point, they are still working with

35:35.920 --> 35:41.000
the distributors, but an official price will be out along with the release date next week.

35:41.000 --> 35:54.240
about 150 us about 150 us also excuse me there is a very interesting bit of news

35:54.240 --> 36:00.520
about dead or alive 4 it has basically removed a need for speed most wanted

36:00.520 --> 36:09.520
from the top position and has taken number one basically it's you know it's

36:09.520 --> 36:13.520
It's a pretty game, but I don't know how it got to be number one.

36:13.540 --> 36:17.540
It's hard. I mean...

36:17.560 --> 36:21.560
From what I saw about it, because I saw very little of it, because you know, Rob's

36:21.580 --> 36:25.600
Xbox broke. Again, I say that Rob's

36:25.620 --> 36:29.620
Xbox broke. Thank you for the reminder. Appreciate it.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.640
Also his Xbox broke. And so basically when I saw it though,

36:33.660 --> 36:37.660
it did look really pretty, but I don't think I would ever play it.

36:37.660 --> 36:41.380
you know whatever but it was pretty well they're saying though all across the

36:41.380 --> 36:46.880
board on the top three titles in the charts are all on Xbox 360 also for

36:46.880 --> 36:51.580
Xbox 360 exclusives have come into the top 20 for the first time since the

36:51.580 --> 36:57.420
December 2005 launch we've got Call of Duty 2 we have project Gotham Racing 3

36:57.420 --> 37:04.540
at number 7 there's also perfect dark zero that hopped up from 27 to be at

37:04.540 --> 37:14.640
number 14 and Sega's condemned is also back in the top 40 so it's a coming in

37:14.640 --> 37:19.480
actually number 18 they said but you know actually I thought condemned was a

37:19.480 --> 37:23.920
really good game that should be higher up there but but honestly people are

37:23.920 --> 37:34.240
liking what they're playing for those with working systems okay one other bit

37:34.240 --> 37:42.580
news too, is that there are going to be no UK studio layoffs yet for EA even

37:42.580 --> 37:46.600
though they are in development jobs. I heard about they were doing some layoffs

37:46.600 --> 37:50.520
here in the US so probably has a lot of people over there on edge but not gonna

37:50.520 --> 37:55.840
happen. That's what's looking like their UK studio is, I hope I say this right, is in

37:55.840 --> 38:01.600
Chertsey. It looks like it's coming out without the job cuts that we're

38:01.600 --> 38:06.640
all seeing over here in the U.S. The studio is supposed to be cutting off I

38:06.640 --> 38:14.080
think 5% of their global workforce. There haven't really been any indications. One

38:14.080 --> 38:19.000
of their spokespersons said that they cannot confirm that there's not any that

38:19.000 --> 38:22.760
might come up. To go ahead and give the quote, every division is going through

38:22.760 --> 38:27.840
evaluation. We're looking for, we're looking around the company to see how to

38:27.840 --> 38:31.400
best align teams everywhere against what needs to happen for future growth.

38:31.400 --> 38:38.840
which means we're giving you a non-committal answer, because we can. So far, about 350 people

38:38.840 --> 38:50.440
were cut in the US, laid off from the Vancouver, Redwood Shores, and Tiburon jobs. The joys of

38:50.440 --> 38:56.760
corporations. It happens, too bad. Well, I wish the UK employees a good bit of luck.

38:56.760 --> 39:04.140
and then another bit actually a looks like February 17th Shadow of the

39:04.140 --> 39:10.460
Colossus will be out in the UK it's a pretty neat game from what I understand

39:10.460 --> 39:14.100
I haven't played it myself I didn't get too into it but it's kind of one of

39:14.100 --> 39:17.460
those games try it out because it's it's kind of a polarizing game people either

39:17.460 --> 39:20.100
really like it or they don't get it so you know certainly for those of you guys

39:20.100 --> 39:22.820
who have been really wanting to check this game out you're gonna get a chance

39:22.820 --> 39:26.960
so I good for opportunity I believe in choices so go for it

39:26.960 --> 39:31.200
oh I'm you know I'm glad to see some of the releases finally filtering out

39:31.200 --> 39:34.700
because there are some good games out there in fact speaking of releases

39:34.700 --> 39:40.940
coming out February 2006 actually already out as of the third there's they

39:40.940 --> 39:44.700
got alien hominid on the Gameboy Advance and I I needed to get that game I've

39:44.700 --> 39:49.340
just been so busy but yeah good I'm coming out on the 10th breath of fire

39:49.340 --> 39:56.900
3 for the PSP I love breath fire command and conquer the first decade also that's

39:56.900 --> 40:04.440
on PC Dora the Explorer on GBA EA Sports Rugby 2006 full auto Xbox 360 Dora the

40:04.440 --> 40:11.040
Explorer popular over there too I an early childhood I'm sorry I'm sorry if

40:11.040 --> 40:13.880
she's popular there although it's a great Halloween costume I saw some Dora

40:13.880 --> 40:17.840
Halloween's funny well they would only get Nickelodeon by satellite by sky

40:17.840 --> 40:18.840
I don't know.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.840
I don't know.

40:19.840 --> 40:20.840
Oh, well.

40:20.840 --> 40:27.680
Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Party 7, Space Invaders Evolution on the PSP, Star

40:27.680 --> 40:34.400
Wars Empire at War on PC, Tales of Eternity on PSP, The Rub Rabbits on DS, what's that?

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
I have never heard it.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
It must be something over there.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.560
Dear UK listeners, please tell me what the Rub Rabbits are, thank you.

40:38.560 --> 40:42.800
The Rub Rabbits would be the sequel to Fill The Magic.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.960
Oh, I thought that had changed names.

40:45.960 --> 40:50.100
I thought it was something really perverted. Where do babies come from?

40:50.100 --> 40:53.960
Yeah, where do babies come from? You have bunnies! And last up,

40:53.960 --> 40:57.160
totally spies for the Game Boy Advance. I,

40:57.160 --> 41:01.320
however, am feeling very happy for our friends over there because on the 17th

41:01.320 --> 41:02.440
they get guilty, Girisuka.

41:02.440 --> 41:05.480
That game is cool.

41:05.480 --> 41:10.000
Very, very cool. And Super Monkey Ball Touch and Go comes out on the 17th as

41:10.000 --> 41:10.400
well.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.440
Alright. But I will be going more into detail

41:13.440 --> 41:15.440
When the time comes all right

41:15.960 --> 41:18.820
Loki do you have some release dates for the u.s.. Of course I do

41:19.360 --> 41:22.940
Coming this week. I will be getting arena football the

41:23.740 --> 41:25.740
football series that no one really watches

41:26.040 --> 41:29.240
Put out by EA, but it's a nice budget. Tell a 29 99

41:29.640 --> 41:33.400
We've got for those horse fans. Let's ride silver buckle

41:34.080 --> 41:35.200
stables

41:35.200 --> 41:40.160
Crappy game for the let's not game. We're in Resident Evil deadly silence coming to the Nintendo DS

41:40.160 --> 41:45.880
which would be good. Rob Rabbits also coming to Nintendo DS. Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max

41:45.880 --> 41:53.120
coming to the PSP. I love those Street Fighter titles. Tales of Legendia coming to the PS2

41:53.120 --> 41:57.320
which kind of combines a fighting game and RPG in the one, which is really neat. And

41:57.320 --> 42:03.360
of course our favorite company Konami, World Soccer winning 11.9 coming to PS2, Xbox, and

42:03.360 --> 42:07.640
PSP. Later on the month, of course, we've got Drakengard 2,

42:07.640 --> 42:11.000
Grandia 3, Mark Echoes getting up,

42:11.000 --> 42:15.580
State of Emergency 2, which will be fun. Also dropped down to $29.99, which is

42:15.580 --> 42:16.160
pretty cool.

42:16.160 --> 42:19.320
Fight Night Round 3, really big boxing game.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.460
Tokka Race Driver 3, which will be cool.

42:23.460 --> 42:28.880
Exit, Sonic Riders coming to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube,

42:28.880 --> 42:32.200
and then a bunch of other stuff as well.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.740
Of course we'll cover those once we get closer to it.

42:34.740 --> 42:38.840
Alright, lots and lots of stuff. We're starting to get back into it.

42:38.840 --> 42:43.340
Summertime will be really big too. March is going to be a big month as far as stuff coming out.

42:43.340 --> 42:46.440
Alright, stay tuned. Now you also have a little bit of a follow-up to something

42:46.440 --> 42:47.560
DarkSakura talked about.

42:47.560 --> 42:52.000
She was talking about DOA4's success over in the UK.

42:52.000 --> 42:56.040
What's going on with DOA4? They're doing an update. There's going to be a patch

42:56.040 --> 43:00.360
which is coming out in mid-February. What's going to be happening is they're going to be

43:00.360 --> 43:06.800
kind of balancing some of the characters as well as fixing a bug with lots of save games.

43:06.800 --> 43:10.400
And one of the rumors is going to be that they're changing the interface and adding

43:10.400 --> 43:12.080
a new character.

43:12.080 --> 43:17.760
One of the new characters that they're talking about here, well at least rumored, is going

43:17.760 --> 43:21.500
to be a Taekwondo character.

43:21.500 --> 43:26.560
Basically one of the things that they found out between kind of browsing some of the data

43:26.560 --> 43:31.660
files on there, seeing a big section of characters missing, and just some other stuff.

43:31.660 --> 43:35.420
So that would be something to look forward to coming mid-February.

43:35.420 --> 43:38.780
Alright, sweet.

43:38.780 --> 43:42.620
Something else that's going to be coming out soon, and this is according to Pacific Business

43:42.620 --> 43:48.180
News, is that an online version of the classic puzzle game Tetris is going to be coming out

43:48.180 --> 43:49.180
soon.

43:49.180 --> 43:51.420
Now I'm kind of thinking, wait, don't we already have Tetranet?

43:51.420 --> 43:52.700
I mean, why would you want to pay?

43:52.700 --> 43:56.860
But here's the thing is that Tetris Online is going to allow people to do this game and

43:56.860 --> 44:00.420
other casual games for just $3 a month.

44:00.420 --> 44:04.140
So they're trying to put this at like a super low price point for folks to do this.

44:04.140 --> 44:07.620
Still say though, you got Tetranet for free that's still out there, so it's going to have

44:07.620 --> 44:11.540
to have some features to make this worthwhile, but I don't know if this is trying to ride

44:11.540 --> 44:16.620
on the coattails of projected success for Tetris DS or what, but nevertheless this is

44:16.620 --> 44:18.780
coming out soon.

44:18.780 --> 44:23.640
Something that should be noted is that this is being funded by Henk Rogers, who sold his

44:23.640 --> 44:30.620
interest in the Blue Lava wireless mobile phone company Jamdat in 2005.

44:30.620 --> 44:37.060
That stock sale will net him another 108 million via Jamdat's upcoming sale to Electronic Arts.

44:37.060 --> 44:45.260
His partner for Tetris Online will be former Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa.

44:45.260 --> 44:49.560
So we'll see, good minds coming together, because the mobile phone Tetris is actually

44:49.560 --> 44:54.540
pretty good for a mobile phone game, so promising things coming out of this, this may not be

44:54.540 --> 45:00.220
your crappy Tetris knockoff, this could be pretty good, so we'll see, we shall see.

45:00.220 --> 45:05.440
Actually I did need to make a statement on something, I did want to go and also correct

45:05.440 --> 45:14.960
myself, I actually told you wrong regarding the subsistence, now I'm doing it, the subsistence!

45:14.960 --> 45:20.240
We'll just call it Metal Gear 3 S. Subsistence.

45:20.240 --> 45:21.240
That's alright.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
Mistakes happen.

45:22.240 --> 45:30.140
Moving on, Loki, you sometimes look at what's going on in the hacking and cracking world.

45:30.140 --> 45:31.880
What's been hacked now?

45:31.880 --> 45:36.960
First thing is the original Xbox DVD firmware has been hacked.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.460
Why is that important?

45:38.460 --> 45:43.920
Well with the hacked firmware, the Xbox doesn't realize a game is burned or is an original

45:43.920 --> 45:44.920
copy.

45:44.920 --> 45:49.360
pop anything in there without a mod chip and it will run.

45:49.360 --> 45:54.320
So that's something that's coming out and what's important about that also is the firmware

45:54.320 --> 46:00.200
on the original Xbox is very similar to the firmware that's in the new Xbox 360 and they're

46:00.200 --> 46:03.720
thinking that maybe they can break it the same way.

46:03.720 --> 46:05.400
So that's interesting.

46:05.400 --> 46:10.720
Moving on to more of a portable stance here, we've got Rise of the Triad coming out on

46:10.720 --> 46:15.660
the PSP as a homebrew program, Rise of the Triad for those who might not remember was

46:15.660 --> 46:21.360
a really cool game kind of followed up Doom, kind of wacky and a little bit had the dog

46:21.360 --> 46:23.840
mode in there as well.

46:23.840 --> 46:28.540
So if you want to check that out, PSP updates has a download for you for that.

46:28.540 --> 46:34.340
Also for the Nintendo DS Linux, they actually have added Wi-Fi support which is pretty cool

46:34.340 --> 46:35.340
there.

46:35.340 --> 46:40.480
So if you've got a modded DS, definitely check that one out.

46:40.480 --> 46:44.540
Also the PSP has some more functionality added to it.

46:44.540 --> 46:50.840
Now they have a homebrew program to use your PSP as a universal remote and can control

46:50.840 --> 46:57.220
most of the TVs out there as well as there's another program made later that week which

46:57.220 --> 47:04.040
will use your PSP as a remote for your PlayStation 2 which is also cool.

47:04.040 --> 47:13.720
And finally, one last thing here, P6, the shell coming to the Playstation firmware 1.5

47:13.720 --> 47:18.860
has been released and that's actually kind of a new GUI that they've added and a lot

47:18.860 --> 47:23.320
more functionality is going to be going into that as well so look for more updates from

47:23.320 --> 47:28.080
us and also you'll probably hear some more things on PSP updates as well.

47:28.080 --> 47:35.620
And finally, they've had some rumors about new firmware updates coming, which are going

47:35.620 --> 47:42.780
to allow email and GPS to be added to the PSP's list of enhancements.

47:42.780 --> 47:46.220
So email and GPS possibly coming later on.

47:46.220 --> 47:47.220
Alright.

47:47.220 --> 47:48.260
Sounds exciting.

47:48.260 --> 47:50.300
Busy week for those guys over in the hacking world.

47:50.300 --> 47:51.300
Alright.

47:51.300 --> 47:53.100
We're going to be opening up our Skype line very, very soon.

47:53.100 --> 47:55.700
We're almost done with the show, but we need to get feedback from you guys.

47:55.700 --> 47:58.180
We want to hear what you guys have to say on tonight's story.

47:58.180 --> 48:03.900
To call us, go to www.orangelaungeradio.com and click on interact with us, or you can

48:03.900 --> 48:09.060
pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.

48:09.060 --> 48:12.520
I should point out, we also have voicemail there, so even if you're listening to podcasts,

48:12.520 --> 48:15.300
you can call that number and leave us voicemail any time throughout the week.

48:15.300 --> 48:19.220
But please note, that's not an 800 number, that's a local number to our area, so you

48:19.220 --> 48:23.860
probably will be assessed a toll for the call, so please ask mommy and daddy if you don't

48:23.860 --> 48:24.860
own the phone line.

48:24.860 --> 48:25.860
You own the phone line.

48:25.860 --> 48:26.860
Hey, do what you want.

48:26.860 --> 48:30.820
All right, but we're going to be taking Skypline calls very soon, but since there's a bit of

48:30.820 --> 48:36.300
a delay, before we go to that, we want to go ahead and announce tonight's listless winners.

48:36.300 --> 48:38.700
Votes are in.

48:38.700 --> 48:43.220
Remember, this is the Kingdom Hearts 3 world we would most like to see, and of course we're

48:43.220 --> 48:44.900
living in a fantasy world.

48:44.900 --> 48:48.620
It doesn't have to be Square or Disney related.

48:48.620 --> 48:49.660
It could be anything.

48:49.660 --> 48:50.660
So here it is.

48:50.660 --> 48:54.500
The votes are tallied, and this is the definitive list through this highly scientific process.

48:54.500 --> 49:03.500
Number three world most want to see the Zelda Ocarina of Time world is the number three world they most want to see.

49:03.500 --> 49:10.500
The number two world the kids most want to see is the Doom world. They want to see them go to hell.

49:10.500 --> 49:17.500
And the number one world as voted by our chat room, this is something that could actually happen too.

49:17.500 --> 49:22.500
Chrono Trigger world is the number one voted answer there.

49:22.500 --> 49:29.500
there

49:52.500 --> 49:55.420
We'll see if we have interviews or not next week.

49:55.420 --> 49:57.340
It's all time-pending stuff.

49:57.340 --> 50:00.540
All right, let's go to the Skype line and hear from you guys.

50:00.540 --> 50:04.460
So again, it's 916-226-9067, or you can call us on Skype.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.900
Its username, OrangeLoungeRadio, is who you want to call.

50:06.900 --> 50:07.900
Let's go to the Skype line.

50:07.900 --> 50:08.900
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

50:08.900 --> 50:09.900
Hello.

50:09.900 --> 50:10.900
Hi, who's this?

50:10.900 --> 50:12.900
This is Xander from Florida.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.900
Xander, you call us too damn much.

50:14.900 --> 50:15.900
I know.

50:15.900 --> 50:16.900
All right, well, what's on your mind this week?

50:16.900 --> 50:18.180
Nothing better to do on Sunday night.

50:18.180 --> 50:19.180
That's all right.

50:19.180 --> 50:20.180
What's up?

50:20.180 --> 50:25.900
I'd like to point out real quick and you're saying that Chrono Trigger could actually appear on Kingdom Hearts 3

50:26.540 --> 50:28.540
It can't I know

50:30.300 --> 50:36.500
Hypothetically, you know, they could do one of those like loophole things or you talking about it's a rights issue the characters they could

50:36.980 --> 50:38.980
But Nomura won't

50:38.980 --> 50:43.520
Final Fantasy strictly like background cameo stuff and Kingdom Hearts. It will never be a world

50:44.060 --> 50:46.060
Look, they can do whatever they want

50:46.060 --> 50:50.460
It's just that they they refuse to do it because they're bastard people. That's what it is

50:51.580 --> 50:53.740
We can but they won't well

50:55.420 --> 50:59.220
In our fantasy world they should is there there's there's nothing wrong with that

51:02.380 --> 51:05.860
All right, okay, what else is on your mind Xander one quick thing

51:05.860 --> 51:10.140
Do you have any idea where I could give everyone I mean any idea?

51:10.220 --> 51:14.620
Do they still push new copies of that around on some of the import sites?

51:14.620 --> 51:18.900
I don't know. I haven't I ordered one so so long ago that I don't know if they still sell this anymore

51:18.900 --> 51:24.020
This is a ps1 title. So I would say probably your best bet's gonna be something like eBay

51:24.100 --> 51:30.620
Don't be afraid don't don't be afraid to find it. Don't be afraid to try like yahoo auctions, but the Japanese one

51:31.380 --> 51:33.380
Might be a good place to try

51:33.420 --> 51:37.180
And yeah, you're gonna pay more money to get shipped over here. But you know, if you really want the game

51:37.180 --> 51:39.180
I did that

51:39.180 --> 51:43.540
and other suggestions you guys are saying saying maybe I don't know

51:43.540 --> 51:47.220
I think it's gonna be hard to find his ps1 but if you want to ps2 title that's

51:47.220 --> 51:49.180
similar you can always try mojib ribbon

51:49.180 --> 51:52.220
but I don't know it's it's a it's very on

51:52.220 --> 51:56.540
it different language intensive yeah it is it is it's just a different game as

51:56.540 --> 51:58.260
well so I don't know but

51:58.260 --> 52:02.620
it's it's close it's the closest thing you're gonna get so

52:02.620 --> 52:07.260
I well good luck to use and are finding that if you find a copy let us know so

52:07.260 --> 52:08.860
we can tell our listeners where you found it

52:08.860 --> 52:10.860
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

52:11.620 --> 52:13.620
No, all right

52:13.940 --> 52:20.980
All right, Xander. Thanks for calling in. Take care. You too. Bye. Let's go to another call here. Hello. You're on orange launch radio

52:22.020 --> 52:24.020
Hello. Hi, who's this?

52:26.380 --> 52:27.780
Hello

52:27.780 --> 52:33.740
It's general sigh I got the name there, but you're breaking up just a little bit, but go ahead and get your questions out

52:33.740 --> 52:35.740
What's what's on your mind?

52:35.740 --> 52:45.740
First and foremost, uh, I'm kinda angry at my computer, let me get...

52:45.740 --> 52:49.140
Yeah we're kinda angry at your computer right now too because it keeps cutting you out,

52:49.140 --> 52:54.100
we can't hear you buddy, um, I'm sorry buddy, I'm gonna have to let you go, you're just

52:54.100 --> 52:56.380
gonna not there, sorry.

52:56.380 --> 53:02.740
I think somebody should call in and say, and do the, how do you check the children?

53:02.740 --> 53:08.100
We're gonna do one more call here. I don't know. It's it's all the net traffic's tied up because of the stupid Bowl. Um

53:08.740 --> 53:11.080
Let's try going to another call. Hi, you're on orange launch radio

53:11.660 --> 53:18.860
Obviously, you already know who this is. It could this be the legend of Zaku. Well, you're on the mark set aside ten minutes

53:18.860 --> 53:20.860
What's what's on your mind Zaku?

53:21.940 --> 53:27.940
Since I started that, you know, I started you know a weekend habit of just playing 2dx really drunk

53:27.940 --> 53:30.180
I kind of need the kind of need suggestions of

53:30.180 --> 53:37.200
liquors that would go great with that how old are you young man I'm 21 21 for

53:37.200 --> 53:40.440
about over a month all right just wanted to make sure you're of age because we

53:40.440 --> 53:44.400
can't encourage yeah if you're under toilet liquors that go good with playing

53:44.400 --> 53:51.400
2dx yes Guinness I I do enjoy Guinness vodka hard liquors like you know

53:51.400 --> 53:57.280
anything 40% take a shot of 151 and drop it in a glass of Guinness it's called an

53:57.280 --> 54:05.980
Irish car bomb it's great but anyways also besides that why I mean I'm

54:05.980 --> 54:11.520
surprised that they charge money for cell phone games even though as a person

54:11.520 --> 54:15.120
who happens to make them for for a senior project in order to get out of

54:15.120 --> 54:19.000
college I find it appalling and people charge what you know that companies

54:19.000 --> 54:23.680
charged monthly for a damn game oh yeah I the monthly fees is a little bit now

54:23.680 --> 54:26.680
I'm like okay well obviously you can charge money for a game because you know

54:26.680 --> 54:32.860
That's how that's what funds these people's page. Yeah, but I mean, but I mean I thought I thought most games were just like

54:32.860 --> 54:37.360
You know two three dollars and that was it but then they have the goal to charge you monthly

54:37.360 --> 54:41.640
Yeah, the repeat things a little lame for the cell phones, especially when they're bad games

54:41.640 --> 54:46.060
I know I know like companies like sprint that they charge like, you know

54:46.060 --> 54:50.380
A certain amount of money for like a certain amount of time and then you have to keep paying it again

54:50.540 --> 54:54.120
Don't buy them on the right scripting model. Don't support that crap

54:54.120 --> 54:57.380
I don't if I see a game that they want to charge a monthly fee. I say screw it

54:57.380 --> 55:04.500
I'm not gonna buy it. Yeah, they you know, they said certain certain phone, you know, certain phone phone providers and game

55:04.500 --> 55:06.480
You know contract and contact

55:06.480 --> 55:13.340
Content distributors do that sort of thing trying to milk money out of you know, people like myself who own nice and

55:13.900 --> 55:18.440
Who nice cell phones when it when enough when enough people don't buy the game?

55:18.440 --> 55:24.680
They'll get the message that that type of distribution system isn't working and people don't want to pay monthly ease for subpar cell phone games

55:24.680 --> 55:28.000
Exactly. Where's my game? I probably might go open source

55:29.040 --> 55:34.840
See, well, that's that's up to the programmer. All right anything else on your mind Zaku. Well, hopefully

55:36.040 --> 55:39.080
We have a lot hasn't been touched up on supernova yet

55:39.360 --> 55:45.440
But you know since location testing already happened and the next one is gonna be in in Illinois

55:45.440 --> 55:54.520
I know, but what I'm hearing is that it's being delayed from boomers all the way to

55:54.520 --> 55:59.160
the next location test because from what I hear right now is that they're trying to

55:59.160 --> 56:01.800
fix the bugs that were found in the first location test.

56:01.800 --> 56:07.000
Okay, good, good, sure, fix bugs, fine by me, I mean that's the idea of the location

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
test.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.280
That's only what I'm hearing from other places.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.960
It's a little bit of rumor at this point, we'll see, I'm sure the game will be fine

56:14.960 --> 56:19.440
when it comes out, we'll see. Yeah, hopefully, hopefully. Alright, Zaku, time's up, I'm letting

56:19.440 --> 56:25.600
you go, have a good one. Alright, bye. Alright, that was the Skype line, boys and girls. That's

56:25.600 --> 56:28.440
all for you, the listener. That's how you do the Skype line. That's how we do it here

56:28.440 --> 56:34.280
at Orange Lounge Radio. Alright, we're getting towards the end of the program here, but not

56:34.280 --> 56:39.360
until we bring you one last story. Couple more stories. Oh yes, Loki, why don't you

56:39.360 --> 56:44.580
start us off then, since you must have found some late additions here. I did. Everybody

56:44.580 --> 56:48.860
loves making fun of Jack Thompson, but remember his modest game proposal?

56:48.860 --> 56:51.140
Just when I thought we could go one week without that name.

56:51.140 --> 56:55.300
Hey, I'm not talking about Jack Thompson, I'm talking about his modest game proposal.

56:55.300 --> 56:59.860
And someone else finished one of their games for the modest game proposal.

56:59.860 --> 57:02.900
It's called I'm Okay, a murder simulator.

57:02.900 --> 57:09.140
And you can check it out actually at, unfortunately the website that was hosting it went down

57:09.140 --> 57:11.100
so they have it mirrored here.

57:11.100 --> 57:20.440
It's 67.15.42.30 slash I'm OK and you can check it out there.

57:20.440 --> 57:21.440
It's a 12 meg download.

57:21.440 --> 57:26.820
It has nice Super Nintendo looking graphics and you basically murder and murder and murder

57:26.820 --> 57:31.320
and murder and lots of murdering and it's great.

57:31.320 --> 57:34.300
So definitely check that out.

57:34.300 --> 57:38.400
And finally for those people who are fans of Burnout, they're doing a promo now with

57:38.400 --> 57:42.920
with the retail kiosk that you can find out there for the Xbox 360, where you can bring

57:42.920 --> 57:51.080
your memory card to the location and download an exclusive Burnout Revenge card that's actually

57:51.080 --> 57:58.120
going to be Xbox 360 themed, as well as a dashboard theme and gamer pic.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.960
So check that out.

58:00.960 --> 58:04.680
Just wanted to say, I got a quick tip here from a chatter, thank you Mike.

58:04.680 --> 58:08.120
He says that japanvideogames.com has Vibribin.

58:08.120 --> 58:11.680
So Xander, go take a look there, and hopefully you can get it.

58:11.680 --> 58:13.680
And just to say, I've ordered through them?

58:13.680 --> 58:14.680
Yeah, they're good.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.120
I've bought Beatmania through them.

58:16.120 --> 58:17.920
I've bought my Drummania through them.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.560
Their prices usually tend to be very comparable.

58:19.560 --> 58:20.560
Oh, no free advertising.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
I'm not.

58:21.560 --> 58:27.040
I'm just saying, as I don't want to misguide any of our listeners, and we have gone through

58:27.040 --> 58:31.520
a number of importers among us, I would buy right at all costs.

58:31.520 --> 58:33.440
They suck!

58:33.440 --> 58:44.040
suck I know if we've they owe me $70 or you could fly to the country and buy it

58:44.040 --> 58:47.800
there and take me with you I don't know if that's an option all right let's let's

58:47.800 --> 58:50.800

58:50.800 --> 58:55.420
Loki no more stories look I have no more all right good so dark Sakura this is a

58:55.420 --> 59:01.200
good note to finish up on tonight what what's coming our way pretty soon well

59:01.200 --> 59:10.640
this has to do with our good friend Itadaki of Team Ninja. Basically there was an interview

59:10.640 --> 59:17.380
with Famitsu Xbox 360 regarding the Dead or Alive franchise where they spoke with Itadaki

59:17.380 --> 59:26.320
about the delays. He did actually make an apology for the last minute postponements

59:26.320 --> 59:28.420
that were going on over it.

59:28.420 --> 59:36.980
Also though, there was a mention about DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2, since we had the

59:36.980 --> 59:43.060
other one mentioned on the show.

59:43.060 --> 59:47.640
But before I get into that, I am going to make a mention that there were plans to release

59:47.640 --> 59:54.060
new outfits for the DOA 4 characters via the Xbox Live Marketplace, however, due to budget

59:54.060 --> 01:00:00.580
and staff issues they had to put that on hold that's where the bikinis went but

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.580
there is still interest in doing it but they may have to do that for a charge

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:11.620
interesting hmm also now as I was bringing up do a extreme beach volleyball

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.860
to Team Ninja is working on the opening and ending scenes for the game currently

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:26.660
implementing some changes to the original design, and there is not a release date being

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:27.660
mentioned.

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:33.940
He said it will be an action game, but that it won't necessarily...

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:39.900
They're also working on an action game that's not really gonna be in the Ninja Gaiden franchise,

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.900
but...

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:48.500
I'm sorry, I choked up for a moment, it said it will either be project progressive, thinking

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:55.220
about ninja guide and got y'all declined, no I'm still my allergies, but project progressive

01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:03.220
dead or alive code cronus or another title, he said the key word is interactivity, anything

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:10.700
that team ninja does, I have to say, team ninja in my esteem is up there with treasure,

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.360
pretty pretty game so put especially that do a forum on my xbox 360 you know

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:19.680
when it worked when it worked and on that note I think it's time to wrap up

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.080
tonight's program but we have to go around and get everybody's final

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.280
