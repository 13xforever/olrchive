Hello everyone and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio. That's right, Rob

00:21.000 --> 00:25.520
and Jamie are both still out. Jamie's actually feeling a bit under the weather right now

00:25.520 --> 00:33.140
And her microphone is broken and Rob was trying to record a podcast on an iBook and well that didn't work out too much

00:33.140 --> 00:39.800
You know so much for those Mac products. Anyways, I'm here to deliver another podcast for you guys

00:39.800 --> 00:42.720
There's so much news. I couldn't possibly pass it up

00:43.280 --> 00:49.200
Anyways, I'm gonna start things off like I started off every week with how my gaming week was once again

00:49.200 --> 00:55.540
I've been playing full-auto all week long and I've gotten to the point now where I'm almost done with the game about

00:55.840 --> 01:03.640
90% done and it's gotten goddamn frustrating. I have slammed controllers, cursed at my 360 and

01:05.040 --> 01:11.280
literally almost broke the game in half. It's just really annoying, especially when you get to the part where the gang wars

01:11.840 --> 01:18.760
and you have to work with some AI that's completely retarded and they want to end up blowing you up and you get penalized if

01:18.760 --> 01:23.080
you blow them up. It's just really frustrating to get a gold in that, and I'm really trying

01:23.080 --> 01:27.120
to do it, but I just have to really take breaks from it. I've been playing a little bit of

01:27.120 --> 01:32.760
Hex HD a little bit, and it's an okay game. Tried a little bit of the Xbox Live Arcade

01:32.760 --> 01:37.800
Gauntlet, and man do I suck at the original Gauntlet. Of course, been playing a little

01:37.800 --> 01:44.380
bit of Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and Deathmatches. Finally finished up February's

01:44.380 --> 01:48.120
runnings and unfortunately I came in second this time around so

01:48.120 --> 01:53.720
oh well better luck next month I guess. Alright let's start things off with

01:53.720 --> 01:54.600
Microsoft's

01:54.600 --> 01:57.820
origami project. This is a brand new

01:57.820 --> 02:01.420
device put out by Microsoft. They've been teasing it a little bit here.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.880
The full details are supposed to hit the internet

02:04.880 --> 02:09.240
on March 2nd but right now they did have a teaser

02:09.240 --> 02:14.320
kind of a concept video if you will showing off what this thing can do.

02:14.320 --> 02:22.760
It can basically play music, show some pictures, link up with the internet, has GPS, also a

02:22.760 --> 02:28.140
media PC extender, Wi-Fi, touch screen, and of course they showed a little bit of gaming

02:28.140 --> 02:29.140
going along with it.

02:29.140 --> 02:37.780
So I'm thinking they're trying to use this as a PSP killer, possibly an iPod killer.

02:37.780 --> 02:41.900
Just trying to combat all the portable gaming and media systems out there.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.540
It should be interesting to see how this pans out.

02:44.540 --> 02:48.620
It did look a little bit big, so I'm not really sure if they're going to be trying to pass

02:48.620 --> 02:53.700
it off to the same market as maybe people that have iPods, but definitely a good alternative

02:53.700 --> 02:58.920
to a laptop or a media PC or, I don't know, just something that you can take with you

02:58.920 --> 03:01.740
on the go, browse your email and that type of thing.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.460
So kind of interesting.

03:04.460 --> 03:08.260
Now got a little bit of a scoop for you guys.

03:08.260 --> 03:16.120
We have Activision's 2006 and 2007 line-up for their upcoming games, and it's actually

03:16.120 --> 03:21.920
going to be something they're going to be debuting at the Destination PlayStation show.

03:21.920 --> 03:30.660
Some of the notable features on here, we've got some of the movie expansions coming out.

03:30.660 --> 03:37.200
Also Quake Enemy Territory coming out on the PC, of course that one looked really sweet.

03:37.200 --> 03:43.480
Really interesting though is they do mention some of the lineup for the next-gen systems, which I thought was very interesting

03:44.160 --> 03:46.460
including some of the revolution launch titles

03:47.160 --> 03:49.880
Two of the revolution launch titles will be Tony Hawk

03:50.280 --> 03:51.420
downhill Jam

03:51.420 --> 03:58.320
Which is going to be the next in the Tony Hawk series and Marvel Legends no word on what Marvel Legends is going to be

03:58.320 --> 04:06.340
But should be pretty interesting some of the other games coming out of course Call of Duty 3 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox

04:06.340 --> 04:12.560
360, X3, you know, tying into the new X-Men movie, as well as some really interesting

04:12.560 --> 04:20.600
titles including Pimp My Ride the game, and Koala's African Safari, as well as the History

04:20.600 --> 04:23.720
Channel Civil War first person shooter game.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.960
I don't know how that's going to work, but it should be interesting.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.080
If you do happen to have, though, a PSP or a Nintendo DS, they haven't forgotten about

04:31.080 --> 04:37.440
you either gun is coming to the PSP as well as Call of Duty 3 should be very

04:37.440 --> 04:42.300
interesting or Call of Duty is gonna be heading to the PSP not sure if it's

04:42.300 --> 04:47.600
gonna be Call of Duty 3 but probably a port of something or other also they

04:47.600 --> 04:52.160
have over the hedge which is gonna be tying in with the Dreamworks movie and

04:52.160 --> 04:58.560
pimp my right as well for that so interesting looks like the DS is also

04:58.560 --> 05:05.040
getting spider-man kids I deal with that is but sounds pretty cool speaking of

05:05.040 --> 05:09.360
the revolution though there's been some more titles announced for it as well one

05:09.360 --> 05:13.680
of them being pennant chase pennant chase is actually a baseball game is

05:13.680 --> 05:18.480
slated for August of last year and it's been pushed back and pushed back well

05:18.480 --> 05:22.600
now they're talking that's gonna come out on the revolution whether it be a

05:22.600 --> 05:29.600
launch title or not, should be interesting to find out. But, I don't know. Anyways, speaking

05:30.620 --> 05:35.740
of the revolution, the cost of the revolution has definitely been one of the points for

05:35.740 --> 05:42.140
that everyone's been looking at. They're debating whether it's going to be about $200 to $150

05:42.140 --> 05:46.740
retail when it comes out. And a little bit of news that's actually going to back that

05:46.740 --> 05:51.660
up. The software development kits have been priced and they're only going to be costing

05:51.660 --> 05:57.480
developers $2,000. Now in comparison here, the PlayStation 2 software development kit

05:57.480 --> 06:02.820
when it first came out was $20,000 per kit at launch. In fact, the original PlayStation

06:02.820 --> 06:08.460
was only $4,000 to $5,000 at launch, so they're even cutting that in half. That's only backing

06:08.460 --> 06:13.400
up the fact that they're trying to lower development costs and basically just lower the price of

06:13.400 --> 06:18.460
games as we know them. So that's something to look forward to. Of course, more stuff

06:18.460 --> 06:24.300
about the revolution is coming our way in E3 this year and one of the rumors

06:24.300 --> 06:27.540
that we're going to see at E3 and I've been saying this before is going to be

06:27.540 --> 06:33.260
some sort of virtual reality and well we've got some more hints at that. A

06:33.260 --> 06:39.940
member of IGN's forums going by the name of Discreet here actually posted some

06:39.940 --> 06:46.300
information about what's going to be coming out and the information that he

06:46.300 --> 06:52.540
posted? Well, it was about this brand new 3D technology brought out by a company

06:52.540 --> 06:59.200
called 3DH. And 3DH is basically a company that's developing holo

06:59.200 --> 07:05.160
projection as well as the glasses to use this. And some of the pictures that they

07:05.160 --> 07:09.120
show on the website look pretty sweet. So imagine using a 3D controller with this

07:09.120 --> 07:14.880
holo projection system, possibly the glasses. You can see that, you know, the

07:14.880 --> 07:18.740
Revolution is going to stand in a class all by itself so that's going to be

07:18.740 --> 07:23.160
really sweet. Another title that's also rumored to be coming to the revolution

07:23.160 --> 07:29.520
of course Nintendo's denying it would be Zelda. Zelda is actually the brand new

07:29.520 --> 07:34.740
Twilight Princess it's been delayed until November now we all thought is

07:34.740 --> 07:38.940
because of the launch and of course as I've been saying week after week is

07:38.940 --> 07:43.300
because they're adding something special to it so this has been confirmed that

07:43.300 --> 07:50.120
they're adding some added functionality to the GameCube title. Now, no word if it's actually

07:50.120 --> 07:56.400
going to be on the revolution, but still the game is going to be launching with the revolution.

07:56.400 --> 08:03.400
Now on to another Nintendo platform here. We have Metroid Dread DS, a 2D Metroid sequel,

08:03.400 --> 08:09.480
sequel rumored to be in the works for the new DS.

08:09.480 --> 08:17.380
Fansite DSX is basically saying that the rumored non-3D sequel of the Metroid series is still

08:17.380 --> 08:23.500
in the works, but still, you know, rumor right now, I don't know, it's still looking forward

08:23.500 --> 08:28.260
to the brand new Metroid Prime Hunter, which is going to be coming out on the DS here in

08:28.260 --> 08:33.600
March as well as, if you haven't played it yet, Metroid Prime Pinball, which I hear is

08:33.600 --> 08:37.640
okay, but I don't know how well pinball games do on the DS.

08:37.640 --> 08:43.400
In other news, The Legend of Zelda has reached its 20th anniversary.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.600
That's right, 20 years of Link.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.720
It's been one hell of an adventure ever since the 8-bit game came out on the Nintendo.

08:50.720 --> 08:55.440
And now, of course, you know, with the news of Twilight Princess, it's only fitting that,

08:55.440 --> 09:01.320
you know, we say happy birthday, Link. In other franchise news here, we've got a brand

09:01.320 --> 09:07.060
new Mario game coming out, of course, on the Nintendo DS. That's right, the new Super Mario

09:07.060 --> 09:13.300
Brothers has a street date now. May 7th right now is the tentative date for the new Super

09:13.300 --> 09:18.420
Mario Brothers, and that's pretty sweet that it's going to be coming out here only a couple

09:18.420 --> 09:24.460
days prior to E3, so it'll be worth checking that one out.

09:24.460 --> 09:27.020
Another little thing here about the DS.

09:27.020 --> 09:31.020
There's been a lot of rumors going around about a brand new revision to the DS, and

09:31.020 --> 09:37.180
of course we're all familiar with the DS Lite, the brand new slimmed down DS with a brighter

09:37.180 --> 09:38.740
screen.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.980
There's still possible a third revision to the DS, and actually there is a patent discovered

09:43.980 --> 09:46.780
this week that kind of backs that up.

09:46.780 --> 09:54.280
The patent is for a brand new portable gaming system from Nintendo, and it actually shows

09:54.280 --> 10:01.200
dual touch screens, not necessarily saying two screens that are touch screens, but actually

10:01.200 --> 10:06.440
being able to point two positions simultaneously on the touch screen.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.600
Now why is this important?

10:07.600 --> 10:11.980
If you think about it, for example, one of the demonstration photos that they had on

10:11.980 --> 10:16.120
there was like of a flight sim and you'd put your fingers on the tips of the wing

10:16.120 --> 10:20.460
and basically be able to maneuver your plane through you know whatever

10:20.460 --> 10:26.540
obstacles that you might encounter very similar to an Nintendo Revolution

10:26.540 --> 10:31.020
controller think about that one for a little bit so that'd be interesting to

10:31.020 --> 10:34.380
see if that ties in with the whole revolution system when that comes out

10:34.380 --> 10:38.780
now if you can't wait that long for the third revision well you might as well

10:38.780 --> 10:43.520
wait just a little bit longer for the second revision. That's right, the Nintendo DS Lite

10:43.520 --> 10:49.920
is hitting the United States in May, so check that out. Might as well pick up your copy

10:49.920 --> 10:56.100
of the new Super Mario Brothers game. And, of course, that's supposed to take over the

10:56.100 --> 11:03.100
old DS by fall. They're going to be phasing out the original DS revision and, yeah, pretty

11:03.900 --> 11:07.860
much DS Lite's going to take it over. Very similar to the way the Game Boy Advance SP

11:07.860 --> 11:12.420
is taking over the Game Boy Advance, for all those who don't remember the old Game Boy

11:12.420 --> 11:20.620
Advance. Speaking of portable system revisions, there's been some rumors about the PSP2. The

11:20.620 --> 11:28.740
new PSP is rumored to feature an 8GB NAND flash hard drive. I guess this would be used

11:28.740 --> 11:35.460
for more of the, you know, your portable media and MP3s and stuff, kind of as another iPod

11:35.460 --> 11:45.460
Anyways, that should be interesting. Another rumor going around about the PSP2 is that it will be containing a video camera, a new webcam.

11:45.460 --> 11:55.460
And now this will be used actually as a mobile camera or possibly to put yourself in the game kind of like an itoy type of thing.

11:55.460 --> 11:59.460
Map your photos onto your characters in the game.

11:59.460 --> 12:15.460
Now currently the camera that we're talking about using for the PSP2 would be a Sony Ericsson mobile phone camera and basically it'll be placed on the PSP screen right about now where the PSP logo is currently found.

12:15.460 --> 12:24.460
Now I don't know if that's a good idea. Personally I would like to see it at the top of the system where you could rotate it around to possibly use this as, you know, say a digital camera.

12:24.460 --> 12:27.460
Because personally I could use a good digital camera.

12:27.460 --> 12:38.460
Now to kind of back up the PSP camera rumor, there's actually been some ads spotted on London trains recently that kind of point towards possibly a camera coming out.

12:38.460 --> 12:54.460
Now the advertisement shows basically a blank screen with the words View? No way! Delete View! Oh my god! Delete View! I don't remember taking that. Delete View at last! A decent one store here.

12:54.460 --> 12:58.780
Now that sort of sounds like they're viewing digital photos, so kind of pointing towards

12:58.780 --> 13:01.940
maybe that the camera is coming out.

13:01.940 --> 13:05.260
Should be interesting, good addition to the PSP.

13:05.260 --> 13:09.740
Speaking of cameras, the PSP isn't the only system to get a new camera.

13:09.740 --> 13:13.700
It's actually been announced that the Xbox Live camera and microphone is going to be

13:13.700 --> 13:15.840
released here pretty soon.

13:15.840 --> 13:21.420
The camera is going to be able to shoot 640 by 480 video at 30 frames per second and take

13:21.420 --> 13:24.260
1.3 megapixel still photos.

13:24.260 --> 13:29.500
The camera will support built-in video chat and video messaging on Xbox Live, plus being

13:29.500 --> 13:33.900
able to use it as sort of an iToy type of peripheral, being able to put yourself in

13:33.900 --> 13:35.940
the games and that type of thing.

13:35.940 --> 13:40.360
Still got one more peripheral for the Xbox 360 owners.

13:40.360 --> 13:45.580
This one's going to be an Xbox 360 transfer kit from Datel.

13:45.580 --> 13:52.060
The transfer kit's basically going to be just like the Exchange 360 site where you can transfer

13:52.060 --> 13:58.340
your game saves from your Xbox 360 to your PSP. It's pretty interesting that they're

13:58.340 --> 14:02.340
going to come out with something like this. The only problem, though, is you can only

14:02.340 --> 14:08.140
dump the whole card at one time. It's expected to retail about $14.99.

14:08.140 --> 14:12.080
On to a completely different topic. Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, is coming to American

14:12.080 --> 14:16.240
Cell Phones. That's right, the popular DS title, which was a remake of the Japanese

14:16.240 --> 14:22.740
Game Boy Advance title, Gaikuten Saiben, and the only one of the three-part series to get

14:22.740 --> 14:29.220
the official US English translation, Gaikuten Saiben 2 and 3 are now being localized for

14:29.220 --> 14:36.380
the US as downloadable content. In other news, some of your favorite old-time games from

14:36.380 --> 14:42.000
Sierra are coming back. That's right, Sierra's classic adventure games are being re-released

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
to run on the Windows XP. Everything from Space Quest to Police Quest to, of course,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.660
Leisure Suit Larry. It should be very interesting to see those come out. They're going to be

14:53.660 --> 15:00.660
retailing at about $20 each, so look for those coming soon. Speaking of titles being re-released,

15:01.260 --> 15:06.280
the Sonic 360 director has been hinting that Dreamcast titles could possibly make their

15:06.280 --> 15:13.280
way onto Xbox Live's arcade. Masato Nakamura was asked if Sega had any plans to release

15:15.440 --> 15:21.460
Sonic on the Xbox Live Arcade. He did reply, yes, we hope we can do something like it.

15:21.460 --> 15:27.160
Was this a hint towards Dreamcast games being released on Xbox Live Arcade or possibly some

15:27.160 --> 15:33.080
re-release of an old Sonic the Hedgehog game on the 15th anniversary of the series? We'll

15:33.080 --> 15:38.360
Alright, for all you folks who are fans of the show, you'll know that my favorite topic

15:38.360 --> 15:43.680
of discussion is the PSP homebrew scene, and we've got some good stories for you this week.

15:43.680 --> 15:51.300
The first is going to be the brand new Super Nintendo emulator, SNES9X version 0.4 has

15:51.300 --> 15:56.000
been updated, and this time the brand new feature is going to be wireless gameplay.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.680
That's right, you can do multiplayer via Wi-Fi ad hoc, so it should be pretty cool.

16:01.680 --> 16:06.480
One of the games that they've been able to run so far on it has been Street Fighter II

16:06.480 --> 16:11.340
and it's been able to run at 60 frames per second while playing versus over Wi-Fi, so

16:11.340 --> 16:12.340
that's amazing.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.480
I can't wait to try that one out actually.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.960
Another homebrew game that we've got coming out here is going to be Commander Keen.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.200
That's right, everyone's favorite shareware game is back.

16:22.200 --> 16:27.760
They've actually added emulation for all different firmwares so you'll be able to run this homebrew

16:27.760 --> 16:29.400
on everything.

16:29.400 --> 16:35.700
Right now you can download that on PSPupdates.com and you can check out, they've got the original

16:35.700 --> 16:39.120
shareware episode included with that, so go check that out.

16:39.120 --> 16:44.520
Now, if you're not a fan of Commander Keen, you may be a fan of Zork.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.720
That's right, the Texas Adventure game has hit the PSP.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.860
What's interesting about that is it's being run through a Game Boy emulator.

16:53.860 --> 17:03.860
Using Rin, the emulator for your PSP, you can actually run some of the Zork games, including Zork 1, 2, and 3.

17:03.860 --> 17:09.860
You can find out more information on that, on PSP updates, of course, and check it out.

17:09.860 --> 17:18.860
I believe you need Zork 1 for DOS, and then they basically walk you through on how they'll be able to run that as a Game Boy ROM, so check it out.

17:18.860 --> 17:24.320
Alright, let's switch focus here and let's talk about a game system we're never going

17:24.320 --> 17:27.980
to see and that would be Infinium Labs Phantom.

17:27.980 --> 17:35.720
That's right, the Phantom, well, they're not doing very well actually.

17:35.720 --> 17:43.660
Infinium Labs has actually run up a $62.7 million dollar bill.

17:43.660 --> 17:47.420
Only $3.5 million of that has been to development costs.

17:47.420 --> 17:53.020
The rest has been in salaries and marketing and just normal expenses.

17:53.020 --> 17:57.620
Right now they're focused on getting the phantom lap board out and that's just a wireless keyboard

17:57.620 --> 17:59.900
and mouse.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.900
We're never going to see the system, folks.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.300
It's just the way it is.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.340
They're taking on so many losses right now.

18:06.340 --> 18:09.980
By the time this thing ever gets to market, they're never going to make their money back.

18:09.980 --> 18:11.980
It's just pitiful.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.860
Now there's something a bit more controversial.

18:15.860 --> 18:22.240
News station WGN has apparently stumbled onto video game addiction. They've actually run

18:22.240 --> 18:30.360
a piece, Philadelphia's Channel 6, showing how video games could be like the next version

18:30.360 --> 18:36.180
of crack, the way they basically have portrayed video games, showing how kids ignore their

18:36.180 --> 18:41.680
families and ignore their dog. You know, who cares? Dogs don't need attention anyways,

18:41.680 --> 18:47.960
especially when it comes down to video games. But the whole story is just a blatant ratings

18:47.960 --> 18:54.600
ploy, basically. And huge backlash over that. Alright, so you've spent a lot of money, you've

18:54.600 --> 19:00.400
got your brand new TV to go with that new snazzy next-gen system. Well, if you're thinking

19:00.400 --> 19:07.400
about buying a Blu-ray or HD DVD video player, think again. Basically, 3 million HDTV owners

19:12.800 --> 19:16.020
out there are going to be screwed. Why are you guys going to be screwed? Well, that's

19:16.020 --> 19:22.180
because the brand new next-gen systems, or at least the video systems, are only going

19:22.180 --> 19:29.180
to have HDMI or DVI connections. So your standard HDTV is not going to have that. Sorry, guess

19:31.200 --> 19:38.200
you should have bought a more expensive TV. So, screw you Sony, and screw you Toshiba.

19:39.740 --> 19:45.840
And since we're on the topic of screwing people, let's talk about screwing Electronic Arts.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.960
That's right, if you haven't pre-ordered Black, then you probably didn't know that there was

19:50.960 --> 19:57.160
actually a hidden code to get a brand new gun in the game. The big fucking gun as you

19:57.160 --> 20:02.700
would put it. But guess what? A lot of people out there say who cares and they went ahead

20:02.700 --> 20:08.080
and hacked the flash site and found the code for you. So get a pen and paper here. The

20:08.080 --> 20:20.880
The code to get the BFG is 5SQQ-STHA-ZFFV-7XEV.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.040
Have fun, enjoy the big fucking gun, and blow up a lot of people.

20:24.040 --> 20:28.960
Alright, well that about does it, so I will see you guys later.

20:28.960 --> 20:33.480
Enjoy this podcast, and we'll be back live again on March 5th.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.480
Talk to you later.
