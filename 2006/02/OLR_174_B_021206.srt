[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for joining us.

7
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:58,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Incentive for you guys to listen live on Sunday nights if you can, those of you guys out there I mean we podcast for a reason, we know not everybody can listen live Sunday nights But Sunday nights when we do do this live, we play music during the breaks when we do this show And tonight we played some pieces in that break from some classic Super Nintendo and Genesis titles We played a song from Secret of Mana in there, one of the songs from the beginning of the game And then we played the Emerald Hill Zone song from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 And the reason why I'm bringing this up

8
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't play this stuff on the podcast because of copyright stuffs.

9
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,273
[SPEAKER_07]: But I brought it up because it inspired some comments here in our chat room.

10
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:08,695
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangelontario.com, click on chat.

11
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:13,340
[SPEAKER_07]: VXJasonXV, who also happens to be our lovely webmaster, he listens too.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,584
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, a lot of games just don't have memorable music like this anymore.

13
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Catchy, but not memorable.

14
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:21,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Agree?

15
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:21,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Disagree?

16
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:23,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Katamari.

17
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,339
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also Space Channel 5.

18
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:29,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, the game was pretty much all music, wasn't it?

19
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:29,301
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

20
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:53,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, I understand what he's saying, is that with a lot of current titles, you either have licensed music, too, you play a game like Burnout, everything you're hearing is licensed, same stuff you hear on the radio, or, you know, it's not like the same it used to be.

21
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

22
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:55,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of see where he's coming from.

23
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of agree on that.

24
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,053
[SPEAKER_02]: The same care isn't being put into it.

25
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:00,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?

26
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:08,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that when you have limiting circumstances, when you do something...

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:17,143
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do something that excels, you know, under those limiting circumstances, people are going to recognize it.

28
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,764
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to see the effort that went into it.

29
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:23,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowadays, you can make something that sounds really good with minimal effort.

30
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:24,586
[SPEAKER_07]: True.

31
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe it's harder to stand out above the pack in that case?

32
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:28,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think so.

33
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, just a little side topic.

34
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought that was interesting.

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I love when our chat room inspires conversation here.

36
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,412
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we're an interactive show.

37
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:37,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Truly interactive.

38
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,026
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeonstradio.com

39
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

40
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:06,404
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a profanity study done this week for Halo 2.

41
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:08,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the way that they intro this.

42
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:11,126
[SPEAKER_05]: What exactly is a profanity study?

43
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:15,488
[SPEAKER_05]: It's studying the frequency of profanity in Halo 2 during online games.

44
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:19,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I love the way they intro this.

45
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:26,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically, when you log into Xbox Live, more often than not, you're greeted by a 14-year-old that learned a new word on the playground that day.

46
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:28,873
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.

47
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:29,654
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways...

48
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:37,430
[SPEAKER_05]: This study, here's what they've basically come up with over the course of 33.9 hours.

49
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:50,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, the number one word, of course, that appeared would have been fuck, with 43% of the time, with an average of 8.11 uses per hour.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,903
[SPEAKER_05]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

51
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:17,985
[SPEAKER_05]: of course some of the other colorful language that was in there.

52
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:27,513
[SPEAKER_05]: 9% of them were racial slurs, 7% of them were sexual slurs including, you know, I want to fuck your mom, that type of stuff.

53
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:36,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait a minute, does I want to fuck your mom count as the usage of the word fuck or as sexual usage of the word fuck?

54
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:41,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, basically, sexual phrases which were not homosexual.

55
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:46,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck was not included in this unless it was directed at a person, i.e.

56
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:46,570
[SPEAKER_05]: your mom.

57
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So, how...

58
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,376
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times did Frack appear?

59
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,236
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I want to know.

60
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:51,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

61
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,636
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they do it on TV.

62
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,437
[SPEAKER_05]: 7% of them were homosexual references.

63
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:59,679
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, you're gay, you suck, you homo.

64
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:10,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn appeared 3% of the time, bitch 7% of the time, and ass 5% of the time, you know, being asshole, assbag, asshat, etc.

65
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:18,282
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually... I know why you wanted to do this story tonight.

66
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:23,610
[SPEAKER_07]: You just wanted an excuse to say ass bag and sound professional.

67
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:25,444
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

68
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:52,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Game experiences may differ during online play.

69
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: That, I guess, does make sense now.

70
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer Oh Poopy.

71
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:01,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you very much, Loki, for earning this episode an explicit tag.

72
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job!

73
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:02,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

74
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:09,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna pwn you, you fucking noobs.

75
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me, before you say all these words again, what was the point of this study?

76
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Scats whores or what?

77
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:20,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious how many times people really do say fuck.

78
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:23,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It was basically that they're trying to kind of...

79
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess bring this to light, you know, all these stupid people that are on Xbox Live and stuff and kind of that, you know, maybe that they should.

80
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:38,637
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't exactly a plea, you know, for the government to crack down or tighten the control in the gaming industry.

81
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:42,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just basically information that parents can educate themselves with.

82
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:48,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That this is how much, you know, fucking language they're going to hear during the course of Halo 2.

83
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:49,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

84
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is why Halo 2 is the number one Xbox Live game.

85
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:53,845
[SPEAKER_02]: How much more do they hear in their house?

86
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:54,826
[SPEAKER_07]: I,

87
00:06:56,395 --> 00:06:58,136
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this tweak in our chatroom.

88
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,176
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Asshat is my Xbox's name.

89
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good for you, buddy.

90
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:09,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's Halo team was called Badass Ninjas, but it was AZZ.

91
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:10,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

92
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:12,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

93
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

94
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, fine.

95
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Great study.

96
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray, hooray.

97
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go to a more serious Halo 2 related article, shall we?

98
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, for the love of God, please save us.

99
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Try not to use ass bag in your story.

100
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, about Ass 2 on PC.

101
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:33,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop it.

102
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:35,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Halo 2 on PC.

103
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:50,955
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Xbox.com, the Xbox game Halo 2 is being put on PC, but there's a hitch on that one that it's not for Windows XP, but for Windows Vista.

104
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll be able to do playing on that one next month, I suppose.

105
00:07:59,332 --> 00:08:02,072
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, buy Windows Vista, please.

106
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's an excuse to upgrade to Windows Vista.

107
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:10,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can freaking play Halo 2, which really would be better if you had an Xbox anyway.

108
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:15,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Being half the computers right now anyways can't run Windows Vista's default theme.

109
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:17,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad.

110
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:18,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad!

111
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:21,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft is not learning anything!

112
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,062
[SPEAKER_07]: You know where our chat room's going with this now?

113
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:29,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm back on the swearing thing, but this is a good indication by our chat room here.

114
00:08:30,304 --> 00:08:33,725
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bringing up... Have you guys ever seen that video on the internet of the kid?

115
00:08:33,785 --> 00:08:35,446
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if it was staged or not.

116
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,686
[SPEAKER_07]: People say it's legit, but whatever.

117
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:42,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Some kid is playing on Xbox Live and he left his voice chat on or whatever, and you can hear him yelling at his mom.

118
00:08:42,888 --> 00:08:45,088
[SPEAKER_07]: and people are quoting it in our chat room right now.

119
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:46,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

120
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like SSJ100 to Matt and Fireboma are going back a little bit back and forth in the chat room there.

121
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Mom, I want my fucking chocolate milk.

122
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,190
[SPEAKER_07]: You promised me, you bitch.

123
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in a clam match.

124
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:59,591
[SPEAKER_07]: You said I could get whatever I wanted and I said chocolate milk but now I want Mountain Dew.

125
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:00,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever heard that?

126
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.

127
00:09:02,172 --> 00:09:04,592
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so sad.

128
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how else to describe it.

129
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard children talking to their parents this way though.

130
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:08,933
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.

131
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I just had to bring that because it made me think of that and those guys are on it too.

132
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:18,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, let's talk about something pure and wholesome and good in the world like Oprah.

133
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:26,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, maybe that's a controversial subject and you're probably wondering what in the hell does Oprah have to do with gaming?

134
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:28,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she going to have video games on her show?

135
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:33,919
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not yet, but who knows because Nintendo has their sights on Oprah.

136
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:39,401
[SPEAKER_07]: This was Reggie Fils-Aim speaking at DICE.

137
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:46,356
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that Nintendo is considering using new marketing outlets such as Oprah and Ellen.

138
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:53,304
[SPEAKER_07]: He said a, quote, blue ocean of opportunity through new types of gameplay, end quote.

139
00:09:53,704 --> 00:10:00,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So, obviously, Nintendo's trying to attract a whole new set of gamers here, and I think we've kind of seen this in the early releases for the Revolution.

140
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:05,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I seem to remember them saying, well, this controller looks like a TV remote.

141
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:12,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's used a TV remote, so we're trying to expand to a whole new base of gamers, and you can see that Nintendo is being very aggressive with this stuff.

142
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, he went on to point out that Nintendogs was a great success.

143
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:20,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Brain Training in Japan sold 2.5 million.

144
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Brain Age, Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day is coming out here on April 17th.

145
00:10:26,648 --> 00:10:29,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very interested to check this out.

146
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:38,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting there on how Nintendo's being aggressive there with their marketing.

147
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:44,742
[SPEAKER_05]: They feel, I guess, not enough moms are playing the Nintendo systems.

148
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:45,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose not.

149
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:47,533
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

150
00:10:48,073 --> 00:10:48,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

151
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:53,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Mom, why are you ponying noobs on, you know, Smash Brothers Revolution?

152
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:55,538
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

153
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, what do you have for us next?

154
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that games are like porn?

155
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:19,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what games you play, but... I know you said you and Dan kind of have some fond memories over games, but I hope this isn't the kind of thing where... More like me screaming at him for being a... Okay, every time that we play, like, Street Fighter and he wins, he has to talk shit, you know?

156
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:21,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, I won!

157
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:22,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you suck!

158
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:24,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, I'm not gonna play with you again then.

159
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be... You know, if it were me, I'd be all, I am putting out tonight.

160
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:31,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, bitch, you watch out, I'll use Cammy.

161
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:32,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

162
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:33,528
[SPEAKER_02]: He hates when I use Cammy, by the way.

163
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:33,648
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

164
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,526
[SPEAKER_02]: because I own him every time.

165
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no, I did not know.

166
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:38,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, let me take your bait.

167
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,868
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Jamie, I didn't know that games are like porn.

168
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,608
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean?

169
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:51,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's been a bit of a talk going around about how games are being marketed.

170
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:59,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's been this obsession going around with basically making them all cinematic.

171
00:12:00,256 --> 00:12:02,437
[SPEAKER_02]: That game pitches are being done like

172
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this movie, or it's like this movie.

173
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:13,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they've got to go out and use different media to market the games.

174
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:19,972
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you sit and watch, you'd be watching a movie trailer at the theater, and you get a game thing up there.

175
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:21,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not watching a movie.

176
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm watching a video game ad.

177
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:24,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

178
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:32,841
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a quote out here by, is his last name pronounced?

179
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:38,654
[SPEAKER_02]: J for Joff, David Joff, who was the creator of God of War.

180
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's basically putting down the video game industry to imitate Hollywood movies and not offer the decent wages that you find amongst the Hollywood industry because the games are being marketed just the same way.

181
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,822
[SPEAKER_07]: So are they saying, they're not saying games are like porn, take that literally, but they're saying games is like how porn is viewed in the entertainment industry.

182
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:02,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what I'm reading?

183
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:03,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

184
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:03,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

185
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:04,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

186
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:08,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of wondering if this was going back to the Rez and Transvibrator thing again.

187
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,824
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I have a story on that coming up later.

188
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:11,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

189
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this quote here.

190
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:17,427
[SPEAKER_02]: He's referring to the tie-in with Peter Jackson's King Kong.

191
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:18,927
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a quote.

192
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:24,710
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of reviews praise King Kong's lack of HUD, but what's wrong with an HUD?

193
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,752
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with a health bar that raises good to the player when he replenishes it?

194
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:35,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And why are we applauding in the press for abandoning the native language of video games?

195
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:37,355
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also another quote in here.

196
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:37,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm

197
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:44,298
[SPEAKER_02]: about the obsession with cinema, and he admitted, I am guilty of that as well because God of War was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark.

198
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:51,705
[SPEAKER_02]: However, he explained he wanted the game to give players the experience of watching Indiana Jones as a 10-year-old rather than being Indiana Jones themselves.

199
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:56,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is where the porn industry ties in another quote.

200
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:58,090
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the porn industry, sort of.

201
00:13:58,491 --> 00:14:02,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I read about this guy who had this topless review that he was trying to add art to, and it's bombing.

202
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:04,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe games fall into that slot.

203
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:07,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Some days I think games can be something else, the next great entertainment media.

204
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:13,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And then days I feel like it's just like porn or motion rides where there's no capability to reach high emotional levels.

205
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:14,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

206
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,479
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very interesting quote.

207
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have an immediate reaction to that.

208
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to sit on that one and think about it for a little bit there.

209
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Games.

210
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:28,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how games are like porn is that when you try to be artsy with porn, people don't buy into it.

211
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:29,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

212
00:14:31,952 --> 00:14:35,459
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to wonder what would happen if we had more people with creative sensibilities.

213
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,106
[SPEAKER_02]: If more games had a soul, had something to say, something that resonates.

214
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:48,869
[SPEAKER_02]: He also was resentful over the fact that people that create games receive pretty meager wages compared to how Hollywood directors and screenplays receive.

215
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:52,470
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I'm really frustrated with the way the industry is structured.

216
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,790
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a sense of kind of being exploited.

217
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an industry problem.

218
00:14:56,911 --> 00:14:59,531
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has, of course, no intention to leave the industry.

219
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, if Sony came to me and told me, we're making God of War 2, I might have to decline, he said before admitting, I can stand up here and say I won't do it until they kick me out.

220
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:08,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going anywhere.

221
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know but I you know my whole thing with that is you know like I said earlier not only is it that we're seeing the same type of standard in video games that's expected you know if movies we're seeing them marketed the same way too you know right up along there with your feature flick you've got the game to go with it you have other games being marketed in the same genre why aren't they getting the same type of of you know pay that anyone in the cinematic industry would receive hmm

222
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:42,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

223
00:15:42,718 --> 00:15:45,519
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have an easy answer for that right now.

224
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:46,920
[SPEAKER_07]: It gives us something to think about, though.

225
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,742
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious what the chatroom thinks about that.

226
00:15:49,302 --> 00:15:50,703
[SPEAKER_07]: OrangeLogicRadio.com, click on chat.

227
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll get some Skype calls about that later.

228
00:15:52,424 --> 00:15:52,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

229
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:54,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that story.

230
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:54,946
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good one.

231
00:15:56,046 --> 00:15:57,767
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's move on and talk about Sony.

232
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:05,493
[SPEAKER_07]: In Part A tonight, we talked a lot about the DS and Xbox and stuff, but we didn't talk a whole lot about Sony, so Loki, save the day here.

233
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:06,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us some Sony news.

234
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:07,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

235
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:07,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

236
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, one of the first things we have is, could the PlayStation 3 kill Sony?

237
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:17,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you think about it, this thing is taking forever to come out, so you kind of have to look at it a little bit.

238
00:16:17,887 --> 00:16:19,931
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that's being brought up is...

239
00:16:20,444 --> 00:16:20,704
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura,

240
00:16:43,673 --> 00:16:47,397
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying, oh, it might be $400, could be $500.

241
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:52,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, people don't have that kind of money to drop on these console systems like that.

242
00:16:52,581 --> 00:17:04,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, with Blu-ray coming out and stuff, not many people feel the need that they need Blu-ray because you're not going to see a big difference unless you own a high-def TV, and only 24% of the market out there owns a high-def TV.

243
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,594
[SPEAKER_05]: So, who cares?

244
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:09,917
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that number is going to increase, though, certainly throughout the next few years.

245
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:10,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, it will, but...

246
00:17:12,202 --> 00:17:12,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

247
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:16,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony needs to drop the price hint already so people stop theorizing about this.

248
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:23,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Developers Conference would be a good time to do that hint hint, but we all know we're going to be waiting until E3 to see the real meat of this.

249
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:30,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is, and I think this is probably going to change right now, that we haven't really seen much in games right now.

250
00:17:30,327 --> 00:17:32,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing's really been finished.

251
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, I think the whole point is everyone's starting to kind of...

252
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:38,737
[SPEAKER_05]: All Doom and Gloom

253
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:02,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a crazy price point?

254
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:04,580
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a crazy price point.

255
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so too, but I'm just saying people will pay it.

256
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:08,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, people will pay it.

257
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,324
[SPEAKER_05]: That's over retail.

258
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:12,206
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they going to be charging for these if there's a shortage?

259
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, $2,000.

260
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:13,707
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

261
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,449
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know.

262
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:20,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they need to come out with some information, that's for sure.

263
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,113
[SPEAKER_07]: The sooner the better.

264
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, is it possible there might be any shows coming up where we could see some of this information?

265
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,207
[SPEAKER_05]: There is actually.

266
00:18:27,928 --> 00:18:32,033
[SPEAKER_05]: At the TGS show, not the Tokyo Game Show, but the...

267
00:18:32,908 --> 00:18:34,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Taipei Game Show 2006.

268
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:44,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony will be showcasing their next-gen console featuring numerous booths, 80 booths actually, covering all the games.

269
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,991
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be coming out.

270
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:48,871
[SPEAKER_05]: And 20 of them exclusively for the PS3.

271
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just going to be recycled stuff.

272
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:56,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would they announce something new at this show?

273
00:18:56,332 --> 00:19:00,073
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the new thing added is going to be the Boomerang competition using the controller.

274
00:19:00,413 --> 00:19:03,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Boomerang controller has been redesigned, actually.

275
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:17,566
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an article put out by, I believe there was some gaming group that got to test out the PS3 and three of the games that have been made so far on the dev console, obviously, and the controller being used does not look like a boomerang.

276
00:19:18,266 --> 00:19:19,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, okay.

277
00:19:19,397 --> 00:19:21,898
[SPEAKER_05]: They're basing it more around the DualShock type of thing.

278
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:22,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, good.

279
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Because DualShock, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

280
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it could be an ergonomic DualShock.

281
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, the Boomerang of Death is probably not going to be the controller.

282
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:33,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

283
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:40,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if it was the Boomerang of Death that was the controller, third-party people are going to make a DualShock-looking one anyway, so you can always buy that.

284
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:45,425
[SPEAKER_07]: About prices, Sephiroth1215 in our chat, remember back when PS1 was like $500?

285
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,666
[SPEAKER_07]: People paid that when that first came out.

286
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be insanely stupid for the PS3 to be $700.

287
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It's murder for their system right there.

288
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:56,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

289
00:19:59,396 --> 00:19:59,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

290
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:07,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we'll go ahead and move on here, get into another story, and actually it kind of relates to the PlayStation 3.

291
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:09,243
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a real brief thing I have here.

292
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:18,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision has revealed that they will be releasing three titles at launch for the Sony console, and of course one game for the Revolution as well.

293
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:22,290
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as what games those are, well, that we don't know.

294
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,891
[SPEAKER_07]: For whatever reason, those are being kept well under wraps.

295
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:28,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say everybody's holding on to it so they can blow their load at E3.

296
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:32,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I think E3 is going to be an avalanche of information.

297
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: You know if it's not that it's going to be murder for the publicity of these systems.

298
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:48,558
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so much hype around this year's E3 with these two systems, Revolution and PS3, that both companies better be prepared to lay it all out on the table, I think.

299
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:58,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting because the article on this site that this ran on here, gamersreports.com, where we found this, says you can guarantee that one of these...

300
00:20:59,898 --> 00:21:02,019
[SPEAKER_07]: One of these games will be Tony Hawk something.

301
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:04,379
[SPEAKER_07]: And certainly that would make sense.

302
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:08,040
[SPEAKER_07]: A new Tony Hawk game on PS3 at launch.

303
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Successful series, why not?

304
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Good theory.

305
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:12,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

306
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:15,802
[SPEAKER_05]: What else might the PS3 bring us, Loki?

307
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully lots of violent games.

308
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:24,904
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to be for the PS3, but one of the things that we've been actually seeing, there was a...

309
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:41,656
[SPEAKER_05]: British, or yesterday, actually at the British Embassy in Tokyo, there was a seminar on British gaming and demonstrated how the powerful graphics of the PS3 can display lots of violence.

310
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yes.

311
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:50,738
[SPEAKER_05]: From headshots to body shots, they had basically, this developer, it's

312
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:53,812
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

313
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:21,393
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a duh for me because as graphics get better, so will the detail of violence.

314
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:22,854
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what else is going to get better?

315
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:25,835
[SPEAKER_07]: The tits and ass will be more realistic as well.

316
00:22:26,755 --> 00:22:27,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Duh.

317
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:31,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, but, you know.

318
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,938
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to come out with a game.

319
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:34,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Tits and ass.

320
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:35,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Headshot.

321
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,279
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the selling point.

322
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,520
[SPEAKER_07]: The tits and ass headshot game?

323
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.

324
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming to PS3 exclusively.

325
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:46,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that'll be DOA Beach Volleyball 2 at 360.

326
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:46,726
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

327
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:48,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

328
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that if the PS3 does usher in a lot of violent games, you know who's gonna love this?

329
00:22:54,994 --> 00:22:56,636
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who's gonna love that?

330
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:57,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Me?

331
00:22:58,258 --> 00:22:59,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not just you, but...

332
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:02,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Jacky Poo Jacky Poo

333
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:32,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Robano?

334
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:32,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

335
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:33,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

336
00:23:33,284 --> 00:23:34,965
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference between two games?

337
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,266
[SPEAKER_07]: You do know we're a video game show, right?

338
00:23:36,627 --> 00:23:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's one of Elevation's key investors.

339
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:40,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Elevation partners.

340
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

341
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're trying to obtain Take-Two.

342
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:49,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay, so Jack Thompson hates Take-Two, Bono wants to buy something he's got to do.

343
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

344
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you say in the letter, do we know?

345
00:23:52,401 --> 00:24:04,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Bono, the letter begins, I write you as a fellow brother in Jesus Christ, appreciative of your bold witness to the transforming truth of the gospel in both your words and your deeds.

346
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:10,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I write to encourage you respectfully and in the spirit of brotherly love not to purchase Take-Two Interactive Software Incorporated.

347
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:11,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, my brain is burning.

348
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you're going to hell.

349
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,002
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, we all got our spot reserved.

350
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:19,546
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should have wrote Bono and went, you know, in the name of love.

351
00:24:21,348 --> 00:24:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget it.

352
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,834
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, the whole terminology there, I admit...

353
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:47,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's just a very poorly masked attempt to, besides the get publicity thing, to try to use religion as a front for his own personal agenda, which I find horribly insulting.

354
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:53,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're a religious person, you should probably find this insulting too, I think.

355
00:24:54,212 --> 00:25:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's also said in the letter that Take-Two has lied to the investment community in its latest SEC filing and warns that ongoing criminal investigations have put the publisher's very survival at risk, despite the fraudulent assertions in the recent SEC filing that they are all without merit.

356
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:13,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

357
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:15,659
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, Jackie Poo?

358
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:15,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up!

359
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:16,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down.

360
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

361
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:40,802
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to just cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it.

362
00:25:42,363 --> 00:25:45,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, did he ever get our flowers?

363
00:25:45,605 --> 00:25:50,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they weren't our flowers, but we helped, and our name was on the little signature of the letter.

364
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was.

365
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:52,170
[SPEAKER_07]: The host of Orange Lounge Radio.

366
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:54,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he ever get those flowers?

367
00:25:54,232 --> 00:26:04,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he did, and he forwarded them on to the offices of Rockstar, and I believe the attorneys representing Rockstar.

368
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bet he never even looked at them.

369
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he even took a minute to smell the flowers.

370
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:10,933
[SPEAKER_01]: He said they were pretty.

371
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:11,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he?

372
00:26:12,214 --> 00:26:12,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good.

373
00:26:12,674 --> 00:26:13,315
[SPEAKER_01]: He said they were pretty.

374
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:13,775
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

375
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And he basically called it harassment.

376
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:35,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it says this harassment of me follows take two and blank Rome's lead in characterizing me in the media and in Alabama's courthouse as variously a bisexual pedophile, mentally ill, paranoid, and so forth.

377
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I believe that's what the letter said at all.

378
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:41,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, what a dumbass.

379
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,648
[SPEAKER_07]: How is sending flowers harassment?

380
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Ordering pizza to somebody else, that's harassment.

381
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:48,811
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what happened here.

382
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:59,358
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole point of this thing was to do something that was non-harassing because there are a lot of people that have chosen to respond immaturely to Jack Thompson.

383
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was supposed to be the anti-harassment.

384
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,851
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

385
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:26,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

386
00:27:26,488 --> 00:27:41,239
[SPEAKER_05]: He said that the flowers were sent to harass him and he sent them, you know, to them to basically, they're forwarded in a memory of the innocence that each of you three men helped kill, as Jack Thompson put.

387
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

388
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:55,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's forwarded in the memory of these victims whose killers have yet... I want to know how many people he thinks have actually been killed by Grand Theft Auto and how many of these people actually, you know,

389
00:27:55,918 --> 00:28:05,385
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's like three people they're talking about here, and how many millions of people have played this game, I would say that's a pretty small number.

390
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:13,811
[SPEAKER_05]: If everybody was learning to kill from these games, wouldn't there be millions and millions of killers out there?

391
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't send him a puppy.

392
00:28:16,376 --> 00:28:17,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Ross makes a good point.

393
00:28:17,616 --> 00:28:22,957
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't send him a puppy because the moment the puppy tried to bite him, he'd have the puppy locked up and then put to death.

394
00:28:23,097 --> 00:28:23,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor puppy.

395
00:28:23,957 --> 00:28:24,297
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

396
00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:25,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't send him any puppies.

397
00:28:27,018 --> 00:28:28,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't want to talk about Jackie Poo.

398
00:28:28,218 --> 00:28:28,658
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, fine.

399
00:28:28,778 --> 00:28:29,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

400
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:34,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually seriously thinking about and compiling the statistical data myself and writing him a letter.

401
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:34,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

402
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know when I write a letter to anybody...

403
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:43,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I put statistical data to back up every damn thing I say.

404
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:49,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm curious now with this whole activism thing, what's next for the Flowers for Jack folks?

405
00:28:49,489 --> 00:28:51,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they created a huge thing here.

406
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:55,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they've been arguing back and forth with Jack Thompson over email.

407
00:28:55,674 --> 00:28:58,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it says, get over your Jack Thompson obsession.

408
00:28:58,776 --> 00:28:59,717
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not about me.

409
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:02,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about Rockstar's sale of murder simulators to children.

410
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you should encourage the parents to do their job.

411
00:29:06,656 --> 00:29:12,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope to God that the next Grand Theft Auto game that comes out is Grand Theft Auto Murder Simulator for Children.

412
00:29:12,698 --> 00:29:14,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, what's the website?

413
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:18,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't the Flourish for Jack folks get so big they had to make their own new website?

414
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:25,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe it's PixellantiNation.com And of course Pixellanti was a term that Jackie Poo coined.

415
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:26,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So, cute.

416
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:31,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so keep tabs on that and we'll be keeping an eye on it too to see what they do next.

417
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:34,925
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as we'd like not to talk about them each week, you know.

418
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:36,796
[SPEAKER_07]: F you of the week time, DarkSakura.

419
00:29:58,348 --> 00:30:08,894
[SPEAKER_02]: My FU of the week goes to San Francisco traffic for sucking out the soul that was sitting within me happily after leaving the Kintetsu Mall.

420
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:18,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I went with my friend Becky to the Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose to go look at the Egyptian exhibit.

421
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:23,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went on to San Francisco to go shopping and look for Japanese stuff.

422
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: And after we were done with the shopping, we decided we were going to go...

423
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:29,925
[SPEAKER_02]: to find somewhere to eat and I got lost.

424
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:31,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't really get lost.

425
00:30:31,545 --> 00:30:40,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more just the streets there make no sense because you'd be going down the road and all of a sudden, oh, we're going to split off here and not make any type of real sense in how we go.

426
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:47,712
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally got to turn around and got back up and made my way back to Mission, which I knew would lead me to Van Ness.

427
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:54,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were going up Van Ness going, you know what, let's eat at the Hard Rock Cafe because as far as she remembered it was on Van Ness.

428
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:55,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't.

429
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're like, oh crap, we don't see it anywhere.

430
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:07,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So we headed back to go to the fisherman's wharf.

431
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:08,886
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to try to eat at Bubba Gump.

432
00:31:08,906 --> 00:31:10,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a two and a half hour wait.

433
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:11,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

434
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

435
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:14,371
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we found the Hard Rock Cafe had been moved there.

436
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're like, great.

437
00:31:16,512 --> 00:31:20,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So after us saying out of spite we were not going to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe, we ate there anyway.

438
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:21,796
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.

439
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:22,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

440
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:33,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you're talking about.

441
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:33,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

442
00:31:34,204 --> 00:31:34,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

443
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:36,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, moving on.

444
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:38,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Loki.

445
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:40,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I got nothing.

446
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really pissed off at anything, actually.

447
00:31:43,008 --> 00:31:44,009
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I threw a book at your head?

448
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,590
[SPEAKER_05]: What if I give you something to be pissed off about?

449
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:46,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

450
00:31:47,311 --> 00:31:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody step on Loki's foot.

451
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

452
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You stay.

453
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:50,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

454
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,340
[SPEAKER_07]: TheFerretHasNephew

455
00:32:08,846 --> 00:32:12,409
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU of the week goes to the fact that I'm not going to be here for two weeks.

456
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:13,911
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of stinks.

457
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:22,558
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, it's for my day job, and I like my day job and all, and getting out of town once in a while on the company dollars is cool and all, and, you know, I get to go teach, which is what I love to do.

458
00:32:23,018 --> 00:32:27,803
[SPEAKER_07]: But it still sucks because, you know, I have to put other stuff I like to do, such as this, on hold.

459
00:32:27,883 --> 00:32:28,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So that bites.

460
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,187
[SPEAKER_07]: So an FU to that frustration feeling that comes with that.

461
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:33,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Grr.

462
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,240
[SPEAKER_07]: and an F you to the fact that I probably won't really get to play games while I'm out there.

463
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to fall behind on this gaming stuff.

464
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be able to read websites and stuff, but my laptop that I'm taking is not that hot unless I convince Extrovert to let me borrow his.

465
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I won't get to play World of Warcraft.

466
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:52,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't get to play Xbox or PlayStation or any of that stuff.

467
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:56,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I could always rent the... Jamie's cradling her laptop.

468
00:32:56,086 --> 00:33:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I know you won't give up the precious, but I could always rent

469
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo 64 games in the hotel room.

470
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The last hotel I stayed at.

471
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:05,835
[SPEAKER_07]: The last Hilton I stayed at had that.

472
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You should take your PSP.

473
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I might.

474
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:10,477
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll probably take the DS.

475
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:11,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the DS.

476
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:11,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably will.

477
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:14,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I originally... You can chat with us on Animal Crossing.

478
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

479
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think if there's any really good games coming out for the DS or Nintendo.

480
00:33:19,722 --> 00:33:20,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I'll probably take that stuff.

481
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:21,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie can stalk around.

482
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:22,604
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see ya.

483
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:26,186
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have free Wi-Fi, so maybe I'll actually get back into Animal Crossing.

484
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:26,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

485
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

486
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:31,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get back to the show.

487
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:32,488
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel better now that I've vented.

488
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:33,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid off my last loan, by the way.

489
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Not my very last loan, but I've got my second room now.

490
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,137
[SPEAKER_02]: My second downstairs room.

491
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:39,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, me too.

492
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:40,839
[SPEAKER_07]: 845,000 bells!

493
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of fish.

494
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, I've been using fruit.

495
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And selling furniture.

496
00:34:06,684 --> 00:34:18,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Tekken is coming to the PSP, so that'd be great, except we don't know if it's going to be a new Tekken fighting game, which it probably will be, or something crappy like Death by Degrees, you know.

497
00:34:18,688 --> 00:34:20,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, I'm looking forward to that.

498
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:28,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing, if you missed out on Nintendogs, you might get your chance with The Dog Happy Life.

499
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:33,453
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a Nintendog-like game, and you can...

500
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:38,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Customize your dog's room, and so on and so forth.

501
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Teach it stuff.

502
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:41,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'd be pretty cool.

503
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:53,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, it'd be interesting, I'm not sure if they have this, but since they do have the mic, which you can use for the PSP, maybe you can actually train your dog via voice.

504
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,631
[SPEAKER_05]: So have voice recognition or something.

505
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:56,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be pretty cool.

506
00:34:56,752 --> 00:34:59,454
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on that, but one can speculate.

507
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:01,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'd be pretty cool.

508
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:05,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's scheduled to be released in Japan on the 27th of April.

509
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:06,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out.

510
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:16,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, if you are in the free stuff, there's a nice little transport tycoon clone out there called OpenTTD.

511
00:35:17,722 --> 00:35:22,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually available for download on PSP Updates.

512
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:22,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks pretty sweet.

513
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know,

514
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:25,918
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

515
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:53,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So, pretty cool.

516
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:55,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Also available on PSP Updates.

517
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:57,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

518
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:04,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So, by the way, those of you guys with PSPs, you should be visiting olrpsp.com.

519
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:05,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.

520
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:06,872
[SPEAKER_07]: That site's pretty cool.

521
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, you gonna do something nice for the folks at olrpsp.com?

522
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:10,614
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to give them some updates.

523
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:11,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Some new wallpaper or something.

524
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:13,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do something for the folks there.

525
00:36:13,175 --> 00:36:14,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been working on stuff.

526
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:14,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

527
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:17,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, you know... We just did a photo shoot.

528
00:36:17,897 --> 00:36:22,339
[SPEAKER_07]: We need folks to be able to put our ugly faces on their PSPs.

529
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:22,399
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

530
00:36:23,157 --> 00:36:24,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not need validation.

531
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:25,158
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm married.

532
00:36:46,968 --> 00:37:01,205
[SPEAKER_02]: My husband says I'm hot all the time I've been reading one of Margaret Cho's books and reading about what it's like to be a celebrity when you don't expect yourself to be one

533
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh my god, that sort of happens to me sometimes.

534
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Please understand, we're grounded here.

535
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:13,956
[SPEAKER_07]: We realize we're not super celebrities, but there is a teensy bit of recognition that comes with us.

536
00:37:14,016 --> 00:37:18,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole thing where I don't expect to say, oh, I've listened to you.

537
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:21,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember who it was I was talking to.

538
00:37:21,023 --> 00:37:23,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just on a message board somewhere.

539
00:37:23,905 --> 00:37:24,986
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone says, oh, is that you?

540
00:37:25,687 --> 00:37:26,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

541
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:29,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, two of my friends from college found me through our website.

542
00:37:29,912 --> 00:37:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, see that's crazy.

543
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, what the hell?

544
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:36,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's great though, we love it, we love it.

545
00:37:36,575 --> 00:37:42,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But do remember guys, A, this isn't our day job, B, you know, we do this because we love games and talking about them.

546
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:46,439
[SPEAKER_02]: I joke all the time about being an internet celebrity, but it's sort of true.

547
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,901
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're grounded with that, you don't really think.

548
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:52,922
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have delusions of grandeur or anything.

549
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:58,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to work, I go to school, and I go to the gym, you know.

550
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:03,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I play my video games and I come talk about it and it just happens to be that people all over the world listen to me.

551
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:05,174
[SPEAKER_02]: No big thing.

552
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:06,615
[SPEAKER_02]: No big whoop.

553
00:38:06,635 --> 00:38:06,655
[SPEAKER_02]: 555-4444

554
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,443
[SPEAKER_07]: The Secret History of Video Game Sex

555
00:38:32,938 --> 00:38:37,422
[SPEAKER_07]: And they hit on some of the high points of sex and gaming in history.

556
00:38:37,863 --> 00:38:39,304
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they have this cute little timeline.

557
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:48,292
[SPEAKER_07]: It's available on 1up.com that starts off with Custer's Revenge in 1982, of course, being one of the most memorable porno games on Atari 2600.

558
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:53,637
[SPEAKER_07]: And not only porno, but, you know, racist and violent, like, all wrapped into one.

559
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:56,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is your X-rated game if there ever was one.

560
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,262
[SPEAKER_07]: There will never be anything like it again, that's for damn sure.

561
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:02,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Was Custer's Revenge even really sold anywhere?

562
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe 10 copies were made and one of them got on the internet and now it's this big cult phenomenon?

563
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:09,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

564
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:10,949
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

565
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,132
[SPEAKER_07]: River City Ransom they put in their list because it had the first pixelated butt.

566
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:19,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember when they went to the sauna?

567
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:21,034
[SPEAKER_07]: You could see the little butt.

568
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:34,580
[SPEAKER_02]: To its defense, River City Ransom was actually a Japanese game called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story where you went, instead of going to the little shops, they actually said, you know, did all the really cute stuff, and you did go to a bathhouse.

569
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:38,182
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's more, you know, it's a cultural thing in that case where it's, you know...

570
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:43,261
[SPEAKER_07]: But for us, here in America, that was a bit of a, oh my gosh, booty!

571
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:46,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Tomb Raider in 96, Lara Croft, enough said.

572
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:52,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Gear Solid in 98 is cited for Meryl.

573
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:58,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she walks around in her underwear if you go interrupt her changing clothes.

574
00:39:58,934 --> 00:39:59,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, alright.

575
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:04,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And moving on the list, of course... She should also say she's more comfortable with her Desert Eagle than with her bra.

576
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:06,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Dead or Alive.

577
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:09,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Nuff Said There is cited.

578
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:10,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Bouncy Boobs.

579
00:40:11,102 --> 00:40:18,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Fear Effect 2, Retro Helix, because it's got sexy protagonists who are lovers.

580
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:19,786
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit of lesbianism.

581
00:40:20,847 --> 00:40:25,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Rez in 2001 is cited for a certain peripheral that came with this game.

582
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to find now, but it's called the Trans Vibrator.

583
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:35,994
[SPEAKER_07]: And trust me, when they developed it, they weren't thinking of the uses that some people have come up for with this.

584
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:38,273
[SPEAKER_02]: The article was hilarious.

585
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:39,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough said.

586
00:40:40,635 --> 00:40:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: BMX XXX in 2002.

587
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I own that game.

588
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:45,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I played this game because you had it.

589
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,262
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a very fun game.

590
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:51,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX.

591
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:53,047
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really cool game though.

592
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:55,609
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have strippers and naked people in it.

593
00:40:55,729 --> 00:40:56,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And pimps.

594
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:03,334
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got that as well, but it takes forever to get the boobs on the bike.

595
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,795
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take very long to get the stripper cutscenes, though.

596
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:08,637
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just these random stripper cutscenes inserted in the game.

597
00:41:08,977 --> 00:41:10,678
[SPEAKER_07]: That you can get pretty soon, but yeah.

598
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:11,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

599
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:18,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Also on the list here of 1up.com's Secret History of Video Game Sex, Leisure Suit Larry from 2004.

600
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:24,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Enough said, although I'm kind of curious why they didn't cite the earlier games, but whatever.

601
00:41:25,353 --> 00:41:32,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Blood Rain, simply for the fact that she ended up being in that Playboy spread, that virtual girl topless thing.

602
00:41:33,636 --> 00:41:38,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, hot coffee, duh.

603
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:43,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Playboy The Mansion, that game, was cited here on the list here.

604
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And God of War...

605
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:49,072
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2005, because of course, you know, he had some, you know, boob stuff too.

606
00:41:49,512 --> 00:41:57,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly, UMD Pornography, making their list here of the steamy side of Gaming's Past.

607
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking here in the chat room to see some of the points that folks are saying here.

608
00:42:03,545 --> 00:42:07,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a lot of people are talking about Bubble Bath Babes.

609
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:09,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's Bubble Bath Babes from the list?

610
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,590
[SPEAKER_07]: That game sucked.

611
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:10,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that game sucked.

612
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:16,888
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, and then people are talking about hacking your NES ROMs to give nudity in the games.

613
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:19,889
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of those are stupid, though, like Super Nude Brothers.

614
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, lame.

615
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:33,333
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never forget the one that was a game that was never released here, but in Japan they had an old, old, old NES title called Nuts and Milk, and it was the name of the game.

616
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, somebody hacked this ROM, and you know what?

617
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:37,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Just fill in the blank.

618
00:42:37,635 --> 00:42:39,255
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what they did to this game, okay?

619
00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:40,216
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

620
00:42:40,716 --> 00:42:41,356
[SPEAKER_05]: That's excellent.

621
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:44,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

622
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, please say you have some type of serious story for us here.

623
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:16,175
[SPEAKER_07]: But Jamie, first, you have a story for us.

624
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:17,077
[SPEAKER_02]: New cost porn.

625
00:43:18,018 --> 00:43:18,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

626
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:18,699
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

627
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

628
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:23,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Quantic Dream has canned InfraWorld.

629
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:27,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been pretty much tossed in the garbage, kicked out to the road.

630
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:28,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

631
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:41,298
[SPEAKER_02]: In an interview with the German website, working title, William de Vandermeer, I suppose I pronounced that right, said InfraWorld at date is cancelled.

632
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,179
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept did not appeal to publishers.

633
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:52,787
[SPEAKER_02]: They did say that Omicron 2, which was announced at the same time as InfraWorld, is actually still on track and is now titled Karma.

634
00:43:53,427 --> 00:43:55,889
[SPEAKER_02]: But it won't be out on shelves until 2009.

635
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:59,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Quantic Dream is actually working on another unnamed title at present.

636
00:44:00,572 --> 00:44:05,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Another quote on here, We have production set, but I cannot divulge the name or details of the project.

637
00:44:05,914 --> 00:44:11,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an original franchise of ours, a game for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, and PC systems.

638
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Speculation is that it's a sequel to Fahrenheit.

639
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But no Inferworld.

640
00:44:19,398 --> 00:44:19,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

641
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:20,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

642
00:44:22,848 --> 00:44:29,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Skype line is open over at www.orangelandradio.com Click on interact with us and I'd be picking up a call right now but nobody's calling in.

643
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:32,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm thinking, I'm looking at our chat room and people are doing this.

644
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:34,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They're collectively doing this.

645
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:35,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick.

646
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:38,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So fine, we'll go on to the next story.

647
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,136
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys don't want to call, fine by me.

648
00:44:40,856 --> 00:44:42,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's on your mind?

649
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:46,058
[SPEAKER_07]: The holiday is coming up pretty soon here.

650
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:48,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's see.

651
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we have to talk about sexy cheats.

652
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:54,272
[SPEAKER_05]: for Sexy Games.

653
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

654
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:23,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other things that they have here.

655
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:30,553
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually talk about Meryl's underwear in Metal Gear Solid, which I thought was kind of funny.

656
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:33,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can actually...

657
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:45,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Blood Rain into Juggie mode by entering Juggie Dance Squad as the code to basically unlock this new mode.

658
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what exactly that does, but it'd be interesting.

659
00:45:48,794 --> 00:45:51,475
[SPEAKER_05]: BMX XXX, they have Topless Girl mode.

660
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: You basically have to win first place in both competition levels to unlock the Topless Girl option.

661
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,761
[SPEAKER_05]: They have Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball, See-Through Swimsuit,

662
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:16,233
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can actually play with Helena, Leifang, and Christie to basically get a transparent swimsuit.

663
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:17,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it is censored.

664
00:46:18,533 --> 00:46:19,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, folks.

665
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:28,356
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the guide game, if you happen to unlock some of the video that's in there, you can hit Triangle Deposit and

666
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:32,863
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, who has some news about Sonic the Hedgehog.

667
00:46:58,493 --> 00:46:59,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, Sonic's old.

668
00:46:59,834 --> 00:47:00,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kidding.

669
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:05,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog even though I was a Super Nintendo person in my younger years.

670
00:47:06,677 --> 00:47:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually is a next generation Sonic game that made an appearance in GamePro.

671
00:47:16,342 --> 00:47:19,144
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big world exclusive thing.

672
00:47:19,324 --> 00:47:19,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

673
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:25,738
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a few interesting points that were made in the article.

674
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:30,741
[SPEAKER_02]: The typical Sonic character model was about 1500 polygons.

675
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:34,363
[SPEAKER_02]: This time around it has 1 million, according to the developers.

676
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome.

677
00:47:35,744 --> 00:47:38,005
[SPEAKER_02]: The game will also be faster than any previous Sonic game.

678
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:43,068
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a quote from Nakamura, who is the game creator.

679
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:48,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It has motion blur, you can see it in some of the images that have been out on there.

680
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were some that were published in the magazine too.

681
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:58,971
[SPEAKER_02]: The game will feature huge environments that have night and day cycles as you progress through the game.

682
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:07,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You have morning, noon, night, changing the lighting, sort of how Ocarina of Time was with the day and night.

683
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:11,912
[SPEAKER_02]: It will also use the Havix Physics game engine.

684
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:21,324
[SPEAKER_02]: GamePro mentioned also that there was a sequence where Sonic faced an army of killer robots and they went flying everywhere with, quote, startling realism.

685
00:48:22,225 --> 00:48:23,948
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what it is when it's finished.

686
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:26,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like it could be pretty sweet.

687
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:27,352
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

688
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:32,016
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're about ready to wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

689
00:48:32,036 --> 00:48:37,902
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki has a couple quick stories he wants to go through real quick here, some things that fell through the cracks that he wants to make sure we talk about.

690
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:38,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

691
00:48:39,384 --> 00:48:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that they've actually got on this website, knollriver.com, for all you Mac owners out there, if you do have a 360, you're able to share your music back and forth with the 360.

692
00:48:51,936 --> 00:48:59,963
[SPEAKER_05]: using this program they made called Connect360 and allow you to sync up your iTunes as well as photos, etc.

693
00:49:00,463 --> 00:49:02,365
[SPEAKER_05]: So check that out if you own a Mac and a 360.

694
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, that was a nice olive branch from Loki, I think, in a way.

695
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:07,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that, Loki.

696
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:09,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, just messing with you.

697
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:11,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, moving on.

698
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:19,476
[SPEAKER_05]: There are actually more video game movies in production right now, and there's been some updates on those, mainly Max Payne and Alice.

699
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:29,222
[SPEAKER_05]: They've actually signed on Sarah Michelle Gellar to play the role of Alice, which will be pretty sweet.

700
00:49:29,782 --> 00:49:33,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And Max Payne, I believe, is still in production right now.

701
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell her to gain some weight first.

702
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:37,227
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be pretty cool.

703
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: The new wave of Xbox 360 games to come out may require you to have a hard drive to play.

704
00:49:42,922 --> 00:49:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the case with the Japanese game Football Manager 2.

705
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:01,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar!

706
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:02,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar!

707
00:50:32,759 --> 00:50:33,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out.

708
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:45,305
[SPEAKER_05]: There was also, during the DICE Summit that's been going on right now, they've had actually a list of, they were doing their own awards for it, the Game Awards.

709
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:49,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, the winner for Game of the Year this year is going to be God of War.

710
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I remember we went over the nominees a couple weeks ago.

711
00:50:53,008 --> 00:51:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: So God of War won for, and actually God of War won a lot of categories, Console Game of the Year, Game of the Year,

712
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:07,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Outstanding Achievements in Animation and Original Music Composition as well as Sound Design.

713
00:51:08,874 --> 00:51:14,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other nominees that won here actually Outstanding Achievements in Gameplay and Engineering.

714
00:51:15,116 --> 00:51:17,276
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a tie between Nintendogs and Guitar Hero.

715
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:18,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I heard Guitar Hero won a bunch.

716
00:51:18,937 --> 00:51:22,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Design, Guitar Hero won as well as...

717
00:51:23,638 --> 00:51:27,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Soundtrack, Guitar Hero won that one as well, so that's pretty sweet.

718
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:40,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very interesting because Amplitude and Frequency were such wonderful games that, if you think about it, aren't that much different from Guitar Hero, except for the fact that you have a guitar.

719
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:42,546
[SPEAKER_07]: People really loved it.

720
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:52,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Another hot coffee thing that hit the internet was advertising a brand new movie, Running Scared, with Paul Walker.

721
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:59,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this minigame that they have on their website, you would pleasure his wife orally.

722
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:02,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, it was kind of like hot coffee.

723
00:52:02,955 --> 00:52:07,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it got pulled off the site due to its graphic content.

724
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:08,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely.

725
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:09,798
[SPEAKER_05]: So much for that.

726
00:52:10,759 --> 00:52:13,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego Star Wars 2 is actually going to be coming out.

727
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Lego Star Wars 2 Return of the Original Trilogy.

728
00:52:18,723 --> 00:52:18,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

729
00:52:20,313 --> 00:52:21,133
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be pretty sweet.

730
00:52:21,153 --> 00:52:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a bunch of screenshots from it.

731
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:27,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like it's going to be covering the original Trilogy Plus.

732
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:28,577
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have co-op and stuff.

733
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:29,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick poll, please.

734
00:52:29,598 --> 00:52:32,059
[SPEAKER_07]: I have never played a LEGO game in my life.

735
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:33,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Have any of you guys?

736
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,841
[SPEAKER_05]: LEGO Star Wars was pretty sweet, actually.

737
00:52:34,881 --> 00:52:35,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it?

738
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was actually really well done.

739
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:40,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I missed the boat on that one somehow.

740
00:52:40,483 --> 00:52:41,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Worth checking out.

741
00:52:41,104 --> 00:52:45,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, dust off your Dreamcast...

742
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:47,359
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some more games for you for free.

743
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:52,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Marathon has been ported over to the Dreamcast.

744
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:55,282
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to thank Bugged for this one.

745
00:52:55,982 --> 00:53:07,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have the Marathon Trilogy you can download on Dreamcast Evolution or it's dcevolution.net They have links to that where you can make an image to play on there.

746
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:12,589
[SPEAKER_05]: The only catch is you're going to need a Dreamcast keyboard and a controller to play the games.

747
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:14,510
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a fan of Halo...

748
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:20,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreamcast, one of the most horribly underappreciated consoles ever.

749
00:53:22,276 --> 00:53:24,097
[SPEAKER_07]: That right there would sell the game for me.

750
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,598
[SPEAKER_07]: I would buy it just to play as the Burger King.

751
00:53:25,638 --> 00:53:25,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It would.

752
00:53:26,018 --> 00:53:26,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

753
00:53:48,464 --> 00:53:58,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're about ready to wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio, but not until we get one last story from Loki, and this is quite interesting.

754
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,432
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm glad they gave this to me because, you know,

755
00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:12,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Ice Cream Man in the UK was busted for running a counterfeit piracy operation and he'll serve 200 hours of community service for selling fake video games, CDs, and DVDs out of his ice cream van.

756
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:39,114
[SPEAKER_05]: and I believe 4,000 pirated DVDs, CDs, and games were seized during the raid on him.

757
00:54:39,994 --> 00:54:49,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So unfortunately... See, I thought, you know, when I hear ice cream and I think of Sweet Tooth, you know, it'd be a new Twisted Metal game.

758
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:53,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

759
00:54:54,446 --> 00:54:54,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

760
00:54:55,837 --> 00:55:01,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this world come to nowadays when an honest ice cream man has to turn the piracy to make a buck?

761
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:04,220
[SPEAKER_07]: At least it wasn't drugs.

762
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:06,620
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it wasn't drugs.

763
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:08,621
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

764
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:12,542
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done with this week's episode and we're going to say goodnight now.

765
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:14,983
[SPEAKER_07]: First though, a couple quick notes.

766
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I am going on vacation.

767
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:18,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, though.

768
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going on a work leave for my day job.

769
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:24,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will not be back until March 5th.

770
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:25,601
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will be gone.

771
00:55:25,641 --> 00:55:26,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you guys then.

772
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:29,762
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the show itself, stay tuned to the podcast stream.

773
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:36,103
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have something new for you guys up the next couple Sundays, at least in some capacity.

774
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:38,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though, guys?

775
00:55:39,605 --> 00:55:42,546
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing this show every week for the podcast at least.

776
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:47,808
[SPEAKER_07]: No matter what, there's been a new podcast every week for over a year now.

777
00:55:47,908 --> 00:55:51,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we take a little break this once, please forgive us.

778
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we earned it.

779
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:56,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a slow news month anyway until we get to E3 and the GDC.

780
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:58,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you've got to take a break.

781
00:55:58,651 --> 00:55:59,072
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

782
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going for ice cream.

783
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm, ice cream.

784
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:03,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get ice cream.

785
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:08,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's all just take the next five weeks off and just eat ice cream on Sundays instead.

786
00:56:08,735 --> 00:56:09,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Rock on.

787
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:11,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

788
00:56:11,805 --> 00:56:14,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I can't wait to play Full Auto this week.

789
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:15,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to that.

790
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:16,509
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have a review.

791
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,711
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be up on the SUF blog.

792
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:19,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

793
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

794
00:56:21,074 --> 00:56:21,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck getting it to work.

795
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, DarkSakura.

796
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:26,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I want ice cream.

797
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

798
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And reject false icons.

799
00:56:30,382 --> 00:56:33,945
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is, I want ice cream too, I think.

800
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:35,246
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what I really want?

801
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:35,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Is a brownie.

802
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:38,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a brownie with ice cream.

803
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,155
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

804
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, that's it.

805
00:56:43,516 --> 00:56:45,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

806
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:56,199
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the fact that you have taken the opportunity to support an independent podcast and we will continue to provide radio for you until we sell out or die.

807
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:05,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Until next time, this is Rob Roberts for the rest of the folks here at Orange Lounge Radio saying, have a great week.

808
00:57:08,757 --> 00:57:11,318
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

809
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:14,240

812
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:35,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Due to other business commitments in our personal lives, Orange Lounge Radio is going on vacation until March 5th.

813
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:50,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't abandon us though, as the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio will bring to the podcast stream exclusively three special solo shows featuring news and other commentary leading up to our return with episode number 175 on March 5th.

814
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:54,412
[SPEAKER_07]: From the staff here at OLR, thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

815
00:57:54,752 --> 00:57:55,232
[SPEAKER_07]: See you soon!
