4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. It is February 12th, 2006 and this is part B, the second half of episode number 174.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Thank you guys so much for joining us and

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,440
Incentive for you guys to listen live on Sunday nights if you can those you guys out there

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,940
I mean we podcast for a reason we know not everybody can listen live some nights, but Sunday nights when we do do this live

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,960
We play music during the breaks when we do this show and tonight

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,940
We played some pieces in that break from some classic Super Nintendo and Genesis titles

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,560
We played a song from Secret of Mana

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,840
in there one of the songs from the beginning of the game and then we played the emerald hill zone song from Sonic the hedgehog 2

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,320
too and the reason why I'm bringing this up we can't play this stuff on the

13
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,080
podcast because of copyright stuffs but I brought it up because it inspired some

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,600
comments here in our chat room www.orangelanterino.com click on chat

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,880
vxjasonxv who also happens to be our lovely webmaster he listens to he

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,560
says a lot of games just don't have memorable music like this anymore

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,320
catchy but not memorable agree disagree I I can't I don't worry I there is the

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:33,320
It's a rare standout hit, granted, but you know, one Katamari doesn't make up for a lot of, you know, very memorable Super Nintendo games they had back then, you know?

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Genesis.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,320
There was also Space Channel 5.

21
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
True.

22
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,320
Then again, the game was pretty much all music, wasn't it?

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
True. True.

24
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,320
But I mean, I understand what he's saying, is that with a lot of current titles, you either have licensed music, too.

25
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
You play a game like Burnout, everything you're hearing is licensed, same stuff you hear on the radio.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,320
Or, you know, it's not like the same it used to be.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,920
I don't know I I kind of see where he's coming from I kind of agree on that so the same care

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,620
Isn't being put into it. Yeah, I think that when you have limiting

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
limiting circumstances

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,840
When you do something

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
when you do something that

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,760
Excels, you know under those limiting circumstances

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,720
People are going to recognize they're gonna see the effort that went into it

34
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Nowadays, you can make something that sounds really good with minimal effort.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,720
True, so maybe it's harder to stand out above the pack in that case?

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I really think so.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Well anyway, just a little side topic, I just thought that was interesting.

38
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
I love when our chat room inspires conversation here.

39
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
See, we're an interactive show, truly interactive.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,720
www.orangewalk.com, click on chat if you want to interact with us.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,720
We'll open up the Skype line a little later in the show, hopefully we have some time,

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,720
and of course there's always ye olde mailbag.

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,860
Anyway, we were talking about game music. Now, one game that had at least a great

44
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,280
intro song, if not a really good soundtrack, all together was Halo 2.

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,160
But sometimes the other soundtrack that you're hearing when you play on Xbox

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Live ain't so great, right, Loki?

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,120
Exactly. There was a profanity study done this week

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,960
for Halo 2, and I love the way that they intro this.

49
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,560
What exactly is a profanity study? It's studying the frequency of profanity in

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,480
Halo 2

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,480
during online games. Anyways, I love the way they intro this. It's basically, when you

52
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,160
log into Xbox Live, more often than not, you're greeted by a 14 year old that learned a new

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:32,160
word on the playground that day. It's great. Anyways, this study, here's what they've basically

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,540
come up with over the course of 33.9 hours. Anyways, the number one word, of course, that

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:47,760
word of course that appeared would have been fuck with 43% of the time with an

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:59,640
average of 8 and 8.11 uses per hour that's it total per the 33.9 hours would

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,260
have been 275 uses of the word fuck fucking or the rocker etc ok the number

58
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,700
Number 2 being shit or you know something to that extent.

59
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,060
Of course some of the other colorful language that was in there, 9% of them were racial

60
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:27,100
slurs, 7% of them were sexual slurs including you know, I wanna fuck your mom, that type

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
of stuff.

62
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,300
Wait a minute, does I wanna fuck your mom count as the usage of the word fuck or a sexual

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,220
usage of the word?

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,060
Well basically uh sexual it says sexual phrases which were not homosexual fuck was not included

65
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,000
in this unless it was directed at a person i.e. your mom so how how many times did frack

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,380
appear that's what i want to know i don't know that's how they do it on tv seven percent

67
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:59,540
of them were homosexual references in other words you're gay you suck you homo um number

68
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,300
damn appear three percent of the time, bitch seven percent of the time, and ass five percent

69
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,300
of the time, you know, being asshole and assbag, asshat, et cetera. And they actually...

70
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,380
I know why you wanted to do this story tonight. You just wanted an excuse to say assbag and

71
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,340
sound professional. Hey, assbag? Come on, what the hell was that?

72
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,660
a dirty job at something. Overall in the course of the, like I said, the period of the study,

73
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,660
shit was used 121 times, followed by, you know, ass at 35 times, and then of course,

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,260
you know, racial slurs, etc. But it's very interesting that they actually broke it all

75
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:52,260
down three at a time. So, yes, you know, game experiences may differ during online play.

76
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,820
That I guess does make sense now.

77
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,820
I prefer Oh Poopy.

78
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,460
Well thank you very much Loki for earning this episode an explicit tag!

79
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,460
Good job!

80
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Woooo!

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,300
Cause, you know, I'm gonna pwn you, you fucking noob.

82
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,260
Now wait, wait, remind me, okay, before you say all these words again, what was the point

83
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
of this study?

84
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,380
Again, just basically the point- Scat's Whores or what?

85
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,420
Like just, I was curious how many times people really do say fuck.

86
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,880
Is basically it was that the rating they're trying to kind of I

87
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,040
Guess bring this to light, you know, all these stupid people are on Xbox Live and stuff and kind of that

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,040
You know, maybe that they should

89
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,280
This isn't exactly a plea, you know for the government to crack down or tighten and control and gaming industry. It's just basically

90
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,560
Information that parents can educate themselves with that. This is how much you know

91
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,880
fucking language they're going to hear during the course of Halo 2.

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,440
Interesting. Which is why Halo 2 is the number one Xbox Live game.

93
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,120
How much more do they hear in their house? I don't know.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,280
I like this. Tweek in our chat room says, Asshat is my Xbox's name.

95
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,880
Well good for you buddy.

96
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,080
Dan's Halo team was called Badass Ninjas

97
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,760
but it was AZZ. Interesting. Oh let's see here.

98
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,400
alright I don't know alright anyway

99
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,800
fine great study hooray hooray alright let's go to a more serious halo 2

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
related article shall we

101
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Jamie for the love of God please save us

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,760
try not to use ass bag in your story well

103
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,840
about ass 2 on PC

104
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,560
stop it okay halo 2 on PC according to xbox.com

105
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,560
xbox

106
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:51,560
The Xbox game, uh, Halo 2 is being put on PC, but there's a hitch on that one, that it's not for Windows XP, but for Windows Vista.

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,560
So, uh, you'll be able to do playing on that one, uh, well, next month, I suppose.

108
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,560
In other words, uh, buy Windows Vista, please. Here's an excuse to upgrade to Windows Vista.

109
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,560
So you can freakin' play Halo 2, which really would be better if you had an Xbox anyway.

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,520
Being half the computers right now anyways, can't run Windows Vista's default theme.

111
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Sad. SAD!

112
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
Microsoft is not learning anything!

113
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
You know where our chat room is going with this now?

114
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,780
I'm back on the swearing thing, but this is, you know, this is a good indication by our chat room here.

115
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,740
They're bringing up, have you guys ever seen that video on the internet of the kid?

116
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,820
And I don't know if it was staged or not. People say it's legit, but whatever.

117
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,420
Some kid is playing on Xbox live and he left his voice chat on or whatever and you can hear him yelling at his mom

118
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,780
And people are quoting it in our chat room right now

119
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,140
Let's see

120
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,380
It looks like SSJ 100 Matt and fire bomb are going back a little a little bit back and forth and chair over there mom

121
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,060
I want my fucking chocolate milk. You promised me you bitch

122
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,420
I'm gonna climb the hatch you said I could get whatever I wanted and I said chocolate milk

123
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,460
But now I want Mountain Dew have you ever heard that? Oh my gosh. It's so

124
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,220
sad I don't know how else to describe it. I've heard children talking to their

125
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,540
parents this way though. That's crazy. Anyway, I just had to bring that because it made me think of that and those

126
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,180
guys are on it too. Anyway, let's talk about something pure and wholesome and

127
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,700
good in the world like Oprah. Okay, maybe that's a controversial subject and you're

128
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,780
probably wondering what in the hell does Oprah have to do with gaming? Is she gonna

129
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,700
have video games on her show no not yet but who knows because Nintendo has their

130
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,620
sights on Oprah this was Reggie Phil's aim speaking at DICE he said that

131
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,980
Nintendo is considering using new marketing outlets such as Oprah and

132
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,340
Ellen he said a quote blue ocean of opportunity through new types of

133
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,260
gameplay end quote so obviously Nintendo's trying to attract a whole new

134
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,860
set of gamers here and I think we've kind of seen this in the early releases

135
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,020
for the revolution I seem to remember them saying well this controller looks

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,420
like a TV remote everybody's used the TV remote so we're trying to expand to a

137
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,780
whole new base of gamers you can see that Nintendo is being very aggressive

138
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,380
with this stuff also he went on to point out that Nintendogs was a great success

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:23,740
brain training in Japan sold 2.5 million by the way brain age train your brain in

140
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,860
minutes a day is coming out here on April 17th I'm very interested to check

141
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,420
this out so very interesting there on how Nintendo's being aggressive there

142
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,300
with their marketing they don't they feel I guess not enough moms are playing

143
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:49,340
you know the Nintendo systems I suppose not all right that'd be great mom why

144

155
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,260
Well, there's been a

156
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:56,860
a bit of a talk going around about how games are being marketed but there's been this obsession

157
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,040
going around with basically making them all cinematic that game pitches are being done

158
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,060
like you know like it's like this movie or it's like this movie and then you know they've

159
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,380
got to go out and use a different media to market the games you know you sit and watch

160
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,720
you'd be watching a movie trailer at the theater and you get a game thing up

161
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,800
there like I'm not watching movie I'm watching a video game ad you know

162
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:34,040
there's actually a a quote out here by a as his last name pronounced J for Joff

163
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,960
David Joff who was the creator of God of War mm-hmm but he's basically putting

164
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,960
down the video game industry to imitate Hollywood movies and not offer you know

165
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,560
the decent wages that you find amongst the Hollywood industry because the games

166
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,320
are being marketed just the same way so are they saying they're not saying games

167
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,440
are like porn take that literally but they're saying games is like how porn is

168
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,200
viewed in the entertainment industry is that what I mean okay interesting good I

169
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,320
was kind of wondering if this is going back to the resin trans vibrator thing

170
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,040
again no I have a story on that coming up later awesome but I love this quote

171
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,540
here was referring to the tie-in with Peter Jackson's King Kong and this is a

172
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,920
quote a lot of reviews praise King Kong's lack of HUD but what what's wrong

173
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,920
with an HUD what's wrong with a health bar that raises good to the player when

174
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,960
he replenishes it and why are we applauding the in the press for been

175
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,360
abandoning the native language of video games there's also another quote here

176
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,540
I'm about the obsession with cinema and he admitted I am guilty of that as well because God of War was inspired by Raiders of

177
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,440
The Lost Ark

178
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:44,940
however

179
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,900
he explained he wanted the game to give players the experience of watching Indiana Jones as a ten-year-old rather than being Indiana Jones themselves and

180
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,020
Now this is where the porn industry thing ties in another quote

181
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,900
It's like the porn industry sort of I read about this guy who had this topless review that he's trying to add art to and

182
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,000
It's bombing maybe games fall into that slot some days

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,740
I think games can be something else the next great entertainment media and then days

184
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,000
I feel like it's just like porn or motion rides where there's no capability to reach high emotional levels

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
Wow

186
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
That's a very interesting quote

187
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,320
And I have to sit on I don't have an immediate reaction

188
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,080
I don't have to sit on that sit on that one and think about it for a little bit there games

189
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,360
So that's how games are like porn is that when you try to be artsy with porn people don't buy into it

190
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
hmm

191
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,420
You know, he also said you have to wonder what would happen if we had more people with creative sensibilities

192
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,020
If more games had a soul had something to say something that resonates

193
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,260
He also was a resentful over the fact that people that create games receive

194
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,800
You know pretty meager wages compared to how Hollywood directors and screenplays receive

195
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,640
He said I'm really frustrated with the way the industry is structured. There is a sense of kind of being exploited

196
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,540
It's an industry problem, but he has of course no intention to leave the industry

197
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,540
He said if Sony came to me and told me we're making God of War 2 I might have to decline

198
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,780
He said before admitting I can stand up here and say I I won't do it until they kick me out. I'm not going anywhere

199
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,580
Huh, but you know, but I you know my whole thing with that is you know, like I'd said earlier not only is it that

200
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,260
We're seeing the same type of standard in video games. That's expected, you know, if movies were seeing them marketed the same way to

201
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,260
You know

202
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,500
Right up along there with your feature flick. You've got the game to go with it

203
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,300
You have other games being marketed in the same genre. Why aren't they getting the same type of of?

204
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,640
You know pay that anyone in the cinematic industry would receive

205
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,880
Interesting I don't I don't have an easy answer for that right now. It gives us something to think about though

206
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
I'm curious what the chat room thinks about that

207
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,700
Orange loves radio.com click on chat. Maybe we'll get some Skype calls about that later. I don't know

208
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,380
Thank you for that story. That was a good one

209
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,060
Alright let's move on and talk about Sony. In part 8 tonight we talked a lot about the

210
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,180
DS and Xbox and stuff but we didn't

211
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,580
talk a whole lot about Sony so Loki save the day here give us some Sony news.

212
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,540
Okay basically one of the first things we have is

213
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,220
could the PlayStation 3 kill Sony because if you think about it this thing is taking

214
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
forever to come out

215
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,540
so you kinda have to look at it a little bit. One of the things that's being brought up

216
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,900
is you know the approach where they're taking it this is an

217
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,540
all media platform type thing it's like you can play videos on it you can

218
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,180
you know look at your pictures browse the internet yeah but what about the

219
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,340
games the games it's a gaming system game should be first

220
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,380
you know let's not focus on it being a blu-ray player but

221
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,780
you know seriously the other thing is it slices it dices what is the cost of this

222
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,260
console going to be I mean

223
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,780
they're saying oh it might be you know four hundred dollars could be five

224
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,980
hundred dollars I mean

225
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,300
people don't have that kind of money to drop on these console systems like that

226
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,020
Plus, you know, with Blu-ray coming out and stuff, not many people

227
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,740
feel the need that they need Blu-ray because you're not going to see a big

228
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,420
difference unless you own a high-def TV and only 24 percent of the market out there

229
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,780
owns a high-def TV, so who cares?

230
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,060
I think that number's going to increase though, certainly, throughout the next few years.

231
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:15,500
Oh yeah, it will, but I agree. Sony needs to drop the price hint already, so people stop

232
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,420
theorizing about this, and Game Developers Conference would be a good time to do that hint-hint,

233
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,500
but we all know we're gonna be waiting until E3 to see the real meat of this.

234
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,860
The other thing is, and I think this is probably gonna change right now,

235
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,660
that we haven't really seen much in games right now, nothing's really been finished,

236
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,900
and just right now I think the whole point is everyone's starting, you know, to kinda,

237
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,180
you know, think all doom and gloom about the PS3 because they don't know anything yet.

238
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,060
So, you know, they figured that the lack of information is a bad sign that the system

239
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,960
isn't going to be ready or it's going to be launched too high they're not going

240
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,660
to launch the system for like seven hundred dollars because that'd be

241
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,980
ridiculous and the fact that it's also supposed to be like you know a DVR as

242
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,020
well is it though people are paying that on eBay for Xbox 360 so we're is that a

243
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,860
crazy price point it is a crazy price point I think so too but I'm just saying

244
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,620
they're people will pay it yeah people pay if that's you know over retail

245
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,460
whether you be charging for these if there's a shortage Oh $2,000 there you

246
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,460
go but I don't know I think that they need to come out with some information

247
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,140
that's for sure sooner the better well is it possible there might be any shows

248
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,820
coming up where we could see some of this information there is actually at

249
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:36,020
the TGS show not the Tokyo game show but the Taipei game show 2006 Sony will be

250
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,460
showcasing their next-gen console featuring numerous booths 80 booths

251
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,300
actually, um, covering all the games, um, they're gonna be coming out, and, uh, 20 of

252
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,380
them exclusively for the PS3, so.

253
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,180
I don't, I think, I think it's just gonna be recycled stuff.

254
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,180
I really don't, yeah, I, you would, why would they announce something new at this show?

255
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,620
Except, no, the new thing added is going to be the, uh, Boomerang competition using the

256
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,620
controller.

257
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,580
Boomerang controller has been redesigned, actually, so, there was an article put out

258
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,860
by, um, I believe that there was some gaming group that got to, um, test out the PS3 and

259
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,600
three of the games that have been made so far on the dev console obviously and the controller

260
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,320
being used does not look like a boomerang so interesting okay they're basing it more

261
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,600
around the dualshock type of thing good because dualshock were if it ain't broke why fix it

262
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,840
well it could be an ergonomic dualshock obviously the boomerang of death is probably not gonna

263
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,760
be the controller all right and even if it was the boomerang of death that was the controller

264
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,620
third-party people are gonna make a dualshock looking one anyway so you can always buy that

265
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:46,140
about prices Sephiroth1215 in our chat. Remember back when PS1 was like $500?

266
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,660
People paid that when that first came out.

267
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,300
It would be insanely stupid for the PS3 to be $700.

268
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,060
It's murder for their system right there.

269
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,500
Alright.

270
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,340
Okay, we'll go ahead and move on here, get into another story.

271
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,380
Actually, it kind of relates to the PlayStation 3. It's just a real brief thing I have here.

272
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,780
Activision has revealed that they will be releasing

273
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,060
three titles at launch for the Sony console and of course one game for the

274
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,220
revolution as well.

275
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,460
As far as what games those are, well that we don't know.

276
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,740
For whatever reason those are being kept well under wraps. I would say

277
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,420
everybody's holding on to it so they can now blow their load at E3.

278
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,840
I think E3 is going to be an avalanche of information.

279
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,940
You know if it's not that

280
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,460
it's gonna be murder for the publicity of the systems

281
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,580
I mean there's so much hype around this year's E3 with these two systems

282
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:46,700
Revolution and PS3 that both companies better be prepared to

283
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,460
lay it all out on the table I think yeah so

284
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,340
this is interesting because the article on this site or that this ran on here

285
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,500
gamersreports.com where we found this says you can guarantee that one of these

286
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,100
games will be Tony Hawk something

287
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,420
and certainly that would make sense. A new Tony Hawk game on

288
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,780
PS3 at launch. Successful series, why not?

289
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,300
Good theory. Alrighty, what else

290
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,740
might the PS3 bring us, Loki? Hopefully lots of violent games.

291
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,900
I know Grand Theft Auto IV is going to be for the PS3, but

292
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,500
one of the things that we've been actually seeing, there was a

293
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,220
British, or yesterday,

294
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,660
actually at the British Embassy in Tokyo, there was a seminar on British gaming

295
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,460
and

296
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,340
demonstrated how the powerful graphics of the PS3

297
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,900
can display lots of violence.

298
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,220
Oh yes, from headshots to

299
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,540
body shots, they had basically

300
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,620
this developer, they were kinda showing off

301
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,620
how, you know, realistic the physics can be in this.

302
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,260
One of the things that they showed was, you know, the meat of being stripped off the bones

303
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:10,100
as a bullet penetrates a body, and just, you know, the ripping off of flesh.

304
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Ew!

305
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Awesome!

306
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
That's great.

307
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:20,320
But, I mean, honestly, this is a duh for me, because as graphics get better, so will the

308
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
detail of violence.

309
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,460
And you know what else is gonna get better?

310
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,620
The tits and ass will be more realistic as well.

311
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:35,820
duh sorry but you know they need to come out of the game tits and ass headshot

314
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,140

318
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,940
this week other than being an anally retentive asshole um oh did I say that

319
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,780
on air the views and opinions expressed on Orange Lounge radio do not necessarily

320
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,500
reflect those of the staff but are of the individuals themselves nice

321
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,260
disclaimer. You're welcome. I applaud you. I came up with that laptop in my head, based on what I'd seen in movies. Good.

322
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:37,500
Alright. Jackie P. Robano. Robano? Yeah. Why? What does he have to do with games? You do know we're a video game show, right? Because he's one of

323
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:48,900
Elevation's key investors. Elevation Partners. Oh. Because they're trying to obtain Take Two. Oh, okay. So Jack Thompson hates Take Two. Bono wants to buy

324
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,860
somebody who's got a do okay okay so what do you say in the letter do we know

325
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,140
dear Bono the letter begins I write you as a fellow brother in Jesus Christ

326
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,460
appreciative of your bold witness to the transforming truth of the gospel in both

327
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,420
your words and your deeds I write to encourage you respectfully and in the

328
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,340
spirit of brotherly love not to purchase take to interactive software incorporated

329
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,100
all right my brain is burning it's because you're going to hell that's okay

330
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,320
We all got our spot. I think you should have ro bono went, you know in the name of love

331
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Don't forget it

332
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,780
You know what the the whole terminology there. I I admit

333
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,660
That it's I think that it's just a very

334
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,080
Poorly masked attempt to as

335
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,700
I obviously

336
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,940
Well, besides the get publicity thing, to try to use religion as a front for his own

337
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,820
personal agenda, which I find horribly insulting.

338
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Yeah.

339
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,620
And if you're a religious person, you should probably find this insulting too, I think.

340
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,940
Well, he's also said in the letter that Take Two is lied to the investment community in

341
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,160
its latest SEC filing and wards that ongoing criminal investigations have put the publisher's

342
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,420
very survival at risk despite the fraudulent assertations in the recent

343
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:15,760
SEC filing that they are all without merit you know first of all if he had

344
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,540
done any actual research into this he would realize that he doesn't have

345
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,980
grounds to stand on it's it's documented with the Department of Justice there is

346
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,780
not an epidemic the only reason there's an there's anyone's thinking there's an

347
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,800
epidemic is because of people like him in other words Jackie boo shut up sit

348
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,780
down shut up you know he needs to just you know cry me a river build a bridge

349
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,380
and get over it all right and Loki did you want to look into did he ever get

350
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,540
our flowers I mean I know they weren't our flowers but we helped and our name

351
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,780
was on the little signature of the letter yes it was the host orange lounge

352
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,340
radio do you ever get those day ever get those flowers yes he didn't forward him

353
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:03,140
on to the offices of what was it rock star and I believe the attorneys

354
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,540
representing rock stars I'll bet he never even looked at him yeah even take

355
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,980
a minute to smell the flowers they were pretty did he well that's good they were

356
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:18,300
pretty that's good and he basically called it harassment you know this is

357
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,100
this harassment of me I'll follow stick to and blank Rome's lead in

358
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:31,180
in characterizing me in the media and in an Alabama's courthouse as variously a bisexual

359
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:35,340
pedophile, mentally ill, paranoid, and so forth.

360
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,340
Yeah, because I believe that's what the letter said at all.

361
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,740
Anyways, what a dumbass.

362
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,020
How is sending flowers harassment?

363
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,140
Ordering pizza to somebody else, that's harassment.

364
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
That's not what happened here.

365
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,800
point of this thing was to do something that was non-harassing because there are

366
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,460
a lot of people that have chosen to respond immaturely to Jack Thompson and

367
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,240
this was supposed to be the ante of that so he completely missed the point and

368
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,760
actually I think that the heart of the point was to still get the point across

369
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,680
right that we're really sick of him he basically here it is here it is my like

370
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,500
My mom always said and I'm sure you guys and Europe brings her this a lot to kill him with kindness

371
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,060
Exactly. Maybe we should send him a puppy. He said right. He said that the flowers were sent

372
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,580
to harass him and

373
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,880
He sent them, you know to them to basically they're forwarded in a memory of the innocence that each of you three men

374
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
help kill is

375
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Jack Thompson put

376
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,600
And, uh, so it's forwarded in the memory of these victims, um, who, whose killers have

377
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,120
yet, I wanna know how many people he thinks have actually been killed by Grand Theft Auto

378
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,980
and how many of these people actually, you know, cause if there's like three people he's

379
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,220
talking about here, and how many millions of people have played this game, I would say

380
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:09,220
that's a pretty small number, I mean, that obviously would, you know, cause if everybody

381
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,820
was you know learning to kill from these games wouldn't there be millions and

382
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,940
millions of killers out there all right if I can't send him a puppy Ross makes a

383
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,700
good point but I can't send my puppy because the moment the puppy tried to

384
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,220
bite him he'd have the puppy locked up and then put to death poor puppy I knows

385
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,700
we don't send him any puppies I'm sorry no I really don't want to talk about

386
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,580
Jackie all right fine I really do I'm actually seriously thinking about and

387
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,500
compiling the statistical data myself and writing him a letter sweet because

388
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:42,340
you know when I write a letter to anybody I put statistical data to back up every damn

389
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
thing I say.

390
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,700
Well I'm curious now with this whole you know activism thing what what's next for the flowers

391
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,260
for Jack's Jack folks I mean you know they they created a huge thing here well they've

392
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,420
been arguing back and forth with Jack Thompson over email looks like it says get over your

393
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,100
Jack Thompson obsession this is not about me it's about rock stars sale of murder simulators

394
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,840
to children.

395
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,560
We should encourage the parents to do their job.

396
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,800
I hope to god that the next Grand Theft Auto game that comes out is Grand Theft Auto Murder

397
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,720
Simulator for Children.

398
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Alright, what's the website?

399
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,120
Didn't the Flowerster Jack folks get so big they had to make their own new website?

400
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
I believe it's pixelantination.com.

401
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,960
And of course pixelanti was a term that Jackiepoo coined.

402
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
So cute.

403
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
Alright, so keep tabs on that and we'll be keeping an eye on it too to see what they

404
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
do next.

405
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,840
We like not to talk about him each week, you know, I know it's news. All right

406
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,320
You know gosh talking about that stuff always gets me in a foul mood

407
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
Doesn't it get you in a bad mood too? Grr

408
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
so

409
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
You know what that means.

410
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
My FU of the Week time, Dr. Sakura.

411
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:08,960
My FU of the Week goes to San Francisco traffic for sucking out the soul that was sitting within me happily after leaving the Kintetsu Mall.

412
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Yesterday I went with my friend Becky to the Rosicrucian Museum in San Jose to go look at the Egyptian exhibit.

413
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,960
And then we went on to San Francisco to go shopping and look for Japanesey stuff.

414
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,960
And after we were done with the shopping, we decided we were going to go find somewhere to eat and I got lost.

415
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,960
Well, I didn't really get lost. The streets there make no sense because you'd be going down the road and all of a sudden,

416
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,600
all of a sudden oh we're gonna split off here and not make any type of real sense in how we go.

417
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,360
So I finally got turned around and got back up and made my way back to mission which I knew would

418
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,400
lead me to Van Ness and we were going up Van Ness going you know what let's see the Hard Rock Cafe

419
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,560
because as far as she remembered it was on Van Ness. It wasn't! So we're like oh crap we don't

420
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:07,180
don't see it anywhere so we so we headed back to go to to the Fisherman's Wharf

421
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,300
we were gonna try to eat a bubblegum so there's a two and a half hour wait yeah

422
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,580
I know and then we found the Hard Rock Cafe had been moved there so we're like

423
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,780
great so after us saying out of spite we were not gonna eat the Hard Rock Cafe we

424
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:25,780
ate here anyway it was really yummy and to also make a little follow-up to a

425
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,780
previous F.U. I am in good health today, shut up!

426
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I know what you're talking about. Yes.

427
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Alright. Alright, moving on. Uh

428
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Loki. I got nothing, I'm not really, there's not been

429
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,780
anything actually. What if I threw a book at your head? What if I give you something to be pissed off about?

430
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Okay. Somebody step on Loki's foot.

431
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,780
Fine, you'll stay. You need to get more creative next time.

432
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I didn't want to make anything stupid-sounding, like you usually do.

433
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,780
Yes, exactly.

434
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,780
My F.U.

435
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,780
Oh, yes?

436
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
The Ferret has an F.U.

437
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
Oh, sure, what's that?

438
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,780
I don't even know if the mics are picking that up anymore.

439
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,780
We'll see.

440
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,780
Moving on.

441
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,780
My F.U. the week goes to the fact that I'm not going to be here for two weeks.

442
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,780
That kind of stinks.

443
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,780
You know, it's for my day job, and I like my day job and all, and getting out of town

444
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:21,780
once in a while on the company dollars is cool and all, and I get to go teach, which

445
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,780
is what I love to do.

446
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,780
But it still sucks because, you know, I have to put other stuff I like to do, such as this, on hold.

447
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,280
So, that bites.

448
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:33,280
So, an F-you to that frustration feeling that comes with that.

449
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
Grr.

450
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,280
And an F-you to the fact that I probably won't really get to play games while I'm out there.

451
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
I'm gonna fall behind on this game, I'll be able to read websites and stuff, but...

452
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,780
My laptop that I'm taking is not that hot, unless I convince Xtuber to let me borrow his.

453
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:51,780
Um, and, uh, you know, I won't get to play World of Warcraft, I won't get to play Xbox, or PlayStation, or any of that stuff.

454
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:58,060
I mean I could always rent the Jamie's Cradling her laptop. No, I know I know you won't give up the precious but um, I

455
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,780
Could always rent Nintendo 64 games in the hotel room the last hotel I stayed at

456
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:08,020
You know that last Hilton I stayed at had that you should take your and your PSC

457
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm I I'll probably take the DS. Yeah, I probably will. You know, I I originally can chat with us on animal crossing

458
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,740
Yeah

459
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
really good games coming out for the SNL.

460
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,940
But anyway, I'll probably do that stuff.

461
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,540
Jackie P's Stalker on CS.

462
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,140
They do have free Wi-Fi, so maybe I'll actually get back into Animal Crossing.

463
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,460
Anyway, let's get back to the show. I feel better now that I've vented.

464
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,340
I paid off my last loan, by the way. Not my very last loan, but I've got my second room now.

465
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,100
My second downstairs room.

466
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,900
Yep, me too.

467
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,780
Eight hundred and forty-five thousand bells!

468
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,820
That's a lot of fish.

469
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,140
Oh no, I've been using fruit.

470
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Alright.

471
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,140
Fruit.

472
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,140
I have 100,000.

473
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,140
And selling furniture.

474
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Bells and fruit.

475
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Alright.

476
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,980
Let's talk about, we've talked a lot about DS, let's talk about the PSP now.

477
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,540
Matt, you have a lot of stuff in regards to the PSP, right?

478
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,900
Yeah, there's lots of stuff going on with the PSP.

479
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,820
Wonderful franchises making their way over in homebrew stuff and, yeah, yeah.

480
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:11,860
Anyways, first of course, Tekken is coming to the PSP, so that'd be great, except we

481
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,360
don't know if it's going to be a new Tekken fighting game, which it probably will be,

482
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,400
something crappy like death by degrees you know so anyways I'm looking forward

483
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,480
to that another thing if you missed out on nintendogs you might get your

484
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,200
chance with the dog happy life it's actually a nintendog like game and you

485
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,640
can you know customize your dog's room and so on and so forth teach it stuff so

486
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,840
that'd be pretty cool and actually no it'd be interesting I'm not sure if they

487
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:50,240
have this, but since they do have the mic, which you can use for the PSP, maybe you can

488
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,760
actually train your dog via voice, voice recognition or something, that would be pretty cool.

489
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,600
No word on that, but one can speculate.

490
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,600
So that would be pretty cool.

491
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,800
And that's scheduled to be released in Japan on the 27th of April, so check that out.

492
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,860
And of course, if you are in the free stuff, there's a nice little transport tycoon clone

493
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:22,140
out there called OpenTTD and it's actually available for download on PSP updates, it

494
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,460
looks pretty sweet so, you know, pretty cool if you're looking for some free stuff.

495
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,620
The other thing, if you're looking for another free game, you might remember this back in

496
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:35,380
the days of shareware, Jazz the Jackrabbit's made its way onto the PSP.

497
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Jazz Jackrabbit!

498
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,380
That's so cool!

499
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,740
yes sonic ripoff sonic ripoff with guns

500
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,620
see so actually you can think of maybe saying shadow the hedgehog ripped off

501
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,820
of jazz jackrabbit

502
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,020
at I'm so that's another thing that's available right now

503
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,580
as well for the PSP so pretty cool also available on a PC updates

504
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:02,300
I'm so I'm by the way those you guys with PSP's

505
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,980
you should be visiting OLR PSP dot com that sites pretty cool

506
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,780
Loki, you're gonna do something nice for the folks at OLRPSP.com.

507
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,880
You need to give them some updates, some new wallpaper or something.

508
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,080
We need to do something for the folks there.

509
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,380
I've been working on stuff.

510
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,880
Alright.

511
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
I mean, unfortunately, you know, time constraints.

512
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,680
We just did a photoshoot.

513
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,480
We need folks to be able to put our ugly faces on their PSPs.

514
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
No.

515
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,480
No.

516
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:23,980
No?

517
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:24,880
No.

518
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
They can have pictures of you and Loki, but not me.

519
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,380
Why?

520
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,180
I'm mysterious.

521
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,880
They have the album art already.

522
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,380
Somebody could probably alter that.

523
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,380
You look cute in the pictures.

524
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:33,880
I do not.

525
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Don't, don't stop.

526
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,180
You-

527
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:39,580
Guys, send... I look cute all the time. Fanbo... there you go, there you go.

528
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,900
I was like, Fanboy, send Dark Soccer SME an email saying you want PSP wallpaper.

529
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,340
I do not need validation. You... I'm married.

530
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,420
Alright. My husband says I'm hot all the time. Yes, but you need to get used to this

531
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,020
whole, you know, internet thing. Alright, well, whatever. You know, I've been reading

532
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,860
one of Margaret Cho's books, and reading about

533
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,300
what it's like to be a celebrity when you don't expect yourself to be one.

534
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,820
Right. I'm like, oh my god, that sort of happens to me sometimes.

535
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,820
please understand we're not talk we know we we're grounded here we realize we're

536
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,460
not like super celebrities but there is still a teensy bit of recognition that

537
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,500
comes with us a teensy bit I don't expect to say oh I've listened to you

538
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,380
like I found I don't even remember who was I was talking to I was just um on a

539
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,380
message board somewhere and so this oh is that you yeah and actually two of my

540
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,860
friends from college found me through our website Wow see that's crazy I don't

541
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:36,460
like, what the hell? Hey, it's great though, we love it, we love it.

542
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,660
But do remember guys, A, this isn't our day job, B,

543
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,300
you know, we do this because we love games and talk about them. I joke all the time

544
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,260
about being an internet celebrity but

545
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:50,580
it's sort of true. But you're grounded with that, you don't really

546
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,860
think. You don't have delusions of grandeur. I go to work,

547
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,300
I go to school, and I go to the gym.

548
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,820
You know, I play my video games and I come talk about it and it just happens to be

549
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,580
be that people all over the world listen to me.

550
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,020
No big thing.

551
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,540
No big whoop, no big whoop, all right.

552
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,580
Five, five, five, four, four, four, four.

553
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,380
Moving on, I got a story on something

554
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,380
we love to play a lot of, and that's sexy games.

555
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,460
Sexy games, one up.

556
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,700
Oh, don't gurry, you're gonna squee at some of this.

557
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,100
This is some good stuff here, all right.

558
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,140
OneUp.com ran an article this week,

559
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,780
and it's actually kind of a spinoff of something

560
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,060
they ran in original PlayStation Magazine.

561
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,900
The Secret History of Video Game Sex.

562
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,260
And they hit on some of the high points

563
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,660
of sex in gaming in history.

564
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,400
And so they have this cute little timeline.

565
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,420
It's available on 1UP.com that starts off

566
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,860
with Custer's Revenge in 1982,

567
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,340
of course being one of the most memorable porno games

568
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,980
on Atari 2600.

569
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,620
And not only porno, but you know, racist and violent,

570
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,080
like all wrapped into one.

571
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,160
I mean, this is your X-rated game if there ever was one.

572
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,660
There will never be anything like it again,

573
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:05,500
for damn sure. Was Custer's Revenge even really sold anywhere? Maybe 10 copies were made and

574
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,420
one of them got on the internet and now it's this big cult phenomenon? We'll see. River

575
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,260
City Ransom they put in their list because it had the first pixelated butt because remember

576
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:24,400
when they went to the sauna? You can see the little butt. To its defense, River City Ransom

577
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,600
was actually a Japanese game called Hot-Blooded Downtown Story

578
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,840
where you went, instead of going to the little shops, they actually said,

579
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,720
you know, did all the really cute stuff, and you did go to a bathhouse.

580
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,360
Yeah, but it's more, you know, it's a cultural thing in that case where it's, you know,

581
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,520
but for us here in America that was a bit of a, oh my gosh,

582
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,280
booty! Tomb Raider in 96,

583
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,240
Lara Croft, enough said, Metal Gear Solid in 98 is

584
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,960
cited for Merrill,

585
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,740
because she walks around in her underwear if you go interrupt her changing clothes

586
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,700
yeah alright and moving on the list of course she should also say she's more

587
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,820
comfortable with her desert eagle than with her bra

588
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,060
dead or alive enough said there

589
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,380
is cited bouncy boobs fear effect 2

590
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,300
retro helix because it's got sexy protagonists who are

591
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,660
lovers a little bit of lesbianism

592
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,200
Res in 2001 is cited for a certain peripheral that came with this game.

593
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,420
It's very hard to find now, but it's called the Trance Vibrator, and trust me, when they

594
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,940
developed it, they weren't thinking of the uses that some people have come up for with

595
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
this.

596
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,940
Enough said.

597
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
The article was hilarious.

598
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,940
Enough said.

599
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,140
BMX XXX in 2002 is cited.

600
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,140
I own that game.

601
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,120
I played this game because you had it, and it was actually a very fun game.

602
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:54,520
It's like Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX, it's a really cool game though, but it does have strippers

603
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,640
and naked people in it, so it's got that as well, so check it out.

604
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,720
It takes forever to get the boobs on the bike.

605
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,680
It doesn't take very long to get the stripper cutscenes though, there's just these random

606
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,860
stripper cutscenes inserted in the game, that you can get pretty soon, but anyway.

607
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:17,800
Also on the list here of 1UP.com's Secret History of Video Game Sex, Leisure Suit Larry

608
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,840
from 2004 enough said although I kind of curious why they didn't cite the earlier

609
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:29,500
games but whatever blood rain simply for the fact that she ended up being in that

610
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,620
Playboy spread that you know virtual girl topless thing Grand Theft Auto San

611
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:42,720
Andreas hot coffee yeah Playboy the mansion that game was cited here on the

612
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,380
list here and God of War in 2005 because of course you know he had some you know

613
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:55,440
boob stuff too and lastly UMD pornography making their list here of the

614
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,060
steamy side of gaming's past. I'm looking here in the chat room to see some of the

615
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,260
points that folks are saying here looks like a lot of talk a lot of people are

616
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,740
talking about bubble bath babes where's bubble bath babes from the list?

617
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:15,540
game sucked all right and then people are talking about hacking your NES roms

618
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,700
to give nudity in the games a lot of those are stupid though like you know

619
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:25,060
super nude brothers I mean lame I'll never forget the one that was on it was

620
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,860
a game that was never released here but in Japan they had an old old old NES

621
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,460
title called nuts and milk was in his name of the game well somebody hacked

622
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,580
this ROM and you know I just fill in the blank you know what they did in this

623
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:43,300
game okay the end that's excellent

624
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:49,660

00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,060
for more information on how you can interact with our show head on over to

627
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,200
orange launch radio comm and click on interact with us or you can always give

628
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,420
us a call it's nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven but remember that is

629
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,380
a toll call if you're outside the Sacramento area, which I imagine most of you are. So

630
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:16,060
ask mommy or daddy if you don't own your phone line. But Jamie, first you have a story for

631
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:25,100
us. New cost porn. Really? No. Oh. Quantic Dream has canned InfraWorld. It's been pretty

632
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:32,600
much tossed in the garbage, kicked out to the road. Bye. In an interview with the German

633
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,920
website working title William Dave Fonda mere I suppose I pronounce that right

634
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,080
said infra-world at date this canceled the concept did not appeal to publishers

635
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:49,280
they did say that on the cron 2 which was given the same it was announced at

636
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,520
the same time as infra-world is actually still on track is now titled karma but

637
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,640
it won't be out on shelves until 2009 Quantic Dream is actually working on

638
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,560
another unnamed title at present another quote on here we have production set but

639
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,080
cannot divulge the name or details of the project. It is an original franchise

640
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:13,240
of ours, a game for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PSP, and PC systems. Speculation is

641
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,680
that it's a sequel to Fahrenheit. Hmm. But no one for world. Bye. Bye-bye.

642
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,860
All right. Our Skype line is open over at www.orangelandrater.com. Click on

643
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:29,020
interact with us and I'd be picking up a call right now but nobody's calling in

644
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:34,260
And I'm thinking I'm looking at our chat room and people are doing this they're doing they're collectively doing this

645
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
I'm sick

646
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,240
So fine, we'll go on to the next story if you guys don't want to qualify my me low-key

647
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,040
What's on your mind? Well, I can talk about holidays coming up pretty soon here

648
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,220
Well, let's see. Of course. We have to talk about sexy cheats

649
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,020
For sexy games. This is you know, it kind of goes

650
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,680
So, we'll run down the list a little bit here of some of the sexy cheats that are out there

651
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,420
for the sexy games.

652
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,060
First one being Dead or Alive 4, where you can add increased bounciness to the breasts

653
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,060
of the women in that.

654
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,460
Simply enter your age as 99 in your profile and it will make the female character's breasts

655
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:20,780
bounce more than usual for those dirty old men out there.

656
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,820
Let's see, some other things that they have here.

657
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:30,100
They actually talk about Meryl's underwear in Metal Gear Solid, which I thought was kind

658
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,700
of funny.

659
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:41,040
But you can actually put BloodRayne into JUGGY mode by entering JUGGY Dance Squad as the

660
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,140
code to basically unlock this new mode.

661
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,780
I don't know what exactly that does, but it would be interesting.

662
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,060
BMX XXX, they have topless girl mode.

663
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:59,180
You have to win first place in both competition levels to unlock the topless grill option.

664
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:04,520
They have Dead or Alive, Extreme Beach Volleyball, Seethrough, Swimsuit, and you can actually

665
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:16,780
play with Helena, Leifang, and Kristie to get a transparent swimsuit, unfortunately

666
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:20,460
it is censored.

667
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,700
And of course the guy game if you happen to unlock some of the video that's in there you

668
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,620
can hit triangle deposit and finish I guess.

669
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:38,520
Ways to spend your Valentine's Day if you are single and you enjoy looking at the women's

670
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,580
lovely.

671
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,780
Thank you for that Loki.

672
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,680
You're cementing that explicit tag for tonight's little portion of the show.

673
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Thank you so much.

674
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
Appreciate it.

675
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:56,080
Alright, well, I guess we're going to go on over to DarkSakura, who has some news about

676
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,680
Sonic the Hedgehog.

677
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,720
Oh yeah, Sonic's old.

678
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
I'm kidding.

679
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,000
You know, I grew up with Sonic the Hedgehog, even though I was a Super Nintendo person

680
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:14,040
in my younger years, but there actually is a next generation Sonic game that made an

681
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,680
appearance in GamePro.

682
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,280
It's a big world exclusive thing.

683
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,160
Cool.

684
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,800
There is a few interesting points that were made in the article.

685
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,200
The typical Sonic character model was about 1,500 polygons this time around.

686
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,400
It has one million, according to the developers.

687
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,680
Pretty awesome.

688
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,280
The game will also be faster than any previous Sonic game.

689
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,520
That's actually a quote from Nakamura, who is the game creator.

690
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,940
It has motion blur.

691
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,180
You can see it in some of the images that have been out on there.

692
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,540
I think there were some that were published in the magazine, too.

693
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:58,220
The game will feature huge environments that have night and day cycles as you progress

694
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,220
through the game.

695
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,940
You have morning, noon, night, changing the lighting, you know, sort of how Ocarina of

696
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,260
Time was with the day and night.

697
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,860
It will also use the Havix physics game engine.

698
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,540
Pro mentioned also that there was a sequence where Sonic faced an army of

699
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,620
killer robots and they went flying everywhere with the quote startling

700
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,100
realism. So we'll see what it is when it's finished.

701
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,820
Sounds like it could be pretty sweet. Alright. Alright we're about ready to

702
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,460
wrap things up here on Orange Lounge Radio but first Loki has a couple quick

703
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,300
stories he wants to go through real quick here some things that fell through

704
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,740
the cracks that he wants to make sure we talk about. Exactly one of the things

705
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:46,020
that they've actually got on this website nullriver.com for all you Mac owners out there.

706
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,100
If you do have a 360, you're able to share your music back and forth with the 360 using

707
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:58,380
this program they made called Connect360 and it'll allow you to sync up your iTunes as

708
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,500
well as photos, etc.

709
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,140
So check that out if you own a Mac and a 360.

710
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,940
Aww, that was a nice olive branch from Loki, I think, in a way.

711
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,500
Thank you for that, Loki.

712
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
Okay, just mess anyways

713
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,080
Moving on there are actually more video game movies in production right now, and there's been some updates on those

714
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
mainly Max Payne and Alice

715
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,880
They've actually signed on

716
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,240
Oh

717
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,520
God who was it Sarah Michelle Gellar?

718
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:32,960
To play the role of Alice, which would be pretty sweet and Max Payne. I believe is still in production right now, so

719
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,680
Tell her to gain some weight first

720
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,960
So that'd be pretty cool.

721
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,080
And basically, what was it, Scott Faye said that Doom and BloodRayne are more learning

722
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,960
experiences than, you know, he's kind of apologizing for those movies and promises of the next

723
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,040
ones will be a little bit better.

724
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,740
The new wave of Xbox 360 games that come out may require you to have a hard drive to play.

725
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:03,480
That's the case with the Japanese game Football Manager 2006.

726
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,280
actually going to be requiring you to have a hard drive to play the game so

727
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,120
you know hopefully you picked up one of those in other words Xbox should have or

728
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:16,580
Microsoft should have never sold the cores they just should have kept at 400

729
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,280
I mean I understand why they did it but yeah so I believe I can they said when

730
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,120
they said the games there would be no games that were hard drive specific oops

731
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,920
I guess you know that must be first-party games or something yeah that's

732
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:34,920
That's going to be, I think, for the Japanese or UK systems, so check that out.

733
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,560
There was also, during the Dice Summit that's been going on right now, they've had actually

734
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,420
a list of, they were doing their own awards for it, the Game Awards.

735
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,720
So basically, the winner for Game of the Year this year is going to be God of War.

736
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,440
Oh yeah, I remember we went over the nominees a couple weeks ago, so.

737
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:59,000
Okay, so God of War 1 for, and actually God of War 1 in a lot of categories, Console Game

738
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:05,420
of the Year, Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievements in Animation and Original Music

739
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,000
Composition as well as Sound Design.

740
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:15,200
Some other nominees that won here actually, Outstanding Achievements in Gameplay and Engineering,

741
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,160
there was a tie between Intendogs and Guitar Hero.

742
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,120
Yeah, I heard Guitar Hero a lot of times.

743
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:26,760
Design, Guitar Hero 1, as well as Best Soundtrack, Guitar Hero 1, that one as well, so that's

744
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,560
pretty sweet.

745
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:34,340
It's very interesting because amplitude and frequency were such wonderful games that if

746
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:40,020
you think about it, aren't that much different from Guitar Hero, except for the fact that

747
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
you have a guitar.

748
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,560
People really loved it.

749
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:50,060
A hot coffee thing that hit the internet for actually this was kind of advertising a brand new movie

750
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:57,460
Running scared with Paul Walker and in this minigame that they have in their website you would pleasure his wife

751
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,540
orally and

752
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:07,860
Yeah, it was kind of like hot coffee and fortunately got pulled off the site due to its graphic content so

753
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,380
Lovely so much for that

754
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:14,420
Lego Star Wars 2 is actually going to be coming out, Lego Star Wars 2

755
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,580
return of the original trilogy

756
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:22,940
and it should be pretty sweet, they've got a bunch of screenshots

757
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:27,060
from it, looks like it's going to be covering the original trilogy plus

758
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,740
they're going to have

759
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,260
co-op and stuff, quick poll please, I have never played a Lego game in my life

760
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:35,260
have any of you guys? Lego Star Wars was pretty sweet actually, was it?

761
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,900
yeah it was actually really well done so alright, maybe I missed the boat on

762
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:45,960
that one somehow. We're checking out and finally dust off your Dreamcast. There's some more

763
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,960
games for you for free. Marathon has been ported over to the Dreamcast and then we have

764
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,880
to thank Bugged for this one. They actually have the Marathon Trilogy you can download

765
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:05,880
on Dreamcast Evolution or it's dcevolution.net. They have links to that where you can make

766
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,300
make an image to play on there. The only catch is you're going to need a Dreamcast keyboard

767
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:15,460
and a controller to play the games, but if you're a fan of Halo and you want to play

768
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,320
some of Bungie's early work, check it out. Dreamcast, one of the most horribly underappreciated

769
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,320
consoles ever. That console was capable of more than we ended up really getting to see

770
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,120
from it. And finally, this is kind of my hope that this is going to be in the game. Fight

771
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,600
night round three they've got had an image come on the internet showing the

772
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,740
Burger King in the game what I'm hoping commercially I'm hoping he's a playable

773
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,740
character because doesn't that violate law right there would sell the game for

774
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:48,560
me it would bite just to play as the Burger King and would so all right well

775
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,640
we're about ready to wrap things up here on orange lounge radio but not until we

776
00:53:52,640 --> 00:54:01,400
get one last story from Loki and this is quite interesting you know I'm glad they

777
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,840
gave this to me because you know ice cream man in the UK was but well I know

778
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,720
you like ice cream so I love ice cream as much as I love pirating things up so

779
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,880
the ice cream man there was an ice cream man in the UK that was actually busted

780
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:23,220
for running a counterfeit piracy operation and he'll serve 200 hours of

781
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,580
community service for selling fake video games CDs and DVDs out of his ice cream
