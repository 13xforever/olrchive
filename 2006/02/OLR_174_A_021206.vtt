Mmm, salad.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
balsamic vinegar.

That's a hell of a salad.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.920
And granola.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.440

01:19.440 --> 01:21.320
Have you ever had good tofu?

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
Well I...

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
You should really have good tofu.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.880
miso soup which has tofu in it like that's one of my favorite kinds of soup

01:26.880 --> 01:31.240
tofu tofu it all depends on what you cook it with I'm making homemade tofu

01:44.400 --> 01:47.440
okay cuz I've become a vegetarian I eat meat for the first time last night in

01:47.440 --> 01:53.760
like a two-and-a-half weeks because we were at Hard Rock Cafe. It made me sick.

01:53.760 --> 01:57.480
Aww. Hard Rock Cafe is pretty good though. I haven't been there a long time. Anyway.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.320
I had a 22-ounce bass too. It was yummy. We're a video game podcast. I'm sorry. I didn't mean

02:01.320 --> 02:04.880

02:15.880 --> 02:19.720
what you'll food food is an important part of guy I made those long gaming

02:19.720 --> 02:24.640
nights you know I made French onion soup French onion soup and that's suck

02:24.640 --> 02:29.160
because cutting six onions is you know you got to get used to it I guess I

02:29.160 --> 02:33.880
don't really cook like ever it's a miracle to cook well French onion soup

02:33.880 --> 02:38.240

02:38.240 --> 02:43.200
you know I can make onion dip just pour the soup mix the sour cream that's easy

02:43.200 --> 02:46.480
I'm drinking fermented tea. Yum.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.800
All right. All this food toss is going to make me hungry here. But anyways, gaming stuff.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.960
Yes, well gaming. Yes, let's get into our gaming weeks and you know how things have been going.

02:54.960 --> 02:58.160
Do you have something real quick to start us off? I played Grand Theft Auto.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.360
Loki, go ahead and start us off since you guys started. How was your gaming week?

03:02.360 --> 03:05.800
I played Grand Theft Auto. That was pretty much it.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.840
Really? Yeah, I haven't gotten a chance to play much of my 360 this week because it's been

03:10.840 --> 03:11.640
really busy.

03:11.640 --> 03:16.160
Man, haven't really been able to snatch the TV away from people.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.500
We have him playing the full auto demo, which just to kind of warm us up to full auto, which

03:21.500 --> 03:28.960
I'll be getting on Tuesday, so it will be a very happy Valentine's Day with full auto.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.080
Alright, alright.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.400
They're doing really weird things on Valentine's Day this year.

03:33.400 --> 03:37.320
I just saw a commercial on TV the other day, it said Saw 2 is being released on DVD on

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
Valentine's Day.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.800
I'm like, that's just hokey.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.720
I find it funny though the most romantic holiday in existence was based off of a martyr

03:46.160 --> 03:50.880
are you do now do you have plans for valentine's day i sure do yeah um dan and i both have to work

03:52.000 --> 03:55.280
but i'm planning on um recreating the night that he proposed to me

03:56.000 --> 04:04.160
oh so um i'm i bought um sourdough uh french baguette at bodine last night so good and then

04:04.160 --> 04:09.920
um i'm gonna get some spinach dip and a bottle of the what's it called menschweizitz blackberry wine

04:09.920 --> 04:17.040
Remember, we were very broke when I moved in with Dan, and we're going to watch UHF.

04:17.040 --> 04:19.840
He proposed to me over Weird Al.

04:19.840 --> 04:20.840
That's awesome.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.600
Either that or we'll just go to Claim Jumper.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.720
Oh, that place is going to be packed though.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.720
I don't know if it'll go there.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.720
Yeah.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.720
Oh, maybe we'll go get Chinese food.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
All right.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
Anyway.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Sorry.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.880
It all comes back to food tonight.

04:31.880 --> 04:32.880
What's going on?

04:32.880 --> 04:36.040
We's hungry people, feed us.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.600
Any other games that you've been playing, Loki, this week?

04:40.600 --> 04:49.600
I did play briefly, and I mean extremely briefly, this Super Mario Bros. 3 hack, it was Mario

04:49.600 --> 04:56.160
Adventure or something like that, and it was okay, but I got bored with it real quick.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.160
I did...

04:57.160 --> 04:59.160
What the frickin' hell?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.360
My microphone just fell apart.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.680
Your microphone's kind of falling apart, here, let's do a quick switcheroo, Loki.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.680
That was interesting.

05:05.680 --> 05:10.440
this one here since we won't have a guest tonight. Anyways, my microphone literally

05:10.440 --> 05:16.300
exploded in my favorite- Live radio, it happens. Um, that's what I get for trying to put that

05:16.300 --> 05:21.960
mesh back on there. Anyways, um, so yeah, I tried actually playing with the Xbox 360

05:21.960 --> 05:27.540
wired controller because I downloaded the Windows XP drivers and it was okay. It works

05:27.540 --> 05:32.960
good as a controller. It would be good for like, um, I think Nintendo 64 emulation or

05:32.960 --> 05:35.720
or something like that, but I don't know.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.360
So I just played a little bit of that and a little bit of,

05:38.360 --> 05:43.300
I, what was it, I'm Okay, I played a little bit of that,

05:43.300 --> 05:48.300
which was that Jack Thompson murder simulator game

05:48.340 --> 05:50.480
that we talked about last week, that was fun.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.340
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.880
I'm just kind of waiting to play some more full auto

05:55.880 --> 06:00.880
and try to actually sit down and set some more 360 times

06:00.880 --> 06:05.840
time so I can play more Ridge Racer and that type of stuff.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.240
And download maybe some more games.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.600
Alright let's go over to DarkSakura.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.920
DarkSakura how was your gaming week?

06:13.920 --> 06:19.700
I played some Animal Crossing at work during my breaks of course because I'm a good girl.

06:19.700 --> 06:24.680
We have a really good story on gaming at work tonight so we have to come back to that later.

06:24.680 --> 06:31.340
I also chatted with some coworkers about PSP games and I'm still needing to sit down with

06:31.340 --> 06:35.740
Maverick Hunter X just because I watched the OAV thing on it, which depressed me utterly

06:35.740 --> 06:38.440
but it was really awesome.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.160
And I played a little bit more Kingdom Hearts but this week's been really crazy because

06:42.160 --> 06:48.860
I'm leaving for Alabama next week and have been trying to double up on my schoolwork

06:48.860 --> 06:51.380
so I don't have to have that sitting over my head.

06:51.380 --> 06:56.320
However, I'm also getting Dirge of Cerberus, which is the game featuring Vincent, sort

06:56.320 --> 07:02.820
of first person shooter-y, and I think I have the name right, it's SNK Coliseum, supposed

07:02.820 --> 07:07.820
to be like this massive, big ol' game starring the KOF characters and different SNK characters.

07:07.820 --> 07:08.820
Very cool.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.820
So I'm working on that.

07:09.820 --> 07:10.820
Alright.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.340
Now I'm glad you brought up the fact that you're going to be in Alabama next week, because

07:13.340 --> 07:18.060
I will actually, when you're in Alabama, I'm going to be in Washington DC next week, and

07:18.060 --> 07:21.500
I'm going to Virginia immediately after that for work so I'm actually going to

07:21.500 --> 07:24.660
I'm doing I'm doing something for this job

07:24.660 --> 07:28.740
Orange Laundry Day and then doing something for my day job back-to-back so for those

07:28.740 --> 07:33.380

08:00.760 --> 08:03.800
Shut up.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.900
Alright there's something that is completely off-top

08:06.900 --> 08:10.480
well not quite off-top. You mentioned KazuKon and

08:10.480 --> 08:14.400
you know convention-wise. Something I forgot to mention about my work

08:14.400 --> 08:17.440
since I said we're doing a sales push right now

08:17.440 --> 08:21.880
there's a contest involved. And the contest is with the four salespeople here

08:21.880 --> 08:26.040
in Folsom and four salespeople in Dallas.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.440
Two contests for both of us.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.520
The contest is whoever brings on the most accounts

08:31.520 --> 08:35.520
gets an all-expense-paid trip to E3 with a VIP pass.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.400
VIP pass lets you get into everything. Oh, you gotta get that.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.160
Oh, the United might not even be able to go E3 because of the future wife, huh?

08:43.160 --> 08:46.680
Actually, she gave me the okay. Woohoo! Alright!

08:46.680 --> 08:51.120
Oh, you gotta get that pass then. Oh, I'm... It's a scoop here on OLR. It doesn't matter anyways.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.320
I'll get a pass, a VIP pass. Whether I win the contest or not,

08:55.320 --> 08:58.560
they better give me one. Rub it in, rub it in. Alright.

08:58.560 --> 09:02.120
Yes, DarkStarker. That's cool, because I'll have my media pass too.

09:02.120 --> 09:06.760
Yeah, we need to get a media pass. Oh, we're working on it. March 31st is the deadline.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.040
Behind the scenes, we're working on it. Okay, alright.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.760
my gaming week I've had a lot of requests like in the chat room the chat

09:13.760 --> 09:17.000
room is lit up right now and I'm getting private messages as well people wanting

09:17.000 --> 09:20.720
to know follow up to the Xbox 360 debacle that I went off on last week

09:20.720 --> 09:25.480
you'll notice I'm a lot calmer when it comes to Xbox 360 topics tonight I did

09:25.480 --> 09:30.000
get the box from Microsoft but because of the fact I was out on business for

09:30.000 --> 09:32.840
part of this week I haven't had a chance to send it back yet but it's going back

09:32.840 --> 09:35.800
tomorrow it's getting put in the box tonight and it's going back tomorrow so

09:35.800 --> 09:39.440
look for another update on a future show whenever I get back I'm gonna be out for

09:39.440 --> 09:43.440
two shows so I'm not sure what's going to happen with the podcast we're going

09:43.440 --> 09:48.220
to talk about that but probably next week there'll be some type of best of

09:48.220 --> 09:52.780
maybe Loki bringing us some current headlines mixed into that and the week

09:52.780 --> 09:56.960
after we'll see is still out so we'll just you know stay tuned to

09:56.960 --> 10:01.920
orangeontrader.com for all the updates on that. Let's see so that's where my

10:01.920 --> 10:04.680
Xbox 360 stands so I'll let you know what happens when that comes back. As far

10:04.680 --> 10:07.560
as the rest of my gaming week it's actually been pretty calm I've been

10:07.560 --> 10:10.700
doing a lot of other things in my personal life this week, so I haven't had a lot of

10:10.700 --> 10:16.040
time for gaming. I was flying on the plane and I brought my DS. I didn't even really

10:16.040 --> 10:21.420
touch it. I actually, I was listening to podcasts. I actually, I brought my iPod and I listened

10:21.420 --> 10:25.980
to other podcasts because I kind of said before on the show that I don't really listen to

10:25.980 --> 10:30.480
a lot of other podcasts. There's really only one other gaming podcast I listen to on a

10:30.480 --> 10:34.160
regular basis, but that's because it's run by somebody I consider an internet friend,

10:34.160 --> 10:38.600
I listen to that one and I try to listen to others once in a while because I really do

10:38.600 --> 10:42.560
want to support the independent podcast scene because I know there's a lot of people that

10:42.560 --> 10:47.580
put blood sweat and tears so to speak into their cast just like we do so I try to listen

10:47.580 --> 10:51.780
to what's going on once in a while and support it but I was listening to podcasts on other

10:51.780 --> 10:54.900
subjects too because there's a lot of great stuff available on iTunes that's not just

10:54.900 --> 10:57.940
video games so you know some of my other interests so that was that.

10:57.940 --> 11:02.540
As far as gaming goes I did check out one new game it's not a new game but it's something

11:02.540 --> 11:06.420
A friend of mine suggested that I play because he thought I would like it

11:06.420 --> 11:09.500
because I was talking about my love of games like Civilization,

11:09.500 --> 11:13.500
so he's trying to get me back into some more like strategy type games.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.820
So the game he brought over for me is a game called Ghost Hunter,

11:16.820 --> 11:19.620
which was something I never really played before and I thought it was more of an

11:19.620 --> 11:21.340
action title like a reverse

11:21.340 --> 11:24.620
Silent Hill type thing. You actually play ghosts and what you're trying to do is

11:24.620 --> 11:26.460
you're trying to haunt people in a house

11:26.460 --> 11:30.140
and make them run away scared from the house. So it's kinda cool but it's more of a

11:30.140 --> 11:31.980
tactical game. I was kinda surprised.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.980
Like you have a certain amount of points that you can spend on different scare tactics and things.

11:35.980 --> 11:41.980
But I really like the game because it's so cool because you can switch and go to the point of view of the people in the house.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.980
And it's really fast. You change between all these graphics.

11:44.980 --> 11:48.980
You can go between all the different points of view of the characters and the overview of the house.

11:48.980 --> 11:53.980
And so you can watch your characters as they're being scared run around and you hear their little heart beating going

11:53.980 --> 11:55.980
Ah, ah, boom, boom, boom, boom.

11:55.980 --> 11:59.980
So this is kind of funny. It's a really cute game. I liked it. It's a good time.

11:59.980 --> 12:04.620
So, if you're a fan of scary type games, or even the...

12:04.620 --> 12:08.260
Well, although it's not really a scary game because it's all done very comically.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.820
But if you're a fan of those type of supernatural things, you might like it.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.940
Or even strategy and tactical type games, you may find this to be kind of fun.

12:15.940 --> 12:19.020
I don't know if it's a game I'll play all the way through to completion.

12:19.020 --> 12:23.120
I don't know if it's that great for me, but I think it'll be fun.

12:23.120 --> 12:28.340
So the game's called Ghost Hunter, and I want to say it was developed by a UK studio, actually.

12:28.340 --> 12:33.340
I think the version my friend had was a UK version somehow, so that's what I checked out.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.340
That was pretty much my gaming week. Not a whole lot of new stuff, sorry.

12:37.340 --> 12:41.340
You know, I wanted to download new demos on the Xbox 360, but we won't go there.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.340
I haven't done that.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.340
Yes, Dark Sakura?

12:43.340 --> 12:44.340
I actually did play another game.

12:44.340 --> 12:45.340
What's that?

12:45.340 --> 12:49.340
Actually, at Walmart.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.340
Was it Deer Hunter?

12:51.340 --> 12:56.340
No, it was this Sega Undersea game that was a lot like...

12:56.340 --> 12:59.420
It was in the same I think type of series as that

13:01.380 --> 13:03.380
What was it called the Safari hunter

13:03.580 --> 13:06.140
But you go and it's like house to the dead with fish

13:06.420 --> 13:10.820
It's underwater undersea hunter the undersea undersea adventure

13:10.820 --> 13:16.540
I like the crocodile hunter cry no, but you you're you have like this like this little handheld tour

13:16.540 --> 13:19.620
you know torpedo things and you shoot sharks and

13:20.860 --> 13:24.540
Hydras and you just go around shooting fish. It's like house of the dead with fish

13:24.540 --> 13:28.220
you were you when you were talking about Safari game you made me think of this

13:28.220 --> 13:30.900
one game maybe we're talking about the same thing here but they used to have a

13:30.900 --> 13:34.660
little arcade here in town you know the Sacramento the town we live in has

13:34.660 --> 13:38.820
essentially no good arcades anymore we used to have a couple good ones like

13:38.820 --> 13:42.220
standalone arcades in the area and I remember one particular one that was out

13:42.220 --> 13:47.380
in Roseville one of our suburbs had this game and I want to say it was by Sega

13:47.380 --> 13:50.340
it was a safari game and it was actually like a sit-down you go around in the

13:50.340 --> 13:55.180
Jeep and you lasso. Yeah, that was it. This was in the same series, but you just go around

13:55.180 --> 13:59.700
shooting fish. That's cool. And like, you know how in House of the Dead when like you

13:59.700 --> 14:03.420
let people die and you tell the other people there was nothing we could do. Instead like

14:03.420 --> 14:07.500
you see like if you let a shark eat one of the divers he just sort of hangs in the water

14:07.500 --> 14:14.380
like dead. And you're like dot dot dot. Okay. Alright, well that's a little bit about what's

14:14.380 --> 14:18.380
going on in our gaming worlds. And if you want to share what's going on in your gaming

14:18.380 --> 14:23.260
Join our chat room www.orangelandradio.com click on chat. You know I send us some email

14:23.340 --> 14:26.540
We'd love getting the email from you guys mailbag at orangelandradio.com

14:26.540 --> 14:29.920
And we'll read some of those emails a little later on in the program

14:32.180 --> 14:38.980
Moving to Arcadian42 said jumbo safari or jumbo safari. That's a jumbo safari not jumbo. All right anyway

14:39.500 --> 14:44.060
Let's get into some news some gaming news, and we'll start it off with

14:44.060 --> 14:49.860
Dark Sakura lots of news on the DS lots and lots of news on the DS this week we

14:49.860 --> 14:53.820
have so much so Dark Sakura if you can give us start us off well there's a

14:53.820 --> 15:00.860
little bit of news about DS voice chats and demo kiosks popping up the upcoming

15:00.860 --> 15:07.980
game Metroid Prime hunters will have a voice over IP option that was recently

15:07.980 --> 15:14.940
announced. Basically, um, what VoiceOver IP is, it's, um, imagine playing Fantasy Star

15:14.940 --> 15:19.140
Online, it's about the same thing. You're doing your, instead of doing like standard

15:19.140 --> 15:21.540
phone line, it's actually connecting through the internet connection.

15:21.540 --> 15:22.540
Right, like Xbox Live.

15:22.540 --> 15:23.540
Yeah.

15:23.540 --> 15:24.540
Basically, yeah.

15:24.540 --> 15:28.860
Yeah, same thing. Only, of course, this will be wireless. Um, one of the Nintendo of Europe

15:28.860 --> 15:34.080
spokespeople mentioned that they're hoping the, uh, VoiceOver IP feature will be included

15:34.080 --> 15:38.960
in the European version also of Metroid Prime Hunters for Nintendo DS, but they have to

15:38.960 --> 15:43.160
work on regulatory and contractual issues before that can be cleared.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.000
Now this would explain why now at E3, because you guys remember E3 we saw the demos of the

15:48.000 --> 15:52.520
voice over IP, like they had two DS's set up on different ends of the Nintendo booth

15:52.520 --> 15:56.980
and you could chat with the other person, but we never really saw anything come of this,

15:56.980 --> 16:00.880
but we kind of, like we knew, ok Nintendo's plotting something, so here it is, I guess

16:00.880 --> 16:03.880
this is the result of that it's not some type of separate game but they're

16:03.880 --> 16:06.800
actually going to incorporate it into their other games. Well basically if any

16:06.800 --> 16:12.000
system has internet capability you know any type of online play capability they

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
have voice over IP capability. Right. Now my old work used to do voice over IP for

16:16.000 --> 16:18.560
our entire phone system. Oh sure it's a huge thing you know people have voice

16:18.560 --> 16:22.640
over IP as their home phone you know. Vonage. Vonage and that stuff yeah. Right

16:22.640 --> 16:27.720
but um also there's more Skype mentioned. Yeah Skype's the same way. I said the game was

16:27.720 --> 16:33.660
for March 20th released in the US and later on May 5th in Europe. They're also

16:33.660 --> 16:37.920
mentioning that they're rolling out a series of DS demo kiosks across North

16:37.920 --> 16:43.740
America at major retail locations like GameStop, EB Games, GameCrazy. DS owners

16:43.740 --> 16:48.300
will be able to wirelessly download games, videos, minigames, sort of like how we did

16:48.300 --> 16:53.060
in E3 and they will be available until the handheld is switched off. You

16:53.060 --> 16:57.700
actually exactly like what our downloads were like at E3 when we were playing

16:57.700 --> 17:02.320
electroplankton and everything in line. Now I heard that they are actually

17:02.320 --> 17:05.660
bringing some of those exact same demos over like Meteos and stuff too are going

17:05.660 --> 17:08.400
to be some of the launch titles we're gonna see in the demo kiosks. There is a

17:08.400 --> 17:13.060
list. The first kiosk will offer free demos of Tetris DS, Brain Training, Mario

17:13.060 --> 17:18.980
Kart DS, Meteos, Chew Swing Golf, and Pokemon Troze, along with a video of

17:18.980 --> 17:23.500
Metroid Prime Hunters, um, new kiosks will be getting new content every quarter.

17:23.500 --> 17:28.300
I, you know, now I remember at E3 you could download the Zelda trailer

17:28.300 --> 17:31.900
and that was like a big thing. You could get, like, movies. That was the big thing.

17:31.900 --> 17:32.940
Yeah, it was a huge thing.

17:32.940 --> 17:37.300
So, now, I want to go back to a minute and talk about Metroid Prime Hunters because I did, I, I, I, I, I'm

17:37.300 --> 17:39.740
sorry if I'm repeating something you already said but I

17:39.740 --> 17:43.860
seem to recall reading that you would only be able to actually use the voice

17:43.860 --> 17:46.260
over IP before and after the game.

17:46.260 --> 17:49.600
you're not actually gonna be able to use it in the game itself that's correct

17:49.600 --> 17:51.100
it's only available in the lobby area

17:51.100 --> 17:54.500
so you can only trash talk in the lobbies. Isn't it very interesting

17:54.500 --> 17:57.620
that Nintendo's kinda opening that door

17:57.620 --> 18:01.960
because Nintendo I mean they have to they have to open that door I I still

18:01.960 --> 18:04.100
say the reason why GameCube was third place

18:04.100 --> 18:07.180
is because they didn't embrace the internet sooner

18:07.180 --> 18:13.760
and I I think though Nintendo's tried very hard to kinda protect people like

18:13.760 --> 18:18.160
Like you know for the same reason you can't share your friend codes on their official

18:18.160 --> 18:19.320
forums and stuff?

18:19.320 --> 18:24.040
It seems like they're trying to protect people from that same, like, you know the stigma

18:24.040 --> 18:25.540
that Xbox Live gets?

18:25.540 --> 18:29.800
You know whenever you go online and play Halo, you're gonna get called a F-A-G or an N-I-G,

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
bling, bling, bling, right?

18:30.800 --> 18:34.080
You're gonna get called those things because people are kinda immature on there and Xbox

18:34.080 --> 18:35.080
Live has that stigma.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.200
I don't think Nintendo wants that same thing.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.200
So it's kinda interesting.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.360
It's very smart to limit it in that respect.

18:40.360 --> 18:46.360
Because you know, there's been plenty of times where I'd be playing PSO and someone would

18:46.360 --> 18:50.080
get lost in our party, which happened all the time.

18:50.080 --> 18:54.280
And so, someone would just, you know, let out a little curse.

18:54.280 --> 18:59.440
And that, you know, you don't want to be stuck in the moment by having it be before and after.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.960
People are usually calmer, more thinking of what they're doing.

19:02.960 --> 19:07.520
I don't mind the occasional fucker shit because we do the same thing on this show and I think

19:07.520 --> 19:09.840
that's just, you know, it's not that bad.

19:09.840 --> 19:14.840
It's how people talk well not everybody, but you know just depends on your culture anyway

19:14.840 --> 19:20.560
But I do hate it when I go on Xbox Live, and there's some 13 year old kid talking about you know

19:21.080 --> 19:25.640
Making up stories about getting drunk and playing the game and calling everybody fag and all that stuff

19:25.640 --> 19:28.240
You know I don't that's the part that annoys me

19:28.240 --> 19:31.360
I don't care if people are gonna say fucker shit once in a while you know but

19:32.240 --> 19:35.240
It's just interesting to me that Nintendo is kind of opening that door

19:35.240 --> 19:38.640
It's gonna be interesting to see if they try to police this at all or if they just

19:38.640 --> 19:44.780
If they're looking at Xbox and going, you know what? It's successful. Why are we afraid of this? Let's just let's just do it

19:44.780 --> 19:46.340
Let's open it up

19:46.340 --> 19:48.420
No, we'll see. All right

19:49.820 --> 19:53.420
And let's go over to Loki for a follow-up story. Yes

19:54.220 --> 19:57.880
Well kind of on the same subject of chatting over the Internet

19:58.260 --> 20:05.220
Nintendo's actually applied for a voice-to-text software patent and basically their reasoning for it is

20:05.220 --> 20:18.220
If a 12 year old boy is playing the role of a 40 year old warrior, voice chat can spoil or detract from the gameplay experience since the warrior ends up having the voice of a 12 year old.

20:18.220 --> 20:28.220
So the solution is that you speak normally and have the software convert the speech into text, which also allows them to censor any naughty words that you'll be using.

20:28.220 --> 20:35.220
be using. So, good idea, probably something that they might use for like, I don't know,

20:35.500 --> 20:39.700
I think this would be good for like, actually Metroid Prime Hunters, because if you can't

20:39.700 --> 20:44.540
support, you know, the voice chat or whatever, you can at least do text chat or something.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.020
Do you need to be talking in Metroid Prime Hunters, maybe?

20:47.020 --> 20:48.660
No. Because, does Metroid Prime Hunters have

20:48.660 --> 20:51.300
a co-op? I don't think they did, at least in the demo I remember.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.440
I don't think so. So maybe that theory is you shouldn't be

20:53.440 --> 20:56.500
talking to each other because you should be finding each other to kill each other and

20:56.500 --> 20:58.660
you wouldn't talk to your enemies.

20:58.660 --> 21:02.700
I don't know, capture the flag, team play stuff. I don't think it depends what kind of...

21:02.700 --> 21:07.020
I haven't touched that demo in forever. It's an interesting idea, who knows how they'll use it, but

21:07.020 --> 21:08.720
something else to look forward to, I guess.

21:08.720 --> 21:10.660
You know where I think this is all headed,

21:10.660 --> 21:14.300
and I think this is actually going to be really, really smart of Nintendo.

21:14.300 --> 21:18.100
You know where I think this is all headed with this whole demo kiosk and all this stuff, the demos?

21:18.100 --> 21:21.160
I think we're going to see something that's like a copy

21:21.160 --> 21:23.680
of Xbox Live on the Xbox 360

21:23.680 --> 21:27.000
with the revolution using the revolution because imagine it you hook up

21:27.000 --> 21:31.640
a Nintendo revolution to the internet and you could download DS demos

21:31.640 --> 21:36.720
onto your revolution essentially turning your revolution into a demo kiosk

21:36.720 --> 21:39.360
I think that's kinda where we're headed where your revolution will be able to

21:39.360 --> 21:40.800
play not only

21:40.800 --> 21:45.480
revolution demos at some point but DS demos as well

21:45.480 --> 21:49.080
beam them over to your DS and I think that's gonna be really powerful

21:49.080 --> 21:52.680
well they're gonna probably do the same thing with the PS3 they're gonna have the game share function

21:52.680 --> 21:58.020
that you can use, probably with the PS3, where you can download one level demos of PSP games.

21:58.020 --> 22:00.880
Maybe Xbox is wishing they had a handheld right about now.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
Probably.

22:01.880 --> 22:02.880
Interesting.

22:02.880 --> 22:07.880
I just kind of see that as the end point for all of this, but it's going to be very cool.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.400
Oh yeah, everyone's looking to online, and they've got to, I mean, since they're not

22:12.400 --> 22:16.880
pushing high def, so online's going to have to be what it is.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.560
It's going to have to be innovative, and that's pretty innovative, I guess.

22:20.560 --> 22:27.440
I'm going to the chat room and checking it out, www.orangelaungeradio.com, click on chat.

22:27.440 --> 22:32.880
Some interesting comments here, Hitstun had a couple of good things to say I like here.

22:32.880 --> 22:36.740
Nintendo needs to solve the problem with people disconnecting when they're about to lose.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.840
Certainly one of their biggest bitches.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.960
That can happen with a lot of online games though, but certainly maybe should affect

22:42.960 --> 22:45.800
their records or something like it does on some Xbox games.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.180
Also Hitstun said this, I thought this was good.

22:48.180 --> 22:54.020
wants people to play not chat that's an interesting point they are very

22:54.020 --> 22:57.940
Nintendo's been always about the games yeah but you know I I don't think I

22:57.940 --> 23:00.660
don't think you can really say Microsoft's not about the games it's

23:00.660 --> 23:04.420
just but but in a way they really have pushed the social network I don't know

23:04.420 --> 23:07.140
weird it's weird I don't know if you could say that they only want they want

23:07.140 --> 23:12.040
them to play not chat because um you know the DS did have pico chat

23:12.040 --> 23:18.880
included with it come on mini me 283 has an interesting comment too I think

23:18.880 --> 23:22.880
Nintendo would be worse than Xbox Live because some people would be even more

23:22.880 --> 23:28.000
immature Nintendo's target audience granted as a whole is usually younger

23:28.000 --> 23:33.480
than Xbox's so interesting point but I don't know I know a lot of you know

23:33.480 --> 23:37.620
twenty-something gamers and thirty something gamers that are Nintendo fan

23:37.620 --> 23:43.640
fanboys. Usually, the older ones are Nintendo fanboys. That's kinda what I notice. I think

23:43.640 --> 23:49.840
Nintendo doesn't necessarily, may not be focusing on age-wise. I've always seen them as focusing

23:49.840 --> 23:58.520
to a more innocent crowd. Hmm. For people who are more looking for the wholesome category

23:58.520 --> 24:05.080
of gaming. Or the not quite so racy, not quite so mature. Well, you know, I even hate to

24:05.080 --> 24:10.280
of games as Grand Theft Auto as basically being a mature game because honestly the game

24:10.280 --> 24:16.200
strikes me overall as very immature, but in general I think that it's more for the people

24:16.200 --> 24:23.280
looking for the more adult experience, like Xbox, but GameCube is more of the we want

24:23.280 --> 24:25.280
a cleaner type of game.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.440
Okay, okay, I can see it.

24:28.440 --> 24:32.560
Alright, it's going to be very interesting to see where this all goes over the next few

24:32.560 --> 24:35.560
months as you know we get more information about the revolution. I'm

24:35.560 --> 24:39.100
wondering you know how we talked about last week that there's going to be a

24:39.100 --> 24:42.500
couple hints dropped a game developers conference on the revolution we think

24:42.500 --> 24:47.680
it's gonna be very interesting to see if it ties into this. I'm thinking that the

24:47.680 --> 24:51.460
announcement we see at at game developers conference this is totally a

24:51.460 --> 24:55.240
rumor I'm making up right here is that it's gonna tie into all this other news

24:55.240 --> 24:58.820
we're seeing is that exactly as I just said it that the revolution is gonna

24:58.820 --> 25:02.440
have that capability I think that'll be the hint that's dropped at GDC because

25:02.440 --> 25:06.520
that would be a good little teaser that doesn't really spoil the actual

25:06.520 --> 25:12.440
revolution you know what I mean I don't know anyway my thoughts speaking of the

25:12.440 --> 25:18.120
DS we have yet more stuff on the DS the DS lite is on its way dark soccer you

25:18.120 --> 25:25.180
know some more information on the DS lite why yes I do Rob Nintendo has

25:25.180 --> 25:29.880
basically announced three colors for the Nintendo DS lite launching in Japan on

25:29.880 --> 25:37.560
March 2nd. They're having Crystal White, Ice Blue, and Enamel Navy. And Nintendo's

25:37.560 --> 25:42.520
actually put some pictures up on their Japanese website. I'll be able to go

25:42.520 --> 25:47.240
ahead and post links to that in our chat room but also anyone can go on to a

25:47.240 --> 25:55.920
Nintendo of Japan site at nintendo.co.jp slash ds slash lite lite slash color slash

25:55.920 --> 26:01.680
index dot HTML and they're they're pretty you remember that old bet from

26:01.680 --> 26:07.080
the live show before we went to this old you know new format on the old live show

26:07.080 --> 26:12.920
we were talking about weight loss on one episode like a few months ago and I made

26:12.920 --> 26:16.760
that bet with extra fur that he couldn't go without fast food for six months well

26:16.760 --> 26:20.600
he's still gone without fast food we're about four months into it now and now

26:20.600 --> 26:23.380
he's telling me he wants a DS light because the deal was if he could do it I

26:23.380 --> 26:26.260
I would buy him a DS Lite or a Nintendo DS

26:26.260 --> 26:27.380
because I said he couldn't do it.

26:27.380 --> 26:30.180
And now he's saying, I want a DS Lite.

26:30.180 --> 26:31.940
I'm like, you can't change the terms.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.420
You're gonna buy whatever DS I can buy.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.180
I'll get you a used DS, smart ass.

26:35.180 --> 26:37.460
Besides, they're not available over here, so ha.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.620
But they'll still play any region.

26:38.620 --> 26:40.100
They will be, you know they will be.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.940
Eventually, but ha, they're not yet.

26:42.940 --> 26:43.780
They'll still play any region,

26:43.780 --> 26:44.960
so I don't see where the big thing is.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.220
You can import them for the same price as it is

26:47.220 --> 26:49.100
to actually just buy one retail at a lot of sites.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.860
No, I'm not importing one.

26:50.860 --> 26:55.020
If I lose a bet, I'm not going out of my way to make it nice.

26:55.020 --> 26:55.520
All right.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.300
If I come out with crap colors over here, I'll import one.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.420
We'll see.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.020
Loki, one more DS story for us?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.980
Yes, and this is only appropriate,

27:03.980 --> 27:07.420
seeing as we're talking about web functions.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.340
Actually, Nintendo has come out to say

27:09.340 --> 27:14.020
that they are looking into creating a web browser for it.

27:14.020 --> 27:20.340
Basically, Reggie, one of the higher-ups at Nintendo,

27:20.340 --> 27:23.740
is on the record talking to EGM saying that

27:23.740 --> 27:29.740
he's looking at a third-party licensee to get involved with the

27:29.740 --> 27:32.900
web functionality in basically a web browser

27:32.900 --> 27:36.460
but if they would not do it

27:36.460 --> 27:40.740
then definitely that's something that Nintendo is looking at putting out themselves

27:40.740 --> 27:41.140
so

27:41.140 --> 27:44.880
it could be something we'll see soon web browsing on the DS

27:44.880 --> 27:48.180
might be it'd be perfect for it I think you know

27:48.180 --> 27:52.300
all this stuff they had to be thinking of when they first put out the DS.

27:52.300 --> 27:56.380
Isn't it interesting how this is kind of rolled out very slowly?

27:56.380 --> 28:00.700
I'm very smart on Nintendo's part because when the DS first came out a lot of us were kind of looking at it

28:00.700 --> 28:01.180
going

28:01.180 --> 28:05.820
not a lot of good games right now, not a lot of stuff to do with this, PSP's got a lot more

28:05.820 --> 28:09.340
functionality and now it's very interesting to see the DS really starting to raise the

28:09.340 --> 28:10.900
bar here against the PSP

28:10.900 --> 28:14.780
because the PSP's niche and what still makes it a very powerful portable system is the

28:14.780 --> 28:15.300
fact that

28:15.300 --> 28:21.720
It does do web browsing and movie playing and all this other stuff too and Nintendo's starting to compensate for that difference a little bit

28:21.720 --> 28:23.060
So it's very interesting

28:23.060 --> 28:24.920
Very interesting should be cool

28:24.920 --> 28:27.100
We'll see what happens. Okay. I lied. I have one more

28:27.720 --> 28:30.860
DS story for you guys, but this is so cool. You got to see this

28:30.960 --> 28:36.680
This was posted and I apologize because I don't remember where but it's a link to a video on youtube.com

28:37.160 --> 28:42.300
And it's actually a clip of the new Super Mario Brothers on Nintendo DS

28:42.300 --> 28:46.640
I'm going to show this in studio here to the folks here. You got to look at this game looks sexy here

28:47.640 --> 28:54.500
Okay, so the clip shows you it's got the old retro. Oh, it's hung up a little bit there

28:55.860 --> 29:01.460
It's got the old retro sounds there and the retro look to it except Mario's in a very desert looking world

29:01.460 --> 29:05.200
Yeah, you can kind of compare it to something you would have seen in Mario Brothers 2

29:05.600 --> 29:11.280
Except the look of it looks like Mario 1 graphics, but it reminds me of Super Mario all-stars

29:11.280 --> 29:15.040
stars basically a little bit it does look kind of like super mario where there's all stars

29:15.040 --> 29:19.120
a lot of the same enemies like you see the little spiky guys and the caterpillar things

29:19.120 --> 29:24.960
and there's these new rings too look at this mario goes in the pipe and then flies out of it that's

29:24.960 --> 29:31.120
kind of cool like mario went in the pipe and the pipe bent to allow him to kind of fly out of it

29:32.720 --> 29:37.840
so this is looking like it's going to be pretty sexy i like this i like the that's stage four

29:37.840 --> 29:41.800
I recognize what level that is.

29:41.800 --> 29:45.000
I don't think this is a redone version of the original.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.200
Well, I wouldn't be surprised if- Well, a lot of it looked like the same type of-

29:48.200 --> 29:51.880
Oh, I'm sure- I wouldn't be surprised if there's

29:51.880 --> 29:55.440
elements of the classic Mario Brothers put into this game, because, you know,

29:55.440 --> 29:57.600
Nintendo loves their retro stuff. No, it is different.

29:57.600 --> 30:01.000
Yeah. See, because you've got the pipe here, you wouldn't have that in the original one.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.880
Yeah. Kinda neat. I like that. I like the thing with it being his head.

30:04.880 --> 30:10.980
Cool anyway, so just a little teaser of what's to come that looks very exciting. I'm very happy about that anyway

30:10.980 --> 30:12.980
I'm gonna post. I'll post the link directly in

30:13.540 --> 30:15.740
Chat room there, so you guys can check out the video as well

30:15.740 --> 30:20.260
I know I know that's great radio to hear us sitting around talking about it, so go check it out

30:20.260 --> 30:25.820
Have a look at it all right now. Let's go on to a completely different topic enough Nintendo DS for now

30:25.820 --> 30:27.820
Let's do a follow-up story

30:28.540 --> 30:34.580
Three weeks in an hour or three weeks now. We've talked about this. Yes the drama all right

30:34.580 --> 30:43.640
what's up lizard basically says yeah our bad about the whole gay lesbian guild

30:43.640 --> 30:48.820
that was you know basically shot down for you know trying to advertise and the

30:48.820 --> 30:53.020
guild wasn't closed but it's just that the the person who did the shout got the

30:53.020 --> 30:56.780
slap on the wrist under harassment policy and that was the whole big issue

30:56.780 --> 31:01.620
was that you know was she harassing no she wasn't harassing anybody that was a

31:01.620 --> 31:06.340
whole issue but anyway sorry yeah it's basically no they're very she's very

31:06.340 --> 31:10.860
happy that blizzard has owned up to the mistake and apologize and corrected it

31:10.860 --> 31:15.900
so basically it's just kind of seeing how the policies under review right now

31:15.900 --> 31:20.260
and they're trying to make revisions to you know make it friendly to everybody

31:20.260 --> 31:26.500
and I clarify things less vague I read I don't know if it's the same story but I

31:26.500 --> 31:30.220
I did read because obviously I've been very curious about this I did read a

31:30.220 --> 31:34.060
follow-up story that said Blizzard did apologize and say that it was you know

31:34.060 --> 31:37.900
not really what it should have been filed under and I heard that they were

31:37.900 --> 31:42.540
going to put all their GMs through sensitivity training to you know I

31:42.540 --> 31:45.820
better identify how to handle these issues in the future and I thought this

31:45.820 --> 31:49.220
was a very creative solution is I don't I don't remember if this was fact or

31:49.220 --> 31:53.380
rumor so take this with a grain of salt but that Blizzard is going to create

31:53.380 --> 31:56.860
another chat channel within the game because right now they have chat

31:56.860 --> 32:02.260
channels for you know general chat looking for group trade they have all

32:02.260 --> 32:05.860
these channels they're going to create a new channel for guild recruitment or

32:05.860 --> 32:10.100
this kind of chat would be acceptable and I think that is a very fair and very

32:10.100 --> 32:14.660
smart solutions anyways that's if that's fact I appreciate Blizzard for doing

32:14.660 --> 32:18.300
that here is the actual apology letter that Sarah Andrews received from

32:18.300 --> 32:22.820
Blizzard and it's from their you know the head of customer service I'm Thor

32:22.820 --> 32:29.140
Before BF4, Head of Blizzard Customer Service Worldwide, I'd like to thank you for bringing

32:29.140 --> 32:34.380
your recent concerns to our attention and extend our apologies for any inconveniences

32:34.380 --> 32:36.700
has caused you or your guild.

32:36.700 --> 32:41.740
The action that was taken by our customer service representatives was an unfortunate

32:41.740 --> 32:47.220
interpretation of our current policies which are currently under review.

32:47.220 --> 32:51.760
This was ultimately escalated to my attention and after reviewing all the details I had

32:51.760 --> 32:56.000
the following warning removed from your account please accept our apologies for

32:56.000 --> 33:00.040
the way our staff characterized your conduct and rest assured your account

33:00.040 --> 33:03.600
will not be penalized in any way for this occurrence I'll be happy to

33:03.600 --> 33:07.960
discuss this with you further so for you so please feel free to contact me

33:07.960 --> 33:13.760
directly and then it leaves his number so thank you thank you blizzard that was

33:13.760 --> 33:17.280
no I mean I'm serious that Amy even though I kind of wish it had happened a

33:17.280 --> 33:20.400
little sooner I understand that corporations are big nasty machines

33:20.400 --> 33:23.500
This probably had to be reviewed a thousand times by legal so I understand

33:23.500 --> 33:28.600
I thank you for that having been in customer service for a very long time myself. Yeah

33:29.100 --> 33:34.920
When things get escalated like that you can't expect a few weeks worth of delay, so I'm I'm understanding

33:34.920 --> 33:38.480
You know I in a perfect world that would have happened a little sooner, but I'm okay with that

33:38.480 --> 33:42.240
I'm okay with it. Please don't see me as bitching further. I'm happy with that so

33:42.880 --> 33:47.160
First a couple comments to what's going on the chat room somebody's saying did I say gay chat?

33:47.160 --> 33:52.300
They were gonna make another channel for gay chat. No, no, that was guild recruitment chats not gay chat

33:53.320 --> 33:57.160
Let's see. What was the other one? Oh another person to comment

33:58.120 --> 34:03.600
EK I am which I think is Mike spelled backwards says did they unban her? I just want to clarify

34:04.480 --> 34:10.120
They never banned her she was warned not banned, but I believe I'm almost positive

34:10.120 --> 34:14.220
She voluntarily left the game because she was kind of pissed off and well, you know, I would have been too

34:14.220 --> 34:17.940
so I can't say I blame her for that but I just want to clarify that nobody was

34:17.940 --> 34:22.740
banned in that whole thing just warned and the warning was inappropriate all

34:22.740 --> 34:26.020
right so I'm glad to hear that follow-up and now the you know the best thing

34:26.020 --> 34:31.020
about that follow-up we won't ever have to talk about that again yay all right

34:31.020 --> 34:37.220
so next up let's talk about another MMO this is another follow-up to a story we

34:37.220 --> 34:40.580
talked about a little while ago you remember a couple I think it was he the

34:40.580 --> 34:46.580
Last week or two weeks ago on the show, we talked about how Square had banned some of

34:46.580 --> 34:48.940
the GIL farmers from Final Fantasy XI.

34:48.940 --> 34:53.420
They didn't say anything at first, but now they have come out and said something.

34:53.420 --> 34:57.500
They released a press release called RMT Countermeasures.

34:57.500 --> 35:01.220
RMT stands for Real Money Trading.

35:01.220 --> 35:06.820
Basically coming out and saying, we've reviewed 700 accounts and banned them, 300 billion

35:06.820 --> 35:09.520
GIL has been removed from circulation.

35:09.520 --> 35:13.660
They realize this is driving up the price of items and they are doing their best to

35:13.660 --> 35:16.620
follow and they say they have more accounts under review and they're taking this stuff

35:16.620 --> 35:18.260
very seriously.

35:18.260 --> 35:23.380
I'm glad they did that, but at the same time, I still go by what I said last week when this

35:23.380 --> 35:27.180
originally came up, why didn't this happen a year and a half ago when things started

35:27.180 --> 35:28.180
to get out of hand?

35:28.180 --> 35:30.140
I don't understand why it took this long.

35:30.140 --> 35:35.560
Now, no review process takes that long, so this is a little bit of a reasonable amount

35:35.560 --> 35:39.960
of time and I'm still not really, this isn't enough to really get me back.

35:39.960 --> 35:44.440
You know, had this happened a long time ago, maybe I would've never left and started playing

35:44.440 --> 35:45.440
World of Warcraft.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.880
Well, yeah, I'm quitting my account next week, actually, because I'm, well, the only delay

35:50.880 --> 35:55.360
that I've had so far is I'm waiting for someone to take over the link shell and that's it.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
Then I'm done.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.760
I'm dumping everything.

35:57.760 --> 36:04.000
I still will go and check out the game when the new expansion is released because I hear

36:04.000 --> 36:07.740
It's going to be a little more solo friendly like you'll be able to do more stuff on your own

36:08.000 --> 36:12.880
So I'm gonna give it another chance because that was one thing Final Fantasy 11 was severely lacking for me like I do

36:13.120 --> 36:19.320
Don't get me wrong. I do understand. It's an MMO. You have to group sometimes. That's understandable, but all the time

36:20.580 --> 36:23.520
Okay, I was a little much. That was the first thing that sent me to World of Warcraft

36:23.520 --> 36:28.920
Yeah, so we'll see I'm gonna give it another chance and we'll see so don't screw this up square

36:28.920 --> 36:32.920
We'll see. That's a little bit of a follow up there.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.920
We seem to be saying that quite a bit where Six Square is concerned.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.920
I know. Anyway, moving on.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.920
DarkSakura. She likes to surf the internet.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.920
You like the internet, right?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.920
Yeah, the internet is serious business.

36:45.920 --> 36:51.920
She serves, sits up and down, and brings the very best to you in her website-o-the-week.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.920
DarkSakura, what's the website of the week?

36:54.920 --> 37:01.920
Today's website of the week is called get your head out of your butt.com best name ever

37:02.400 --> 37:07.540
for a website. Basically the site focuses on political issues and then gives an opinion

37:07.540 --> 37:13.580
on how the people who are most prevalent in these issues are big idiots. I mean it really

37:13.580 --> 37:18.220
is nothing but political issues but the whole point of this is if you're going to be in

37:18.220 --> 37:22.860
the public eye and say things don't be a dumbass about it. I actually put some thought into

37:22.860 --> 37:30.100
A few of the different issues brought over here was more about the Communications Decency

37:30.100 --> 37:35.820
Act, more recent developments with that, which actually sort of affects us, you know.

37:35.820 --> 37:43.020
Also about issues with the Super Bowl, and this one actually really struck with me about

37:43.020 --> 37:49.380
Cindy Sheehan, who was arrested for wearing that particular t-shirt at the State of the

37:49.380 --> 37:51.100
Union address.

37:51.100 --> 37:57.240
She was basically lost any credibility she might have had for doing that at the most inappropriate time ever

37:57.700 --> 38:02.280
So yeah, it's pretty good. It's a pretty good site. Give some pretty controversial views on things

38:02.380 --> 38:04.880
That's another good article in here about the Dixie Chicks, too

38:05.420 --> 38:08.180
But anyone who happens to be politically and socially minded

38:08.900 --> 38:09.660
Check it out

38:09.660 --> 38:11.060
You may not agree with the opinion

38:11.060 --> 38:17.400
But at least it's very intelligently presented and has the best website name ever and so therefore it's your website of the week

38:17.400 --> 38:20.960
Exactly. It's GetYourHeadOutOfYourButt.com. All one word.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.120
Is it non-partisan? Does it razz on both sides?

38:24.120 --> 38:28.000
It seems fairly non-partisan. That's actually another thing that appealed to

38:28.000 --> 38:29.240
me is that it seems

38:29.240 --> 38:33.040
it is a bit more on the liberal-friendly side

38:33.040 --> 38:37.080
but then again it does also... Because when I looked at it, it seemed a little more on the other side of it.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.440
It really floats the line to me.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.860
Well, whoever's got their head in their butt this week, essentially. Well, right, and I

38:43.860 --> 38:44.760
think that they're...

38:44.760 --> 38:48.040
You know, I think the person who writes it, the reason why it appeals to me is because

38:48.040 --> 38:50.040
it has a very similar point of view to I do.

38:50.040 --> 38:56.280
I've got a very socially liberal mindset, but when it comes to fiscal, you know, circumstances

38:56.280 --> 39:01.120
and some borderline social circumstances, I do lean a little conservatively on it just

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120
based on my background.

39:02.120 --> 39:07.080
But, you know, I think it's very moderate, I'd have to put it as very moderate.

39:07.080 --> 39:11.120
Okay, that's good, because that kind of stuff's only funny to me when it's both sides being

39:11.120 --> 39:12.120
razzed.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.120
Oh yeah, I agree.

39:13.120 --> 39:20.240
And they, like I said, they go from everything from, you know, pointing fingers at, you know,

39:20.240 --> 39:25.640
the Patriot Act to pointing fingers at, you know, that Cindy lady.

39:25.640 --> 39:26.640
Okay, that's cool.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.880
I mean, it really does go back and forth.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.360
I think it's a very fair point of view, but again, it is the author's point of view.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
Alright.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.680
What does that have to do with games?

39:33.680 --> 39:34.680
It doesn't, but...

39:34.680 --> 39:35.680
That's teasing, I'm teasing.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.320
Well, no, but every so often I've seen things pop up about the RIAA and...

39:39.320 --> 39:42.520
I want to say I saw something about like you know there was even a gaming

39:42.520 --> 39:45.160
category in there something like I seem to recall

39:45.160 --> 39:48.500
maybe I'm crossing wires I don't know. I honestly believe

39:48.500 --> 39:51.720
this is my social political point of view on this

39:51.720 --> 39:55.580
anything that happens that's in the public eye as far as any type of

39:55.580 --> 39:57.320
political or social agenda

39:57.320 --> 40:01.440
is eventually going to affect all other aspects of life including

40:01.440 --> 40:05.240
how we communicate what we do for our leisure including games

40:05.240 --> 40:09.200
I honestly think that everything is linked. You'll see one thing about

40:09.200 --> 40:13.320
so-and-so, you know, privacy issue and then you'll see

40:13.320 --> 40:17.160
all sorts of privacy measures being incorporated into like

40:17.160 --> 40:20.600
AOL, Yahoo, Game Chat.

40:20.600 --> 40:25.480
This is the reason why I think gamepolitics.com is a horribly overlooked site.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.680
I think more people should be keeping a pulse on what's going on over there

40:28.680 --> 40:30.040
because it really fuses

40:30.040 --> 40:33.440
this politics thing with what what goes on with gaming.

40:33.440 --> 40:39.040
You know, I think that for everybody that ignores the social issues that go on, issues

40:39.040 --> 40:43.720
with government and politics, you know, it's not necessarily the smartest thing to do.

40:43.720 --> 40:45.640
You're keeping yourself in the closet, basically.

40:45.640 --> 40:49.760
You're keeping yourself under your pile of blankets, warm and safe in your bed, and you

40:49.760 --> 40:52.240
won't realize that the house is crashing around you.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
Alright.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.240
That's my opinion.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.240
That's why I like this site.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.240
Alright.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.240
That's her opinion.

40:57.240 --> 40:58.240
Take it or leave it.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.240
Alright.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.240
I'm gonna leave it.

41:00.240 --> 41:01.240
No, I'm teasing.

41:01.240 --> 41:02.240
I'm teasing.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.240
Hey, hey, hey.

41:03.240 --> 41:08.960
because it pisses so many people off probably all right um well we'll see

41:08.960 --> 41:14.920
we'll check the email later oh yeah I get in an email low-key speaking of

41:14.920 --> 41:21.800
things crashing down get it crash Xbox all right what's going on on Xbox Live

41:21.800 --> 41:27.040
lots of new stuff to download actually they've added crystal quest which is

41:27.040 --> 41:33.180
actually one of the earlier Mac games I remember crystal quest I wanted

41:33.180 --> 41:39.620
download this it's well yeah Xbox one of the first Mac games in color and so you

41:39.620 --> 41:43.060
know I don't know it's too similar to the other games are out there right now

41:43.060 --> 41:50.740
like mutant storm and geometry wars that they're just too similar no did you did

41:50.740 --> 41:54.360
you download it I haven't played it yeah okay I've seen pictures of it and they've

41:54.360 --> 41:59.900
just compared it to this but anyways the one I'm waiting for is crystal castles

41:59.900 --> 42:04.560
I like that game. That was pretty fun crystal cat like the old with the bear running around getting the gems. Yep

42:07.780 --> 42:13.020
I know and it's even better when you actually have the trackball to play at home. I know I know so that was fun

42:13.020 --> 42:15.260
Yeah, you can't play you can't play that game with a keyboard

42:15.260 --> 42:20.260
You have to use either your mouse which is essentially an inverted trackball or a trackball. I mean trackballs the bomb. So anyway

42:21.060 --> 42:27.260
So that and also another cool demo that's gonna be coming out and that would be Ghost Recon advanced warfighter

42:27.260 --> 42:34.340
It should be coming probably pretty soon, you know, in the next couple weeks or so.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.700
Because the game's coming out in March, like the second week in March.

42:36.700 --> 42:40.760
Another thing that's coming out though, 99 Nights demo is going to be hitting the Japanese

42:40.760 --> 42:42.780
Xbox Live Arcade.

42:42.780 --> 42:46.580
But for those people that know the region trick that you can do that, you can actually

42:46.580 --> 42:49.340
probably download that here.

42:49.340 --> 42:56.160
If you want to know the region trick, go post it on our forums and Loki will help you out.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.360
I thought this was interesting.

42:57.360 --> 43:01.220
Our chat room over at orangelaunchradio.com is kind of giggling.

43:01.220 --> 43:05.200
They're snickering to themselves because they said essentially that we got Loki to talk

43:05.200 --> 43:09.640
about something Mac-related and keep the peace.

43:09.640 --> 43:10.640
It's amazing.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.920
All right, before Loki can respond to that, I better run on to another story real quick.

43:14.920 --> 43:18.700
Okay, I'm going to talk about Xbox 360 tonight and not get angry, and this should be good

43:18.700 --> 43:20.320
news to some folks.

43:20.320 --> 43:25.000
This is coming from a website, xboxic.com.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.920
Peter Moore, who of course is the Vice President of the Entertainment and Devices Division

43:29.920 --> 43:34.660
of Microsoft Corp, he is talking about the issues regarding these shortages, and this

43:34.660 --> 43:39.980
is what he said, quote, within the next four to six weeks, anybody will be able to walk

43:39.980 --> 43:42.760
into a store and buy an Xbox 360.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.200
So will we be seeing these shortages come to an end?

43:45.200 --> 43:46.600
God, let's hope so.

43:46.600 --> 43:47.600
That's an ambitious statement.

43:47.600 --> 43:52.040
Yeah, but at the same time, maybe four to six weeks is when you should have launched

43:52.040 --> 43:57.740
your system if that's the case but what do I know I'm just I'm just some guy

43:57.740 --> 44:04.200
with a broken Xbox all right uh sorry I couldn't resist but whereas you may be

44:04.200 --> 44:07.920
able to walk into a store and get one here though Loki what's going on other

44:07.920 --> 44:13.520
places Australia got all of Australia of course and they were supposed to get

44:13.520 --> 44:17.200
their 360s I believe in the beginning of March and now it's the end of March and

44:17.200 --> 44:25.000
And now it's, well, you might get some, you might get a couple, but there's gonna be shortages.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.360
All those shortages, because I guess they're not shipping Australia, they're just gonna

44:28.360 --> 44:30.440
be shipping the United States, you know, to make that-

44:30.440 --> 44:34.560
I was gonna say, they took all of Australia's consoles and took them back, tweaked them

44:34.560 --> 44:36.560
for US, put them out here.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Sorry guys.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.920
They're all, eh, Australia, eh, not very important.

44:40.920 --> 44:46.440
So I don't know, but um, so yeah, if you're looking to play the 360, you might as well

44:46.440 --> 44:51.360
save up for the Nintendo Revolution or the PS3 or something I don't know yeah

44:51.360 --> 44:55.540
the ps3 all right that should be coming out sometime maybe Microsoft will prove

44:55.540 --> 44:59.500
us wrong we would love to be wrong on this but otherwise if you're one of our

44:59.500 --> 45:03.180
Australia listeners make sure you've got a pre-order or something you're gonna be

45:03.180 --> 45:08.740
camping out if you want one of these systems bad enough or you know I'm not gonna

45:08.740 --> 45:13.780
hold it to them for that four to six week thing four to six weeks from when

45:13.780 --> 45:21.780
2007 I mean seriously what they sold 600,000 units in the first three months

45:21.780 --> 45:25.580
instead of three million yeah they're right on schedule

45:25.580 --> 45:29.620
jaded 2006 and our chat room says the shortages will actually last another four

45:29.620 --> 45:34.660
to six years I hope not that's that's when the Xbox 720 will be out by then or

45:34.660 --> 45:40.140
whatever they do next we hope we'll see yeah the Xbox 360 is very misleading

45:40.140 --> 45:43.460
because it makes you it makes it sound like you can rotate the system but we

45:43.460 --> 45:48.380
know happily. Alright, since we're traveling abroad right now, let's go

45:48.380 --> 45:54.440
over to the UK and go over to Dark Sakura for the UK report. It looks like

45:54.440 --> 46:00.840
the Grim Reaper has visited Gizmondo Europe. It's finally dead, kaput, and

46:00.840 --> 46:09.400
filing for bankruptcy. Gizmondo UK has been ordered to liquidate by the

46:09.400 --> 46:12.560
High Court. As part of this, the liquidators will probably have to sell

46:12.560 --> 46:18.320
off the company's assets watch out you know that means what discount gizmondo

46:18.320 --> 46:23.940
which means Jamie's gonna get one check your bargain bin dude I love I love the

46:23.940 --> 46:29.060
gizmondo that pisses me off cuz the gizmondo had some fun stuff on it I love

46:29.060 --> 46:32.380
that Johnny whatever game it was cute for a few minutes but it didn't it

46:32.380 --> 46:35.660
didn't generate enough interest for me I'm not I mean like if I were a video

46:35.660 --> 46:39.420
game collector like you or like a system collector like you are I might go run

46:39.420 --> 46:44.160
out and get one but I I'm gonna I'm gonna pass it's it's just so that when

46:44.160 --> 46:49.540
you're going up against the likes of Nintendo really you know we had our Neo

46:49.540 --> 46:54.200
Geo make it a little while and die over here Neo Geo pocket color probably the

46:54.200 --> 46:58.740
wondrous one never even came out over here probably announcing a console

46:58.740 --> 47:04.360
revision before you launch the console not a good idea well at any rate you

47:04.360 --> 47:08.480
know I feel awful for them because I talked with a few of the reps that were

47:08.480 --> 47:12.640
there at E3 and I thought they were just fabulous and I thought they really tried

47:12.640 --> 47:17.000
really hard to make this something that would appeal to people they believed in

47:17.000 --> 47:20.480
it and that's important but believe only get you so far

47:20.480 --> 47:26.160
that's too bad so it's kind of well maybe next time so what else is going on

47:26.160 --> 47:33.640
besides that well you know my heart still hurts over that though did you

47:33.640 --> 47:40.000
need a moment of silence for Gizmondo? Nah. Alright. Okay. Now the next thing is that

47:40.000 --> 47:49.000
Nintendo is pushing their Wi-Fi online services. Excuse me as I lose my voice. They're doing

47:49.000 --> 47:54.240
a video spot for the service which is going worldwide, showing worldwide head-to-head

47:54.240 --> 48:04.000
playability and it's sort of big news okay it's very epic yeah epic that's a

48:04.000 --> 48:11.760
good worldwide Wi-Fi by Nintendo Sunday Sunday Sunday with monster trucks but

48:11.760 --> 48:17.520
the are they really I mean what this raises to question is it are they really

48:17.520 --> 48:24.000
going for a worldwide market with that well I think as long as you get the big

48:24.000 --> 48:28.720
three it seems like as long as you get a big three Japan US UK the rest of it

48:28.720 --> 48:34.440
kind of falls into place I just I don't know you know I honestly think that I

48:34.440 --> 48:38.760
would love to see something like that go worldwide so that you know I have a lot

48:38.760 --> 48:42.360
of friends overseas you know I would really like to be able to sit down and

48:42.360 --> 48:45.200
play my games with my friends overseas if we can overcome the eight-hour time

48:45.200 --> 48:50.280
difference but other than that you know I think it would be I'm really hoping

48:50.280 --> 48:56.720
that that's their goal see it's thought-provoking truly epic oh my um

48:56.720 --> 49:02.400
also coming up mm-hmm release dates sweet because we like release dates

49:02.400 --> 49:11.280
because that means that stuff goes out so coming up on the 17th Frogger helmet

49:11.280 --> 49:17.280
chaos coming out on the DS this is again you can use guilty gear isuka I code

49:17.280 --> 49:23.480
being re-released on PS2. We have Mark Echo's Getting Up content under pressure, Shadow

of the Colossus, Shaman King Master of Spirits 2, SpongeBob SquarePants blah blah blah blah.

49:32.020 --> 49:36.760
Was that, did that blah blah blah stand for SpongeBob SquarePants who really gives a fuck?

49:36.760 --> 49:41.240
Exactly. And this is coming, it's the Yellow Avenger. I love SpongeBob but I could care

49:41.240 --> 49:45.520
less about the games. I'm like whoopty shit. Yeah, exactly. Also Super Monkey Ball Touch

49:45.520 --> 49:52.400
enroll which makes me happy Tom Clancy's rainbow six lockdown also coming out

49:52.400 --> 50:00.520
there's actually one on the 19th which is too tough mission Nadia on DS and

50:00.520 --> 50:05.680
since um we're gonna have a couple of issues with a you know show next week

50:05.680 --> 50:10.160
I'll go ahead and point to a few on the 24th uh-huh this is just the ones that

50:10.160 --> 50:12.060
that actually sort of pointed out in my head.

50:12.060 --> 50:15.160
Alien Hominid on the PC.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.960
America's Army, Rise of the Soldier on Xbox,

50:18.960 --> 50:22.540
Unk, Black, Bust-A-Move DS, Crash Day, EverQuest 2,

50:23.400 --> 50:27.280
Galactic Kingdoms 2, Colum, Mega Man, Maverick Hunter X,

50:27.280 --> 50:29.520
which I recommend to everybody in the universe to play

50:29.520 --> 50:30.720
because it's awesome.

50:30.720 --> 50:35.220
NARC, Omnimusha 3, Panzer Elite Action, and Project Zero 3.

50:36.100 --> 50:37.900
We also have Sea World Adventure,

50:37.900 --> 50:39.900
Chum is deep-sea adventure

50:41.420 --> 50:46.140
Loki what's going on with you or was that it? I'm sorry. We're you gonna do another week there. No, all right

50:46.480 --> 50:50.560
We'll go over to Loki for the u.s. Counterpart. What's coming up in the u.s. Release dates

50:51.220 --> 50:56.240
Lots of fun stuff my favorite full autos finally coming out on the Xbox 360

50:57.040 --> 50:59.040
we've also got

50:59.860 --> 51:01.860
Actually some of the very similar ones you

51:02.940 --> 51:04.620
super monkey ball

51:04.620 --> 51:05.760
touch

51:05.760 --> 51:11.240
The one for the DS which would be really cool. We've got I believe mark echoes getting up

51:11.940 --> 51:14.940
Supposedly is coming out. Hopefully because it keeps getting delayed

51:16.140 --> 51:18.900
Drakon guard too, which would be pretty sweet and

51:19.920 --> 51:21.920
I believe

51:22.560 --> 51:28.460
Those are the big ones for that week actually not there's a lot of smaller stuff

51:29.160 --> 51:34.280
But that's the main we don't care about the small stuff. They're all be tight unless there's a sleeper hit in there

51:34.280 --> 51:35.280
but then we'll talk about it later.

51:35.280 --> 51:39.600
Well, Dragon Guard II is going to be pretty sweet, I mean, everyone remembers the first

51:39.600 --> 51:40.600
one.

51:40.600 --> 51:41.600
No, I didn't.

51:41.600 --> 51:42.600
I never played it.

51:42.600 --> 51:48.460
Fine, it's like Panzer Dragoon crossed with Dynasty Warriors type of thing.

51:48.460 --> 51:52.960
So you have dragon combat and lots of, you know, people versus one person type of thing,

51:52.960 --> 51:56.600
and it'll be pretty cool.

51:56.600 --> 51:57.600
Sounds good.

51:57.600 --> 52:03.320
Alright, so let's go back over to Matt to talk about an old classic title coming back

52:03.320 --> 52:08.680
for a new resurgence what's going on here lemmings everybody remembers lemmings oh heck

52:08.680 --> 52:14.120
yeah lemmings i used to draw lemmings lemmings lemmings was awesome i used to have the old

52:14.120 --> 52:18.840
uh super nintendo one and it was also on the pc i had like super lemmings or something

52:18.840 --> 52:23.120
which wasn't as good but the game got kind of hard pretty quick i think maybe that's

52:23.120 --> 52:26.720
what it was i had on pc lemmings too i don't know so what's up with lemmings lemmings is

52:26.720 --> 52:33.640
is available for free to play over the Internet. What? What'd you say? Yes, you can actually,

52:33.640 --> 52:39.960
it's programmed in dhtml and you can play it if you have a pretty decent PC. Anyways,

52:39.960 --> 52:49.400
just head on over to www.elizium.nu slash scripts slash lemmings. Okay, I have a feeling

52:49.400 --> 52:53.800
this isn't endorsed by the official company, is it? Probably not. This isn't a domain that's

52:53.800 --> 52:58.360
I'm kind of thinking this isn't endorsed by the original company.

52:58.360 --> 53:03.120
But basically all you need is just a modern browser, you know, it'll work with most recent

53:03.120 --> 53:07.720
versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla, and Opera.

53:07.720 --> 53:13.080
And a 500 plus megahertz processor, which, you know, if you've got any computer that's

53:13.080 --> 53:17.920
like within this decade, you probably can run this, so sweet.

53:17.920 --> 53:21.040
Some comments from the chatroom there, www.orangelaundry.com.

53:21.040 --> 53:26.880
Tomokun says, that's my earliest gaming memory is Lemmings, aww.

53:26.880 --> 53:31.620
And then vxjasonxv, holy futs, awesome.

53:31.620 --> 53:36.800
Just some people doing the bard makes a little XD face over Lemmings, so definitely a title

53:36.800 --> 53:39.280
that's fond, very fond with some people.

53:39.280 --> 53:43.200
If I may say so, I'd also like to give a shout out to the bard.

53:43.200 --> 53:44.200
We were college roommates.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.200
Wow, alright, cool.

53:45.200 --> 53:50.160
I'm glad you finally got to listen to the show.

53:50.160 --> 53:57.560
Okay. Oh now look that we lost Loki. He's over there playing lemmings. Look at that. Stop it. Stop it, but turn off the crack

53:58.560 --> 54:04.680
Remember it only hurts the ones you love and you eventually because you'll have lose liver function from playing lemmings

54:04.680 --> 54:07.160
Oh and somebody had to make the real bad pun

54:07.800 --> 54:13.560
Xander in our chat room just started singing we are the lemmings on the run that you know the song from in the groove

54:13.560 --> 54:15.040
I forget it

54:15.040 --> 54:17.040
Nerd, all right

54:17.040 --> 54:23.040
Moving on, I want to talk about this story. This is kind of interesting.

54:23.040 --> 54:28.440
A solitaire game got a New York City worker

54:28.440 --> 54:32.000
fired this week. Here's what happened. Office assistant

54:32.000 --> 54:35.760
Edward Greenwood IX, if you can believe it,

54:35.760 --> 54:40.080
was going over papers at his desk when the mayor, Michael Bloomberg,

54:40.080 --> 54:44.200
made the rounds and he was with a photographer and posing for pictures and

54:44.200 --> 54:44.640
stuff.

54:44.640 --> 54:49.000
The mayor got to Greenwood and they shook hands and the photographer snapped

54:49.000 --> 54:52.080
the photo but the mayor noticed that

54:52.080 --> 54:55.680
Greenwood had a game of solitaire up on the screen after the picture was taken

54:55.680 --> 54:59.800
so the guy got fired for playing solitaire

54:59.800 --> 55:04.140
and Bloomberg said the workplace is not an appropriate place for games

55:04.140 --> 55:07.600
it's a place where you've got to do the job that you're getting paid for

55:07.600 --> 55:10.920
Greenwood's response, Greenwood by the way earned

55:10.920 --> 55:15.800
$27,000 a year and had worked in the office for six years.

55:15.800 --> 55:20.520
He said, it wasn't like I spent hours and hours a day playing because I had plenty to

55:20.520 --> 55:21.520
do.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.440
If I had been working at something exhaustively for two hours, I might get a cup of coffee

55:25.440 --> 55:28.680
and play for a minute, but then go right back to my work.

55:28.680 --> 55:32.820
He also said in the interview that he kept his playtime to his one hour lunch or during

55:32.820 --> 55:36.520
his quick breaks when he needed a moment of distraction, or it sounds like in there then

55:36.520 --> 55:40.040
he said maybe he'll play for a minute and get back into his work.

55:40.040 --> 55:42.880
So two things that surprised me about this story.

55:42.880 --> 55:46.040
One, he only made $27,000 a year

55:46.040 --> 55:47.400
and he lives in the New York City area.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.240
My God.

55:48.240 --> 55:50.400
He's probably living in a really crap apartment.

55:50.400 --> 55:51.760
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy,

55:51.760 --> 55:54.040
because that's not a great salary.

55:54.040 --> 55:56.800
I mean, I thought people in that area had to make more,

55:56.800 --> 55:58.020
so I'm sorry, dude.

55:59.020 --> 56:00.040
But what do you think?

56:00.040 --> 56:01.880
The second part that's surprising is that,

56:01.880 --> 56:04.560
is this just a case of bad timing?

56:04.560 --> 56:06.820
Was the mayor just trying to save his butt

56:06.820 --> 56:09.260
because he got a, you know, somebody snapped a picture

56:09.260 --> 56:14.180
He didn't want making an example of him. I guess you know, you know at my work

56:14.180 --> 56:19.540
We actually have an internet workstation set up just for you steering brakes

56:19.540 --> 56:25.360
But they've actually been really cracking down about they don't even put the games on our systems. They're removed from our whole setup

56:25.900 --> 56:33.300
A lot of places are cracking down about having private files on on your computer about even your desktop wallpaper

56:33.300 --> 56:39.420
right you know it's really these computers are for work use only right if

56:39.420 --> 56:43.940
you want to play a game do it during your break and bring a Game Boy with you

56:43.940 --> 56:48.600
you know that's what I do I play my DS in the break room it's you know what you

56:48.600 --> 56:51.660
talk about kind of like the managed application network and that's a very

56:51.660 --> 56:54.220
similar thing at the place where I work is that they don't have solitaire and

56:54.220 --> 56:57.940
stuff because it's a managed application distribution system so you only have

56:57.940 --> 57:01.560
access to the programs that you need but one of those programs in my company you

57:01.560 --> 57:05.480
need to do your job is Internet Explorer. And of course, people find their way over

57:05.480 --> 57:10.720
to games.yahoo and some of that other stuff and they play Bejeweled and stuff. So I see

57:10.720 --> 57:13.960
people doing this on their breaks at my work a lot.

57:13.960 --> 57:14.960
Those are blocked at my work.

57:14.960 --> 57:15.960
Interesting.

57:15.960 --> 57:20.600
What they need to understand is he was playing Solitaire, and he's fired for playing Solitaire

57:20.600 --> 57:24.640
because Solitaire is a crappy game. And the mayor was trying to make an example, if you're

57:24.640 --> 57:27.640
going to play games at my work, god damn it, it's not going to be this piece of shit game.

57:27.640 --> 57:30.720
You better play Minesweeper. You need to be playing Minesweeper.

57:30.720 --> 57:32.720
Solitaire is so

57:33.600 --> 57:38.520
1990 okay, I think it's just as the simple fact that and actually this is an issue

57:38.520 --> 57:43.640
I have about the American workplace in general, you know, I believe that it's in them

57:43.640 --> 57:49.320
I want to say in the Netherlands they offer you something like four months mandatory mandatory vacation

57:49.320 --> 57:55.760
No four weeks mandatory vacation time you are required by law right to take your vacation, right?

57:55.760 --> 57:58.800
Here, you can roll over your vacation to the next year,

57:58.800 --> 58:01.200
store it up, but you can only retain like five days of it

58:01.200 --> 58:02.360
or something like that.

58:02.360 --> 58:06.360
You know, they focus on time is productivity

58:06.360 --> 58:09.280
instead of healthy workers are more productive workers.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.080
What about the guy's concept of a micro break

58:12.080 --> 58:14.960
where he says, you know, I just do it for a minute.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.120
I mean, in a productivity world,

58:18.120 --> 58:19.880
let's say, I don't know what this guy's job was,

58:19.880 --> 58:21.920
but let's say he was in an environment where he had,

58:21.920 --> 58:25.360
let's say you work a job where you process applications

58:25.360 --> 58:29.180
and you have to do fifty applications a day. As long as I'm meeting my fifty

58:29.180 --> 58:30.360
applications a day,

58:30.360 --> 58:34.240
where's the harm in a little solitaire here and there? Well, it's like the people

58:34.240 --> 58:37.520
at various places that I've been at are rewarded for having over

58:37.520 --> 58:38.920
100% productivity.

58:38.920 --> 58:42.580
I, on average, have over 100% productivity, and I get up

58:42.580 --> 58:46.720
all the time and, you know, go to the bathroom. You're a total slacker.

58:46.720 --> 58:50.760
I'm not a slacker. But just the thing is,

58:50.760 --> 58:55.040
that really gets me about that, in a lot of places new hire training will

58:55.040 --> 58:59.400
actually say take a take a five-minute break for every hour that you look at

58:59.400 --> 59:04.480
the computer ergonomics people will tell you this rest your eyes every every you

59:04.480 --> 59:08.320
know hour or so for about five minutes so that you will not cause permanent

59:08.320 --> 59:12.720
damage that's why we have such a high rate of people who have to go into the

59:12.720 --> 59:17.400
doctor and go and stress leave and on medication you bring you bring up a very

59:17.400 --> 59:22.560
good point because I I'm a corporate trainer is what I do for a living and I

59:22.560 --> 59:24.400
I teach big classes that usually go on

59:24.400 --> 59:25.880
for a several week period,

59:25.880 --> 59:28.180
and I usually tell my students,

59:28.180 --> 59:31.160
look, on your breaks, you shouldn't be on the internet,

59:31.160 --> 59:33.760
because I allow them to do it when they're on their breaks,

59:33.760 --> 59:35.460
but I say, you know what, you really need to go up,

59:35.460 --> 59:38.280
go outside, walk around the building,

59:38.280 --> 59:40.600
go get coffee or something, get away from the computer,

59:40.600 --> 59:42.900
because this is where you are the rest of the day,

59:42.900 --> 59:44.960
and to kind of support that,

59:44.960 --> 59:47.180
and then, of course, I totally go against what I say,

59:47.180 --> 59:48.560
because I have to catch up on my own emails

59:48.560 --> 59:51.340
during break usually, but you know what they do, though,

59:51.340 --> 59:52.740
sometimes, and I've seen people do this,

59:52.740 --> 59:55.420
is that I've seen people will be,

59:55.420 --> 59:57.980
I don't catch them on it, but I know they're doing it,

59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.500
because I'll walk around and suddenly somebody

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.000
hits a button real fast and it looks like

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:02.980
their screen flickered.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.820
I know what they're doing.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.420
They're taking down the game they were just playing

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:06.860
or the email they were just writing.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.300
People get sneaky with this stuff.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.360
It's very interesting.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.940
It's the corporate technology world.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.900
It's just the whole thing.

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.140
People will work through their breaks.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.380
I know lots of people who just work through their breaks

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.240
because they're so worried about their level

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.280
productivity about not having enough hours in the day to you know get their

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.380
work done who work overtime without getting paid for it take your break I

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:36.140
was getting migraines daily at work when I was working that way and I was upset

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.820
with my job now I take a break I go play video games in the break room I play on

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:46.020
my DS my level of stress has gone down considerably I haven't been as sick you

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.420
know people need to take that time for themselves that's why I think that

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:52.100
having you know a portable game system with you at work. Wait a minute though, you're going from

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.140
looking at a computer screen to looking at a DS

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.500
isn't that? But the fact is that you are not working. Okay.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.940
You are. It's a different focus in your eyes I guess. It's a different focus. It is something, it is non

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.380
stressful work. I mean it's not necessarily work but you're

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:08.800
you're giving yourself a new distraction that is allowing your mind to think in a

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:09.700
different direction.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:12.680
Loki, I'm curious if you have anything to add to this because you work in an

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.300
environment where it is about games and you guys are

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.860
part of your job is being familiar with video games, which is kind of interesting.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.380
Yeah, I read a lot of sites, but usually while I'm

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.340
working, I'll spend the first half an hour a day checking up on all the news sites

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:32.380
and posting them on our forums. But still, though, I have to know all the stuff that's

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.780
going on because

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.660
like, I'll find out what date changes before we even hear about them.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:41.420
You know, I'll be like, hey, they just made a press release that this has changed dates,

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.180
check into it, and then we'll get the update for it.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:50.900
Or, well also then, we usually take our 15 minute breaks in a 6 player deathmatch in

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:54.760
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, so.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:02.140
I can't really comment on the going outside and getting coffee and stuff.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.960
I have to go to the chat room because the chat room is just lighting up with feedback

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
on this here.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.520
Bugs in our chat room, he says, if there's a flippin' photo shoot in your cube, close

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.480
that shit.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.480
That's true.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.200
being corrected by SSJ 100 Matt who says you can live fine in New York City

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.240
making $30,000 a year so I stand corrected on that I I thought I always

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.760
thought the cost of living was way way higher there but I guess you know New

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.520
York City is a great place so I guess it's one of those things we're like you

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.700
know if you can sacrifice see I need my space I need a huge apartment so but

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.720
you can sacrifice a little bit of that then you know it works out so I hope

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.400
nobody was offended by that comment cuz I really didn't mean any offense I was

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.720
just really surprised I thought you really had to make I was gonna have more

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.480
I have a friend who just moved to New York about maybe six months ago who was complaining about

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:52.720
Having a one-bedroom apartment for you know paying 1200 for it, which is what I pay for a house. Yeah, yeah, so it's interesting

01:02:53.560 --> 01:03:00.360
Let's see I like this mini me 283 says you know once upon a time solitaire used to be played with real cards

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.840
Very good point you got to be what if he had actually had the cards out on his desk

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.920
Would it would the same thing have happened if he had had playing cards out on his fired?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.760
Do you think he would have still been fired? Yeah? I don't think he would have been I

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.600
I think you would have been, because it's still a use of company time.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.480
Interesting.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:22.080
Let's see. Back in the day we used to play Minesweeper with real mines.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:27.460
Hitstun says, yeah, don't use the work PC for games, use something else like a cell

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.080
phone.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.960
Because a lot of cell phones have games, so even if you don't have a DS, you probably have a cell

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.360
phone.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.680
We have to have our cell phones put away. It would depend on your work environment, because

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.120
you're in a call center type area, right? Well, no, I don't work at the call center.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:40.920
I work over

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.060
in one of our production departments.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.880
Very interesting. But I did get

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.960
permission to text message my mother all day when Hurricane Katrina hit.

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.540
Well, that stuff's different, you know, obviously. And you want to know what? I still had a

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.420
hundred and ten percent productivity that day.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.800
Wow. Alright, moving on.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.760
Now you're just bragging. You're a show-off over there. No, it means that you can

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.300
still take time for yourself and still get all your work done.

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.740
Alright, one thing that Jamie has plenty of time for, can still get all her work

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.740
done is checking our mailbag over at OrangeloungeRadio.com

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.580
Send us emails, we love getting emails. It's mailbag

01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:22.220
at OrangeloungeRadio.com and when you guys send in your emails

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.980
DarkSakura reads them and then she'll print some of the ones she likes out

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.820
and put them on her fridge. I post them in my cubicle. And then she'll throw darts at them.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:35.120
Yeah, uncertain ones. Alright, so let's go over to the mailbag, open that stuff up over

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.580
there

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:40.540
And see what you folks have to say this week dark Sakura. What's in the mail bag this week?

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:46.600
I have once again received a bajillion emails, so I'm taking the eight most relevant ones. Oh, it's a lot

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.740
Let's get started. Okay first room Chupa thingy. I love that name. That's cool

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:58.740
I I received feedback last week that I need to stop saying hi so and so so I'll just I'll just kind of smile

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:04.420
Yo, what up know that when Jamie read your name? I'm smiling instead of saying hi Chupa things

01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:09.080
so I'll just I'm smiling hey Griff chupa thingy all right okay read the

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:15.560
email all right man you don't snap me today I would like to say I'm fed up

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.320
with Joseph Lieberman's crap I've written emails to my state senators max

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.720
I'm trying to pronounce that Bacchus and Conrad Burns asking them not to buy into

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.680
senator Lieberman's ideals and to reject video game banning laws I don't know if

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.200
I will get a form letter or not however even if nothing is done about it it was

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.940
still worth the effort keep fighting the good fight that is very good you know

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:44.820
for all the people who just sit and go I don't like this yeah do something about

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:49.380
it you've got senators write them you know you want your voice heard you need

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.340
to make it heard agreed I have nothing else say agreed so a bajillion kudos go

01:05:54.340 --> 01:06:01.260
to you that's awesome a winner is you also our dear friend Rob the one that's

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.100
Not you.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:02.920
Yeah, I know.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:03.760
The other Rob.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:04.600
Rob with two B's.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.420
That's how you know the difference.

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.260
Rob with two B's.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.080
Rob with two B's.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.420
Sent a list of vaporware from 2005.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.940
Which I think is pretty cool.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.340
And I am loading it as it was a link in the email.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:18.180
But some of the ones that came up,

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.720
there was the Optimus keyboard.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:25.560
There were,

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.560
They actually said the PowerBook G5 was ineligible.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.360
Wait, so clarify this for me.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360
This is like a list.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.360
It's like the top.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.320
I seem to remember I read a similar article, or maybe it was even the same one, just inadvertently

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320
this week.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.760
It was something like a top list of the top vaporware we didn't see or something like

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:45.760
that.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.760
Yeah.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.760
Okay, okay.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760
I get it.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.080
Number 10 was the high definition TiVo and TiVo to go for Mac.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.440
Number nine, AlphaGrip ergonomic keyboard and trackball, which actually looks kind of

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:01.560
neat but it like it was way too looks too unwieldy and next up soon as it

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.300
loads by the way this is on wired news a blu-ray or HD DVD discs for the end of

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:13.860
2005 which we didn't see Team Fortress 2 Brotherhood of Arms Legend of Zelda

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.300
Twilight Princess thank you that was number six should be number one well

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:22.980
let's see what we'll see what else they came up with well you know we all drooled

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:26.380
over that at E3.

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380
What is number one, Loki?

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.160
What do you think number one is before we get there?

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.900
I would say probably Duke Nukem Forever since it's been in production for ten years.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.580
But see, it's the running gag now.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.580
You don't put that on a two.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:36.580
Alright, keep going.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.580
Let's see, we'll find out.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.020
Okay, number five, Starcraft Ghost.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.020
Number four.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:41.020
Oh, good call.

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:42.020
Yeah.

01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:44.300
Number four, Microsoft's Vista and Internet Explorer 7.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.940
However, in its defense, the beta for 7 did come out last year.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:50.220
And I'm hearing Firefox is still better.

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.220
I know the same thing because I was up on the beta for a little bit.

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.220
It's still crap.

01:07:56.220 --> 01:08:00.220
Three, Google, betas galore.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.220
Oh, that's true. Their email is still considered beta, isn't it?

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:08.220
Gmail is still beta. Frugal is still beta. Alerts, blog search, book search, scholar.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:14.220
Google News is the last beta left, but it was still beta in 2005.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.220
Good point then. Okay, that's a good one.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:21.100
Also, um, we're up to number two

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.420
phantom

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:30.440
The phantom not a surprise. But yeah, we all expected that and number one, you know what here have another cookie

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.660
Cuz number one is Duke Nukem forever. No, I

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.660
Stand corrected no cookie for me. Just kidding. Give me a damn cookie

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:44.820
I know my cookies. These are my sugar-free gluten-free cookies. Give me a cookie. They're actually pretty yummy. Yeah, it tastes like dough. All right

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:48.900
So, yeah, um

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Excuse me

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:54.220
back to the

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.060
lovely fantastic and mystical world of email

01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:03.740
Krispy Kreme writes in and said okay. So once the actual subject of this is personal game rules

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:13.740
Okay, so every once in a while, I'll play Naruto 3 for PS2 with my brother, and we've set up this rule where you can't push someone into a corner and attack them continually, preventing them from moving.

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.740
I was wondering if you guys have any rules you set up with whoever you play with to make the game fair.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:18.740
No snaking!

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:23.740
I was just thinking the same thing. No snaking on Mario Kart DS.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740
Ooh, gosh, that's so broad.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:28.740
Do not pull up people's radishes in Animal Crossing.

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:32.740
There's so many different games I could think of.

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:39.740
of, you know there's general courtesy laws that come with a lot of MMOs, certainly, you

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:43.500
know, things about courtesy, like, you know, especially in a group, you know, even though

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:47.020
I was kind of ragging on the group element of Final Fantasy XI earlier, to kind of go

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.740
back there for a little bit, Final Fantasy XI has such a heavy grouping element that

01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:56.140
it's like, you know, everybody has their role and so and so pulls these kind of monsters

01:09:56.140 --> 01:09:57.140
and there's thrust there.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.580
When the white mage says, get your ass over here, you do it.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.520
Exactly, exactly, those types of things.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.680
So I'm trying to think of games like Mario Party and stuff.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.640
If we were talking board games, I'd have a lot, because we change the rules on board

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.280
games all the time, but video games, it's harder to change the rules.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.960
Every so often when we play Super Smash Brothers Melee, we call a no sleep rule.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:20.360
Oh, you can't use the Jigglypuff thing?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360
Yeah.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.360
Okay.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360
Alright, well those are some good ones.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.480
And there's actually, sometimes we play with a no Jigglypuff rule at all, because Jigglypuff's

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.480
annoying.

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.800
I'll keep an eye on the chatroom while you read the next email.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.800
I usually end up not being allowed to play Kirby.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.800
Cause I piss people off when I play Kirby.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800
People get pissed off when I play Ness cause I sit in the corner and go

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.800
P.K. Fire! P.K. Fire! P.K. Fire! P.K. Fire!

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.800
P.K. Fame!

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.800
Alright.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.800
Um, I also got one that was actually sent to mailbox but it's supposed to be mailbag.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.800
Um.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.800
That's right cause our awesome webmaster Jason digs that stuff out of the black hole of death

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.800
where those emails go to when they go to the wrong address and forwards them appropriately.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.800
So thank Jason.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.440
there's a an email sent more about

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.560
flowers for Jack okay I'm just

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.920
making a mention on oh yeah we have flowers for Jack stuff coming up later

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.360
so

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.360
yeah so I'm gonna leave that just that you know what

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.800
forget him I am only addressing it for the sake of

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.240
he just pisses me off so much alright so that email gets tossed

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.600
sorta and we also have

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.960
um, an email from um,

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.600
and he wanted me to do the name a certain way, from uh,

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.680
Happyda. It's a pretty long email so I'm just gonna go over,

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.320
I'm gonna quote certain points on it. Says, hey guys, love the new format, I listen when I'm

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.120
at work and it's gotten pretty tough to find

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.320
enough quality podcasts to get me through the whole day, especially since

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.360
Air America has gone to charging for its podcasts.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:52.320
Did they really? I guess so. Not smart, not smart.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.000
And the fact that we've extended the podcast at least another hour is great more for me. That's what he says

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.700
I'm curious as to what this music-oriented gaming show was all about

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.120
Being a strictly podcast listener for the past year so I can never catch it live with my schedule

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:12.160
We're looking into options about putting out the old shows either for

01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:18.000
Consumption on some type of archive like CD DVD the problem is because there was a lot of copyrighted music that came with that

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.600
So it's kind of hard for us to do that. We are also looking into possibilities possibly

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.160
syndicating our show we don't really run the archives with DDR freak anymore

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.640
because our shows podcast so kind of defeats the purpose but we may look into

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:35.380
a syndication agreement with somebody at some point for the earlier episodes

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:41.440
anything is possible also with us possibly being gone next week we don't

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.060
have a contingency plan in place just yet because we live week to week just

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:50.400
like we live paycheck to paycheck so we may have a best of so you can hear some

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400
of the highlights from the live show I think that might actually be a really

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.160
good idea to put together some of our highlights from the old three-hour show

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.000
like because you know there's still people that haven't heard Loki play

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.600
karaoke revolution and we need to put that out to the podcast masses I'm glad

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.520
I wasn't in San Diego sleeping in the Harry Potter closet um you know what

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:14.060
it's I think this new format we stay on topic a lot more than we did with the

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:19.420
old one but that can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing so I don't

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.260
I don't know.

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.300
That's all I have to say about that for now.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:24.500
Hopefully you'll be able to see it later on.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.700
Those files are not deleted.

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.540
They're out there.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.980
We've been trying to collect them.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.620
There's some episodes that did, for whatever reason,

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.620
get lost forever, but we have folks,

01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.500
we have diehard listeners like Misty and Angel or two,

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.660
I think, off the top of my head,

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.340
and I think Jaded, to some extent, too,

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:42.660
that purposely archived the live stuff and saved them all

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.900
and are trying to build up archives.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.900
So post something on the forums.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:46.900
You might be able to find somebody

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.460
who's willing to share some old stuff,

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.920
and we're okay with that if you wanna bootleg it.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.240
Well the second paragraph pertains to you.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.200
Uh oh.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.500
Anyway to the topic at hand,

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.160
well not really a topic I guess,

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.640
I just wanted to point out that Rob has in fact

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.180
mentioned he was gay during last year's E3.

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.600
Which is true, you did.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.000
Oh, okay.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.240
It was on stage during Jay Allard's keynote speech

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.480
when he rushed on stage and yelled,

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.360
okay now I'll be serious.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.360
That one cracked me up.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:13.800
I think it was when he was talking about

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.680
getting some autographs from fans of the G4 people

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.160
and I'm pretty sure it was Morgan Webb

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.100
what she told the autographs it wasn't for him and she said jokingly something

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.840
along the lines of sure as any just wanted a picture of her or something

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.700
nothing too important but you guys were bitching about consistency in World of

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:35.560
Warcraft so I thought I'd call you guys on it I guess I stand corrected but also

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:42.340
do realize our show we weren't on iTunes when we did the e3 thing we weren't on

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.820
iTunes I don't think because iTunes happened in June I want to say and

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.860
And that's, for all the podcasts,

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:49.480
when iTunes rolled out their podcast name,

01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.300
I think that's when a lot of these shows got huge,

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.900
so maybe that's why I think a lot of people,

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.260
because I did get a lot of emails from people

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.200
who didn't know it before, so, you know, whatever, I don't.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.840
No, she means we don't pay attention to you.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:02.120
I don't know, whatever.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.720
It's a little detail, I mean, okay.

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:07.560
So I got served by a listener, whatever, I don't care.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:11.680
Next up, anyhow, on the topic of emulation and finding ROMs,

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.980
not that everyone here would do such an evil thing,

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.520
I've heard you can find a lot of great ROM sets via torrent sites.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.760
In fact, most everything on there are complete sets for different ROM systems.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:28.880
Something too complete if you're not interested in foreign games that are basically the same

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.280
thing or you can't understand the language anyway.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.920
You might be pretty successful in finding the odd cult classic or insanely popular ROM

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.280
here and there, but 90% of the time, they're sets.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.780
Just wanted to throw out some info, as I totally agree with you that ROM sites are 9 times

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:47.660
out of 10 BS sites just trying to get more votes on useless topless hits on

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:53.780
their hentai banners talk about the total scum sites of the internet like

01:15:53.780 --> 01:16:00.300
the bottom of the barrel sites the just hideously horrible things on the

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.680
internet I can't think of enough negative words to describe these sites

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:07.500
are these top so-and-so sites I shouldn't label all because maybe

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.640
there's a couple that are okay but I'm you know what I'm talking about you know

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:18.200
like top 50 ROM sites top 10 Nintendo ROM sites top 69 porno sites you know

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.800
it's it's I what about banners banners banners banners I will go ahead and name

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:28.520
one of the sites I go through for old searches sure as a so far as domain as a

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:34.560
far net yeah yeah pH AR I'm still going as last I checked one of the best and

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.560
ROMNation.net

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.560
I believe

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.560
.net.com

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.560
I remember surfing Zofar's domain

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.560
like when Zofar was actually still there

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.560
years and years ago

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.560
I remember the International House of ROMs

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.560
Alright, anyway

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.560
Before we age ourselves

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.560
I do have one request and that is just call me

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.560
Happyda, as in

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:58.560
email address, I'm not gonna list

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560
I don't want to have the ladies to start stalking

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.560
me from my lead emailing skills

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.440
But please give a shout out to ARC and tell everyone to give some damn blood for goodness

01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:08.440
sakes.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.440
Free cookies and pop.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.440
It's a win-win for everyone.

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.440
Wait a minute.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.440
Is that a local thing or?

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.600
It's someone who actually emailed from the Red Cross.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Oh.

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:20.600
Red Cross worker.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.600
Wow.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.600
Sweet.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.680
So, that's a...

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:28.120
Because that acronym made me think of something local.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:29.120
I'm sorry.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.120
Yeah.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:31.120
ARC.

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.120
My college.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:37.880
get it okay I get it now whoo so yeah but that mean actually I find that very

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.980
cool I actually am not allowed to get blood anymore why because I actually

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:47.000
tested positive for certain antibodies hmm that means I can't get blood anymore

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.280
that and I hallucinated well you'll just have to give a lot of sweat and tears

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.720
instead all right I will they'll be happy to accept your cookie donations

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.440
all right that it that's that's all the mail well I'm actually one of our

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.680
listeners Justin wanted to know the name of the title we use for the FUs of the Week.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.560
It's the one wing angel theme from Final Fantasy Advent Children.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:10.520
Yes, and the FUs of the Week will be coming up in the next segment.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:11.520
And last one?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.520
Yep.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.320
It's a message from, I'm going to go by Jaded.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.960
Well, you may have already gotten some of this already.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.700
Actually, I know you have gotten some of this before, but it's on the whole video game thing.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:27.440
There's an article I found on Slashdot that might be interesting.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:35.080
pulling that up. Video gaming keeps the brain from aging and is basically

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.440
stating that a body of research suggests that playing video games provides

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.760
similar benefits to bilingualism and exercising the mind. Just as people

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.240
fluent in two languages learn to suppress one language while speaking the

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.480
other, so too are gamers adept at shutting out distractions to deftly

01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:52.040
switch attention between different tasks. A new study of a hundred university

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:55.680
students in Toronto has found out that video gamers consistently outperform

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.880
their non-playing peers in a series of tricky mental tests.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:03.500
If they also happened to be bilingual, they were unbeatable.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.160
I actually have found similar studies to that effect.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.960
There was one in one of the psychological journals that I was reading when I was stuck

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.560
in my doctor's office that they let me keep.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:21.160
It was talking about how gamers have a better grasp of multitasking and puzzle, basically,

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160
problem solving skills.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.680
I'm all for stories that say games can make you smart

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.980
But I do think it really depends on what kind of games you're playing too. That's a huge part of it. So anyway

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.580
Alright, so is that it for the mailbag? Was that eight? Yep. We're good. All right, you want to send in good

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:38.440
I want to send in some email mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.040
let's close up the old mailbag and get back into some news and

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:48.240
One more thing for you guys before we go to break this kind of relates to an email bag question because it

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.840
that asked about what was the music gaming live show like.

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.740
This is a story that definitely would have been brought up on that show.

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:57.480
We're not turning our back on the music game scene.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.480
We know a lot of you guys are still listening.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.760
We love music games, love them, love them.

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:06.320
What's going on with DDR Extreme, the little title, DDR Extreme?

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:11.400
Yeah, everybody, you know, remembers, you know, similar kind of thing with the hot coffee

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.560
with stuff that's left in the game that not supposed to be in there, but it was in there

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.260
like people found memories and people were like wondering, how the hell are we gonna

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:20.260
unlock memories?

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.540
And for those who don't know, Memories is a song that was in the arcade that should

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.400
have been in the home version but wasn't.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400
Yes.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:32.880
Well, there has been a code breaker code released for it and this code breaker is kind of like

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.580
a GameShark type of device where you use it for cheating.

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:52.100
you just enter this code in and it's 2A59D741F1A5E096. Enter that in on a version 7.0 or higher code

01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:58.460
record because most of them are higher than that. And it will unlock memories. Everything

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.780
including it being in the song wheel, actually having unlock information in the information

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:08.300
scream all you have to do is save your game and you're done it's permanently

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:13.540
unlocked Wow I want to know how somebody found that how did somebody find that

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:19.380
code carefully I guess I guess so well kudos to you and kudos to Aaron Japan

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.380
where way to squeeze out an extra song from DDR extreme which came out what two

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:32.220
years ago now yeah yeah all right hey it's increased playability all right now

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.220
Now I'm eating cookies over here. You're gonna make me fat, Dark Sakura.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.220
No, I'm not. These are healthy cookies, huh?

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.220
Okay, these cookies are the most awesome cookies in the universe,

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:47.220
because they're no sugar added, no trans fat, and taste great.

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:50.220
I shop at the natural food store.

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:55.220
Alright. Well, we're gonna go to a quick break here and eat some more cookies,

01:21:55.220 --> 01:22:01.220
and we'll be back in a little while with part B of our podcast.
