00:20.013 --> 00:25.395
[SPEAKER_01]: A variety of Nintendo DS updates, and just in time for Valentine's Day, a review of sexy video games.

00:33.177 --> 00:36.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.478 --> 00:40.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are again, live for another week on Sunday night.

00:40.698 --> 00:45.879
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, we also reach out to the world at your convenience via our podcast stream.

00:45.899 --> 00:49.140
[SPEAKER_03]: It all happens at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is February 12th, 2006 and it's episode number 174.

00:54.141 --> 00:57.961
[SPEAKER_03]: With me, Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, are my lovely co-hosts.

00:58.301 --> 01:00.702
[SPEAKER_03]: In that corner, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.162 --> 01:01.742
[SPEAKER_05]: I love salad.

01:02.382 --> 01:02.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Mmm, salad.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.043
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of salad do you have tonight?

01:04.363 --> 01:12.846
[SPEAKER_05]: I have spinach and tofu and egg and cheese and carrots and black beans and craisins and balsamic vinegar.

01:12.866 --> 01:13.606
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a hell of a salad.

01:13.646 --> 01:14.066
[SPEAKER_03]: And granola.

01:14.086 --> 01:14.906
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff in there.

01:15.486 --> 01:16.247
[SPEAKER_05]: And yummy stuff.

01:16.347 --> 01:18.147
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say to people that go, ew, tofu?

01:19.348 --> 01:20.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever had good tofu?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really have good tofu?

01:22.769 --> 01:25.610
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like miso soup, which has tofu in it.

01:25.630 --> 01:26.930
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of my favorite kinds of soup.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Tofu, it all depends on what you cook it with.

01:29.935 --> 01:31.276
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm making homemade tofu.

01:31.556 --> 01:32.597
[SPEAKER_05]: Not tofu.

01:32.617 --> 01:33.197
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't make tofu.

01:33.958 --> 01:35.659
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm making homemade miso this week.

01:35.879 --> 01:37.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever had a tofu turkey?

01:37.100 --> 01:38.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I used to date a vegan.

01:38.481 --> 01:38.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:38.621 --> 01:39.762
[SPEAKER_03]: And one year I got a tofu turkey.

01:40.283 --> 01:44.386
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually eat tofurkey on my sandwiches.

01:44.746 --> 01:45.907
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've become a vegetarian.

01:45.927 --> 01:49.289
[SPEAKER_05]: I ate meat for the first time last night in like two and a half weeks.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.632
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we were at Hard Rock Cafe.

01:53.272 --> 01:53.772
[SPEAKER_05]: It made me sick.

01:53.792 --> 01:54.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

01:54.453 --> 01:54.553
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

01:55.171 --> 01:56.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Hard Rock Cafe is pretty good, though.

01:56.291 --> 01:57.072
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been there in a long time.

01:57.272 --> 01:57.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:57.592 --> 01:58.832
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a 22-ounce bath, too.

01:58.852 --> 01:59.252
[SPEAKER_05]: It was yummy.

01:59.432 --> 02:00.513
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a video game podcast.

02:00.533 --> 02:00.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

02:00.993 --> 02:02.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to turn into Food Network there suddenly.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, Tech Master Loki, bring us back to speed here.

02:05.274 --> 02:05.794
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

02:06.294 --> 02:06.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

02:06.874 --> 02:07.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

02:08.275 --> 02:08.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good week?

02:09.295 --> 02:09.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:09.615 --> 02:10.195
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:10.736 --> 02:11.936
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to bring it up because...

02:12.336 --> 02:13.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

02:25.818 --> 02:28.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutting six onions is, you know, you gotta get used to it, I guess.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.440
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really cook, like, ever.

02:31.821 --> 02:32.921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a miracle to cook.

02:33.101 --> 02:34.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, French onion soup's easy.

02:34.362 --> 02:36.562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just onion and beef broth.

02:36.722 --> 02:37.543
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's all it is.

02:37.563 --> 02:39.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's like, I can make onion dip.

02:40.144 --> 02:42.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pour the soup mix in the sour cream.

02:42.065 --> 02:42.585
[SPEAKER_03]: That's easy.

02:44.185 --> 02:45.366
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm drinking fermented tea.

02:46.016 --> 02:48.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Grand Theft Auto.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, haven't gotten a chance to play much of my 360 this week because I've been really busy.

03:12.171 --> 03:14.912
[SPEAKER_02]: And haven't really been able to snatch the TV away from people.

03:16.112 --> 03:22.694
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been playing the full auto demo, which just to kind of warm us up to full auto, which I'll be getting on Tuesday.

03:22.814 --> 03:28.536
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will be a very happy Valentine's Day with full auto.

03:29.056 --> 03:30.036
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, all right.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.406
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing really weird things on Valentine's Day this year.

03:33.446 --> 03:38.070
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw a commercial on TV the other day that said Saw 2 is being released on DVD on Valentine's Day.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.592
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that's just hokey.

03:40.892 --> 03:44.756
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it funny that the most romantic holiday in existence is based off of a martyr.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have plans for Valentine's Day?

03:48.359 --> 03:48.819
[SPEAKER_05]: I sure do.

03:49.940 --> 03:50.881
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan and I both have to work.

03:52.176 --> 03:55.318
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm planning on recreating the night that he proposed to me.

03:56.638 --> 03:56.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

03:57.239 --> 04:02.161
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bought sourdough French baguette at Bodine last night.

04:02.781 --> 04:03.281
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm, so good.

04:03.882 --> 04:09.825
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm going to get some spinach dip and a bottle of the, what's it called, blackberry wine.

04:10.525 --> 04:12.426
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we were very broke when I moved in with Dan.

04:13.566 --> 04:14.627
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to watch UHF.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.489
[SPEAKER_05]: He proposed to me over Weird Al.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.042
[SPEAKER_05]: Either that or we'll just go to Claim Jumper.

04:23.383 --> 04:24.624
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that place is going to be packed, though.

04:24.764 --> 04:25.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we'll go there.

04:25.925 --> 04:26.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll go get Chinese food.

04:27.426 --> 04:27.926
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

04:28.366 --> 04:28.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

04:28.586 --> 04:31.128
[SPEAKER_03]: God, it all comes back to food tonight.

04:31.689 --> 04:32.489
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on?

04:33.250 --> 04:34.250
[SPEAKER_05]: We's hungry people.

04:34.711 --> 04:35.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat us.

04:35.972 --> 04:38.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other games that you've been playing, Loki, this week?

04:40.755 --> 04:44.738
[SPEAKER_02]: I did play briefly, and I mean extremely briefly, this

04:45.259 --> 04:46.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Mario Bros.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.480
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 hack.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.060
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Mario Adventure or something like that.

04:51.501 --> 04:55.281
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was okay, but I got bored with it real quick.

04:56.302 --> 05:00.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I did... Freaking hell, my microphone just fell apart.

05:00.443 --> 05:02.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Your microphone's kind of falling apart.

05:02.623 --> 05:04.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let's do a quick switcheroo, Loki.

05:04.664 --> 05:05.344
[SPEAKER_02]: That was interesting.

05:05.364 --> 05:07.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and use this one here, since we don't have a guest tonight.

05:08.065 --> 05:11.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, my microphone literally exploded in my face.

05:11.766 --> 05:12.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Live radio, it happens.

05:14.385 --> 05:17.166
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's what I get for trying to put that mesh back on there.

05:17.507 --> 05:26.791
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um, so yeah, I tried actually playing with the Xbox 360 wired controller because I downloaded the Windows XP drivers and it was okay.

05:27.311 --> 05:28.472
[SPEAKER_02]: It works good as a controller.

05:28.912 --> 05:35.195
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be good for like, um, I think Nintendo 64 emulation or something like that, but I don't know.

05:35.775 --> 05:39.737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just played a little bit of that and a little bit of, um, I, what was it?

05:40.077 --> 05:41.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm okay.

05:41.798 --> 05:42.778
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little bit of that.

05:45.380 --> 05:47.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Thompson Murder Simulator

06:10.779 --> 06:13.440
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

06:14.101 --> 06:18.123
[SPEAKER_05]: I played some Animal Crossing at work during my breaks, of course, because I'm a good girl.

06:19.664 --> 06:23.586
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a really good story on gaming at work tonight, so we have to come back to that later.

06:24.787 --> 06:36.694
[SPEAKER_05]: I also chatted with some coworkers about PSP games, and I'm still needing to sit down with Maverick Hunter X just because I watched the OAV thing on it, which depressed me utterly, but it was really awesome.

06:38.306 --> 06:44.390
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a little bit more Kingdom Hearts, but this week's been really crazy because I'm leaving for Alabama next week.

06:45.651 --> 06:50.794
[SPEAKER_05]: And have been trying to double up on my schoolwork, so I don't have to have that sitting over my head.

06:51.375 --> 06:57.399
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm also getting Dirge of Sebris, which is the game featuring Vincent, sort of first-person shootery.

06:58.079 --> 07:00.021
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I have the name right.

07:00.261 --> 07:01.942
[SPEAKER_05]: It's SNK Coliseum.

07:02.562 --> 07:07.646
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be this massive, big ol' game starring the KOF characters and different SNK characters.

07:08.666 --> 07:08.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

07:08.966 --> 07:09.527
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm working on that.

07:32.898 --> 08:00.239

[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

08:04.203 --> 08:04.483
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

08:04.683 --> 08:06.844
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that is completely off top.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not quite off top.

08:08.265 --> 08:12.207
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned Katsukan and convention-wise.

08:12.767 --> 08:15.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I forgot to mention about my work.

08:15.448 --> 08:19.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I said we're doing a sales push right now, there's a contest involved.

08:19.330 --> 08:25.613
[SPEAKER_02]: And the contest is with the four salespeople here in Folsom and four salespeople in Dallas.

08:26.293 --> 08:27.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Two contests for both of us.

[SPEAKER_02]: The contest is whoever brings on the most accounts gets an all expense paid trip to E3 with a VIP pass VIP pass lets you get into everything Oh, you gotta get that Oh, you might not even be able to go to E3 because of the future wife, huh?

[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to get media pass.

[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on it.

[SPEAKER_02]: March 31st is the deadline.

09:06.782 --> 09:07.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Behind the scenes.

09:07.624 --> 09:08.486
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on it.

09:08.566 --> 09:08.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

09:09.007 --> 09:09.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

09:10.973 --> 09:11.633
[SPEAKER_03]: MyGamingWeek.

09:11.774 --> 09:13.495
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of requests like in the chat room.

09:13.515 --> 09:16.217
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room is lit up right now and I'm getting private messages as well.

09:16.517 --> 09:20.720
[SPEAKER_03]: People wanting to know follow up to the Xbox 360 debacle that I went off on last week.

09:20.980 --> 09:24.482
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll notice I'm a lot calmer when it comes to Xbox 360 topics tonight.

09:25.203 --> 09:33.168
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get the box from Microsoft but because of the fact I was out on business for part of this week, I haven't had a chance to send it back yet but it's going back tomorrow.

09:33.348 --> 09:34.069
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:00.658 --> 10:00.998
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

10:01.458 --> 10:02.539
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where my Xbox 360 stands.

10:02.559 --> 10:04.220
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll let you know what happens when that comes back.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.901
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the rest of my gaming week, it's actually been pretty calm.

10:07.261 --> 10:11.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing a lot of other things in my personal life this week, so I haven't had a lot of time for gaming.

10:12.443 --> 10:15.244
[SPEAKER_03]: I was flying on the plane, and I brought my DS.

10:15.524 --> 10:16.565
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even really touch it.

10:17.545 --> 10:18.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I was listening to podcasts.

10:19.446 --> 10:27.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I brought my iPod, and I listened to other podcasts because I kind of said before on the show that I don't really listen to a lot of other podcasts.

10:27.509 --> 10:28.250
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:44.161 --> 10:45.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Blood, Sweat, and Tears Blood, Sweat, and Tears

11:04.369 --> 11:05.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Ghost Hunter Ghost Hunters

11:26.844 --> 11:28.825
[SPEAKER_03]: and make them run away scared from the house.

11:29.165 --> 11:30.925
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of cool, but it's more of a tactical game.

11:30.965 --> 11:31.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised.

11:32.146 --> 11:35.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have a certain amount of points that you can spend on different scare tactics and things.

11:36.147 --> 11:42.169
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really like the game because it's so cool because you can switch and go to the point of view of the people in the house.

11:42.669 --> 11:43.929
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, really fast.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.130
[SPEAKER_03]: You change between all these graphics.

11:45.150 --> 11:49.011
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go between all the different points of view of the characters and like the overview of the house.

11:49.271 --> 11:56.053
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can watch your characters as they're being scared run around and you hear their little heart beating going, boom, boom, boom, boom.

11:56.613 --> 11:57.393
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of funny.

11:57.713 --> 11:58.554
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cute game.

11:58.614 --> 11:59.034
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

11:59.174 --> 11:59.714
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good time.

11:59.794 --> 12:08.097
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a fan of scary type games or even the... Although it's not really a scary game because it's all done very comically.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.238
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're a fan of those type of supernatural things, you might like it.

12:11.758 --> 12:15.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Or even strategy and tactical type games, you may find this to be kind of fun.

12:16.079 --> 12:18.860
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a game I'll play all the way through to completion.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.241
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's that great for me, but...

12:21.921 --> 12:22.841
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be fun.

12:23.022 --> 12:24.082
[SPEAKER_03]: So the game's called Ghost Hunter.

12:24.662 --> 12:27.723
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say it was developed by a UK studio, actually.

12:28.143 --> 12:32.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think the version my friend had was a UK version somehow.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.345
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I checked out.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.726
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty much my gaming week.

12:35.806 --> 12:36.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a whole lot of new stuff.

12:37.227 --> 12:37.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

12:37.747 --> 12:41.088
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I wanted to download new demos on the Xbox 360, but we won't go there.

12:41.208 --> 12:41.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

12:41.389 --> 12:41.929
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done that.

12:42.129 --> 12:42.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, DarkSakura?

12:43.209 --> 12:44.390
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did play another game.

12:44.530 --> 12:44.810
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

12:45.010 --> 12:46.971
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually at Walmart.

12:49.632 --> 12:50.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Deer Hunter?

12:51.312 --> 13:02.197
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was this Sega Undersea game that was a lot like... It was in the same, I think, type of series as that... Oh, what was it called?

13:02.217 --> 13:03.058
[SPEAKER_05]: The Safari Hunter?

13:03.998 --> 13:06.259
[SPEAKER_05]: But you go, and it's like House of the Dead with fish.

13:06.900 --> 13:07.540
[SPEAKER_05]: It's underwater.

13:07.980 --> 13:08.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Undersea Hunter?

13:08.881 --> 13:10.902
[SPEAKER_05]: The Undersea Adventure.

13:10.922 --> 13:12.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like the Crocodile Hunter?

13:13.243 --> 13:19.426
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you have like this little handheld torpedo things, and you shoot sharks.

13:20.729 --> 13:23.410
[SPEAKER_05]: and Hydra's, and you just go around shooting fish.

13:23.471 --> 13:24.631
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like House of the Dead with fish.

13:26.312 --> 13:28.713
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were talking about Safari game, you made me think of this one game.

13:28.753 --> 13:32.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we're talking about the same thing here, but they used to have a little arcade here in town.

13:33.336 --> 13:36.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Sacramento, the town we live in, has essentially no good arcades anymore.

13:37.077 --> 13:43.861
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have a couple good ones, like standalone arcades in the area, and I remember one particular one that was out in Roseville, one of our suburbs,

13:44.681 --> 13:49.462
[SPEAKER_03]: had this game, and I want to say it was by Sega, and it was a safari game, and it was actually like a sit-down.

13:49.722 --> 13:51.343
[SPEAKER_03]: You go around in the Jeep and you lasso.

13:51.463 --> 13:51.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was it.

13:51.923 --> 13:52.223
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cute.

13:52.283 --> 13:52.943
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that game.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.744
[SPEAKER_05]: But this was in the same series, but you just go around shooting fish.

13:56.084 --> 13:56.444
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

13:56.604 --> 14:02.485
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know how in House of the Dead when you let people die and you tell the other people there was nothing we could do?

14:02.986 --> 14:08.867
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead, you see, if you let a shark eat one of the divers, he just sort of hangs in the water like, dead.

14:09.247 --> 14:10.207
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, dot, dot, dot.

14:10.547 --> 14:11.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

14:12.768 --> 14:13.088
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

14:13.459 --> 14:16.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a little bit about what's going on in our gaming worlds.

14:16.641 --> 14:21.263
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to share what's going on in your gaming world, join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

14:22.144 --> 14:23.364
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always send us some email.

14:23.765 --> 14:30.008
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting the email from you guys, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and we'll read some of those emails a little later on in the program.

14:32.509 --> 14:34.831
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving to Arcadian42 said Jambo Safari.

14:35.151 --> 14:38.173
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the name of it, Jambo Safari, not Jambo.

14:38.553 --> 14:38.993
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.041
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:09.534 --> 15:15.379
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, what VoiceOver IP is, it's... Imagine playing Phantasy Star Online.

15:15.959 --> 15:16.760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the same thing.

15:16.860 --> 15:21.644
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing your... Instead of doing, like, standard phone line, it's actually connecting through the internet connection.

15:21.704 --> 15:23.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Xbox Live, basically.

15:23.786 --> 15:24.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, same thing.

15:25.147 --> 15:26.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Only, of course, this will be wireless.

15:27.689 --> 15:37.277
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the Nintendo of Europe spokespeople mentioned that they're hoping the VoiceOver IP feature will be included in the European version, also of Metroid Prime Hunters for Nintendo DS.

15:38.335 --> 15:42.235
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have to work on regulatory and contractual issues before that can be cleared.

15:42.739 --> 15:43.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Internet Capability

16:10.374 --> 16:13.375
[SPEAKER_05]: Any type of online play capability, they have voice over IP capability.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Now my old work used to do voice over IP for our entire phone system.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.057
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh sure, it's a huge thing.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.077
[SPEAKER_03]: People have voice over IP as their home phone.

16:20.537 --> 16:20.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Vonage.

16:20.978 --> 16:21.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Vonage and that stuff.

16:22.518 --> 16:25.399
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but also there's a release that's mentioned.

16:25.639 --> 16:26.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Skype's the same way.

16:27.039 --> 16:32.201
[SPEAKER_05]: It said the game was set for a March 20th release in the US and later on May 5th in Europe.

16:33.473 --> 16:42.177
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also mentioning that they're rolling out a series of DS demo kiosks across North America at major retail locations like GameStop, EB Games, GameCrazy.

16:43.257 --> 16:48.839
[SPEAKER_05]: DS owners will be able to wirelessly download games, videos, mini games, sort of like how we did at E3.

16:49.860 --> 16:52.901
[SPEAKER_05]: And they will be available until the handheld is switched off.

16:53.301 --> 16:59.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, exactly like what our downloads were like at E3 when we were playing Electroplankton and everything in line.

17:00.249 --> 17:08.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I heard that they are actually bringing some of those exact same demos over, like Meteos and stuff, too, are going to be some of the launch titles we're going to see in the demo kiosks.

17:08.153 --> 17:08.814
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a list.

17:09.214 --> 17:20.039
[SPEAKER_05]: The first kiosk will offer free demos of Tetris DS, Brain Training, Mario Kart DS, Meteos, True Swing Golf, and Pokemon Troze, along with a video of Metroid Prime Hunters.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Kiosks will be getting new content every quarter.

17:24.866 --> 17:29.509
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember at E3 you could download the Zelda trailer, and that was a big thing.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.430
[SPEAKER_03]: You could get movies.

17:30.730 --> 17:31.831
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the big thing.

17:31.891 --> 17:32.832
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was a huge thing.

17:33.733 --> 17:36.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I want to go back to a minute and talk about Metroid Prime Hunters.

17:36.335 --> 17:46.143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if I'm repeating something you already said, but I seem to recall reading that you would only be able to actually use the voiceover IP before and after the game.

17:46.403 --> 17:49.045
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not actually going to be able to use it in the game itself.

17:49.205 --> 17:49.626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

17:49.646 --> 17:50.987
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only available in the lobby area.

17:51.147 --> 17:52.528
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can only trash talk in the lobbies.

17:53.106 --> 17:53.967
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:17.049 --> 18:18.933
[SPEAKER_03]: on their official forums and stuff.

18:19.253 --> 18:25.243
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like they're trying to protect people from that same, like, you know the stigma that Xbox Live gets?

18:25.464 --> 18:30.392
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whenever you go online and play Halo, you're going to get called a F-A-G or an N-I-G, right?

18:31.101 --> 18:34.883
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get called those things because people are kind of immature on there and Xbox Live has that stigma.

18:35.203 --> 18:36.943
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Nintendo wants that same thing.

18:37.103 --> 18:38.084
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of interesting.

18:38.144 --> 18:40.185
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very smart to limit it in that respect.

18:42.045 --> 18:49.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, there's been plenty of times where I'd be playing PSO and someone would get lost in our party, which happened all the time.

18:49.969 --> 18:53.010
[SPEAKER_05]: And so someone would just, you know, let out a little curse.

18:54.130 --> 18:57.472
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, you know, you don't want to be stuck in the moment.

18:58.032 --> 19:00.233
[SPEAKER_05]: By having it be before and after, people are usually calmer.

19:02.262 --> 19:09.787
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind the occasional fuck or shit because we do the same thing on this show and I think that's just, you know, it's not that bad.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how people talk.

19:12.449 --> 19:14.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not everybody, but you know, it just depends on your culture.

19:14.611 --> 19:25.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, but I do hate it when I go on Xbox Live and there's some 13-year-old kid talking about, you know, making up stories about getting drunk and playing the game and calling everybody fag and all that stuff.

19:25.678 --> 19:28.260
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't, that's the part that annoys me.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.802
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if people are going to say fuck or shit once in a while, you know.

19:32.661 --> 19:35.303
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just interesting to me that Nintendo is kind of opening that door.

19:35.363 --> 19:41.148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be interesting to see if they try to police this at all, or if they're looking at Xbox and going, you know what?

19:41.228 --> 19:42.008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's successful.

19:42.469 --> 19:43.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we afraid of this?

19:43.670 --> 19:44.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just do it.

19:45.131 --> 19:45.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's open it up.

19:46.992 --> 19:47.333
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

19:50.595 --> 19:52.557
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Loki for a follow-up story.

19:53.277 --> 19:53.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

19:54.598 --> 19:57.901
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, kind of on the same subject of chatting over the internet.

19:58.394 --> 20:17.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo has actually applied for a voice-to-text software patent, and basically their reasoning for it is summed up, if a 12-year-old boy is playing the role of a 40-year-old warrior, voice chat can spoil or detract from the gameplay experience, since the warrior ends up having the voice of a 12-year-old.

20:18.956 --> 20:28.644
[SPEAKER_02]: So the solution is that you speak normally and have the software convert the speech into text, which also allows them to censor any naughty words that you be using.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.426
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good idea.

20:31.606 --> 20:35.089
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably, you know, something that they might use for, like, I don't know.

20:35.609 --> 20:40.153
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this would be good for, like, actually Metroid Prime Hunters, because if you can't support...

20:40.629 --> 20:44.410
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the voice chat or whatever, you can at least do text chat or something.

20:44.490 --> 20:46.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need to be talking in Metroid Prime Hunters, maybe?

20:46.951 --> 20:49.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, does Metroid Prime Hunters have a co-op?

20:49.192 --> 20:49.932
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they did.

20:50.092 --> 20:51.353
[SPEAKER_03]: At least in the demo, I remember.

20:51.373 --> 20:57.755
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe the theory is you shouldn't be talking to each other because you should be fighting each other to kill each other and you wouldn't talk to your enemies.

20:57.795 --> 20:59.015
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.

20:59.155 --> 21:00.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Capture the flag, team play stuff.

21:00.616 --> 21:00.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

21:00.876 --> 21:03.957
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it depends what kind of... I haven't touched that demo in forever.

21:03.997 --> 21:04.937
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting idea.

21:04.977 --> 21:06.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows how they'll use it, but...

21:07.058 --> 21:08.299
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else to look forward to, I guess.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where I think this is all headed?

21:10.721 --> 21:13.904
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is actually going to be really, really smart of Nintendo.

21:14.204 --> 21:17.687
[SPEAKER_03]: You know where I think this is all headed with this whole demo kiosk and all this stuff, the demos?

21:18.187 --> 21:25.593
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to see something that's like a copy of Xbox Live on the Xbox 360 with the Revolution, using the Revolution.

21:25.633 --> 21:36.202
[SPEAKER_03]: Because imagine it, you hook up a Nintendo Revolution to the internet and you could download DS demos onto your Revolution, essentially turning your Revolution into a demo kiosk.

21:36.802 --> 21:45.227
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's kind of where we're headed, where your revolution will be able to play not only revolution demos at some point, but DS demos as well.

21:45.527 --> 21:48.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Beam them over to your DS, and I think that's going to be really powerful.

21:48.989 --> 21:50.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're going to probably do the same thing with the PS3.

21:50.730 --> 21:57.653
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have the game share function that you can use probably with the PS3, where you can download one-level demos of PSP games.

21:57.873 --> 22:00.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Xbox is wishing they had a handheld right about now.

22:00.375 --> 22:00.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

22:00.895 --> 22:01.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

22:02.361 --> 22:02.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

22:03.021 --> 22:06.464
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of see that as the end point for all of this.

22:06.484 --> 22:07.604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be very cool.

22:08.305 --> 22:08.525
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

22:08.645 --> 22:09.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's looking to online.

22:10.906 --> 22:13.808
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got to, I mean, since they're not pushing high def, so...

22:15.248 --> 22:16.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Online is going to have to be what it is.

22:16.789 --> 22:18.010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have to be innovative.

22:18.490 --> 22:19.791
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's pretty innovative, I guess.

22:20.772 --> 22:22.914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the chat room and checking it out.

22:23.154 --> 22:27.277
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.

22:27.357 --> 22:28.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting comments here.

22:29.799 --> 22:31.920
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun had a couple good things to say I like here.

22:32.461 --> 22:36.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo needs to solve the problem with people disconnecting when they're about to lose.

22:36.464 --> 22:38.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly one of their biggest bitches.

22:38.727 --> 22:45.170
[SPEAKER_03]: That can happen with a lot of online games, though, but, you know, certainly maybe should affect their records or something like it does on some Xbox games.

22:45.570 --> 22:49.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, HitStun said this, I thought this was good, Nintendo wants people to play, not chat.

22:51.432 --> 22:52.593
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an interesting point.

22:53.134 --> 22:55.016
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo has always been about the games

23:15.896 --> 23:18.417
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniMe283 has an interesting comment, too.

23:18.557 --> 23:23.499
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Nintendo would be worse than Xbox Live because some people would be even more immature.

23:24.360 --> 23:28.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's target audience, granted, as a whole, is usually younger than Xbox's.

23:29.422 --> 23:30.863
[SPEAKER_03]: So, interesting point.

23:31.723 --> 23:32.163
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

23:32.223 --> 23:37.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of, you know, 20-something gamers and 30-something gamers that are Nintendo fanboys.

23:38.106 --> 23:40.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, the older ones are Nintendo fanboys.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.203
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what I noticed.

23:43.363 --> 23:47.064
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Nintendo doesn't necessarily, may not be focusing on age-wise.

23:48.324 --> 23:51.005
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always seen them as focusing to a more innocent crowd.

23:52.345 --> 23:53.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

23:54.345 --> 23:59.246
[SPEAKER_05]: For people who are more looking for the wholesome category of gaming.

24:00.046 --> 24:02.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the not quite so racy, not quite so mature.

24:03.407 --> 24:08.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I even hate to think of games as Grand Theft Auto as basically being a mature game.

24:09.218 --> 24:11.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Because honestly, the game strikes me overall as very immature.

24:12.840 --> 24:18.023
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, I think that it's more for the people looking for the more adult experience.

24:18.884 --> 24:19.124
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.425
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Xbox.

24:20.565 --> 24:24.467
[SPEAKER_05]: But GameCube is more of the we want a cleaner type of game.

24:25.508 --> 24:25.808
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

24:26.348 --> 24:26.608
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

24:27.148 --> 24:27.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see that.

24:28.424 --> 24:30.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Game Developers Conference on the Revolution

24:46.436 --> 24:55.763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking that the announcement we see at Game Developers Conference, this is totally a rumor I'm making up right here, is that it's going to tie into all this other news we're seeing.

24:55.803 --> 24:59.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that exactly as I just said it, that the revolution is going to have that capability.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.967
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'll be the hint that's dropped at GDC.

25:02.267 --> 25:07.651
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that would be a good little teaser that doesn't really spoil the actual revolution, you know what I mean?

25:08.272 --> 25:08.532
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

25:09.252 --> 25:10.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, my thoughts.

25:11.980 --> 25:14.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of the DS, we have yet more stuff on the DS.

25:14.942 --> 25:17.023
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS Lite is on its way.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.584
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you know some more information on the DS Lite?

25:20.225 --> 25:21.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, yes I do, Rob.

25:24.367 --> 25:31.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo has basically announced three colors for the Nintendo DS Lite, launching in Japan on March 2nd.

25:32.132 --> 25:34.593
[SPEAKER_05]: They're having Crystal White, Ice Blue,

25:35.200 --> 25:36.380
[SPEAKER_05]: and Enamel Navy.

25:37.060 --> 25:40.141
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo has actually put some pictures up on their Japanese website.

25:41.561 --> 25:57.605
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be able to go ahead and post links to that in our chat room, but also anyone can go onto Nintendo of Japan's site at nintendo.co.jp slash ds slash lite, l-i-t-e slash color slash index.html.

25:58.585 --> 25:59.365
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're pretty.

26:00.452 --> 26:00.832
[SPEAKER_03]: www.DarkSakura.com

26:16.665 --> 26:18.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's still gone without fast food.

26:18.507 --> 26:19.788
[SPEAKER_03]: We're about four months into it now.

26:20.268 --> 26:22.009
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's telling me he wants a DS Lite.

26:22.029 --> 26:27.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the deal was if he could do it, I would buy him a Nintendo DS because I said he couldn't do it.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.475
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's saying, I want a DS Lite.

26:30.175 --> 26:31.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you can't change the terms.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.357
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to buy whatever DS I can find.

26:33.397 --> 26:35.099
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get you a used DS, smartass.

26:35.139 --> 26:36.560
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides, they're not available over here.

26:36.740 --> 26:37.160
[SPEAKER_02]: So, ha.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.361
[SPEAKER_05]: But they'll still play.

26:38.501 --> 26:39.121
[SPEAKER_02]: They will be.

26:39.182 --> 26:39.982
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they will be.

26:40.062 --> 26:40.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, but...

26:41.516 --> 26:41.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha!

26:42.237 --> 26:42.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Not yet.

26:42.577 --> 26:44.880
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll still play any region, so I don't see what the big thing is.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.845
[SPEAKER_05]: You can import them for the same price as it is to actually just buy one retail at a lot of sites.

26:49.486 --> 26:50.347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not importing one.

26:50.887 --> 26:54.191
[SPEAKER_03]: If I lose a bet, I'm not going out of my way to make it nice.

26:55.252 --> 26:57.195
[SPEAKER_05]: If they come out with crap colors over here, I'll import one.

26:58.322 --> 26:58.642
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

26:59.483 --> 27:01.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, one more DS story for us.

27:02.067 --> 27:05.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and this is only appropriate since we're talking about web functions.

27:07.494 --> 27:13.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Nintendo has come out to say that they are looking into creating a web browser for it.

27:14.062 --> 27:14.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically,

27:15.859 --> 27:32.805
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie, one of the higher ups at Nintendo, is on the record talking to EGM saying that he's looking at a third party licensee to get involved with the web functionality and basically a web browser.

27:33.626 --> 27:41.048
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they would not do it, then definitely that's something that Nintendo's looking at putting out themselves.

27:42.129 --> 27:43.449
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something we'll see soon.

27:43.609 --> 27:45.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Web browsing on the DS might be

27:46.365 --> 27:47.106
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:02.219 --> 28:03.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of good games right now.

28:03.900 --> 28:04.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of stuff to do with this.

28:05.060 --> 28:06.721
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP's got a lot more functionality.

28:06.861 --> 28:10.762
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's very interesting to see the DS really starting to raise the bar here against the PSP.

28:11.003 --> 28:18.926
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the PSP's niche and what still makes it a very powerful portable system is the fact that it does do web browsing and movie playing and all this other stuff too.

28:18.966 --> 28:21.727
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nintendo's starting to compensate for that difference a little bit.

28:21.767 --> 28:22.467
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very interesting.

28:23.428 --> 28:23.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

28:23.948 --> 28:24.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be cool.

28:25.319 --> 28:25.759
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

28:26.019 --> 28:26.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I lied.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.121
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one more DS story for you guys.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.222
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is so cool.

28:30.242 --> 28:30.882
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to see this.

28:31.343 --> 28:41.388
[SPEAKER_03]: This was posted, and I apologize because I don't remember where, but it's a link to a video on YouTube.com, and it's actually a clip of the new Super Mario Bros.

28:41.449 --> 28:42.329
[SPEAKER_03]: on Nintendo DS.

28:42.369 --> 28:44.730
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show this in studio here to the folks here.

28:44.750 --> 28:45.371
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to look at this.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.672
[SPEAKER_03]: This game looks sexy here.

28:47.852 --> 28:48.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

28:49.013 --> 28:52.175
[SPEAKER_03]: So the clip shows it's got the old retro...

28:52.884 --> 28:54.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, it hung up a little bit there.

28:56.326 --> 29:01.650
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the old retro sounds there and the retro look to it, except Mario's in a very desert-looking world.

29:02.270 --> 29:04.912
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of compare it to something you would have seen in Mario Bros.

29:05.372 --> 29:09.095
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, except the look of it looks like Mario 1 graphics, but...

29:09.415 --> 29:12.457
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of Super Mario All-Stars, basically.

29:12.477 --> 29:12.797
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

29:12.837 --> 29:14.298
[SPEAKER_03]: It does look kind of like Super Mario Bros.

29:14.358 --> 29:14.879
[SPEAKER_03]: All-Stars.

29:15.219 --> 29:18.821
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the same enemies, like you see the little spiky guys and the caterpillar things.

29:19.282 --> 29:21.203
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's these new rings, too.

29:21.423 --> 29:21.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario goes in the pipe and then flies out of it.

29:24.866 --> 29:25.566
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

29:27.147 --> 29:31.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Mario went in the pipe and the pipe bent to allow him to kind of fly out of it.

29:32.864 --> 29:35.425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is looking like it's going to be pretty sexy.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.265
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

29:36.365 --> 29:38.025
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the... And that's stage four.

29:40.406 --> 29:41.706
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognize what level that is.

29:42.006 --> 29:44.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this is a redone version of the original.

29:45.107 --> 29:45.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

29:45.607 --> 29:54.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wouldn't be surprised if... Well, a lot of it looked like the same type of... Oh, I'm sure... I wouldn't be surprised if there's elements of the classic Mario Brothers put into this game.

29:55.009 --> 29:56.830
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Nintendo loves their retro stuff.

29:56.890 --> 29:57.550
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it is different.

29:57.970 --> 30:00.614
[SPEAKER_03]: See, because you've got the pipe here, you wouldn't have had that in the original one.

30:00.634 --> 30:00.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of neat.

30:01.134 --> 30:02.176
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

30:02.296 --> 30:03.818
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the fade with it being his head.

30:04.338 --> 30:05.360
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.

30:05.380 --> 30:08.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so just a little teaser of what's to come.

30:08.203 --> 30:09.325
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks very exciting.

30:10.017 --> 30:10.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy about that.

30:10.797 --> 30:16.059
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I'll post the link directly in chat room there so you guys can check out the video as well.

30:16.379 --> 30:20.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's great radio to hear us sitting around talking about it, so go check it out and have a look at it.

30:22.001 --> 30:24.681
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now let's go on to a completely different topic.

30:24.721 --> 30:25.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough Nintendo DS for now.

30:26.002 --> 30:28.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a follow-up story.

30:28.843 --> 30:32.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Three weeks now we've talked about this?

30:32.744 --> 30:34.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the drama.

30:34.344 --> 30:35.105
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, what's up?

30:37.452 --> 30:48.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Blizzard basically says, yeah, our bad about the whole gay lesbian guild that was, you know, basically shot down for, you know, trying to advertise.

30:48.738 --> 30:55.002
[SPEAKER_03]: The guild wasn't closed, but it's just that the person who did the shout got the slap on the wrist under harassment policy.

30:55.022 --> 30:58.844
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the whole big issue was that, you know, was she harassing?

30:58.984 --> 30:59.324
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

30:59.765 --> 31:00.785
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't harassing anybody.

31:01.285 --> 31:02.086
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the whole issue.

31:02.266 --> 31:03.106
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, sorry.

31:03.367 --> 31:05.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's basically, you know, they're very...

31:06.008 --> 31:10.570
[SPEAKER_02]: She's very happy that Blizzard has owned up to the mistake and has apologized and corrected it.

31:11.430 --> 31:23.535
[SPEAKER_02]: The policy is under review right now and they're trying to make revisions to make it friendly to everybody and clarify things, less vague.

31:24.426 --> 31:40.520
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's the same story, but I did read, because obviously I've been very curious about this, I did read a follow-up story that said Blizzard did apologize and say that it was not really what it should have been filed under, and I heard that they were going to put all their GMs through sensitivity training.

31:42.587 --> 31:44.848
[SPEAKER_03]: to better identify how to handle these issues in the future.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.470
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought this was a very creative solution.

31:47.570 --> 32:01.919
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember if this was fact or rumor, so take this with a grain of salt, but that Blizzard is going to create another chat channel within the game because right now they have chat channels for general chat, looking for group, trade.

32:01.979 --> 32:02.639
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all these channels.

32:02.800 --> 32:07.743
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to create a new channel for guild recruitment where this kind of chat would be acceptable.

32:07.803 --> 32:09.484
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that is a very fair...

32:09.885 --> 32:11.094
[SPEAKER_03]: and very smart solutions.

32:11.194 --> 32:11.919
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's fact...

32:13.416 --> 32:14.757
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate Blizzard for doing that.

32:14.817 --> 32:18.680
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the actual apology letter that Sarah Andrews received from Blizzard.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from their head of customer service.

32:22.402 --> 32:26.205
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Thor Biafor, head of Blizzard customer service worldwide.

32:26.265 --> 32:36.412
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank you for bringing your recent concerns to our attention and extend our apologies for any inconveniences this has caused you or your guild.

32:36.672 --> 32:40.515
[SPEAKER_02]: The action that was taken by our customer service representatives

32:40.973 --> 32:46.317
[SPEAKER_02]: was an unfortunate interpretation of our current policies, which are currently under review.

32:47.057 --> 32:54.063
[SPEAKER_02]: This was ultimately escalated to my attention, and after reviewing all the details, I had the following warning removed from your account.

32:54.423 --> 33:02.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Please accept our apologies for the way our staff characterized your conduct, and rest assured your account will not be penalized in any way for this occurrence.

33:03.129 --> 33:08.433
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to discuss this with you further, so please feel free to contact me directly.

33:12.177 --> 33:12.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

33:12.718 --> 33:13.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Blizzard.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.041
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I'm serious.

33:15.962 --> 33:20.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I kind of wish it had happened a little sooner, I understand that corporations are big, nasty machines.

33:20.569 --> 33:22.652
[SPEAKER_03]: This probably had to be reviewed a thousand times by legal.

33:22.972 --> 33:23.573
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand.

33:24.414 --> 33:24.715
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

33:25.205 --> 33:25.465
[SPEAKER_03]: for that.

33:43.237 --> 33:45.399
[SPEAKER_03]: First, a couple comments to what's going on in the chat room.

33:45.439 --> 33:47.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's saying, did I say Gay Chat?

33:47.301 --> 33:48.982
[SPEAKER_03]: They were going to make another channel for Gay Chat.

33:49.022 --> 33:52.405
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, that was Guild Recruitment Chat, not Gay Chat.

33:53.707 --> 33:55.708
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, what was the other one?

33:56.049 --> 34:02.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, another person in the comment, EKIM, which I think is Mike, spelled backwards, says, did they unban her?

34:03.015 --> 34:06.618
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to clarify, they never banned her.

34:06.718 --> 34:08.440
[SPEAKER_03]: She was warned, not banned.

34:08.740 --> 34:12.862
[SPEAKER_03]: But I believe, I'm almost positive she voluntarily left the game because she was kind of pissed off.

34:12.922 --> 34:14.282
[SPEAKER_03]: And well, you know, I would have been too.

34:14.722 --> 34:16.483
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't say I blame her for that.

34:16.523 --> 34:17.504
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to clarify that.

34:17.584 --> 34:18.844
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was banned in that whole thing.

34:18.904 --> 34:19.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Just warned.

34:20.005 --> 34:21.625
[SPEAKER_03]: And the warning was inappropriate.

34:22.746 --> 34:23.146
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

34:23.606 --> 34:24.687
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm glad to hear that follow up.

34:24.727 --> 34:26.888
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know the best thing about that follow up?

34:27.408 --> 34:28.988
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't ever have to talk about that again.

34:30.089 --> 34:30.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

34:30.749 --> 34:31.089
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

34:31.589 --> 34:32.710
[SPEAKER_03]: So next up.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.126
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:02.643 --> 35:04.885
[SPEAKER_03]: We've reviewed 700 accounts and banned them.

35:06.266 --> 35:09.107
[SPEAKER_03]: 300 billion gil has been removed from circulation.

35:09.488 --> 35:17.613
[SPEAKER_03]: They realize this is driving up the price of items, and they are doing their best to follow, and they say they have more accounts under review, and they're taking this stuff very seriously.

35:18.334 --> 35:24.077
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they did that, but at the same time, I still go by what I said last week when this originally came up.

35:24.538 --> 35:27.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't this happen a year and a half ago when things started to get out of hand?

35:28.060 --> 35:29.821
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand why it took this long.

35:30.101 --> 35:32.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, no review process takes that long.

35:32.503 --> 35:33.884
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

35:49.960 --> 35:54.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the only delay that I've had so far is I'm waiting for someone to take over the link shell and that's it.

35:55.262 --> 35:55.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm done.

35:56.082 --> 35:57.322
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dumping everything.

35:57.862 --> 36:08.025
[SPEAKER_03]: I still will go and check out the game when the new expansion is released because I hear it's going to be a little more solo friendly, like you'll be able to do more stuff on your own.

36:08.425 --> 36:12.526
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to give it another chance because that was one thing Final Fantasy XI was severely lacking for me.

36:12.967 --> 36:15.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I do understand it's an MMO.

36:15.627 --> 36:16.748
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to group sometimes.

36:17.068 --> 36:17.908
[SPEAKER_03]: That's understandable, but

36:18.709 --> 36:19.790
[SPEAKER_03]: All the time.

36:20.891 --> 36:21.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was a little much.

36:22.052 --> 36:23.774
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first thing that sent me to World of Warcraft.

36:23.814 --> 36:25.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we'll see.

36:25.176 --> 36:26.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it another chance, and we'll see.

36:27.479 --> 36:29.000
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't screw this up, Square.

36:30.842 --> 36:31.123
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

36:32.104 --> 36:34.907
[SPEAKER_05]: I seem to be saying that quite a bit where Square is concerned.

36:36.249 --> 36:36.669
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

36:37.510 --> 36:39.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, moving on.

36:40.802 --> 36:43.183
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, she likes to surf the internet.

36:43.403 --> 36:44.443
[SPEAKER_03]: You like the internet, right?

36:44.783 --> 36:46.524
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the internet is serious business.

36:46.584 --> 36:52.225
[SPEAKER_03]: She serves it up and down and brings the very best to you in her Website of the Week.

36:53.025 --> 36:55.126
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's the Website of the Week?

36:56.206 --> 37:03.048
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's Website of the Week is called GetYourHeadOutOfYourBud.com Best name ever for a website.

37:03.797 --> 37:11.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, the site focuses on political issues and then gives an opinion on how the people who are most prevalent in these issues are big idiots.

37:13.100 --> 37:21.123
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it really is nothing but political issues, but the whole point of this is if you're going to be in the public eye and say things, don't be a dumbass about it.

37:21.223 --> 37:23.064
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually put some thought into it.

37:23.404 --> 37:32.047
[SPEAKER_05]: A few of the different issues brought over here was more about the Communications Decency Act, more recent developments with that.

37:32.768 --> 37:34.209
[SPEAKER_05]: which actually sort of affects us, you know.

37:35.590 --> 37:38.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Also about issues with the Super Bowl.

37:39.994 --> 37:50.103
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one actually really struck with me about Cindy Sheehan who was arrested for wearing that particular t-shirt at the State of the Union address.

37:51.064 --> 37:57.329
[SPEAKER_05]: How she was basically lost any credibility she might have had for doing that at the most inappropriate time ever.

37:58.098 --> 38:00.499
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, it's a pretty good site.

38:00.519 --> 38:02.360
[SPEAKER_05]: Gives some pretty controversial views on things.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.942
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also another good article in here about the Dixie Chicks, too.

38:05.822 --> 38:09.844
[SPEAKER_05]: But, anyone who happens to be politically and socially minded, check it out.

38:09.904 --> 38:13.186
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not agree with the opinion, but at least it's very intelligently presented.

38:13.626 --> 38:15.407
[SPEAKER_05]: And has the best website name ever.

38:16.047 --> 38:17.488
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, therefore, it's your website of the week.

38:17.722 --> 38:20.885
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, it's getyourheadoutofyourbutt.com, all one word.

38:21.405 --> 38:22.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it non-partisan?

38:22.346 --> 38:24.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it razz on both sides?

38:24.308 --> 38:25.589
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems fairly non-partisan.

38:26.249 --> 38:36.998
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually another thing that appealed to me, is that it seems, it is a bit more on the liberal-friendly side, but then again, it does also... Because when I looked at it, it seemed a little more on the other side of it.

38:37.999 --> 38:40.381
[SPEAKER_05]: It really floats the line to me.

38:40.401 --> 38:42.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, whoever's got their head in their butt this week, essentially.

38:43.283 --> 38:49.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right, and I think that there, you know, I think that the person who writes it, the reason why it appeals to me is because it has a very similar point of view to I do.

38:50.247 --> 39:02.014
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a very socially liberal mindset, but when it comes to fiscal, you know, circumstances and some borderline social circumstances, I do lean a little conservatively on it just based on my background.

39:02.794 --> 39:05.095
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think it's very moderate.

39:05.696 --> 39:07.036
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to put it as very moderate.

39:07.297 --> 39:07.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

39:07.657 --> 39:07.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

39:08.217 --> 39:08.537
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

39:08.798 --> 39:11.380
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that kind of stuff is only funny to me when it's both sides being razzed.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.661
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I agree.

39:13.062 --> 39:25.614
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, they go from everything from pointing fingers at the Patriot Act to pointing fingers at that Cindy lady.

39:26.014 --> 39:26.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's cool.

39:26.775 --> 39:27.956
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it really does go back and forth.

39:27.996 --> 39:31.299
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a very fair point of view, but again, it is the author's point of view.

39:31.840 --> 39:32.741
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that have to do with games?

39:33.650 --> 39:35.554
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't, but... I'm just teasing, I'm teasing.

39:35.594 --> 39:44.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, but every so often I've seen things pop up about the RIAA and... I want to say I saw something about, like, you know, there was even a gaming category in there or something.

39:44.091 --> 39:45.594
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I seem to recall, maybe I'm...

39:46.666 --> 40:04.714
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly believe, and this is my social political point of view on this, anything that happens that's in the public eye as far as any type of political or social agenda is eventually going to affect all other aspects of life, including how we communicate, what we do for our leisure, including games.

40:05.374 --> 40:07.536
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly think that everything is linked.

40:07.876 --> 40:20.544
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see one thing about so and so, you know, privacy issue and then you'll see all sorts of privacy measures being incorporated into like AOL, Yahoo, Game Chat.

40:21.185 --> 40:25.448
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the reason why I think GamePolitics.com is a horribly overlooked site.

40:25.748 --> 40:32.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I think more people should be keeping a pulse on what's going on over there because it really fuses this politics thing with what goes on with gaming.

40:33.053 --> 40:33.233
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

40:33.926 --> 40:35.467
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

41:03.973 --> 41:05.814
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it pisses so many people off, probably.

41:30.842 --> 41:32.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember Crystal Quest.

41:32.863 --> 41:34.104
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to download this.

41:34.584 --> 41:37.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, one of the first Mac games in color.

41:38.146 --> 41:40.066
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I don't know.

41:40.127 --> 41:47.910
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too similar to the other games that are out there right now, like Mutant Storm and Jump True Wars.

41:48.270 --> 41:49.211
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just too similar.

41:50.020 --> 41:50.500
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Crystal Castles!

42:09.368 --> 42:11.650
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's even better when you actually have the trackball to play at home.

42:11.830 --> 42:12.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

42:12.691 --> 42:13.632
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

42:13.752 --> 42:15.433
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't play that game with a keyboard.

42:15.474 --> 42:18.416
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to use either your mouse, which is essentially an inverted trackball, or a trackball.

42:18.436 --> 42:19.437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, trackball's the bomb.

42:19.797 --> 42:20.318
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

42:21.479 --> 42:30.167
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, and also another cool demo that's going to be coming out, and that would be Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter should be coming probably pretty soon.

42:30.187 --> 42:32.249
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,

42:32.887 --> 42:33.287
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

42:56.229 --> 42:57.311
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was interesting.

42:57.351 --> 43:01.077
[SPEAKER_03]: Our chat room over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com is kind of giggling.

43:01.138 --> 43:08.731
[SPEAKER_03]: They're snickering to themselves because they said essentially that we got Loki to talk about something Mac related and keep the peace.

43:09.531 --> 43:09.811
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOXIC.COM

43:31.258 --> 43:41.964
[SPEAKER_03]: He is talking about the issues regarding these shortages, and this is what he said, quote, Within the next four to six weeks, anybody will be able to walk into a store and buy an Xbox 360.

43:42.705 --> 43:44.826
[SPEAKER_03]: So will we be seeing these shortages come to an end?

43:45.406 --> 43:46.287
[SPEAKER_03]: God, let's hope so.

43:46.447 --> 43:47.607
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an ambitious statement.

43:47.927 --> 43:54.391
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but at the same time, maybe four to six weeks is when you should have launched your system, if that's the case.

43:54.591 --> 43:55.932
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do I know?

43:57.152 --> 43:58.693
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just some guy with a broken Xbox.

43:59.234 --> 44:02.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh... Sorry, I couldn't resist.

44:03.357 --> 44:08.401
[SPEAKER_03]: But whereas you may be able to walk into a store and get one here, though, Loki, what's going on other places?

44:09.281 --> 44:10.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia.

44:10.382 --> 44:11.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love Australia.

44:11.643 --> 44:12.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

44:12.344 --> 44:19.829
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were supposed to get their 360s, I believe, in the beginning of March, and now it's the end of March, and now it's... Well, you might get some.

44:20.250 --> 44:21.090
[SPEAKER_02]: You might get a couple.

44:22.111 --> 44:23.392
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's gonna be shortages...

44:24.924 --> 44:35.272
[SPEAKER_02]: All those shortages because I guess they're not shipping Australia, they're just going to be shipping the United States, you know, to make that... I was going to say, they took all of Australia's consoles and took them back and tweaked them for US.

44:35.752 --> 44:36.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Put them out here.

44:36.613 --> 44:37.093
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

44:37.294 --> 44:39.736
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all, eh, Australia, not very important.

44:40.856 --> 44:42.378
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.

44:42.678 --> 44:44.159
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, if you're looking to play the 360...

44:46.189 --> 44:47.230
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

45:16.215 --> 45:17.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, what?

45:18.077 --> 45:23.481
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold 600,000 units in the first three months instead of 3 million?

45:24.402 --> 45:25.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're right on schedule.

45:26.023 --> 45:30.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaded2006 in our chatroom says, The shortages will actually last another four to six years.

45:31.347 --> 45:31.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope not.

45:31.868 --> 45:35.571
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when the Xbox 720 will be out by then or whatever they do next.

45:36.171 --> 45:36.492
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope.

45:36.672 --> 45:37.032
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

45:38.233 --> 45:44.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Xbox 360 is very misleading because it makes it sound like you can rotate the system, but we know it happens.

45:45.399 --> 45:45.659
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

45:46.169 --> 45:52.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're traveling abroad right now, let's go over to the UK and go over to DarkSakura for the UK report.

45:53.672 --> 45:58.274
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the Grim Reaper has visited Gizmondo Europe.

45:58.955 --> 46:06.598
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finally dead, kaput, and filing for bankruptcy.

46:06.718 --> 46:10.040
[SPEAKER_05]: Gizmondo UK has been ordered to liquidate by the High Court.

46:10.140 --> 46:13.681
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of this, the liquidators will probably have to sell off the company's assets.

46:14.241 --> 46:14.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch out!

46:14.922 --> 46:15.602
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what that means.

46:16.777 --> 46:18.278
[SPEAKER_05]: Discount Gizmondo!

46:42.972 --> 46:52.254
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just so that when you're going up against the likes of Nintendo, really, you know, we had our Neo Geo make it a little while and die over here.

46:52.774 --> 46:53.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Neo Geo Pocket Color.

46:54.175 --> 46:56.715
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wonderswan never even came out over here.

46:57.015 --> 47:02.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably announcing a console revision before you launch the console, not a good idea.

47:03.077 --> 47:04.577
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at any rate, you know...

47:06.170 --> 47:16.295
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel awful for them because I talked with a few of the reps that were there at E3 and I thought that they were just fabulous and I thought they really tried really hard to make this something that would appeal to people.

47:16.395 --> 47:18.256
[SPEAKER_03]: They believed in it and that's important.

47:18.997 --> 47:20.277
[SPEAKER_03]: But belief only gets you so far.

47:20.437 --> 47:21.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's too bad.

47:21.158 --> 47:24.720
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of, oh well, maybe next time.

47:25.380 --> 47:27.221
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else is going on besides that?

47:28.542 --> 47:30.883
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, my heart still hurts over that though.

47:33.264 --> 47:35.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need a moment of silence for Gizmondo?

47:38.745 --> 47:42.407
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the next thing is that Nintendo is pushing their Wi-Fi online services.

47:46.570 --> 47:47.750
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me as I lose my voice.

47:48.671 --> 47:52.493
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a video spot for the service which is going worldwide.

47:53.073 --> 47:59.757
[SPEAKER_05]: It's showing worldwide head-to-head playability and it's sort of big news.

48:00.290 --> 48:01.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, it's very epic.

48:02.250 --> 48:04.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, epic.

48:04.351 --> 48:07.131
[SPEAKER_03]: Worldwide Wi-Fi by Nintendo.

48:07.211 --> 48:08.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

48:09.432 --> 48:10.352
[SPEAKER_05]: With monster trucks.

48:11.652 --> 48:20.854
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, I mean, what this raises to question is are they really going for a worldwide market with that?

48:21.874 --> 48:29.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think as long as you get the big three, it seems like as long as you get the big three, Japan, US, UK, the rest of it kind of falls into place.

48:30.854 --> 48:33.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I just... I don't know.

48:33.295 --> 48:39.656
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I honestly think that I would love to see something like that go worldwide so that, you know, I have a lot of friends overseas.

48:40.256 --> 48:45.618
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I would really like to be able to sit down and play my games with my friends overseas if we can overcome the eight hour time difference.

48:46.978 --> 48:51.019
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, you know, I think it would be... I'm really hoping that that's their goal.

48:51.939 --> 48:52.499
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

48:52.839 --> 48:53.779
[SPEAKER_05]: It's thought provoking.

48:53.859 --> 48:54.560
[SPEAKER_05]: Truly epic.

48:55.020 --> 48:55.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.541
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming up, release dates.

48:59.921 --> 49:00.141
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

49:01.001 --> 49:03.942
[SPEAKER_05]: because we like release dates because that means that stuff goes out.

49:04.942 --> 49:12.945
[SPEAKER_05]: So coming up on the 17th, Frogger, Helmet Chaos coming out on the DS.

49:13.146 --> 49:14.386
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, again, UK news.

49:15.026 --> 49:18.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Guilty Gear Isuka, Ico being re-released on PS2.

49:20.148 --> 49:22.729
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Mark Echo's Getting Up content under pressure.

49:23.269 --> 49:30.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow of the Colossus, Shaman King, Master of Spirits 2, SpongeBob SquarePants, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49:32.820 --> 49:36.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that blah blah blah stand for Spongebob Squarepants Who Really Gives a Fuck?

49:36.783 --> 49:37.223
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

49:37.303 --> 49:39.444
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Yellow Avenger.

49:39.584 --> 49:42.066
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Spongebob, but I could care less about the games.

49:42.106 --> 49:43.086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like whoopty shit.

49:43.106 --> 49:43.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

49:44.327 --> 49:46.689
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Super Monkey Ball Touch and Roll, which makes me happy.

49:48.129 --> 49:50.491
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Lockdown.

49:51.632 --> 49:57.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Also coming out, there's actually one on the 19th, which is Too Tough Mission Nadia on DS.

50:00.609 --> 50:01.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Alien Hominid PC

[SPEAKER_05]: America's Army, Rise of the Soldier on Xbox, Unk, Black, Bust a Move DS, Crash Day, EverQuest 2, Galactic Kingdoms 2, Coulomb, Mega Man, Maverick Hunter X, which I recommend to everybody in the universe to play because it's awesome, NARC, Omnimusha 3, Panzer Elite Action, and Project Zero 3.

50:36.043 --> 50:39.686
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have SeaWorld Adventure, Shamu's Deep Sea Adventure.

50:41.588 --> 50:41.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki,

50:42.492 --> 50:43.293
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with you?

50:43.313 --> 50:43.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was that it?

50:43.833 --> 50:44.234
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

50:44.274 --> 50:45.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you going to do another week there?

50:45.275 --> 50:45.315
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

50:45.335 --> 50:46.156
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

50:46.836 --> 50:48.238
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go over to Loki for the U.S.

50:48.458 --> 50:48.959
[SPEAKER_03]: counterpart.

50:49.019 --> 50:49.899
[SPEAKER_02]: What's coming up in the U.S.

50:49.919 --> 50:50.580
[SPEAKER_02]: for release dates?

50:51.601 --> 50:52.602
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of fun stuff.

50:53.123 --> 50:55.986
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite, Full Auto, is finally coming out on the Xbox 360.

50:56.046 --> 51:01.751
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also got actually some of the very similar ones.

51:03.223 --> 51:08.086
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Monkey Ball Touch the one for the DS, which would be really cool.

51:08.986 --> 51:11.288
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got, I believe, Mark Echo's getting up.

51:11.928 --> 51:14.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly, he's coming out, hopefully, because it keeps getting delayed.

51:16.311 --> 51:18.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Drakengard 2, which would be pretty sweet.

51:19.893 --> 51:25.536
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe those are the big ones for that week, actually.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.558
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of smaller stuff.

51:30.503 --> 51:31.603
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care about the small stuff.

51:32.164 --> 51:32.924
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all B-titles.

51:32.964 --> 51:35.326
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's a sleeper hit in there, but then we'll talk about it later.

51:35.366 --> 51:37.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dragon Guard 2 is going to be pretty sweet.

51:37.828 --> 51:39.890
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone remembers the first one.

51:39.990 --> 51:40.530
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't.

51:40.550 --> 51:43.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I never played it.

51:43.252 --> 51:43.412
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

51:43.812 --> 51:47.615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Panzer Dragoon crossed with Dynasty Warriors type of thing.

51:48.416 --> 51:52.839
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have dragon combat and lots of people versus one person type of thing.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.141
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be pretty cool.

51:56.462 --> 51:56.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

51:57.679 --> 52:04.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so let's go back over to Matt to talk about an old classic title coming back for a new resurgence.

52:04.764 --> 52:05.324
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on here?

52:06.024 --> 52:06.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemmings!

52:06.865 --> 52:08.146
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody remembers Lemmings?

52:08.466 --> 52:09.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, heck yeah.

52:09.727 --> 52:10.947
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to draw Lemmings.

52:11.168 --> 52:11.888
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemmings.

52:12.228 --> 52:13.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Lemmings was awesome.

52:13.269 --> 52:17.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have the old Super Nintendo one, and it was also on the PC.

52:17.432 --> 52:19.633
[SPEAKER_03]: I had like Super Lemmings or something, which wasn't as good, but...

52:20.962 --> 52:22.563
[SPEAKER_03]: The game got kind of hard pretty quick.

52:22.603 --> 52:24.404
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe that's what it was I had on PC, Lemmings 2.

52:24.644 --> 52:24.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

52:25.044 --> 52:25.805
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up with Lemmings?

52:26.225 --> 52:29.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemmings is available for free to play over the internet.

52:29.647 --> 52:30.027
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

52:30.047 --> 52:30.948
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you say?

52:32.208 --> 52:38.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can actually, it's programmed in DHTML, and you can play it if you have a pretty decent PC.

52:39.390 --> 52:48.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, just head on over to www.elizium.nu slash scripts slash lemmings.

52:48.693 --> 52:51.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I have a feeling this isn't endorsed by the official company, is it?

52:52.034 --> 52:54.716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in a domain that's .nu.

52:55.277 --> 52:57.939
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of thinking this isn't endorsed by the original company.

52:58.219 --> 53:01.302
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically all you need is just a modern browser.

53:01.722 --> 53:10.589
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll work with most recent versions of Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Opera, and a 500 plus megahertz processor.

53:10.869 --> 53:15.753
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got any computer that's within this decade, you probably can run this.

53:15.833 --> 53:16.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

53:16.654 --> 53:16.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.

53:17.816 --> 53:24.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Some comments from the chatroom there, www.orangelandre.com Tomo Kun says, that's my earliest gaming memory is Lemmings.

53:25.481 --> 53:25.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

53:26.801 --> 53:28.843
[SPEAKER_03]: And then VxJasonXV, holy futs.

53:30.103 --> 53:30.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

53:31.404 --> 53:35.287
[SPEAKER_03]: And just some people doing the bard makes a little XD face over Lemmings.

53:35.367 --> 53:39.249
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely a title that's fond, very fond with some people.

53:39.749 --> 53:42.371
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may say so, I'd also like to give a shout out to the bard.

53:42.571 --> 53:42.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

53:43.151 --> 53:44.072
[SPEAKER_05]: We were college roommates.

53:44.798 --> 53:46.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, alright, cool.

53:46.759 --> 53:49.200
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you finally got to listen to the show.

53:49.240 --> 53:49.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

53:50.960 --> 53:51.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now look at that.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.201
[SPEAKER_03]: We lost Loki.

53:52.241 --> 53:53.261
[SPEAKER_03]: He's over there playing lemmings.

53:53.461 --> 53:53.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.

53:54.302 --> 53:54.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

53:55.102 --> 53:55.482
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

53:55.542 --> 53:55.822
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

53:56.482 --> 53:57.743
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn off the crack.

53:58.603 --> 54:04.685
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, it only hurts the ones you love, and you eventually, because you'll lose liver function from playing lemmings.

54:04.905 --> 54:05.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

54:05.406 --> 54:07.306
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody had to make the real bad pun.

54:07.927 --> 54:11.848
[SPEAKER_03]: Xander in our chat room just started singing, We are the lemmings on the run.

54:12.561 --> 54:13.562
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the song from In the Groove?

54:13.982 --> 54:14.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget it.

54:15.382 --> 54:15.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Nerd!

54:16.203 --> 54:16.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

54:19.304 --> 54:20.125
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

54:20.645 --> 54:21.885
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk about this story.

54:21.925 --> 54:22.886
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of interesting.

54:24.607 --> 54:29.789
[SPEAKER_03]: A solitaire game got a New York City worker fired this week.

54:30.129 --> 54:30.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what happened.

54:31.210 --> 54:33.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Office Assistant Edward Greenwood the 9th

54:34.909 --> 54:35.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

54:58.646 --> 54:59.668
[SPEAKER_03]: for playing Solitaire.

55:00.409 --> 55:04.016
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bloomberg said, the workplace is not an appropriate place for games.

55:04.337 --> 55:07.403
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a place where you've got to do the job that you're getting paid for.

55:08.291 --> 55:09.252
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenwood's response.

55:09.312 --> 55:15.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenwood, by the way, earned $27,000 a year and had worked in the office for six years.

55:15.275 --> 55:21.298
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, He also said in the interview that he kept his playtime to his one-hour lunch or during his quick breaks when he needed a moment of distraction.

55:35.546 --> 55:39.536
[SPEAKER_03]: or it sounds like in there then he said maybe he'll play for a minute and get back into his work.

55:41.038 --> 55:42.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things that surprised me about this story.

55:43.079 --> 55:47.301
[SPEAKER_03]: One, he only made $27,000 a year and he lives in the New York City area?

55:47.321 --> 55:47.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

55:47.961 --> 55:50.342
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably living in a really crap apartment.

55:50.442 --> 55:54.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy, because that's not a great salary.

55:54.924 --> 55:57.746
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought people in that area had to make more, so I'm sorry, dude.

55:59.026 --> 55:59.526
[SPEAKER_03]: But what do you think?

56:00.067 --> 56:04.989
[SPEAKER_03]: The second part that's surprising is that is this just a case of bad timing?

56:05.049 --> 56:09.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Was the mayor just trying to save his butt because somebody snapped a picture and he didn't want...

56:10.191 --> 56:11.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Making an example of him.

56:11.736 --> 56:12.398
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.

56:13.702 --> 56:17.494
[SPEAKER_05]: At my work, we actually have an internet workstation set up.

56:18.138 --> 56:23.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for use during breaks, but they've actually been really cracking down about... They don't even put the games on our systems.

56:23.942 --> 56:25.503
[SPEAKER_05]: They're removed from our whole setup.

56:26.323 --> 56:34.608
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of places are cracking down about having private files on your computer, about even your desktop wallpaper.

56:34.808 --> 56:38.991
[SPEAKER_05]: These computers are for work use only.

56:39.711 --> 56:44.534
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to play a game, do it during your break and bring a Game Boy with you.

56:45.035 --> 56:45.615
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I do.

56:45.655 --> 56:46.876
[SPEAKER_05]: I play my DS in the break room.

56:48.177 --> 56:48.517
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

56:48.537 --> 56:59.500
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about the managed application network, and that's a very similar thing at the place where I work, is that they don't have Solitaire and stuff because it's a managed application distribution system, so you only have access to the programs that you need.

56:59.860 --> 57:03.281
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of those programs at my company you need to do your job is Internet Explorer.

57:03.581 --> 57:05.882
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, people find their way over to...

57:06.762 --> 57:10.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Games.Yahoo and some of the other stuff and they play Bejeweled and stuff.

57:10.104 --> 57:13.506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see people doing this on their breaks at my work a lot.

57:13.846 --> 57:14.807
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are blocked at my work.

57:15.247 --> 57:15.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

57:15.587 --> 57:22.211
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to understand is he was playing Solitaire and he's fired for playing Solitaire because Solitaire is a crappy game.

57:22.931 --> 57:24.432
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor was trying to make an example.

57:24.472 --> 57:27.554
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to play games at my work, god damn it, it's not going to be this piece of shit game.

57:27.574 --> 57:29.235
[SPEAKER_03]: You better play Minesweeper.

57:29.355 --> 57:30.696
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be playing Minesweeper.

57:30.736 --> 57:33.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Solitaire is so 1990, okay?

57:35.191 --> 57:41.273
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it just shows the simple fact that, and actually this is an issue I have about the American workplace in general.

57:41.733 --> 57:49.356
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I believe that it's in, I want to say in the Netherlands they offer you something like four months mandatory vacation.

57:49.536 --> 57:51.276
[SPEAKER_05]: No, four weeks mandatory vacation time.

57:51.677 --> 57:55.318
[SPEAKER_05]: You are required by law to take your vacation.

57:55.658 --> 57:55.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

57:56.394 --> 58:01.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, you can roll over your vacation to the next year, store it up, but you can only retain like five days of it or something like that.

58:02.358 --> 58:09.082
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they focus on time is productivity instead of healthy workers are more productive workers.

58:09.382 --> 58:14.585
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the guy's concept of a micro break where he says, you know, I just do it for a minute.

58:16.605 --> 58:27.610
[SPEAKER_03]: In a productivity world, let's say, I don't know what this guy's job was, but let's say he was in an environment where he had, let's say you work a job where you process applications and you have to do 50 applications a day.

58:28.090 --> 58:32.592
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as I'm meeting my 50 applications a day, where's the harm in a little solitaire here and there?

58:33.072 --> 58:38.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's like the people at various places that I've been at are rewarded for having over 100% productivity.

58:39.480 --> 58:41.462
[SPEAKER_05]: I, on average, have over 100% productivity.

58:41.963 --> 58:45.647
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get up all the time and go to the bathroom.

58:45.667 --> 58:46.628
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a total slacker.

58:46.788 --> 58:47.469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a slacker.

58:49.211 --> 58:59.840
[SPEAKER_05]: But just the thing is, that really gets me about that, in a lot of places, new hire training will actually say, take a five-minute break for every hour that you look at the computer.

58:59.960 --> 59:01.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Ergonomics people will tell you this.

59:02.422 --> 59:08.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest your eyes every hour or so for about five minutes so that you will not cause permanent damage.

59:08.947 --> 59:15.512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have such a high rate of people who have to go into the doctor and go on stress leave and are on medication every

59:16.098 --> 59:42.209
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring up a very good point, because I'm a corporate trainer, is what I do for a living, and I teach big classes that usually go on for a several week period, and I usually tell my students, look, on your breaks, you shouldn't be on the internet, because I allow them to do it when they're on their breaks, but I say, you know what, you really need to go up, go outside, walk around the building, go get coffee or something, get away from the computer, because this is where you are the rest of the day.

59:43.124 --> 01:00:11.555
[SPEAKER_03]: and to kind of support that and then of course you know I totally go against what I say because I have to catch up on my own emails during break usually but you know what they do though sometimes and I've seen people do this is that I've seen people will be I don't catch them on it but I know they're doing it because like I'll walk around and suddenly like somebody hits a button real fast it looks like their screen flickered I know what they're doing they're taking down the game they were just playing or the email they were just writing people get sneaky with this stuff it's very interesting it's corporate technology world

01:00:11.946 --> 01:00:12.606
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the whole thing.

01:00:12.887 --> 01:00:14.408
[SPEAKER_05]: People will work through their breaks.

01:00:15.148 --> 01:00:27.016
[SPEAKER_05]: I know lots of people who just work through their breaks because they're so worried about their level of productivity, about not having enough hours in the day to get their work done, work overtime without getting paid for it.

01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:29.229
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:00:45.985 --> 01:00:46.946
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:10.204 --> 01:01:18.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I'm curious if you have anything to add to this, because you work in an environment where it is about games, and you guys are part of your job is being familiar with video games, which is kind of interesting.

01:01:19.246 --> 01:01:28.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I read a lot of sites, but usually while I'm working, I'll spend the first half an hour a day checking up on all the news sites and posting them on our forums.

01:01:28.427 --> 01:01:37.509
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, though, I have to know all the stuff that's going on, because I'll find out about date changes before we even hear about them.

01:01:37.749 --> 01:01:38.409
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be like, hey,

01:01:39.022 --> 01:01:41.324
[SPEAKER_02]: They just made a press release that this has changed dates.

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:45.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Check into it, and then we'll get the update for it.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:52.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we usually take our 15-minute breaks in a six-player deathmatch in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

01:01:54.858 --> 01:02:01.385
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really comment about going outside and getting coffee and stuff.

01:02:02.236 --> 01:02:05.598
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go to the chat room because the chat room is just lighting up with feedback on this here.

01:02:05.898 --> 01:02:11.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Bugs in our chat room, he says, If there's a flippin' photo shoot in your cube, close that shit.

01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:12.781
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

01:02:13.381 --> 01:02:18.724
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm being corrected by SSJ100Matt who says, You can live fine in New York City making $30,000 a year.

01:02:19.264 --> 01:02:21.806
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stand corrected on that.

01:02:21.826 --> 01:02:24.047
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought the cost of living was way, way higher there.

01:02:24.067 --> 01:02:24.567
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess, you know...

01:02:25.643 --> 01:02:30.406
[SPEAKER_03]: New York City is a great place, so I guess it's one of those things where if you can sacrifice... See, I need my space.

01:02:30.466 --> 01:02:35.148
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a huge apartment and stuff, but I guess if you can sacrifice a little bit of that, then it works out.

01:02:36.509 --> 01:02:39.170
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope nobody was offended by that comment, because I really didn't mean any offense.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.351
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just really surprised.

01:02:40.391 --> 01:02:42.752
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you really had to have more.

01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:50.956
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who just moved to New York about maybe six months ago who was complaining about having a one-bedroom apartment for paying $1,200 for it, which is what I pay for a house.

01:02:51.076 --> 01:02:52.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's interesting.

01:02:53.918 --> 01:02:54.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:02:55.398 --> 01:02:55.778
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

01:02:55.838 --> 01:03:00.380
[SPEAKER_03]: MiniMe283 says, you know, once upon a time, Solitaire used to be played with real cards.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good point.

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:05.942
[SPEAKER_03]: What if he had actually had the cards out on his desk?

01:03:06.202 --> 01:03:08.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Would the same thing have happened if he had had playing cards out on his desk?

01:03:08.843 --> 01:03:09.083
[SPEAKER_03]: Fired!

01:03:09.523 --> 01:03:10.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think he would have still been fired?

01:03:10.743 --> 01:03:10.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:03:10.903 --> 01:03:11.603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he would have been.

01:03:12.404 --> 01:03:14.444
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he would have been because it's still a use of company time.

01:03:14.464 --> 01:03:15.485
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:16.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:03:18.526 --> 01:03:18.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:03:19.006 --> 01:03:21.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, we used to play Minesweeper with real minds.

01:03:22.127 --> 01:03:22.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha!

01:03:23.702 --> 01:03:26.384
[SPEAKER_03]: HitStun says, yeah, don't use the work PC for games.

01:03:26.464 --> 01:03:27.925
[SPEAKER_03]: Use something else like a cell phone.

01:03:28.345 --> 01:03:29.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of cell phones have games.

01:03:30.126 --> 01:03:32.307
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if you don't have a DS, you probably have a cell phone.

01:03:32.407 --> 01:03:33.588
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to have our cell phones put away.

01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:36.530
[SPEAKER_03]: It would depend on your work environment.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:38.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're in a call center type area, right?

01:03:38.831 --> 01:03:40.172
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I don't work at the call center.

01:03:40.212 --> 01:03:44.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I work over in one of our production departments.

01:03:45.135 --> 01:03:46.596
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

01:03:46.636 --> 01:03:47.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:03:47.947 --> 01:03:51.948
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did get permission to text message my mother all day when Hurricane Katrina hit.

01:03:51.988 --> 01:03:54.989
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that stuff's different, you know.

01:03:55.269 --> 01:03:56.110
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to know what?

01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.350
[SPEAKER_05]: I still had 110% productivity that day.

01:03:58.471 --> 01:03:58.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:01.552
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

01:04:02.432 --> 01:04:03.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're just bragging.

01:04:03.692 --> 01:04:04.713
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a show-off over there.

01:04:04.813 --> 01:04:08.194
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it means that you can still take time for yourself and still get all your work done.

01:04:08.414 --> 01:04:08.694
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:04:09.704 --> 01:04:15.649
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that Jamie has plenty of time for and can still get all her work done is checking our mailbag over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:04:15.969 --> 01:04:16.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us emails.

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:17.530
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting emails.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:20.693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:04:20.733 --> 01:04:26.897
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you guys send in your emails, DarkSakura reads them, and then she'll print some of the ones she likes out and put them on her fridge.

01:04:27.117 --> 01:04:28.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I post them in my cubicle.

01:04:29.059 --> 01:04:30.680
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she'll throw darts at them.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, uncertain ones.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:38.526
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so let's go over to the mailbag, open that stuff up over there, and see what you folks have to say this week.

01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:40.580
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what's in the mailbag this week?

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:45.581
[SPEAKER_05]: I have once again received a bajillion emails, so I'm taking the eight most relevant ones.

01:04:46.001 --> 01:04:46.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, eight's a lot.

01:04:46.721 --> 01:04:47.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get started.

01:04:48.102 --> 01:04:49.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first from Chupathingy.

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:51.763
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that name, Chupathingy.

01:04:51.783 --> 01:04:52.503
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

01:04:52.703 --> 01:04:58.905
[SPEAKER_03]: I received feedback last week that I need to stop saying, Hi, so-and-so, so I'll just kind of smile.

01:04:59.025 --> 01:04:59.625
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what up?

01:04:59.766 --> 01:05:02.386
[SPEAKER_03]: Know that when Jamie reads your name, I'm smiling.

01:05:02.907 --> 01:05:05.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of saying, Hi, Chupathingy, so I'm smiling.

01:05:06.568 --> 01:05:07.528
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Griff, Chupathingy.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:08.124
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:05:08.224 --> 01:05:08.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:05:08.845 --> 01:05:09.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Read the email.

01:05:09.265 --> 01:05:11.046
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:05:11.086 --> 01:05:12.827
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, you all snapped me today.

01:05:14.207 --> 01:05:17.269
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to say I'm fed up with Joseph Lieberman's crap.

01:05:17.907 --> 01:05:28.634
[SPEAKER_05]: I've written emails to my state senators, Max Bacchus and Conrad Burns, asking them not to buy into Senator Lieberman's ideals and to reject video game banning laws.

01:05:29.014 --> 01:05:31.516
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I will get a form letter or not.

01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:35.018
[SPEAKER_05]: However, even if nothing is done about it, it was still worth the effort.

01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:36.018
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep fighting the good fight.

01:05:36.559 --> 01:05:37.920
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very good.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.503
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for all the people who just sit and go, I don't like this.

01:05:42.823 --> 01:05:43.643
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like that.

01:05:44.284 --> 01:05:45.064
[SPEAKER_05]: Do something about it.

01:05:45.104 --> 01:05:45.865
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got senators.

01:05:45.905 --> 01:05:46.185
[SPEAKER_05]: Write them.

01:05:48.141 --> 01:05:50.222
[SPEAKER_05]: You want your voice heard, you need to make it heard.

01:05:50.702 --> 01:05:50.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

01:05:51.683 --> 01:05:52.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing else to say.

01:05:52.443 --> 01:05:52.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:54.664
[SPEAKER_05]: So a bajillion kudos go to you.

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:55.504
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

01:05:55.904 --> 01:05:56.744
[SPEAKER_03]: The winner is you.

01:05:57.825 --> 01:06:01.546
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, our dear friend Rob, the one that's not you.

01:06:02.066 --> 01:06:02.386
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:03.027
[SPEAKER_03]: The other Rob.

01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:04.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob with two Bs.

01:06:04.387 --> 01:06:05.107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you tell the difference.

01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:05.848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rob with two Bs.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:10.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Sent a list of vaporware from 2005, which I think is pretty cool.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.070
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am loading it as it was a link in the email.

01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:14.631
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:22.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the ones that came up, there was the Optimus keyboard.

01:06:24.722 --> 01:06:30.168
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually said the PowerBook G5 was ineligible.

01:06:31.508 --> 01:06:33.248
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so clarify this for me.

01:06:33.288 --> 01:06:34.089
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like a list.

01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:39.470
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to remember I read a similar article, or maybe it was even the same one, just inadvertently.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:44.871
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something like a list of the top vaporware we didn't see or something like that.

01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:45.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, I get it.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 10 was the high-definition TiVo and TiVo to go for Mac.

01:06:50.933 --> 01:06:57.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 9, AlphaGrip ergonomic keyboard and trackball, which actually looks kind of neat, but it looks too unwieldy.

01:06:59.175 --> 01:06:59.655
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up,

01:07:00.981 --> 01:07:02.322
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as it loads.

01:07:03.142 --> 01:07:04.302
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, this is on Wired News.

01:07:05.443 --> 01:07:09.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Blu-ray or HD DVD discs for the end of 2005, which we didn't see.

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:14.647
[SPEAKER_05]: Team Fortress 2, Brotherhood of Arms, Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess.

01:07:14.667 --> 01:07:15.147
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:16.548
[SPEAKER_05]: That was number six.

01:07:16.568 --> 01:07:17.948
[SPEAKER_03]: It should have been number one.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:20.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's see what else they came up with.

01:07:20.929 --> 01:07:23.571
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, we all drooled over that at E3.

01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:24.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what number one is?

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:26.401
[SPEAKER_03]: StarCraft Ghost

01:07:39.274 --> 01:07:40.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good call.

01:07:40.455 --> 01:07:40.635
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:07:41.035 --> 01:07:43.797
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, Microsoft's Vista and Internet Explorer 7.

01:07:44.337 --> 01:07:47.799
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in its defense, the beta for 7 did come out last year.

01:07:47.899 --> 01:07:50.120
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hearing Firefox is still better.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:51.200
[SPEAKER_05]: I am hearing the same.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.122
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the same thing because I was up on the beta for a little bit.

01:07:55.603 --> 01:07:56.103
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still crap.

01:07:57.077 --> 01:07:57.757
[SPEAKER_05]: 3.

01:07:57.337 --> 01:07:57.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Google.

01:07:57.917 --> 01:07:58.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Beta is galore.

01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:01.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.

01:08:01.679 --> 01:08:03.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Their email is still considered beta, isn't it?

01:08:03.799 --> 01:08:04.739
[SPEAKER_05]: Gmail is still beta.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.880
[SPEAKER_05]: Frugal is still beta.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Alerts, blog search, book search, Scholar.

01:08:09.161 --> 01:08:14.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Google News is the last beta left, but it was still beta in 2005.

01:08:14.943 --> 01:08:15.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point, then.

01:08:16.063 --> 01:08:16.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a good one.

01:08:17.744 --> 01:08:20.925
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we're up to number 2.

01:08:21.985 --> 01:08:22.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Phantom.

01:08:23.885 --> 01:08:24.466
[SPEAKER_05]: The Phantom.

01:08:24.766 --> 01:08:25.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a surprise.

01:08:32.106 --> 01:08:35.408
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand corrected.

01:08:35.468 --> 01:08:36.228
[SPEAKER_03]: No cookie for me.

01:08:36.688 --> 01:08:37.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

01:08:37.049 --> 01:08:37.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a damn cookie.

01:08:37.869 --> 01:08:38.730
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:39.430
[SPEAKER_05]: My cookies.

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.190
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a cookie.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.272
[SPEAKER_05]: These are my sugar-free, gluten-free cookies.

01:08:42.472 --> 01:08:42.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a cookie.

01:08:43.112 --> 01:08:43.973
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually pretty yummy.

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:44.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it tastes like dough.

01:08:44.633 --> 01:08:44.873
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:08:47.335 --> 01:08:48.996
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

01:08:50.737 --> 01:08:51.117
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:57.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the lovely, fantastic, and mystical world of email.

01:08:57.739 --> 01:09:03.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Crispy Creamy writes in and said, Okay, so the actual subject of this is personal game rules.

01:09:04.601 --> 01:09:13.805
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so every once in a while I'll play Naruto 3 for PS2 with my brother and we've set up this rule where you can't push someone into a corner and attack them continually, preventing them from moving.

01:09:13.865 --> 01:09:17.866
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if you guys have any rules you set up with whoever you play with to make the game fair.

01:09:18.513 --> 01:09:19.194
[SPEAKER_03]: No snaking!

01:09:20.475 --> 01:09:21.436
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying the same thing.

01:09:21.497 --> 01:09:24.040
[SPEAKER_03]: No snaking on Mario Kart DS.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, gosh, that's so broad.

01:09:26.482 --> 01:09:28.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not pull up people's radishes in Animal Crossing.

01:09:30.247 --> 01:09:33.010
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different games I could think of.

01:09:33.431 --> 01:09:33.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:39.256
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's general courtesy laws that come with a lot of MMOs, certainly.

01:09:39.677 --> 01:09:51.273
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, things about courtesy, like, you know, especially in a group, you know, even though I was kind of ragging on the group element of Final Fantasy XI earlier, to kind of go back there for a little bit, Final Fantasy XI has such a heavy grouping element that it's like, you know,

01:09:51.553 --> 01:09:52.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Smash Bros.

01:09:52.694 --> 01:09:53.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Melee No Sleep Rule

01:10:18.435 --> 01:10:20.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you can't use the Jigglypuff thing?

01:10:20.357 --> 01:10:20.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:20.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:10:21.638 --> 01:10:22.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, those are some good ones.

01:10:23.039 --> 01:10:26.742
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's actually, sometimes we played with a no Jigglypuff rule at all, because Jigglypuff's annoying.

01:10:26.842 --> 01:10:28.824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep an eye on the chat room while you read the next email.

01:10:28.884 --> 01:10:30.625
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually end up not being allowed to play Kirby.

01:10:32.026 --> 01:10:33.708
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I piss people off when I play Kirby.

01:10:33.888 --> 01:10:38.652
[SPEAKER_03]: People get pissed off when I play Ness, because I sit in the corner and go, PK fire, PK fire, PK fire, PK fire.

01:10:38.872 --> 01:10:39.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:10:41.994 --> 01:10:46.058
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I also got one that was actually sent to Mailbox, but it's supposed to be Mailbag.

01:10:47.159 --> 01:10:47.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

01:10:47.947 --> 01:10:56.193
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, because our awesome webmaster, Jason, digs that stuff out of the black hole of death where those emails go to when they go to the wrong address and forwards them appropriately.

01:10:56.233 --> 01:10:56.913
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank Jason.

01:10:58.815 --> 01:11:05.719
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an email sent more about Flowers for Jack, which I'm just making a mention on.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, we have Flowers for Jack stuff coming up later.

01:11:09.442 --> 01:11:13.625
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm going to leave that just that, you know what, forget him.

01:11:15.124 --> 01:11:18.446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm only addressing it for the sake of, he just pisses me off so much.

01:11:18.526 --> 01:11:20.607
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so that email gets tossed, sorta.

01:11:23.529 --> 01:11:24.430
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have...

01:11:26.411 --> 01:11:32.613
[SPEAKER_05]: An email from, and he wanted me to do the name a certain way, from Happida.

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:38.016
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty long email, so I'm just going to go over, I'm going to quote certain points on it.

01:11:38.456 --> 01:11:39.756
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, hey guys, love the new format.

01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:48.219
[SPEAKER_05]: I listen when I'm at work, and it's gotten pretty tough to find enough quality podcasts to get me through the whole day, especially since Air America has gone to charging for its podcasts.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:49.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they really?

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.360
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess so.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:52.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Not smart, not smart.

01:11:54.326 --> 01:12:01.096
[SPEAKER_05]: Curious as to what this music-oriented gaming show was all about.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:06.163
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a strictly podcast listener for the past year, so I can never catch it live with my schedule.

01:12:07.429 --> 01:12:15.278
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking into options about putting out the old shows either for consumption on some type of archive like CD, DVD.

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:19.744
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is because there was a lot of copyrighted music that came with that, so it's kind of hard for us to do that.

01:12:19.784 --> 01:12:23.508
[SPEAKER_03]: We are also looking into possibilities of possibly syndicating our show.

01:12:24.029 --> 01:12:25.771
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really run the archives with

01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:29.674
[SPEAKER_03]: with DDR Freak anymore because our show's podcast, so it kind of defeats the purpose.

01:12:30.515 --> 01:12:35.278
[SPEAKER_03]: But we may look into a syndication agreement with somebody at some point for the earlier episodes.

01:12:36.099 --> 01:12:37.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything is possible.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:46.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, with us possibly being gone next week, we don't have a contingency plan in place just yet because we live week to week, just like we live paycheck to paycheck.

01:12:48.288 --> 01:12:51.471
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may have a best of, so you can hear some of the highlights from the live show.

01:12:51.491 --> 01:12:54.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might actually be a really good idea to put together some of our highlights from

01:12:54.993 --> 01:12:56.314
[SPEAKER_03]: The old three-hour show.

01:12:57.375 --> 01:13:02.199
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still people that haven't heard Loki play Karaoke Revolution, and we need to put that out to the podcast masses.

01:13:02.339 --> 01:13:03.880
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad I wasn't here live for that.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.522
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in San Diego sleeping in the Harry Potter closet.

01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:07.723
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

01:13:09.884 --> 01:13:14.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this new format, we stay on topic a lot more than we did with the old one.

01:13:14.568 --> 01:13:16.749
[SPEAKER_03]: But that can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing.

01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.730
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:13:19.302 --> 01:13:20.624
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:13:39.366 --> 01:13:40.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the second paragraph pertains to you.

01:13:40.926 --> 01:13:41.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:41.606
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is true.

01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:41.767
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

01:14:04.931 --> 01:14:09.454
[SPEAKER_05]: It was on stage during Jay Allard's keynote speech when he rushed on stage and yelled, Okay, now I'll be serious.

01:14:12.356 --> 01:14:19.220
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was when he was talking about getting some autographs from fans of the G4 people, and I'm pretty sure it was Morgan Webb and what she told the autographs.

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:26.045
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't for him, and she said, jokingly, something along the lines of, Sure, as in he just wanted a picture of her or something.

01:14:26.425 --> 01:14:31.328
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing too important, but you guys were bitching about consistency in World of Warcraft, so I thought I'd call you guys on it.

01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:32.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh...

01:14:32.762 --> 01:14:41.928
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I stand corrected, but also do realize our show, we weren't on iTunes when we did the E3 thing.

01:14:41.948 --> 01:14:47.732
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't on iTunes, I don't think, because iTunes happened in June, I want to say, and that's for all the podcasts.

01:14:47.812 --> 01:14:51.235
[SPEAKER_03]: When iTunes rolled out their podcast name, I think that's when a lot of these shows got huge.

01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:57.199
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that's why I think a lot of people, because I did get a lot of emails from people who didn't know it before.

01:14:57.279 --> 01:14:58.240
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, whatever.

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.241
[SPEAKER_05]: That just means they don't pay attention to you.

01:15:05.912 --> 01:15:16.901
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyhow, on the topic of emulation and finding ROMs, not that everyone here would do such an evil thing, I've heard you can find a lot of great ROM sets via torrent sites.

01:15:17.521 --> 01:15:22.045
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, most everything on there are complete sets for different systems.

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:23.426
[SPEAKER_05]: Something too complete...

01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:38.700
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not interested in foreign games that are basically the same thing or you can't understand the language anyway, you might be pretty successful in finding the odd cult classic or insanely popular ROM here and there, but 90% of the time, they're sets.

01:15:39.161 --> 01:15:48.468
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to throw out some info as I totally agree with you that ROM sites are 9 times out of 10 BS sites just trying to get more votes on useless top lists so they can get more hits on their hentai banners.

01:15:48.528 --> 01:15:49.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about the...

01:15:51.121 --> 01:15:53.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Total scum sites of the internet.

01:15:53.702 --> 01:15:56.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the bottom of the barrel sites.

01:15:56.623 --> 01:16:00.805
[SPEAKER_03]: The just hideously horrible things on the internet.

01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:02.726
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of enough negative words to describe these sites.

01:16:02.746 --> 01:16:05.046
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these top so-and-so sites.

01:16:05.587 --> 01:16:09.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't label all because maybe there's a couple that are okay.

01:16:09.728 --> 01:16:11.449
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what I'm talking about.

01:16:11.489 --> 01:16:13.150
[SPEAKER_03]: You know like top 50 ROM sites.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:15.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Top 10 Nintendo ROM sites.

01:16:15.411 --> 01:16:17.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Top 69 porno sites.

01:16:18.012 --> 01:16:18.432
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's...

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:21.530
[SPEAKER_03]: What a bunch of crap.

01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:23.031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's banners, banners, banners, banners.

01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:26.091
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go ahead and name one of the sites I go through for old searches.

01:16:26.351 --> 01:16:26.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

01:16:26.951 --> 01:16:28.052
[SPEAKER_05]: As Zofar's domain.

01:16:28.432 --> 01:16:29.072
[SPEAKER_05]: Zofar.net.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:30.032
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, oh yeah.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:30.612
[SPEAKER_05]: P-H-A-R.

01:16:31.232 --> 01:16:32.933
[SPEAKER_05]: Still going as last I checked.

01:16:33.013 --> 01:16:33.713
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best.

01:16:34.613 --> 01:16:36.753
[SPEAKER_02]: And... Romnation.net.

01:16:37.474 --> 01:16:37.774
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.

01:16:38.434 --> 01:16:40.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Dotnet or dotcom.

01:16:40.914 --> 01:16:44.135
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember surfing Zofar's domain when Zofar was actually still there.

01:16:44.535 --> 01:16:45.315
[SPEAKER_03]: Years and years ago.

01:16:45.335 --> 01:16:46.015
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember being in the chat room.

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.956
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the International House of Roms.

01:16:48.156 --> 01:16:48.456
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:16:48.536 --> 01:16:49.336
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway, anyway.

01:16:50.441 --> 01:16:51.461
[SPEAKER_03]: before we age ourselves.

01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:57.904
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have one request and that is just call me HappyDah as in email address I'm not going to list.

01:16:58.524 --> 01:17:02.306
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to have the ladies to start stalking me for my elite emailing skills.

01:17:03.346 --> 01:17:07.668
[SPEAKER_05]: But please give a shout out to ARC and tell everyone to give some damn blood for goodness sakes.

01:17:07.728 --> 01:17:08.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Free cookies and pop.

01:17:08.628 --> 01:17:09.629
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a win-win for everyone.

01:17:10.909 --> 01:17:11.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:13.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a local thing?

01:17:15.351 --> 01:17:18.192
[SPEAKER_05]: It's someone who actually emailed from the Red Cross.

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:19.153
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

01:17:19.773 --> 01:17:20.253
[SPEAKER_05]: Red Cross worker.

01:17:20.526 --> 01:17:21.567
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, sweet.

01:17:22.568 --> 01:17:27.853
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a... Because that acronym made me think of something local.

01:17:28.153 --> 01:17:29.374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, ARC.

01:17:29.434 --> 01:17:31.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my college, American... Okay, I got thrown for a minute.

01:17:31.716 --> 01:17:32.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now I get it.

01:17:32.497 --> 01:17:33.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I get it now.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.102
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, but actually I find that very cool.

01:17:38.162 --> 01:17:39.684
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually am not allowed to give blood anymore.

01:17:40.745 --> 01:17:40.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

01:17:41.565 --> 01:17:44.668
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I actually tested positive for certain antibodies.

01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:17:45.908 --> 01:17:47.028
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I can't give blood anymore.

01:17:47.369 --> 01:17:48.249
[SPEAKER_05]: That and I hallucinated.

01:17:48.449 --> 01:17:52.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you'll just have to give a lot of sweat and tears instead.

01:17:53.311 --> 01:17:53.531
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:17:54.071 --> 01:17:56.472
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be happy to accept your cookie donations.

01:17:57.452 --> 01:17:57.812
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:17:57.952 --> 01:17:58.512
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

01:17:58.712 --> 01:17:59.233
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all the mail?

01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:04.454
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, one of our listeners, Justin, wanted to know the name of the title we use for the FUs of the week.

01:18:04.574 --> 01:18:07.575
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one-winged angel theme from Final Fantasy Advent Children.

01:18:07.796 --> 01:18:09.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and the FUs of the week will be coming up in the next segment.

01:18:10.396 --> 01:18:11.057
[SPEAKER_05]: And last one.

01:18:11.297 --> 01:18:11.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

01:18:12.297 --> 01:18:14.398
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a message from...

01:18:15.764 --> 01:18:16.825
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go by Jaded.

01:18:17.825 --> 01:18:19.966
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you may have already gotten some of this already.

01:18:20.026 --> 01:18:24.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I know you have gotten some of this before, but it is on the whole video game thing.

01:18:24.528 --> 01:18:26.789
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an article I found on Slashdot that might be interesting.

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:31.791
[SPEAKER_05]: And pulling that up, video gaming keeps the brain from aging.

01:18:33.869 --> 01:18:41.751
[SPEAKER_05]: and is basically stating that a body of research suggests that playing video games provides similar benefits to bilingualism and exercising the mind.

01:18:42.311 --> 01:18:50.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as people fluent in two languages learn to suppress one language while speaking the other, so too are gamers adept at shutting out distractions to deftly switch attention between different tasks.

01:18:50.713 --> 01:18:58.315
[SPEAKER_05]: A new study of 100 university students in Toronto has found out that video gamers consistently outperform their non-playing peers in a series of tricky mental tests.

01:18:58.855 --> 01:19:01.136
[SPEAKER_05]: If they also happen to be bilingual, they were unbeatable.

01:19:01.816 --> 01:19:01.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh.

01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have found similar studies to that effect.

01:19:07.071 --> 01:19:12.093
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one in one of the psychological journals that I was reading when I was stuck in my doctor's office that they let me keep.

01:19:12.113 --> 01:19:21.856
[SPEAKER_05]: It was talking about how gamers have a better grasp of multitasking and puzzle, basically, problem-solving skills.

01:19:22.356 --> 01:19:27.718
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for stories that say games can make you smart, but I do think it really depends on what kind of games you're playing, too.

01:19:27.838 --> 01:19:28.778
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a huge part of it.

01:19:29.779 --> 01:19:29.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:19:30.859 --> 01:19:32.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so is that it for the mailbag?

01:19:32.962 --> 01:19:33.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that it?

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:34.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, we're good?

01:19:34.485 --> 01:19:36.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you want to send in some email?

01:19:36.728 --> 01:19:42.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Let's close up the old mailbag and get back into some news.

01:19:43.759 --> 01:19:45.802
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more thing for you guys before we go to break.

01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:52.308
[SPEAKER_03]: This kind of relates to an email bag question because it asked about what was the music gaming live show like.

01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:55.370
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a story that definitely would have been brought up on that show.

01:19:55.631 --> 01:19:57.452
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not turning our back on the music game scene.

01:19:57.472 --> 01:19:59.414
[SPEAKER_03]: We know a lot of you guys are still listening.

01:19:59.474 --> 01:20:00.475
[SPEAKER_03]: We love music games.

01:20:00.535 --> 01:20:01.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Love them, love them.

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:04.058
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with DDR Extreme?

01:20:04.358 --> 01:20:05.800
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole title, DDR Extreme.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.640
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:12.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody remembers similar kind of thing with the hot coffee with stuff that's left in the game that

01:20:14.088 --> 01:20:15.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Not supposed to be in there, but it was in there.

01:20:15.869 --> 01:20:16.849
[SPEAKER_02]: People found Memories.

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:20.130
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were wondering, how the hell are we going to unlock Memories?

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:24.871
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those who don't know, Memories is a song that was in the arcade that should have been in the home version, but wasn't.

01:20:25.131 --> 01:20:25.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:20:26.452 --> 01:20:31.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there has been a Codebreaker code released for it.

01:20:31.433 --> 01:20:35.455
[SPEAKER_02]: And Codebreaker is kind of like a GameShark type of device where you use it for cheating.

01:20:36.115 --> 01:20:39.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you just enter this code in, and it's 2A59D741.

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:47.499
[SPEAKER_02]: F1, A5, E096.

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:54.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Enter that in on a version 7.0 or higher code record because most of them are higher than that.

01:20:55.761 --> 01:20:57.662
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will unlock memories.

01:20:58.142 --> 01:21:04.304
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything including it being in the song wheel, actually having unlock information in the information screen.

01:21:04.705 --> 01:21:06.965
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is save your game and you're done.

01:21:07.205 --> 01:21:08.906
[SPEAKER_02]: It's permanently unlocked.

01:21:09.006 --> 01:21:09.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:21:09.586 --> 01:21:11.127
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know how somebody found that.

01:21:12.287 --> 01:21:13.988
[SPEAKER_03]: How did somebody find that code?

01:21:14.248 --> 01:21:15.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Carefully, I guess.

01:21:15.529 --> 01:21:16.269
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

01:21:16.549 --> 01:21:17.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, kudos to you.

01:21:17.429 --> 01:21:20.231
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, kudos to, uh, Air Japan, um, where that was posted.

01:21:20.271 --> 01:21:24.893
[SPEAKER_03]: A way to squeeze out an extra song from DDR Extreme, which came out, what, two years ago now?

01:21:25.633 --> 01:21:25.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:26.234
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:21:26.474 --> 01:21:26.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:21:27.274 --> 01:21:28.435
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, it's increased playability.

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:28.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:21:30.816 --> 01:21:31.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:21:32.176 --> 01:21:33.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm, now I'm eating cookies over here.

01:21:33.757 --> 01:21:35.138
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna make me fat, DarkSakura.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:35.518
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not.

01:21:35.538 --> 01:21:36.619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, these are healthy cookies, huh?

01:21:36.839 --> 01:21:41.481
[SPEAKER_05]: These cookies, okay, these cookies are the most awesome cookies in the universe because, um,

01:21:43.439 --> 01:21:48.040
[SPEAKER_05]: They're no sugar added, no trans fat, and taste great.

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:49.880
[SPEAKER_05]: I shop at the natural food store.

01:21:51.141 --> 01:21:51.441
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:21:51.941 --> 01:22:00.603
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're going to go to a quick break here and eat some more cookies, and we'll be back in a little while with Part B of our podcast.
