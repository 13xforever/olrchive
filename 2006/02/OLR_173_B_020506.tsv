362	4828	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to the podcast stream twice weekly.
5129	11638	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to listings with past episodes.
12058	13901	And now the conclusion of episode number 173 for February 5th, 2006.
19727	25111	And we're back here for the second half of Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 173.
25171	27353	For this, February the 5th of 2006.
27613	30135	Hope you guys are doing well.
30155	32357	We had a pretty fun first half, very long first half.
32958	38542	As you may or may not have heard, hopefully you guys have all went back and downloaded part A of the show, for those of you guys listening on the podcast.
38562	41224	But I was having a little bit of printing drama.
41264	43506	I wasn't able to print my boarding pass for my flight tomorrow.
43986	47489	Loki finally got the damn thing to work, and we printed my boarding pass during the break.
47529	48290	I'm very happy.
48870	52332	Even if I do have a crappy B-Pass, damn you, Southwest and your stupid system.
52792	54773	Even if I have a crappy B-Pass, at least it works.
54793	55493	So thank you, Loki.
56634	56914	All right.
57854	58175	No mic?
58195	59195	There you go.
60076	65278	Sorry, Christopher, like, you tangled me up in the chair.
65518	67299	That's all right.
67499	72982	And, of course, if you didn't hear Part A, also, I'm in a very angsty Xbox 360 mood tonight.
73062	74542	And I'm not going there again.
74562	76143	You'll just have to download Part A to figure out why.
76163	77524	But if I sound bitter, I have a good reason.
78413	80434	Alright, let's get back into it though.
80494	83015	Let's talk about something else that makes a lot of people bitter.
83555	85296	And that's lack of Advent Children.
85336	87837	Because you know we were supposed to have this movie out like months ago.
88517	89757	DarkSakura, what did you do with it?
89937	92078	I had it months ago.
92498	94439	Yeah, but what did you do with the rest of our copies?
94459	96100	Where's our English version of it?
96140	96740	What did you do with it?
98120	98541	I ate it.
100821	101962	Barf it up so we can have it.
102042	103042	No, really.
103062	104723	Where is Advent Children for the USA?
105323	107204	Well, you know, I...
108280	119123	We're supposed to be getting it sometime this year according to the digital bits, which is basically what's been said about it.
119924	120504	This is a quote.
120544	127126	It's taking a little extra time to work with the director to get all of the supplemental elements finished, which is why it's delayed.
128907	136649	For as long as it's taking us to get it, I feel really awful for our friends in the UK who are probably not even getting it until after we do.
137532	138032	Hi, it's February.
138072	138792	Where's my Advent Children?
138812	138852	Hi.
166521	166981	I don't get it.
167401	168162	That's okay.
168842	170802	Is this thing going to still sell when it comes out?
170923	172263	They're going to have to have a lot of extras.
172283	173843	Yeah, people are going to buy it.
173983	174864	I know they will.
175224	180866	However, I'm very much in a wait and see mode over this.
181546	182126	I have it.
182346	183526	I can watch it whenever I want.
185647	189228	I'm trying not to be too pushy on it.
190468	192209	But I want to see the stuff on the desks.
192566	194608	I don't want to watch it on my computer the first time.
194648	199791	I want to watch it on a TV, a big TV, as big as possible, for the first time.
199811	201312	I don't want it pixelated or none of that.
201352	202193	I want it beautiful.
203894	204094	What?
204494	205936	Mine's actually a full DVD rip.
206776	207417	Damn you people.
208838	209898	It looks pretty on my screen.
209938	212540	I'm trying to be legit with this here, okay?
212560	213921	I legitimately downloaded it.
214001	220065	I want to support Square and Sony here, but I'm finding it harder and harder to as this thing keeps getting delayed.
220566	222067	Whatever the problem is, fix it.
224655	225336	Anything else?
225376	228297	If it's to my credit, I have removed it from my hard drive.
229177	229777	Loki, what?
230657	233278	You had a release date on this at one point, and now it's shot again.
233318	234439	Yeah, they keep pulling it.
234979	235459	Jeez.
236059	241681	There was even a rumor going around saying that they're redoing all the animations to match the English dubbing.
243502	246783	Which, I guess that would be a good reason why it's taken so long.
246803	248244	Okay, that might be a decent reason.
248284	251565	Nah, I don't think that's what the reason is.
251705	252025	But, um,
252662	258748	I think the UK was actually, there was an article I think out this week about the UK and they're getting theirs in 2006 as well.
259128	266655	See, I'd imagine they don't have to do any sort of localization for a UK release.
269638	276144	Alright, let's move on and talk about something that's going on in Japanese arcades right now, but not US ones.
276224	276925	Loki, what's going on?
277968	279609	What's going on is Soul Calibur 3.
279689	284771	The PlayStation 2 exclusive game is finally hitting the arcades where it needs to be.
285111	295935	They're going to actually have all the same characters from the home version along with some redesigned versions of three bonus characters from that version.
296035	299277	Amy, Li-Long, and Wong-Syung-Kyung.
299297	301377	I believe that's how you pronounce that.
301858	302198	Anyways...
304230	305872	So, it should be pretty cool.
306452	309736	Will I be able to take my custom dancer character and use it in the arcades?
311978	312759	That I'm not sure.
312779	321527	It says when the player finishes the game of Soul Calibur 3 Arcade Edition, the screen will display a barcode symbol and password.
322148	328114	This will be used to join an online mobile phone-based Soul Calibur 3 game called Mobile Conquest Mode.
329376	344263	Basically, by taking a snapshot of the barcode symbol with the person's mobile phone and using the password, players can register their characters and challenge other players throughout the country via Soul Calibur 3's mobile phone website.
344903	346344	That's kind of unique.
346404	347104	That is unique.
347124	353407	I mean, I realize mobile phone is way bigger in other countries than it is here, but that's kind of neat.
353467	355648	I wish it would take off here, but whatever.
356721	363737	Game is slated for release in the fall in Japan and should be coming out here I'm sure at some point.
365349	367170	I would like to see Soul Calibur 3 in the arcades.
367210	369691	I know everybody said, oh, PlayStation 2 exclusive, but you know what?
370131	371092	Exclusive Windows up.
371132	371612	Let's get that.
371792	374173	Soul Calibur 2 is a great, great arcade game.
374213	378595	I'd love to see 3 hit the arcades, although I kind of think it should have been the arcades first.
378615	378975	But whatever.
379355	386439	If they can come up with these kind of cool features like it sounds like they're doing, if they can carry some of that coolness over to the US, I won't have such an issue with this.
386839	387119	I don't know.
388411	388831	All right.
389352	392814	Now, you know, we were talking also in the first half because we had an email about it.
392874	395836	You know, we started as a DDR-centric station.
395876	398478	So, of course, music and rhythm games, we love them.
398978	402160	And, Loki, you have an article to hit the Internet this week about rhythm games, right?
402280	402520	Yes.
402620	406303	GameSpot ran the 10 spot, the top 10 rhythm games.
407063	408064	Oh, another list.
408244	408484	Yes.
409164	410025	Everybody loves lists.
410305	413908	Lists are what they do when news gets slow.
414608	414988	Anyways.
415048	415869	It's human interest.
416669	416929	Yes.
417470	417710	First,
418430	418771	Samba de Amigo
427011	427711	Which is pretty good.
427731	428412	Number 9, right?
428592	428852	Yes.
428932	430132	Is this in order or is this just 10?
430352	433154	I think this is just 10 in no particular order.
433654	435875	This one actually was on the DS.
436375	436735	Osu!
437135	444178	Tatake Uiden, which was for Nintendo DS, was kind of a game we never saw.
444198	445959	I heard of this game, though.
446019	447159	A lot of people are importing it.
447540	448520	It's different.
448660	449320	Yeah.
449340	450041	Guitar-O-Man.
450661	451461	Woohoo!
451501	452122	Guitar-O-Man!
452142	452302	Yeah.
452602	453102	Vib-Ribbon.
455012	461653	I love that they're not excluding import titles and things that weren't released here because there were a lot of good stuff that weren't released here.
461673	479617	Of course, the original guitar favorite, Guitar Freaks, Busta Groove, or Busta Move, however you want to call it, Frequency, then Guitar Hero, and you know, let's see here, of course, Dance Dance Revolution.
479877	481797	And they named third mix specifically, right?
482045	484066	I would say Third Mix was definitely a peak.
484086	485607	It had so many great licenses.
485967	489208	I remember way back in your old apartment of doom.
489788	490089	I know.
490189	491689	The first time I ever got a little bod thing.
491709	498432	Watching you play DDR, not DDR, playing the Jungle Book game on the Jungle Book pad.
498733	500253	Baby's first dancing game.
500293	501174	That was me.
501234	502774	I had my little mini for midgets.
502794	505135	It was a DDR pad for midgets for the Jungle Book dancing game.
505155	505636	That's okay.
505856	506576	Jamie Fix.
506916	507356	I know, I know.
507897	508597	So is that it?
508637	509177	Was that ten?
509497	510138	That was it.
510158	510818	Where's Beatmania?
511670	512851	Get Guitar Freaks off that list.
512891	513912	Put Beatmania in there instead.
514092	514752	No crap.
514932	519415	I think we can all say the Guitar Hero kind of improved on Guitar Freaks, so there's no need for both of them on the list there.
519716	521857	Let's get rid of Guitar Freaks and put Beatmania in there instead.
521897	522457	What's up with that?
522958	523278	I don't know.
524119	524959	Anything else missing?
525099	525420	I don't know.
525460	526961	I think otherwise it's a pretty solid list.
527441	528281	Space Channel 5?
528942	529863	Ooh, good call.
530143	531364	That should have been somewhere on there.
531404	531904	I don't know about that.
531984	532885	Ooh, good call.
533485	534526	Space Channel 5 is a great game.
536387	538749	I would have said Amplitude over Frequency.
539826	542051	I'm at least glad there's a little bit of Harmonix love in there.
542251	543734	Karaoke Revolution's not on the list.
544877	546380	In which two, it's Loki says, good!
546400	548043	I don't like their game.
548925	549226	Whatever.
550582	551764	comments from the chat room here.
551804	554487	Of course, we've got folks saying no Beatmania.
555227	558471	PKakira88 says no Pump It Up, no In The Groove.
559753	561575	Rini says, where's poppin' music?
562536	562936	Interesting.
563397	564318	Lots of interesting choices.
564978	570224	That's the thing about lists, you guys, is so that they can leave something off just to ruffle your feathers about it.
570725	571165	Did it work?
571385	571686	Did it work?
572714	578557	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
602103	603684	I love reading Kojima's blog.
604404	606465	I think that he's a pretty interesting person.
607786	609446	And kind of cute.
610627	613808	I just like the pictures up there with his little foxhound thing on the side.
614949	626474	Lots of interesting insight into what he's got going on, as well as opinions of certain other people, which I'll leave for somebody else to bring up.
626614	627675	But it's really cool.
628215	630716	And he also apparently just...
632068	636070	has all kinds of things sneaking out in his blog, along with changes.
636110	636971	Didn't you notice a couple?
638212	639272	I honestly haven't really read it.
640573	642374	But I will visit it now that it's hit your list.
645276	650399	Well, also, though, you can find the link to Kojima's podcast.
651379	653681	Oh, that's right, and I have a quick little follow-up on the podcast.
653721	657243	Now, I do know something about that because I saw something on another site about it.
657865	662767	And actually, that podcast is going to be delivered in English soon.
663227	666388	No, Hideo Kojima is not going to suddenly start speaking English for you guys.
666988	672290	Actually, what's going to happen is that it's going to be handled by the international manager, Ryan Payton.
672630	678392	Payton's going to summarize Kojima's podcast and bring on guests and give behind-the-scenes information on the latest happenings of the company.
678412	685855	So it's not really like a word-for-word blog, but it's, you know, it's like the English spinoff, I guess you could say.
685935	686555	So that's pretty cool.
687193	689915	So, you want to give the address there for folks who want to look up that blog?
690415	694237	Absolutely, and I'm going to give the link to the English blog.
695178	706484	It's www.blog.konami.jp slash gs slash hideoblog underscore e. All right.
707305	707685	Visit it.
708065	709566	Love it, because DarkSakura said so.
710066	710446	Exactly.
710567	714549	All right, one thing that will not come up on the Hideo Kojima blog ever again...
715461	716202	What's this, Loki?
716582	727893	It would be an Uwe Boll adaptation of Metal Gear Solid, and to which I will paraphrase, because he says, absolutely not, over my dead body, fuck you, Uwe Boll.
727953	730236	He did not say fuck you, Uwe Boll, you're not paraphrased.
731177	738324	Anyways, basically, there's no way, they didn't contact him on it, they would never let him touch that property, so...
739704	740725	Thanks for watching!
758357	764959	because Alone in the Dark sucked ass, as did other movies like Blood Rain, which only pulled in $2.4 million over 30 days.
764979	769600	If I made $2.4 million in 30 days, that would be a great thing, because then I could fund my evil empire.
769640	773281	But for a movie in Hollywood to make $2.4 million over 30 days and not be like an arthouse movie type thing...
786994	798004	That's not saying much considering that the production budget of the movie is $25 million and the marketing costs apparently reached about $22 million putting it a good They marketed that movie?
798044	799685	I think I maybe saw one billboard.
799726	800166	That was it.
800266	800746	Like ever.
801127	802688	That puts it in the hole quite a bit.
803783	813069	But hey, if you still want to see more Weevil wonderful movies and stuff, there's In the Name of the King, two-part Weevil.
814029	814750	Stop plugging that.
815010	815790	Nobody wants to see it.
815830	816491	Just don't plug it.
816771	817551	Epic movie.
817731	818952	Three hours of crap.
818992	819493	Don't plug it.
820393	821033	Coming out in November.
823140	823360	DarkSakura
859210	868377	My FU of the week goes toward my own body for betraying me in a most heinous fashion.
869057	878965	I went over to one of my co-workers house to help her and her son with their mp3 player and I forgot about her dogs.
879966	882788	Now normally if I'm around a dog I'll get sniffy.
883848	884889	I might itch a little bit.
885309	888512	Normally I take like a Benadryl before I go over there and I'm fine.
889575	890936	Oh my god.
891136	891396	Okay.
893017	896618	I'm there for all of ten minutes and I start to feel the sniffy.
897138	899099	And I start to feel my eyes itch a little bit.
899119	900380	And I was like, yeah, it's allergies.
900860	901940	I'm leaving in a few minutes.
902981	911144	Well, within not even five minutes of that, suddenly my eyes were swollen shut.
912144	913225	They were bloodshot.
913305	916026	I burst two blood vessels in my left eye.
917086	921849	and my eyes had swollen so much they were pulling the skin tight around my eyes.
922149	922329	Ew!
922670	926152	It was really disgusting and then they were all gumming up and it was all bloody.
927693	930274	And many podcast listeners just threw up in their mouths there with that.
930294	930695	Thank you.
930735	930995	Sorry.
931755	932776	It was very disgusting.
933216	938800	I'm going into detail so that people will understand my level of rather well-contained rage right now.
939540	944603	So, and you know, I wasn't really, you know, my friend kept apologizing.
944623	945404	It's not her fault.
945444	945924	You know, she...
946497	946777	and so on.
970285	973866	I had my glasses off at that point, and I turned and looked at her, and she was like, OH MY GOD!
973966	975267	And started to get out of the car.
975887	979368	I was like, Tia!
979428	980088	No!
980228	981989	I just have zombie eyes.
983469	986070	My eyes, I actually took a picture of it.
986810	988651	How it was after, get this.
988671	989551	Will you post it on the website?
989671	989971	I will.
990571	992292	Three doses of Benadryl.
994552	999214	And all kinds of eye drops, including, I got those neat Japanese minty eye drops, though, that make your eyes feel all cold.
1000100	1023136	and I slept with a cold compress on my face for two days I went to the doctor yesterday because it actually the bone around my left eye started to hurt and so he gave me some lovely drugs and now most of the swelling is down but it's still there I looked yesterday like I got punched in the eye Dan proceeded to say well that's what you get for not ducking my husband
1024190	1027131	So yeah, fuck you to my jeans.
1027791	1030992	I blame mommy and daddy and all the drugs they did in the 70s.
1031852	1033972	Okay, Loki, your turn.
1035473	1038854	My FU this week goes to the restaurant chain known as Hooters.
1039434	1043615	Fuck you for your really crappy service and your really crappy food.
1044595	1048176	I went there actually on Saturday to get some food and, you know, because...
1048607	1050787	People wanted to go to Hooters to check it out.
1051127	1051868	Nellie had never been.
1052468	1054588	So we got there, and I give them my name.
1054688	1056048	They write my name down as Ben.
1056328	1057529	I'm like, no, it's Matt.
1057629	1058709	They write down Max.
1059329	1060749	I'm like, that's close enough.
1061349	1063390	So we're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting.
1063590	1065550	Finally, we get seated and stuff.
1066370	1068090	It takes them a half an hour to take our order.
1068810	1071431	Then afterwards, we're waiting, waiting, waiting.
1071451	1073651	It takes an hour for us to get our food.
1073771	1077332	And they hadn't even delivered the wings we had ordered, which were going to be an appetizer.
1078660	1082503	On top of all that, just the people there were retarded.
1082764	1085986	I mean, just completely retarded.
1086106	1094773	You're trying to talk to these people, and their coke was really watered down, and their burgers weren't that great, and the wings, you know what, even if they are world famous, they sucked ass.
1094853	1097475	So, fuck Hooters, I will never be going back there.
1098796	1102038	Arsef in the chatroom says, who goes to Hooters for the food?
1103979	1105420	Well, it's definitely not for the intelligence.
1105741	1106061	All right.
1106380	1106780	Welcome to Hooters!
1106800	1108141	I just want to add on Loki's hatred for Hooters.
1108161	1109261	Because it's not that great.
1109281	1110242	Their food isn't that good.
1135353	1139274	and the girls are like, thank you for coming to here.
1139594	1142455	They're like, they have more brains in their boobs than they do in their head.
1144215	1147156	You can address those cards and letters to extifer at orangelaunchradio.com.
1147316	1147616	Yes.
1148156	1154078	Email me your amazing, you know, stories on how I meant something in your life.
1155258	1155618	All right.
1156139	1159139	In this debut here on Orange Launch Radio.
1160540	1161140	Moving on.
1163188	1173176	DarkSakura, speaking of something meaningful, Kingdom Hearts 2 is a very meaningful game to some of us, and we've been waiting to hear some news on the US version, but do you got something for us?
1173980	1181146	Well, yeah, actually I've got a confirmed list of some of the voice actors in the game.
1181226	1181667	Very cool.
1182187	1185810	So we have Haley Jo Osment, of course, as Sora.
1186771	1189674	For Aerith, it's Mena Suvari from American Beauty.
1191355	1194538	One I don't want to say because it's very, very spoilery.
1195979	1196560	Should I spoil?
1196580	1196620	No.
1198184	1199646	Okay, plug your ears real quick.
1199766	1202510	She's in it for like a very short time.
1202590	1202811	Okay.
1203131	1204112	So close your eyes.
1205254	1205755	Close your ears.
1206616	1207497	One, two, three.
1207737	1208138	Tifa.
1208979	1209119	Oh.
1209640	1211562	Rachel Lee Cook from Antitrust.
1212103	1213004	Okay, open your ears again.
1213585	1214146	Like they heard that.
1215033	1237238	Riku, David Gallagher, Kyrie, Hayden Panettiere, Ruxus, Jesse McCartney, Namin, Brittany Snow, Hades, James Woods, Chicken Little, Zach Boff, Cloud, Steve Burton,
1239285	1246548	and I do not see anything about bringing back my man as my man.
1246649	1247969	David Boreanaz as Squall?
1248489	1248729	Yes.
1248910	1249690	Leon, remember.
1249750	1250610	Oh, sorry, Leon.
1250790	1251151	Not bad.
1251331	1252911	On IMDB they had him listed.
1252931	1253692	Yeah, by IMDB.
1253772	1254572	IMDB lies.
1254772	1258934	IMDB, all they did was copy the same people who played whoever in whatever.
1259094	1259494	Oh, really?
1259795	1264977	So, yeah, IMDB is a... I will not say lying piece of crap.
1265017	1266398	I will just say inaccurate source.
1266818	1267138	They are.
1268344	1269085	I do agree.
1269225	1271006	But for the stuff that's already out, they're pretty reliable.
1271566	1278089	And no Pirates of the Caribbean voice actors, unfortunately.
1278249	1279750	Yeah, nothing listed there.
1279830	1280931	And no Lance Bass.
1281031	1285253	Well, no reason scheduling conflicts to their new movie.
1285753	1296939	Although, in an article that I read, they were taking great care to capture some very Keith Richards-like motion for how he would walk.
1299031	1312996	Alright, all this talk on Kingdom Hearts, I think we need to bring back a segment, because we've been doing this new format for a little while, and part of the reason we went to the new format is so we could bring segments from our live show we used to do, and one of those segments is...
1315291	1315951	List lists!
1316351	1317052	Woohoo!
1317552	1323374	Alright, now I know our podcast listeners are hearing list lists for the first time, so we're going to kind of set this up for you guys.
1323674	1327835	Those of you guys listening live tonight on Sunday night, you guys get to directly participate in this.
1328256	1330176	Your votes will come up with the lists.
1330796	1334078	As we've been talking about in the show, people love to make lists.
1334358	1335978	And we're no different here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1336078	1341180	Once in a while, we like to take a topic, and we like to come up with the definitive list.
1342506	1343067	Thanks for watching!
1371409	1374455	So I bet you're all dying to know tonight's topic and see how this works here.
1375617	1382869	The topic for tonight is World I Most Want to See in Kingdom Hearts 3.
1384278	1385119	Now here's the catch.
1385659	1388000	Doesn't have to be related to Disney or Square.
1388040	1389721	We're living in a fantasy world right now, okay?
1389761	1394563	We realize that it's got to be Disney or Square to realistically be in a Kingdom Hearts game, but that's okay.
1394824	1402828	We live in a fantasy world here at Orange Lounge Radio, so we're opening it up to any fandom, any cartoon, whatever you want, any type of Kingdom Hearts world you think ought to be in the game.
1403428	1404408	Here's your chance to name it.
1404468	1407029	And we're going to come up with the Orange Launch Radio definitive list.
1407550	1409690	One other small little teensy weensy change.
1409710	1411411	We're doing a list list from the way we used to do it.
1411951	1419093	When the chat room votes, you will be able to pick not just one, but now you can pick a number one and a number two.
1419454	1421534	So you can actually pick two things from the top list.
1421554	1424435	But you do have to tell me what's your number one and what's your number two.
1424455	1427316	And if you don't specify, I'll assume the first thing you listed was your number one.
1427516	1427816	All right.
1428557	1429277	Enough chatter.
1430396	1432277	Let's get to the list, shall we?
1432397	1433698	Let's start making our list here.
1434379	1436540	And DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
1436560	1442004	What's your number three pick for a world you would most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 3?
1442364	1442744	Doom.
1444105	1444565	Doom?
1445346	1447127	Now would this be with The Rock or not?
1447207	1448528	This would be hell.
1451930	1453071	Alright, we have Doom on the list.
1453091	1454392	Any other reasons why you want to see Doom?
1454412	1455813	Just to put the characters in hell?
1455833	1455873	No.
1456644	1458265	I just like to see really fucked up things.
1459526	1460187	No kidding, lady.
1460567	1462949	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
1462969	1463529	You're number three.
1463770	1469574	I was actually picking more Disney-themed stuff, so Darkwing Duck.
1469634	1470555	That would be cool.
1471075	1472637	The Darkwing Duck level.
1473117	1473797	Alright, I like that.
1473878	1475419	Are you the terror that flaps in the night?
1478246	1484130	My number three pick is, I didn't have a better name for this, so I'm calling it Secret of Mana World.
1484390	1487272	You know, it's another great square game that ought to be given some love.
1487292	1488253	So Secret of Mana World.
1489974	1492856	Dare I ask, Extrofer, what's your number three pick?
1493397	1494818	I'm going to be pretty predictable.
1494858	1496299	I'm going to choose Silent Hill World.
1498308	1498668	DarkSakura
1528854	1530616	My number two, Labyrinth.
1533178	1535100	With David Bowie.
1535341	1536302	And his member.
1537283	1538344	Oh yes, and his member.
1538364	1541107	Because there were two stars, there were three stars in that movie.
1541187	1544590	Jennifer Connelly, David Bowie, and David Bowie Schlong.
1545331	1549856	And each of the characters will be dressed up in tight pants with giant packages.
1550036	1550256	Yes.
1551141	1558144	And your special helper will be the little dog on the other dog.
1559284	1560105	Or Bluto.
1562105	1563766	So bad!
1564506	1565587	Alright, let's keep it moving.
1565947	1569088	Loki, your number two pick for worlds you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3.
1569328	1573250	Since all the answers have been quite ridiculous, how about we do Hello Kitty world.
1574290	1575531	Sanrio world, there we go.
1578706	1581308	Hello Kitty, Chrono Trigger World, and then traveling in time.
1581348	1581868	That would be complex.
1609135	1610756	Xtifer, your number two pick.
1612036	1615157	Well, I think that I'm going to go with Serenity World.
1616417	1621698	Because... And this is collective Joss Whedon fanboy coming out.
1621738	1625820	But you have Mal as your... Cat in tight pants as your partner.
1625960	1626220	Yes.
1628280	1632681	He's going to age you and maybe have a hot sex scene too.
1632801	1634282	Against the men with blue hands.
1634642	1634982	All right.
1636044	1637005	Time for the number ones.
1637165	1637746	You ready for it?
1637806	1639587	Number one worlds.
1639647	1640868	We're making the definitive list.
1641029	1642770	Once we've done this, this is done.
1643030	1644111	This is all sealed and done.
1644131	1646173	We're sending it to Square and saying this is what we want.
1647274	1648735	Don't listen to what anybody else says.
1648776	1650197	This is the top three right here.
1650537	1653460	DarkSakura, your number one fantasy world for Kingdom Hearts 3.
1653800	1656643	Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time world.
1657764	1661287	Not any of that crap water world crap from Dreamwaker.
1663516	1664577	So Legend of Zelda World.
1664837	1667479	Again, something that would never happen, the Nintendo thing on the Sony.
1667499	1672842	But if anyone looks at my DeviantArt profile, I have done fan art for this.
1673643	1674343	That's hardcore.
1674763	1675004	Yes.
1675124	1676084	Hardcore nerd.
1676525	1676805	Alright.
1679167	1680809	Loki, your number one pick.
1681189	1681729	This was tough.
1681789	1688415	I wanted to go more realistic and do like, you know, Treasure Planet or Rocketeer, speaking of fighting Nazis.
1688936	1692819	But since we're going ridiculous, DOA Beach Volleyball World.
1693279	1695822	I almost put that one on there.
1696542	1699085	DOA Beach Volleyball World.
1699225	1701346	So what exactly would you be fighting?
1702287	1704189	You would be fighting clothing.
1704769	1705190	All right.
1705737	1711046	I just see this doing nothing but playing volleyball there, because when you go to the undersea level in Kingdom Hearts 2, all you do is sing.
1711867	1712868	You sing under the sea.
1714050	1714371	Alright.
1714907	1718649	My number one pick is Microsoft World.
1718869	1722410	And in Microsoft World, things glitch out.
1722550	1726072	You have to fight the evil glitches and things that disappear.
1726452	1730234	And the world just disappears suddenly on you and things go blank.
1731575	1732695	It's a real crazy level.
1733155	1735756	What was that one game on GameCube that totally messed with you?
1735997	1737117	Eternal Darkness, was that it?
1737197	1738218	Was it Bitterness World?
1738758	1740579	No, Microsoft World actually is what this is.
1740639	1743540	Let's be glad the Tron world is not powered by Microsoft.
1744465	1745206	That's my number one pick.
1745626	1746987	Extifer, your number one pick.
1748088	1749209	I bet you I know what this is.
1750350	1751371	I just have a feeling.
1751831	1758376	I just need to go that one step further in my Joss Whedon fandom and create once more with Feeling World.
1761019	1762960	I thought you were just going to say Buffy World.
1763180	1765983	No, it was the musical episode of Buffy.
1766103	1771027	That was great, especially with the whole hot lesbian scene with Tara and Willow.
1771147	1773429	You can do so much with that world.
1774526	1780069	Alright, let's see, now here's the part where the chatroom yells at us for the things we didn't put on the list, and guess what guys, it's gone.
1780249	1781189	You can't have this anymore.
1781590	1788153	Let's see, we have Minimi283 says Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy World, Legend of Zaku, YTMND World.
1790384	1791886	Let's see.
1792646	1800052	Roz says, Beer Pong World, Nintendo Maniac 64, Hentai World, Sephiroth 1215, Oregon Trail World.
1800733	1803155	We all die of dysentery or a bear eats us.
1803195	1804976	That's a great one.
1805717	1815305	Fireboma, Pleasure Island, Monkey Island, coming from MiniMe283, PKAcura88, Dragon Ball Z. Lots and lots of great picks from you guys.
1815365	1816306	Rio World World.
1816886	1818007	Too bad, because here it is.
1818207	1823691	So now's the fun part, because this is where we get mad at each other, because we're going to take off some from the list.
1823711	1825352	Here it is as it stands right now, the top 12.
1826292	1844525	Doom World, Darkwing Duck, Secret of Mana World, Silent Hill World, Labyrinth World, Hello Kitty or Sanrio World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, Zelda Ocarina of Time, DOA Beach Volleyball, Microsoft World, and Buffy the Musical World.
1844685	1846686	Once more with Feeling World, if you so choose.
1847166	1850747	Alright, so DarkSakura, one of these has got to come off the list.
1850787	1851687	What's going off the list?
1853107	1854227	Move your hand out of my way.
1854327	1854607	Sorry.
1854627	1854987	Thank you.
1855828	1856708	Microsoft World, sorry.
1857188	1858288	You evil little bitchling.
1858328	1861488	Why did you take that one off?
1861789	1864809	Because I don't want to play a reality game.
1864929	1866809	I want to play something for fun.
1868550	1869650	I'm okay with that answer.
1869690	1871450	Alright, Loki, what's coming off this list?
1874011	1875891	You know, I'm just going to have to take off
1877725	1877985	D.O.A.
1878005	1879146	Beach Volleyball World
1899400	1900361	I like that one.
1901802	1905225	Sora was going to become a man.
1905645	1907487	You took that away from him.
1907627	1908087	I'm sorry.
1908307	1908728	It's done.
1908908	1909268	It's done.
1909308	1910029	What's done is done.
1910149	1912271	Now he'll never get any because he's never going to find Kairi.
1912491	1914472	Extra Pearl, what's the last one coming off this list?
1916414	1919116	I think I'm going to go with Hello Kitty World.
1919897	1921138	Oh, Hello Kitty World.
1921158	1921878	That was a good one.
1923880	1924340	All right.
1928312	1929875	It's your turn to vote.
1930035	1935063	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your top two.
1935344	1936846	Your number one and your number two.
1937968	1938309	Alright.
1939847	1950713	Doom, Darkwing Duck, Secret of Mana World, Silent Hill World, Labyrinth World, Chrono Trigger World, Serenity World, and Zelda Ocarina of Time World.
1950873	1957937	Tell us what worlds would you most want to see in Kingdom Hearts 3, assuming that, you know, Disney and Square only is out of the picture, your fantasy world.
1958358	1962600	Send those over private message and we'll reveal the answers a little later in the show, the definitive list.
1963120	1965362	In the meantime, more news.
1966202	1969104	And we're going to go on over to Loki, who's going to tell us what's going on
1969780	1970680	with the Sony PSP.
1970720	1974742	And we talked about some of this in the first half, but you had a little more like PSP also.
1974842	1975442	So what's going on?
1975582	1981183	Yeah, basically they're just boasting that their online service is going to be better than Microsoft.
1982584	1985705	So anyway, so they said that this time it's very real.
1987045	1996228	Sony is dead serious about their online service and it's being designed to match the service of Xbox Live and exceed it.
1997549	2003621	And they're going to be basically, as mentioned before, linking a lot of the PSP and PS3 stuff together.
2003701	2006647	So, yeah, promises, promises.
2007408	2008350	That's what I have to say about that.
2013365	2015087	Isn't that a little bit too much too late?
2015607	2020852	I mean, Xbox Live has already established themselves as the definitive... Well, but you know what?
2021072	2025816	If Sony puts out something better, there's no reason they can't take the crown.
2025896	2033542	That's not necessarily going to be their big thing, though, because you can have beta, which is better than VHS.
2034243	2040589	Basically, their plan of, you know, fuck it, we don't need a plan, didn't really work out too well with the PS2, so...
2042918	2046423	I'm going to have to try it again.
2046723	2049366	And, oddly enough, wasn't Beta by Sony?
2051489	2052470	Something to think about there.
2053430	2054270	Let's move on.
2054330	2064012	Let's go over to DarkSakura, who likes to keep tabs on what's going on overseas because we love our listeners throughout the world, not just those here in America.
2064032	2071793	I mean, we love the America ones, we love the Canada ones, and all the other countries, but the UK doesn't get enough love from a lot of gaming things out there because they get games late and stuff.
2071833	2072233	It sucks.
2072553	2074694	So, DarkSakura, what's going on in the UK?
2075294	2080775	Well, actually, the first thing we have up is that Daedalus is doing a new Xbox 360 hard drive.
2085612	2090914	It's supposed to be 2 inches square, weighing 4 ounces.
2091034	2094796	The drive will be able to store thousands of songs and over 5,000 images.
2095296	2103959	The idea is you can transfer MP3s from your PC to your Xbox 360 or whack all of your JPEGs and use your TV to watch them all.
2104480	2111783	It's basically a 4 gigabyte USB drive that's shaped like the power button on the 360.
2113806	2114186	and Close.
2115747	2120989	They're actually giving a speculated price of £99.
2123810	2127052	DarkPlanets is already taking pre-orders for £74.99.
2127212	2129753	That's in pounds.
2131314	2134915	Also, though, they still have not yet confirmed the price point.
2135275	2140778	They're still working with the distributors, but an official price will be out along with their release date next week.
2140978	2141418	So about $150 USD
2144108	2144848	About 150 US.
2147770	2155154	Also, there is a very interesting bit of news about Dead or Alive 4.
2156715	2163699	It has basically removed Need for Speed Most Wanted from the top position and has taken number one.
2166580	2172524	Basically, it's a pretty game, but I don't know how it got to be number one.
2173745	2174225	It's hard.
2174245	2176066	I mean.
2177546	2182627	From what I saw about it, because I saw very little of it, because, you know, Rob's Xbox broke.
2184087	2186328	Again, I say that Rob's Xbox broke.
2186348	2188088	Thank you.
2188108	2188328	No problem.
2188348	2189129	Thank you for the reminder.
2189169	2189689	Appreciate it.
2189849	2191569	Also, his Xbox broke.
2191589	2196790	And so, basically, when I saw it, though, it did look really pretty, but I don't think I would ever play it.
2197330	2198511	Because, you know, whatever.
2199211	2199711	But it was pretty.
2200091	2205415	Well, they're saying that all across the board, the top three titles in the charts are all on Xbox 360.
2206255	2213180	Also, four Xbox 360 exclusives have come into the top 20 for the first time since the December 2005 launch.
2213821	2219504	We've got Call of Duty 2, we have Project Gotham Racing 3 at number 7.
2220185	2224128	There's also Perfect Dark Zero that hopped up from 27 to be at number 14.
2227958	2232339	and Sega's Condemned is also back in the top 40.
2233520	2235800	So it's coming in actually at number 18, they said.
2238381	2240202	Actually, I thought Condemned was a really good game.
2240222	2241162	That should be higher up there.
2242462	2246624	But honestly, people are liking what they're playing for those with working systems.
2253326	2257467	One other bit of news, too, is that there are
2258619	2270967	I heard about there were doing some layoffs here in the US, so it probably has a lot of people over there on edge, but not going to happen, hmm?
2271912	2272793	That's what it's looking like.
2273193	2276336	Their UK studio is in Chertsey.
2277257	2282922	It looks like it's coming out without the job cuts that we're all seeing over here in the US.
2283803	2289429	The studio is supposed to be cutting off, I think, 5% of their global workforce.
2291610	2293632	There haven't really been any indications.
2294032	2299816	One of their spokespersons said that they cannot confirm that there's not any that might come up.
2300696	2303558	To go ahead and give the quote, every division is going through evaluation.
2304899	2314105	We're looking around the company to see how to best align teams everywhere against what needs to happen for future growth, which means we're giving you a noncommittal answer because we can.
2315547	2327017	So far, about 350 people were cut in the U.S., laid off from the Vancouver, Redwood Shores, and Tiburon jobs.
2329540	2331201	The joys of corporations.
2331922	2332302	It happens.
2332403	2332683	Too bad.
2332863	2335445	Well, I wish the U.K.
2335485	2336807	employees a good bit of luck.
2337948	2339910	And then, another bit, actually...
2341621	2346484	Looks like February 17th, Shadow of the Colossus will be out in the UK.
2348005	2350507	It's a pretty neat game from what I understand.
2350567	2351528	I haven't played it myself.
2351988	2357132	I didn't get too into it, but it's kind of one of those games, try it out, because it's kind of a polarizing game.
2357152	2358773	People either really like it or they don't get it.
2358833	2362976	So, you know, certainly for those of you guys who have been really wanting to check this game out, you're going to get a chance.
2363056	2364797	So good for opportunity.
2364877	2365657	I believe in choices.
2365858	2366498	So go for it.
2366977	2367778	Breath of Fire 3 for the PSP
2392034	2393155	I love Breath of Fire.
2394155	2397576	Command & Conquer, the first decade, also, that's on PC.
2398057	2399797	Dora the Explorer on GBA.
2400398	2403799	EA Sports Rugby 2006, full auto, Xbox 360.
2403899	2406260	Is Dora the Explorer popular over there, too?
2406280	2410301	It's an early childhood game.
2410582	2413303	I'm sorry if she's popular over there, although it's a great Halloween costume.
2413323	2414883	I saw some Dora Halloweens, funny.
2415083	2417424	Well, they would only get Nickelodeon by Sky Satellite.
2417484	2417964	Oh, well.
2420767	2433014	Mario and Luigi Partners in Time, Mario Party 7, Space Invaders Evolution on the PSP, Star Wars Empire at War on PC, Tales of Eternia on PSP, The Rub Rabbits on DS.
2433814	2434355	What's that?
2434595	2435095	I've never heard it.
2435115	2435875	It must be something over there.
2435895	2438297	Dear UK listeners, please tell me what The Rub Rabbits are.
2438557	2442539	The Rub Rabbits would be the sequel to Philly the Magic.
2443597	2445820	Oh, I thought that had... Change names.
2446400	2448963	Aw, I thought it was something really perverted.
2449063	2450064	Where do babies come from?
2450164	2450905	Yeah, where do babies come from?
2450925	2451526	You have bunnies!
2452346	2452467	Aw.
2452847	2456010	And last up, Totally Spies for the Game Boy Advance.
2456911	2462297	I, however, am feeling very happy for our friends over there because on the 17th they get Guilty Gear Yusuka.
2464013	2465294	That game is cool.
2465995	2466896	Very, very cool.
2467436	2470278	And Super Monkey Ball Touch and Go comes out on the 17th as well.
2471639	2474542	But I will be going more into detail when the time comes.
2476163	2478065	Loki, do you have some release dates for the U.S.?
2478165	2479045	Of course I do.
2479566	2483008	Coming this week, we'll be getting Arena Football in the...
2484011	2484732	Let's Ride Silver Buckle
2494136	2497398	Stables, crappy game for the Game Boy Advance.
2497718	2501400	Resident Evil Deadly Silence coming to the Nintendo DS, which should be good.
2501940	2504021	Rub Rabbits also coming to the Nintendo DS.
2504322	2507103	Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max coming to the PSP.
2508004	2509745	Gotta love those Street Fighter titles.
2509805	2516528	Tales of Legendia coming to the PS2, which kind of combines a fighting game and RPG in the one, which is really neat.
2517189	2521371	And, of course, our favorite company, Konami, World Soccer Winning 11.9 coming to PS2, Xbox, and
2523732	2524212	PSP.
2524913	2536037	Later on the month, of course, we've got Drakengard 2, Grandia 3, Mark Echo's Getting Up, State of Emergency 2, which will be fun, also dropped down to $29.99, which is pretty cool.
2536597	2538918	Fight Night Round 3, really big boxing game.
2539478	2543440	Touka Race Driver 3, which will be cool.
2543580	2548722	Exit, Sonic Riders coming to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube.
2549443	2552067	and then a bunch of other stuff as well.
2552327	2554651	Of course, we'll cover those once we get closer to it.
2556664	2557384	Lots and lots of stuff.
2557404	2558445	We're starting to get back into it.
2558465	2560366	Yes, summertime will be really big too.
2560406	2563247	March is going to be a big month as far as stuff coming out.
2563847	2564267	Stay tuned.
2564567	2567468	Now, you also have a little bit of a follow-up to something DarkSakura talked about.
2567788	2571810	She was talking about DOA4's success over in the UK.
2572230	2573851	What's going on with DOA4?
2574191	2574991	They're doing an update.
2575011	2578253	There's going to be a patch which is coming out in mid-February.
2579033	2584135	What's going to be happening is they're going to be balancing some of the characters as well as
2584695	2613418	fixing the bug with lots of save games and one of the rumors is going to be that they're changing the interface and adding a new character one of the new characters that they're talking about here well at least rumored is going to be a Taekwondo character basically one of the things that they found out between you know kind of browsing some of the data files on there seeing a big section of characters missing and just some other stuff so that would be something to look forward to
2614742	2617487	Coming mid-February.
2618589	2628526	Something else that's going to be coming out soon, and this is according to Pacific Business News, is that an online version of the classic puzzle game Tetris is going to be coming out soon.
2629048	2631509	Now I'm kind of thinking, wait, don't we already have Tetranet?
2631549	2632509	I mean, why would you want to pay?
2632589	2640312	But here's the thing is that Tetris Online is going to allow people to do this game and other casual games for just $3 a month.
2640372	2643534	So they're trying to put this at like a super low price point for folks to do this.
2643994	2646875	Still say, though, you got Tetranet for free that's still out there.
2646975	2650276	So it's going to have to have some features to make this worthwhile.
2650316	2655438	But I don't know if this is trying to ride on the coattails of projected success for Tetris DS or what.
2655498	2657439	But nevertheless, this is coming out soon.
2658540	2669587	Something that should be noted is that this is being funded by Hank Rogers, who sold his interest in the blue lava wireless mobile phone company Jamdat in 2005.
2670488	2676412	That stock sale will net him another $108 million via Jamdat's upcoming sale to Electronic Arts.
2677032	2683357	His partner for Tetris Online will be former Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa.
2685214	2685854	So we'll see.
2686655	2691117	Good minds coming together because the mobile phone Tetris is actually pretty good for a mobile phone game.
2691157	2693778	So promising things coming out of this.
2693818	2696459	This may not be just crappy Tetris knockoff.
2696499	2697360	This could be pretty good.
2697440	2698000	So we'll see.
2698620	2699061	We shall see.
2700021	2701922	Actually, I did need to make a statement on something.
2701962	2702202	Sure.
2703303	2705904	I did want to go and also correct myself.
2706204	2711206	I actually told you wrong regarding the subsistence.
2711367	2712127	Now I'm doing it.
2712147	2712847	Subsistence.
2714912	2718173	We'll just call it Metal Gear 3 S. Subsistence.
2719513	2720534	That's alright.
2720794	2721874	Mistakes happen.
2722494	2724135	Alright, moving on.
2725195	2729956	Loki, you sometimes look at what's going on in the hacking and cracking world.
2730056	2730916	What's been hacked now?
2731617	2735998	First thing is the original Xbox DVD firmware has been hacked.
2736918	2737978	Why is that important?
2738318	2739919	Well, with the hacked firmware...
2740259	2744240	The Xbox doesn't realize a game is burned or is an original copy.
2744600	2748422	So you can pop anything in there without a mod chip and it will run.
2749342	2750882	So that's something that's coming out.
2751142	2759225	And what's important about that also is the firmware on the original Xbox is very similar to the firmware that's in the new Xbox 360.
2760065	2762666	And they're thinking that maybe they can break it the same way.
2763695	2764075	Rise of the Triad
2783762	2787326	So if you want to check that out, PSP Updates has a download for you for that.
2788306	2794372	Also, for the Nintendo DS Linux, they actually have added Wi-Fi support, which is pretty cool there.
2794732	2798976	So if you've got a modded DS, definitely check that one out.
2800277	2803800	Also, the PSP has some more functionality added to it.
2804521	2808825	Now they have a homebrew program to use your PSP as a universal remote.
2809637	2811819	And finally, one last thing here, P6, the
2829329	2858284	Shell coming to the PlayStation firmware 1.5 has been released and that's actually kind of a new GUI that they've added and a lot more functionality is going to be going into that as well so look for more updates from us and also you'll probably hear some more things on PSP updates as well and let's see finally they've had some rumors about new firmware updates coming which are going to allow email and GPS to be added to
2858965	2862586	The PSP's list of enhancements.
2862726	2865527	So email and GPS possibly coming later on.
2883353	2883393	916-226-9067
2902151	2904612	So please ask Mommy and Daddy if you don't own the phone line.
2904672	2906532	If you own the phone line, hey, do what you want.
2906932	2909793	All right, but we're going to be taking Skype line calls very soon.
2909853	2915994	But since there's a bit of a delay, before we go to that, we want to go ahead and announce tonight's listless winners.
2916835	2917575	Votes are in.
2919355	2922736	Remember, this is the Kingdom Hearts 3 world we would most like to see.
2922756	2924356	And, of course, we're living in a fantasy world.
2924856	2926917	It doesn't have to be square or square.
2927839	2928540	Disney-related.
2928580	2929280	It could be anything.
2929600	2930080	So here it is.
2930120	2934522	The votes are tallied, and this is the definitive list through this highly scientific process.
2935003	2943406	Number three world we most want to see, the Zelda Ocarina of Time world is the number three world they most want to see.
2944687	2949689	The number two world the kids most want to see is the Doom world.
2949729	2950770	They want to see them go to hell.
2952304	2957888	Alright, and the number one world, as voted by our chatroom, this is something that could actually happen, too.
2958509	2962752	Chrono Trigger World is the number one voted answer there.
2962992	2963893	Very cool, very cool.
2964493	2966635	No love for Serenity, extrovert, sorry.
2966755	2968336	Well, it got some pity votes.
2969016	2971198	What did you say, the Silent Hill World?
2972099	2976362	Silent Hill World, I think, was a close fourth, I think.
2977344	2979567	No, actually Silent Hill World was kind of trailing.
2979587	2980949	Darkwing Duck almost made it though.
2980970	2981991	That was number four.
2982552	2983854	Jesus Christ.
2984475	2984675	Sorry.
2984715	2985156	All right.
2988103	2989324	Maybe we'll do a list list again soon.
2989344	2990644	You know we have to do match games sometime too.
2990664	2991525	We haven't done that in forever.
2991625	2992265	So maybe next week.
2992305	2992625	We'll see.
2993125	2995026	We'll see if we have interviews or not next week.
2995346	2997147	It's all time pending stuff.
2997287	3000389	Alright, let's go to the Skype line and hear from you guys.
3000489	3004350	So again, it's 916-226-9067 or you can call us on Skype.
3004370	3006731	It's username OrangeLoungeRadio is who you want to call.
3006771	3007712	Let's go to the Skype line.
3007752	3009072	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3009813	3010113	Hello.
3010513	3011273	Hi, who's this?
3012134	3013074	This is Xander from Florida.
3013154	3014495	Xander, you call us too damn much.
3015313	3015553	I know.
3015713	3016774	Alright, what's on your mind this week?
3016794	3017874	Nothing better to do on Sunday night.
3018014	3018454	That's alright.
3018494	3018855	What's up?
3020435	3025957	I'd like to point out real quick, you're saying that Chrono Trigger could actually appear on Kingdom Hearts 3.
3027098	3027458	It can't.
3028278	3029059	I know.
3029899	3035141	Hypothetically, they could do one of those loophole things, or are you talking about it's a rights issue?
3035161	3038543	No, the characters... They could, but Nomura won't.
3039243	3042584	Final Fantasy is strictly background cameo stuff in Kingdom Hearts.
3042624	3043985	It will never be a world in Kingdom Hearts.
3044429	3046030	Do you have any idea where I could get Vibra Bun?
3046651	3046911	Any idea?
3070632	3074697	Do they still push new copies of that around on some of the import sites?
3074737	3075017	I don't know.
3075057	3080323	I ordered one so, so long ago that I don't know if they still sell this anymore because it's a PS1 title.
3080823	3084167	So I would say probably your best bet is going to be something like eBay.
3084468	3086630	Don't be afraid to try Yahoo Auctions, but the Japanese one.
3091761	3092961	might be a good place to try.
3093882	3099163	And yeah, you're going to pay more money to get shipped over here, but if you really want the game bad enough... I didn't expect that.
3100224	3101284	Any other suggestions you guys have?
3101304	3101704	Liksang?
3102144	3103044	Liksang, maybe.
3103185	3103465	I don't know.
3103725	3109086	I think it's going to be hard to find because it's PS1, but if you want a PS2 title that's similar, you can always try Mojib Ribbon.
3109526	3109947	But I don't know.
3110307	3113908	I heard it's very language intensive.
3114088	3114808	Yeah, it is.
3114948	3117749	It's just a different game as well, so I don't know.
3117829	3119249	But it's close.
3119310	3120410	It's the closest thing you're going to get.
3124393	3125834	Well, good luck to you, Xander, finding that.
3125874	3128755	If you find a copy, let us know so we can tell our listeners where you found it.
3129175	3130296	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3132077	3132237	No.
3132597	3132857	All right.
3134218	3134878	All right, Xander.
3134918	3135618	Thanks for calling in.
3135658	3135998	Take care.
3136779	3137079	You too.
3137219	3137459	Bye.
3138239	3139260	Let's go to another call here.
3139820	3141081	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3142301	3142701	Hello.
3142982	3143662	Hi, who's this?
3146584	3147104	Hello!
3148265	3153869	It's General Psy, I got the name there, but you're breaking up just a little bit, but go ahead and get your questions out.
3153929	3154949	What's on your mind?
3157311	3161574	First and foremost, I'm kind of angry at my computer.
3162634	3169079	Let me get... Yeah, we're kind of angry at your computer right now, too, because it keeps cutting you out.
3169119	3169979	We can't hear you, buddy.
3170920	3171180	Okay.
3171950	3172391	I'm sorry, buddy.
3172411	3173271	I'm going to have to let you go.
3173331	3175172	You're just kind of not there.
3175252	3175652	Sorry.
3176433	3182736	I think somebody should call in and do the... Have you checked the children?
3182756	3183817	We're going to do one more call here.
3184477	3184778	I don't know.
3185598	3187979	It's all the net traffic's tied up because of the stupid bull.
3189140	3190161	Let's try going to another call.
3190201	3191181	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3191842	3193463	Obviously, you already know who this is.
3194183	3195644	Could this be the legend of Zaku?
3196384	3197345	Well, you're on the mark.
3197625	3198946	Let's set aside ten minutes.
3199026	3200707	What's on your mind, Zaku?
3201750	3213433	Um, since I started that, you know, since I started a, you know, a weekend habit of just playing 2DX really drunk, I kind of need, I kind of need suggestions of, of liquors that would go great with that sort of activity.
3213493	3214694	How old are you, young man?
3215214	3215334	I'm 21.
3215474	3218174	I've been 21 for about, for over a month.
3218375	3222016	Alright, just wanted to make sure you're of age, because we can't encourage this if you're under 21.
3222516	3225176	Uh, liquors that go good with playing 2DX.
3225616	3225757	Um.
3225917	3226217	Yes.
3226837	3227137	Guinness.
3228187	3229108	I do enjoy Guinness.
3229248	3229748	Vodka?
3229969	3231450	Hard liquors.
3231470	3233711	Anything 40% alcohol.
3234151	3236933	Take a shot of 151 and drop it in a glass of Guinness.
3236953	3237974	It's called an Irish Car Bomb.
3238014	3241076	It's great.
3242237	3249082	But anyways, besides that, I'm surprised that they charge money for cell phone games.
3250123	3256427	Even though as a person who happens to make them for a senior project in order to get it out of college, I find it appalling.
3257082	3277362	And people charge, you know, that company's charged monthly for a damn game Yeah, the monthly fees is a little bit, now I'm like, okay, well obviously you can charge money for a game Because, you know, that's how, that's what funds these people's paychecks Yeah, but I mean, I thought most games were just like, you know, two, three dollars and that was it But then they have the gall to charge you monthly
3277702	3281805	Yeah, the repeat thing's a little lame for the cell phones, especially when they're bad games.
3283166	3290432	I know companies like Sprint that they charge a certain amount of money for a certain amount of time, and then you have to keep paying it again.
3290872	3292954	Don't buy them.
3293134	3294215	Don't support that crap.
3294295	3294615	I don't.
3294755	3297477	If I see a game that they want to charge a monthly fee, I say, screw it.
3297497	3298138	I'm not going to buy it.
3298258	3300960	Yeah, as I said, certain phone providers and game contractors
3306383	3306763	All right.
3306783	3306903	See...
3330307	3332108	Well, that's up to the programmer.
3332148	3333469	Alright, anything else on your mind, Zaku?
3334689	3339092	Hopefully, a lot hasn't been touched up on Supernova yet.
3340472	3343654	Since location testing already happened and the next one is going to be
3345049	3346670	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3362139	3363400	Okay, good, good.
3363660	3364380	Sure, fixed bugs.
3364920	3365440	Fine by me.
3365600	3366981	I mean, that's the idea of dual locations.
3367021	3369102	That's only what I've been hearing from other places.
3369622	3373063	It's, you know, it's a little bit of rumor at this point.
3373103	3373484	We'll see.
3373544	3375724	I'm sure the game will be fine when it comes out.
3375864	3376245	We'll see.
3376505	3377925	Yeah, hopefully, hopefully.
3378045	3379166	All right, Zaku, time's up.
3379206	3379726	I'm letting you go.
3379786	3380266	Have a good one.
3380486	3381167	All right, bye.
3382167	3384468	All right, that was the Skype line, boys and girls.
3384848	3385948	That's all for you.
3385988	3387449	That's how you do the Skype line.
3387469	3389430	That's how we do it here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3391122	3396172	Alright, we're getting towards the end of the program here, but not until we bring you one last story.
3396753	3397454	Couple more stories.
3398296	3402163	Oh yes, Loki, why don't you start us off then, since you must have found some late additions here.
3402704	3402965	I did.
3404266	3406608	Everybody loves making fun of Jack Thompson.
3406888	3408930	But remember his Modest Game Proposal?
3408950	3411031	Justin, I thought we could go one week without that name.
3411111	3412612	Hey, I'm not talking about Jack Thompson.
3412632	3414994	I'm talking about his Modest Game Proposal.
3415214	3419398	And someone else finished one of their games for the Modest Game Proposal.
3419798	3422260	It's called I'm Okay, a Murder Simulator.
3422820	3430866	And you can check it out, actually, at... Unfortunately, the website that was hosting it went down, so they have it mirrored here.
3431027	3431147	It's...
3434288	3453105	67.15.42.30 slash I'm okay and you can check it out there it's a 12 meg download has nice Super Nintendo looking graphics and you basically murder and murder and murder and murder and lots of murdering and it's great so definitely check that out
3454235	3477668	And finally, for those people who are fans of Burnout, they're doing a promo now with the retail kiosk that you can find out there for the Xbox 360, where you can bring your memory card to the location and download an exclusive Burnout Revenge card that's actually going to be Xbox 360 themed, as well as a dashboard theme and gamer pick.
3478068	3479069	So check that out.
3480834	3483754	Just wanted to say, I got a quick tip here from a chatter.
3483795	3484315	Thank you, Mike.
3484655	3487715	He says that JapanVideoGames.com has VibRibbon.
3488075	3491096	So Xander, go take a look there, and hopefully you can get it.
3491556	3493436	And just to say, I've ordered through them.
3494016	3494376	Yeah, they're good.
3494416	3496217	I bought Beatmania through them.
3496237	3497657	I bought my Drummania through them.
3497877	3499537	Their prices usually tend to be very comparable.
3499677	3500457	Oh, no free advertising.
3501297	3510619	I'm just saying, as I don't want to misguide any of our listeners, and we have gone through a number of importers among us, avoid buy-write at all costs.
3513514	3514295	They suck!
3514755	3515095	I know.
3515595	3516135	They owe me $70.
3516615	3520336	And you can take me with you.
3522076	3524417	Or you could fly to the country and buy it there.
3524817	3525437	And take me with you.
3525457	3526297	I don't know if that's an option.
3526417	3529478	All right, let's get on to our last story tonight.
3529518	3529998	Right, Loki?
3530038	3530638	Last story.
3530938	3531938	Loki, no more stories, Loki.
3531978	3532438	I have no more.
3532558	3532938	All right, good.
3533579	3536859	So DarkSakura, this is a good note to finish up on tonight.
3538280	3540200	What's coming our way pretty soon?
3541074	3545287	Well, this has to do with our good friend Itadaki of Team Ninja, who...
3548142	3559607	Basically, there was an interview with Famitsu Xbox 360 regarding the Dead or Alive franchise where they spoke with Itagaki about the delays.
3561328	3567531	He did actually make an apology for the last minute postponements that were going on over it.
3568251	3570792	Also, there was a mention about...
3573410	3575491	DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2.
3582854	3591197	Before I get into that, I am going to make a mention that there were plans to release new outfits for the DOA 4 characters via the Xbox Live Marketplace.
3591866	3598690	However, due to budget and staff issues, they had to put that on hold.
3598971	3600111	That's where the bikinis went.
3600452	3604574	But there is still interest in doing it, but they may have to do that for a charge.
3605155	3605615	Interesting.
3606896	3621225	Now, as I was bringing up DOA Extreme Beach Volleyball 2, Team Ninja is working on the opening and ending scenes for the game, currently implementing some changes to the original design
3622686	3627453	and there is not a release date being mentioned.
3627853	3639929	He said it will be an action game but that it won't necessarily they're also working on an action game that's not really going to be in the Ninja Gaiden franchise but
3643961	3646684	Project Progressive, Dead or Alive, Code, Cronus, or another title.
3646704	3648365	He said the key word is interactivity.
3648385	3652469	Anything that Team Ninja does, Team Ninja, in my esteem, is up there with treasure.
3670575	3671896	Some pretty, pretty games.
3671976	3675818	Especially that DOA 4 on my Xbox 360, you know, when it worked.
3676739	3677179	When it worked.
3677659	3680781	And on that note, I think it's time to wrap up tonight's program.
3681442	3683343	But we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
3683423	3689246	Extifer, thank you so much for being on the show tonight and giving us your 50 cents or so.
3689567	3690447	Thank you for having me.
3690547	3691107	Final thought.
3693229	3693789	Wow.
3695690	3696851	Loki, your final thought.
3697912	3698192	Yay.
3699192	3699473	I don't know.
3699513	3700033	I don't have anything.
3700495	3704137	My final thought is that stupid shipping box is going to get here tomorrow when I'm out of town.
3704918	3706318	And I'll be here to collect.
3707979	3709080	DarkSakura, your final thought?
3709400	3710261	Reject false icons.
3710681	3711621	Think for yourself!
3713022	3714143	Like Britney Spears does.
3715904	3723168	From us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys, have a great week and we'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
