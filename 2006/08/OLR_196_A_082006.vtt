00:00.000 --> 00:19.360
Today, August 20th, 2006, is 1080p really the future?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.240
Microsoft begs to differ.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.520
What do Wii preview parties have in common with raves?

00:24.520 --> 00:31.520
What ever happened to the Phantom anyway?

00:54.520 --> 00:58.040
caused quite a bit of stir, but it was a good time. We had a good time on last week's show.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.320
We're going to have a good time on this week's show, and to help us through that, as always,

01:01.320 --> 01:04.520
say hello to Loki! Yes, I'm here.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.840
That's right. How you doing, Loki? I'm doing good.

01:06.840 --> 01:12.360
Good. Anything exciting going on in your week? Uh, yeah. I destroyed the arcade cabinet.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.960
Really? Oh, that's right, you built... Now, long time listeners of Orange on

01:15.960 --> 01:19.880
Australia, remember back in the day, you built your own cabinet to play it,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.120
like, what, a main cabinet, basically, right? Basically, yeah.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.200
and why did you destroy it? It's too big. Too big?

01:25.200 --> 01:28.680
Need the room for the 37-inch LCD TV.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.960
So about how much money would you say ended up getting burned? Only a couple

01:32.960 --> 01:34.960
hundred. Most of it was in the buttons.

01:34.960 --> 01:39.360
I see. Alright well also joining us tonight say hello to an old friend of

01:39.360 --> 01:41.680
our show. Say hello to Miklotov.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.040
Hi. How you doing Miklotov? Oh I'm good.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.400
Good. Miklotov happens to work for Konami but he's not here as an employee

01:50.400 --> 01:51.800
of Konami, he's here as a gamer.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.800
I don't play video games.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.800
Which is kind of an issue. I just saw you playing one like two minutes ago.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
But that doesn't count.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.800
I see. I have to say that because we actually have Konami-related news tonight that's pretty big.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.800
So, I have to remember to distinguish that.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.800
I know. But I know everything about Konami, so...

02:05.800 --> 02:06.800
Oh, really?

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
Yes.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.800
You can't share any of it on here?

02:08.800 --> 02:10.800
No.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.800
I'm teasing. I know.

02:11.800 --> 02:15.800
Alright, also say hello to an old favorite of our program.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.800
Say hello to Drewnami.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.800
Hey, what's up?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.800
Not a whole lot. How are you doing?

02:22.800 --> 02:26.800
Uh, fair good. Hey. Give me a mic, dammit.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.800
Give me that mic. Sheesh.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Alright.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.800
A little mic confusion. There we go.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.800
Alright. How are you doing?

02:33.800 --> 02:39.800
Uh, fair. A little bit of gaming to speak of, but I think we'll say that to gaming weeks.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.800
Alright. Well, let's get to it. Let's start with Loki. How was your gaming week?

02:43.800 --> 02:49.220
My week was good. I played Dead Rising which is still fun, but

02:50.160 --> 02:52.560
It gets progressively harder later in the game

02:54.720 --> 03:01.440
Then what else they play I played I just got done playing the bad day la demo on PC

03:01.800 --> 03:06.000
That's really cool-looking except. I don't like the fact that to save a lot of people

03:06.000 --> 03:10.720
I'm not a fan of saving people more a fan of beating them to death in the game. So

03:10.720 --> 03:14.960
So that's gonna take a little bit of getting used to, but I am looking forward to the game.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.620
It's supposed to be coming I guess later this week or next week or something, I don't know.

03:18.620 --> 03:19.620
So should be cool.

03:19.620 --> 03:23.860
That's also part of my problem with Dead Rising, really, is that I don't like saving people.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.460
I like to kill them in games.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.140
Well they're fucking stupid, okay?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.860
They are fucking stupid in Dead Rising.

03:28.860 --> 03:33.380
I tried saving these people, they were trapped in a store, and they wanted to get the safety,

03:33.380 --> 03:37.300
so I'm like, you know, follow me, and they're sitting there beating up a zombie, and then

03:37.300 --> 03:39.740
all of a sudden like five zombies jump on them and eat them.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.060
like you're a dumb idiot well fucking listen to me or die apparently you chose

03:45.060 --> 03:50.780
death so fuck you so the next time I you know I ran past that section when I

03:50.780 --> 03:55.660
reloaded the game again I said fuck them they can die and that's what they did so

03:55.660 --> 03:59.820
of course I'll come by and break down the door so the zombies have an easier

03:59.820 --> 04:06.220
chance you know getting them all right anything else that you played I want to

04:06.220 --> 04:09.220
I was going to say I played ChromeHounds, but I don't think I did.

04:09.220 --> 04:10.220
Okay.

04:10.220 --> 04:12.220
I'll talk about my gaming week.

04:12.220 --> 04:17.220
I played Dead Rising a little more because killing zombies is a lot of fun.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.220
I got a little bit further.

04:18.220 --> 04:22.220
I finally figured out the secret to kill that very first boss that kept slicing me.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.220
Or actually I should say shooting me because he has a gun.

04:24.220 --> 04:27.220
And I sliced him because Loki showed me where to find a katana.

04:27.220 --> 04:30.220
So that made me very happy because it made fighting that first boss a hell of a lot easier.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.220
So now I'm having more fun just running around doing random things.

04:33.220 --> 04:39.220
The other game I've been playing a lot of this week is 99 Nights. I decided to go out and buy it because I actually like the demo, and you know what?

04:39.220 --> 04:44.220
I don't understand why all the reviews on the internet are so freaking negative of this game.

04:44.220 --> 04:50.220
It's not that bad. It's not perfect, but it's not like the worst game on Xbox 360 right now, by far.

04:50.220 --> 04:59.220
I think this game just isn't for everybody. The game is a bit of a button masher, yes, but so were a lot of old arcade games, like in the early 90s and late 80s.

04:59.220 --> 05:05.540
The game really reminds me in a sense of golden axe you run around you swing your sword around you hit the button to hit

05:05.540 --> 05:10.860
Your sword a lot you kill things except you're killing hundreds and hundreds of monsters at a time

05:10.860 --> 05:15.700
I actually find the game to be a lot of fun, and it looks gorgeous the music is awesome

05:16.260 --> 05:19.500
Now there are some problems with the game as I said it's not perfect

05:19.500 --> 05:24.740
Um some of the interface just kind of sucks like the menus and things and I I just didn't dig it I

05:24.740 --> 05:32.460
The save menus are a little weird and those things and the voice overs are awful, awful.

05:32.460 --> 05:39.700
I mean whoever did the voices did horrible, whoever did the lip syncing did horrible.

05:39.700 --> 05:43.900
They should have just had an option to retain the original Japanese language track because

05:43.900 --> 05:48.060
I'll tell you the voice overs are awful but the game itself is quite a bit of fun.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.300
They have that option with Enchanted Arms which is coming out and you can do the Japanese

05:51.300 --> 05:53.740
voice track or the English voice track.

05:53.740 --> 05:57.260
Good because if they butcher the English there, then that's you know gonna be what we do here

05:57.260 --> 06:01.960
I'm going over to orange lounge radio.com clicking on chat and reading what our chat room has to say

06:02.620 --> 06:08.180
We have fire bomb. It says sky Kingdom Hearts 2 is a button masher too, but it had a story

06:09.740 --> 06:12.480
Yeah, 99 nights has a story too though

06:12.480 --> 06:17.300
I mean granted Kingdom Hearts 2 has a really great in-depth story and 99 nights is a little bit

06:17.300 --> 06:21.260
You know kind of generic, but it looks really pretty and if the story is not bad

06:21.260 --> 06:27.300
I can think of games that had worse stories. So I I mean I would call 99 nights a

06:28.620 --> 06:33.820
Slightly above average game and the only kind of its John well, I guess there's dynasty warriors

06:33.820 --> 06:39.700
But considering that's just like a straight-up port. I'd say it's really the only kind of game of its genre

06:40.220 --> 06:44.300
Really truly available for next-gen right now, and I think it's worth a lawyer

06:44.300 --> 06:51.220
I yeah, I think there's a audience of people that this game is really for you know an audience of people what an

06:52.020 --> 06:57.980
Audience of people not a audience whatever. Thank you grammar bigletov professor guy. You're welcome

06:58.020 --> 07:02.140
Well, then how is your gaming week so I can criticize the way you talk about it. Oh, well

07:02.140 --> 07:03.860
I've been playing a couple things

07:03.860 --> 07:07.180
I'm not allowed to talk about and one's really frustrating and I hate it

07:07.180 --> 07:11.460
But other than that the only game I really play at all anymore is

07:11.460 --> 07:14.580
is Suikoden 2 and I play it at work on my breaks

07:14.580 --> 07:19.020
and I leave it on so I've amassed about 700 hours on the game now

07:19.020 --> 07:22.400
so and I just really like that game a lot

07:22.400 --> 07:25.020
Are you trying to see if maybe it rolls over once you hit 999?

07:25.020 --> 07:29.160
Actually yeah, we're hoping that it would happen this week because we don't know how to

07:29.160 --> 07:33.560
you know, count, so we didn't realize it wasn't going to hit 999 this week

07:33.560 --> 07:39.440
but I'm really enjoying it and I always enjoy it, I've played through that game a million times

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
And that's all I play.

07:40.440 --> 07:44.080
Now, did you watch me play some of those games on 360, like Prey and Dead Rising?

07:44.080 --> 07:45.520
What do you think of some of those ones you've been watching?

07:45.520 --> 07:47.840
Prey is pretty cool.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.440
It's kind of creepy.

07:49.440 --> 07:56.240
I think I could enjoy it on a computer because I don't like using console controllers for

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
FPSs.

07:57.240 --> 08:03.480
99 Nights I was really excited about and then I saw it and I was really disappointed because

08:03.480 --> 08:08.200
it looks like a really bland Samurai Warriors or Dynasty Warriors.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.760
That's pretty bad seen as dynasty warriors is pretty bland as I like dynasty warriors

08:12.760 --> 08:16.360
I think and I like 99 nights and then I look at dynasty warriors and I go

08:17.720 --> 08:24.600
Environments and 99 nights just are so bland and you're always fighting the same enemy and you can't even tell half the time if

08:25.480 --> 08:27.880
There's still an enemy on screen because your stupid

08:29.120 --> 08:33.900
Comrades are all like grouped around it. It's like a hundred of your friends around one enemy

08:33.900 --> 08:35.900
So you have to wade your way through them

08:35.900 --> 08:39.940
You know swing your sword it only hits the bad. Yeah, I

08:40.500 --> 08:45.700
I'll forgive that though because the same thing again look at games like golden axe Ninja Turtles

08:45.700 --> 08:49.740
You never hit your friends magically. That's that's what this game is to me

08:49.740 --> 08:56.260
It's a souped-up old-school beat-em-up don't like that so you could hit your friends there were like double dragon, right?

08:56.440 --> 09:00.500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can one of the double dragon. Double dragon is fun to throw people in the pits

09:00.500 --> 09:05.520
That's what we need. We need a Simpsons next-gen arcade game that looks like 99 nights, but it's the Simpsons

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
Okay, awesome. That would be

09:08.700 --> 09:11.200
Score maybe that'll be on Wii's virtual console

09:12.140 --> 09:14.140
cardboard tube samurai

09:15.500 --> 09:17.500
That would be fucking sweet

09:18.180 --> 09:23.140
And I guess the other game you had was dead rising and the zombie games actually frightened me

09:23.140 --> 09:24.980
But it looks it was funny at times

09:24.980 --> 09:27.340
But I still I don't think I could bring myself to play it

09:27.340 --> 09:32.340
Did you like the part where I wore the little kid's outfit and the big teddy bear mask?

09:32.340 --> 09:36.780
If you mean creeped out by it, then yes, I liked it a whole lot.

09:36.780 --> 09:40.340
My favorite was going to the women's store and getting the dress with the big bright

09:40.340 --> 09:42.740
pink flowers on it and then putting on sunglasses.

09:42.740 --> 09:43.740
That was awesome.

09:43.740 --> 09:44.740
That was pretty funny.

09:44.740 --> 09:47.540
Or when you changed your hair gray in the cosmetic store.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.460
But the greatest is that whatever costume you're wearing carries on into the cut scenes.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.860
So it's really funny to be wearing the flowery dress in the cut scenes where he's trying

09:54.860 --> 09:55.860
to act all badass.

09:55.860 --> 10:00.860
Yeah, when he was leaning up against the wall, he was some sort of prostitute. That was pretty awesome.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.860
And that part had no zombies, so I was okay with it.

10:03.860 --> 10:05.860
Alright. Are you afraid of zombies?

10:05.860 --> 10:06.860
Yes, I am.

10:06.860 --> 10:08.860
You need someone to hold your hand when you play zombie games?

10:08.860 --> 10:10.860
I can't think of someone who works at Taco Bell.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.860
Alright, anyway, moving on.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.860
Going over to DrewNami.

10:15.860 --> 10:17.860
Drew, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

10:17.860 --> 10:19.860
Well, I haven't exactly been on the cutting edge lately.

10:19.860 --> 10:32.860
I've been playing... I finished Fable as a little goody-two-shoes, now I'm replaying it as some big, badass, evil, bisexual screwing around, bucking around, whatever.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.860
Which was the best part of Fable, really. Otherwise it was just pretty much your standard, you know.

10:36.860 --> 10:41.080
uh... i'd have to say the different kind of weapons that you can use

10:41.080 --> 10:44.500
uh... and different kind of uh...

10:44.500 --> 10:47.860
relationship you can have with uh... the townsfolk

10:47.860 --> 10:50.880
which admittedly is not much but uh...

10:50.880 --> 10:52.600
it's still kinda cool

10:52.600 --> 10:53.780
uh...

10:53.780 --> 10:57.580
i've been brushing up on my beatmania lately uh...

10:57.580 --> 10:59.580
haven't been doing too much of that actually

10:59.580 --> 11:02.780
took the time to put my scores in on rankings

11:02.780 --> 11:04.660
again not very impressive

11:04.660 --> 11:09.040
uh... playing a little bit more tell your iris almost beat it

11:09.040 --> 11:11.360
been going back to pray finally beat it

11:11.360 --> 11:14.780
ending was very cool you know what all things considered a prey doesn't take

11:14.780 --> 11:18.240
that long to be it's a pretty short game i mean if i was a little more hardcore

11:18.240 --> 11:21.540
about it and can play games like for a long time in one setting i could have

11:21.540 --> 11:22.980
been in a day

11:22.980 --> 11:27.520
yes but it's pretty easy to even can die don't you know you don't ever really die

11:27.520 --> 11:32.000
uh... and for some reason i picked up a man x command mission after like two

11:32.000 --> 11:33.760
months of not playing it

11:33.760 --> 11:36.880
and i've just been blowing through it

11:36.880 --> 11:38.680
like five hours straight

11:38.680 --> 11:40.100
no reason at all

11:40.100 --> 11:41.640
nine but uh...

11:41.640 --> 11:45.400
it's it's fairly good rpg

11:45.400 --> 11:48.400
all right well that that's it for everybody's gaming week and i know to

11:48.400 --> 11:51.100
some folks in chatter uh... kind of talking a little bit about their a

11:51.100 --> 11:55.160
gaming weeks there and we don't care about them no i i'm curious what folks

11:55.160 --> 11:59.820
uh... their plan uh... d j dark night is playing so com three i think c don't

11:59.820 --> 12:01.480
care uh...

12:01.480 --> 12:05.240
Well, we don't have time to play everything. We're just, what, four people?

12:05.240 --> 12:08.200
There's too many games. How many new games do they release every week?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.040
But how many of them are worth playing?

12:10.040 --> 12:12.040
That's true. I'm not going to deny that.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.040
There's like maybe one a month.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.400
But everybody's into something different, right?

12:15.400 --> 12:18.040
You know, if I didn't have a job, I'd be playing tons of games.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.480
I wouldn't. I hate video games.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.680
Isn't that what you do all day now?

12:25.240 --> 12:25.720
For now.

12:25.720 --> 12:31.720
All right, anyway, let's go to some housekeeping stuff really quick.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.080
We wanted to mention the ChromeHounds tourney.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.200
Remember how we were going back and forth with Bobby Black Wolf about, we're gonna kick

12:38.200 --> 12:40.780
your ass, you're gonna kick our ass, or whatever?

12:40.780 --> 12:43.280
We couldn't get enough people to participate in the ChromeHounds thing.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.140
I don't know if folks just, like, our listener base isn't really into this game or what,

12:47.140 --> 12:48.480
but we couldn't get enough people.

12:48.480 --> 12:52.500
And I guess, I don't know, I wasn't really following, but I guess maybe there was shenanigans

12:52.500 --> 12:54.320
going on somewhere else in the tournament.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.320
So it got cancelled.

12:56.320 --> 12:57.320
So it never really happened.

12:57.320 --> 13:01.000
So we never got to put O.L. Army vs. Bobby did the test.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.980
So maybe another time, I think what we'll do right now, focus on building up the presence

13:05.980 --> 13:10.160
of Orange Lounge Radio listeners in different games on the O.L. Army, and then we'll take

13:10.160 --> 13:11.160
people on in tournaments.

13:11.160 --> 13:15.180
Personally, I would like to see something more along the lines of, like, Saints Row

13:15.180 --> 13:16.520
when that comes out.

13:16.520 --> 13:20.980
Not necessarily a team deathmatch type of thing, but just last man standing, just get

13:20.980 --> 13:25.840
bunch of people from you know you know all games get you know some of us get

13:25.840 --> 13:29.620
some other people and just have everyone kill each other and you know I like that

13:29.620 --> 13:33.800
kind so it would answer answer the age-old classic all our question of if

13:33.800 --> 13:37.720
all the members of Orange Lawns Radio got into a battle royale who would

13:37.720 --> 13:40.800
survive you guys are just fucking lucky that they haven't put out a Grand Theft

13:40.800 --> 13:44.500
Auto yet that's online because I would fucking kill everybody that sounds like

13:44.500 --> 13:48.520
the throwdown that is the throwdown I know that because I've been owning my

13:48.520 --> 13:54.880
peep my peeps at work for what you know almost a year now yeah I think I think

13:54.880 --> 13:59.000
we could do that bring it I've I've got a year on it can't you do that it

13:59.000 --> 14:02.800
doesn't have rumble lows rumble roses double X have a mode like that the four

14:02.800 --> 14:08.760
four chicks beating each other up yeah it says that we should all get rumble

14:08.760 --> 14:13.060
rumble roses double X will be 20 bucks any day now come on how many people

14:13.060 --> 14:18.220
actually want to waste $20 though I I bought oh no way I didn't buy the game I

14:18.220 --> 14:19.660
I got it for free. Thank you, Konami.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.460
That's not worth it, either.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.700
I want to borrow that if you never play it.

14:25.700 --> 14:26.380
I don't play it.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.340
I want to spend some time with chick wrestlers.

14:28.340 --> 14:29.340
Come on, it's fun.

14:29.340 --> 14:33.020
I basically popped it in, played with the boob adjustment

14:33.020 --> 14:34.740
little dial on there, and got bored of it.

14:34.740 --> 14:35.940
That's about it.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.100
BlackWolf's in chat right now, our old buddy,

14:38.100 --> 14:40.100
Bobby BlackWolf, who also does a show Sunday nights

14:40.100 --> 14:41.900
over allgames.com.

14:41.900 --> 14:43.660
Loki does not play well with others.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.660
He can't handle a team game.

14:45.660 --> 14:48.020
That's probably about right.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.420
yeah at least okay at least he admits it

14:50.420 --> 14:54.420
I'm like Zim from Invader Zim

14:54.420 --> 14:57.500
we need to do like a destroying when we're on our own planet

14:57.500 --> 15:01.580
so I wish we could do like a World of Warcraft like I wish you could have like a private

15:01.580 --> 15:03.260
Battlegrounds wouldn't that be fun

15:03.260 --> 15:06.980
actually they're gonna have they had a little neat

15:06.980 --> 15:10.540
World of Warcraft insider that they posted up saying

15:10.540 --> 15:14.900
in the expansion they're going to have an arena and you can field your own

15:14.900 --> 15:15.660
teams

15:15.660 --> 15:21.000
Hmm, but does anybody on all games interactive play World of Warcraft? I don't know. Well, I somehow I don't see Scott

15:21.000 --> 15:25.120
Ruben wasting his days away leveling out World of Warcraft. Hey, I resemble that remark

15:26.120 --> 15:28.640
All right. Well, we'll see maybe someday. All right

15:28.640 --> 15:35.340
Anyway, we're gonna get into tonight's news and we want to start it off with a piece of news that we are actually putting out

15:35.340 --> 15:36.580
there

15:36.580 --> 15:39.860
It has to do with an upcoming promotion coming to orange lounge radio

15:39.860 --> 15:41.060
We're really excited about it

15:41.060 --> 15:44.640
And this has just been posted on our website over orange lounge radio comm

15:44.640 --> 15:51.640
Orange Lounge Radio is going to be bringing you a fall of DDR Power Previews.

15:51.640 --> 15:55.640
This has to do with the upcoming Xbox DDR games.

15:55.640 --> 16:00.640
We're going to announce a partnership with Konami to promote upcoming Dance Dance Revolution titles

16:00.640 --> 16:05.640
on the Xbox and Xbox 360 platforms with exclusive song premieres.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.640
Debuting in the fourth quarter of 2006 on the Xbox,

16:07.640 --> 16:11.640
Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix 4 will contain a new Power Mode

16:11.640 --> 16:15.640
accessible via a returning feature known as Party Mode.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.640
Power Mode will allow the user to play a non-stop music course,

16:19.640 --> 16:23.640
four of which are initially available, approximately five minutes in length.

16:23.640 --> 16:28.640
These new Power Courses not only feature a stream of non-stop dancing arrows,

16:28.640 --> 16:31.640
but seamlessly mixed non-stop music.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.640
Longtime fans of the DDR series will recognize this feature

16:34.640 --> 16:39.640
as something similar to a non-stop mode featured in the Japanese-only arcade release,

16:39.640 --> 16:44.640
Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000. Dance Dance Revolution Universe, the first game

16:44.640 --> 16:46.960
in the DDR series for the Xbox 360,

16:46.960 --> 16:51.640
also scheduled for the fourth quarter of 06, will also contain this new power mode

16:51.640 --> 16:55.800
with a completely different lineup of courses, four initially available.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.880
Speed, Sync, and Quad modes are some of the other additional features

16:59.880 --> 17:04.400
both games will contain in the party mode. Beginning Sunday, September 3rd,

17:04.400 --> 17:08.800
Orange Lounge Radio, hey that's us, will be offering exclusive first listens of

17:08.800 --> 17:14.300
the new power courses each week on Sunday nights along with bonus v-rare

17:14.300 --> 17:19.060
track previews from the Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 v-rare and the

17:19.060 --> 17:23.380
Dance Dance Revolution Universe v-rare. The music will be debuted during our

17:23.380 --> 17:26.980
live broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio Live right here six o'clock Pacific time.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.380
These preview listens will be rebroadcast on the syndicated run of

17:31.380 --> 17:35.380
Orange Lounge Radio Live airing on all games radio the following Monday at 5

17:35.380 --> 17:39.780
p.m. Pacific time and Tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific time now these preview listens

17:39.780 --> 17:44.100
are exclusive to the live broadcast as you can imagine due to copyright reasons

17:44.100 --> 17:48.500
they will not be available as the podcast or on the podcast so you have to

17:48.500 --> 17:51.900
listen live to hear it we're really excited about this I mean we've been

17:51.900 --> 17:57.740
covering DDR news for a long long time so you know being able to kind of play

17:57.740 --> 18:01.780
a part in rolling out new songs for all you guys to hear is really exciting so

18:01.780 --> 18:04.300
So we're going to be starting that in two weeks.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.380
I've already heard them all hahaha.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.780
Well you're special, that's why.

18:08.780 --> 18:13.040
So if I hahaha, we'll be playing them for you guys pretty soon.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.040
Very excited about it.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.180
You guys can almost be as cool as us, that means.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.460
I'll be blasting them in my car hahaha.

18:19.460 --> 18:22.340
He says I already don't if I had a car.

18:22.340 --> 18:23.340
Does that matter?

18:23.340 --> 18:24.340
No.

18:24.340 --> 18:29.600
Alright, anyway, before we do this thing here, are you guys anything we should warn the listeners

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
about or anything?

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
I don't know.

18:31.600 --> 18:37.600
I think it's cool. I love the idea of non-stops from Solo 2000-ish thing coming back, that whole idea.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.600
Personally, I don't like one of them.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.600
But there's like, you know, there's four in each game, at least.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.600
You don't think I know that?

18:46.600 --> 18:51.600
But I'm saying, you know, so is there ever a song in DDR you don't like?

18:51.600 --> 18:55.600
No! That's a lie.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.600
Because I'm like, okay, usually in a 75 song list there's got to be at least, you know,

19:00.600 --> 19:05.880
you know a few that you don't like but there's a few that you love so

19:05.880 --> 19:09.760
somebody's muting me I don't even understand that I forget it yeah I know

19:09.760 --> 19:15.200
all right so anyway you go DM in all right well I will be starting that on

19:15.200 --> 19:19.080
Sunday September 3rd right here live on orange lounge radio we're excited about

19:19.080 --> 19:23.440
that yeah cutress points out they were also in solo bass mix oh that's right

19:23.440 --> 19:29.080
so it's had like half as many as solo 2002 doesn't add like four more I keep

19:29.080 --> 19:33.640
forgetting about solo bass I was I had only ever played solo 2000. I think they still have a solo

19:33.640 --> 19:38.200
bass machine down at the Folsom bowling alley over here. Really? That's pretty cool. It was awful.

19:39.480 --> 19:43.880
Yeah I think they had one that uh at what the local Walmart for a little while uh that got

19:43.880 --> 19:50.840
that got taken out. I think it moved to the Folsom bowling alley that's where they got theirs from.

19:51.480 --> 19:57.400
Anyways um so yeah I think we'll start off the show with some wonderful exclusive stuff that

19:57.400 --> 20:00.960
that you're not gonna hear anywhere else, at least not yet.

20:02.360 --> 20:05.240
Starting off with some price drops.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.440
Far Cry and Six Predator, yet another game on the 360s,

20:08.440 --> 20:11.560
dropped down to $39.99, so that's always good.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.680
And also now we have a date for Dead or Alive Extreme 2,

20:15.680 --> 20:18.720
which is gonna be hitting this holiday season

20:18.720 --> 20:23.720
right before Black Friday on November 22nd,

20:24.040 --> 20:26.160
so look forward to that.

20:26.160 --> 20:33.160
One bad thing though, Oblivion on the PSP has been delayed to April, so, you know, got to wait a little bit longer.

20:35.160 --> 20:47.160
Now, for you hockey fans, NHL 07 has been confirmed by the folks at EA to be having a demo coming out soon, so you can check that out on Xbox Live's Marketplace, probably in a couple weeks.

20:47.160 --> 20:57.160
Now, one thing that was mentioned on GameStop this week, they pointed out a Devil May Cry 5th Anniversary Collection coming out on the Playstation 2.

20:57.160 --> 21:06.160
That is going to be coming out for $39.99 retail on October 25th, and it features Devil May Cry 1 through 3.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.160
However, they missed a little bit of information on that.

21:09.160 --> 21:14.360
that, that there's also a Resident Evil 10th anniversary collection coming out on the GameCube,

21:14.360 --> 21:20.240
which will be featuring Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 4, also for $39.99,

21:20.240 --> 21:27.240
also coming out on the 25th of October. And now for you, you know, fans of, you know,

21:27.400 --> 21:33.800
new colors for systems, you'll be happy to know that the PlayStation 2 Slim is getting

21:33.800 --> 21:40.800
a new color. It's going to be coming out in silver now. I guess that way you can coordinate

21:40.800 --> 21:46.440
your Playstation 2 slim with your upcoming Playstation 3 and that will also be hitting

21:46.440 --> 21:55.440
stores October 25th. Also coming out on the 31st, Xbox 360 is going to be getting a peripheral

21:55.640 --> 22:02.640
bundle. No news yet on what exactly is in that. Speaking of bundles, PSP is also getting

22:02.640 --> 22:05.480
getting a new bundle called the Digital Entertainment Pack.

22:05.480 --> 22:10.480
It's coming out September 20th for $249.99.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.880
It'll include the core system, a one gigabyte memory stick,

22:14.880 --> 22:17.480
the Lords of Dogtown UMD movie,

22:17.480 --> 22:19.280
and ATV Off-Road Fury Road.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.880
Well they're gonna have to unload those somewhere.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.040
Please and trails.

22:22.040 --> 22:26.020
So apparently this is a great deal or something,

22:26.020 --> 22:29.040
but that's gonna be coming out September 20th.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.560
And then finally, I've got some news

22:31.560 --> 22:36.480
that'll make any DDR fan a little bit sad and that is information about the

22:36.480 --> 22:41.360
brand new Saturday morning series called dance revolution and it will feature

22:41.360 --> 22:47.040
this group called the slumber party girls anyways this is actually coming

22:47.040 --> 22:52.680
from a industry a magazine called home media retailing it says dick

22:52.680 --> 22:56.360
entertainment and geffen records have partnered to create slumber party girls

22:56.360 --> 23:01.120
a five members is it is it just wrong to me that dick entertainment is producing

23:01.120 --> 23:07.320
this I mean about slumber party girls yeah it's slightly wrong anyway from

23:07.320 --> 23:12.640
the geniuses you brought us captain in a five-member singing and dance act aimed

23:12.640 --> 23:18.880
at the tween demographic the group whose multi-ethnic members were chosen from

23:18.880 --> 23:24.960
more than 1,000 applicants will be the cornerstone to and this is apparently is

23:24.960 --> 23:30.160
brought to you by Kohl's Kohl's secret slumber party on CBS which premieres

23:30.160 --> 23:38.240
September 16th. The Slumber Party Girls will also appear on 26 half-hour episodes of Dance Revolution,

23:38.880 --> 23:46.320
and of course my notes on that will be the unholy love child of DDR and Saturday Morning TV. A live

23:46.320 --> 23:52.880
action TV series within the secret Slumber Party TV block inspired by Konami's video game franchise

23:52.880 --> 23:58.160
Dance Dance Revolution. A Slumber Party Girls original music signal is slated to debut on

23:58.160 --> 24:05.160
iTunes and AOL this month with a music DVD from Geffen, a division of Universal Music

24:05.280 --> 24:07.920
Thereafter.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.880
Is this the end of DDR? Has DDR jumped the shark?

24:10.880 --> 24:15.040
Now I wonder if we're going to see any of their music on one of the DDR games.

24:15.040 --> 24:15.840
Please, God.

24:15.840 --> 24:21.840
Oh God, this is not the American B for you, is it? Oh God. Oh God.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.400
Please, can I-

24:23.400 --> 24:27.400
It just struck me. This might be the American B for you. I'm going to have to pour acid

24:27.400 --> 24:31.240
in my eyes and I would have I would have loved to just walked into the boardroom

24:31.240 --> 24:35.480
that was planning this shit dogma style and stopped it from happening you know

24:35.480 --> 24:42.320
ease you know don't defile our DDR anymore now it is promotion now I'm of

24:42.320 --> 24:49.940
what type now in studio I have a picture of the slumber party girls which I will

24:49.940 --> 24:54.480
hope to get on the website at some point but now Rob and Shane you guys have seen

24:54.480 --> 25:01.800
the slumber party girls uh drew take a look you know what do you think it's the

25:01.800 --> 25:05.320
fucking Mickey Mouse Club yeah pretty much the Mickey Mouse Club of DDR I

25:05.320 --> 25:08.240
don't know what the fuck they're gonna do with this show but uh it's pretty

25:08.240 --> 25:12.400
scary so um cutters has a good point look at it this way last year it was go

25:12.400 --> 25:18.080
west and YMCA this year at slumber party girls I say to make the top earlier

25:18.080 --> 25:22.480
there's one song in DDR you always skip you know what though think about this

25:22.480 --> 25:30.120
What is the Mickey Mouse Club done for us giving us a bunch of horse? So, you know what more power to Britney Christina Justin Timberlake

25:31.120 --> 25:37.640
That one sexy back songs pretty hot. I know it was stuck in my head the other day. I was very sad. Oh anyway, yeah

25:37.640 --> 25:42.400
Sorry, uh, sorry. I think thinking about Justin Timberlake. We should get back to video games. However

25:46.280 --> 25:51.420
What do you think is this good promotion me go top I'm especially curious what you might think on this is this good promotion

25:51.420 --> 25:57.420
I can have a comment. I don't like it. I think it's really stupid

25:57.780 --> 26:04.040
All right, but that's me not speaking as a Konami employee. That's me speaking as you know a normal person that

26:04.620 --> 26:09.220
Can look at that article and be like hey Rob. That's the worst thing I've ever seen

26:09.220 --> 26:11.220
I wonder if we'll see more about this in a few days

26:12.540 --> 26:16.020
Maybe I don't know why oh, yeah, maybe maybe they'll do a performance

26:16.860 --> 26:20.020
We'll see. All right, let's move it. Let's move on to another story

26:20.020 --> 26:24.680
Now, maybe if you're into that thing, maybe you'll be lucky and they'll release a Slumber

26:24.680 --> 26:29.160
Party Girls HD DVD, so you can see them in all their full high-definition glory.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.880
With a free coupon for therapy.

26:30.880 --> 26:36.020
Which hopefully you'll be able to play on your Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

26:36.020 --> 26:42.080
There are rumors going around out there, according to DigiTimes, this HD DVD add-on will be retailing

26:42.080 --> 26:44.200
for $200 US.

26:44.200 --> 26:49.640
Now, originally I think the rumors were $100, but I think we all realized that seemed a

26:49.640 --> 26:54.200
a little low. So $200 is now the price of the add-on they're saying. This is only a

26:54.200 --> 26:59.580
rumor keep in mind, but sounds like it could be pretty legit. What do you think, Loki?

26:59.580 --> 27:04.780
Well we haven't heard the official price yet. I keep checking daily, twice daily. But I'm

27:04.780 --> 27:09.460
sure Microsoft I know is coming into our work in a few weeks, and I'm sure we'll get the

27:09.460 --> 27:13.360
information out of them then. But that sounds about right. I mean HD DVD players are pretty

27:13.360 --> 27:20.120
expensive, um, and it's not really something that you necessarily have to buy. So, yeah,

27:20.120 --> 27:24.680
$200 seems pretty reasonable for an HD DVD player. But, I mean, when you think about

27:24.680 --> 27:30.640
it, all it is, is really kind of just a drive anyways. But, um, you know, one thing, though,

27:30.640 --> 27:33.960
that what's kind of cool about it, though, is you are gonna be probably able to pump

27:33.960 --> 27:40.420
out, um, 1080p with it. Well, maybe. I don't know. But, um, it doesn't really matter anyways

27:40.420 --> 27:43.860
because 1080i and 1080p are pretty much the same damn thing.

27:43.860 --> 27:45.220
And according to one of the Microsoft employees...

27:45.220 --> 27:46.500
That's not what Sony says!

27:46.500 --> 27:52.100
Well, yeah, they're the ones selling those 1080p TVs.

27:52.100 --> 28:01.140
So pretty much, you know, we have one of the former Microsoft employees, I guess, Andre...

28:01.140 --> 28:02.900
I can't even pronounce his last name.

28:02.900 --> 28:09.340
Anyways, he had a blog entry entitled 1080p Meaningless This Generation, and he discussed

28:09.340 --> 28:13.580
That's why the PlayStation 3 can output 1080p for both games and movies, but apparently

28:13.580 --> 28:22.580
doesn't mean much, and you won't see any 1080p games for the PlayStation 3 this year.

28:22.580 --> 28:23.580
And that kind of makes sense.

28:23.580 --> 28:28.300
I mean, it can output that high, but a lot of the games are being co-developed for both

28:28.300 --> 28:33.900
the, you know, 360 and PlayStation 3 at the same time, so a lot of them just shoot for

28:33.900 --> 28:39.020
720 anyways, so, big deal.

28:39.020 --> 28:43.140
This is interesting what fireresurrected says in our chat room over at orangelaunchradio.com

28:43.140 --> 28:47.180
click on chat, 1080i and 1080p is not the same thing.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.380
And I don't think that's what they're saying in this article, I mean obviously they're

28:49.380 --> 28:53.940
not interlaced progressive, but I think what they're saying is, does it matter?

28:53.940 --> 28:57.160
Does the eye really distinguish the difference that much?

28:57.160 --> 29:00.740
They're just saying that there's not much of a difference between the interlaced and

29:00.740 --> 29:05.500
the progressive scan on it, I mean, okay, so granted, I think what you'll see-

29:05.500 --> 29:08.780
I sure noticed the difference between 480i and 480p.

29:08.780 --> 29:14.100
I would say what the main difference would probably be is it'd be sharper and less blurry

29:14.100 --> 29:16.760
especially with a lot of movement on screen and stuff like that because it's updating

29:16.760 --> 29:23.540
faster but I'm not going to go spend $3,000 on a fucking TV just to make sure that it's

29:23.540 --> 29:25.500
not quite as blurry as the other thing.

29:25.500 --> 29:26.500
I'm sorry.

29:26.500 --> 29:30.440
Granted, this will be something that will be available later on.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.360
Is it something that you need right now?

29:32.360 --> 29:33.360
Probably not.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.480
So who cares?

29:35.480 --> 29:36.480
Are you really going to notice?

29:36.480 --> 29:41.040
But if each console generation lasts about five years, then the question is, is this

29:41.040 --> 29:43.160
something you're going to have in five years?

29:43.160 --> 29:48.240
Possibly, but the thing is though, is it something really, I mean like for example, the difference

29:48.240 --> 29:54.180
between 720 and 1080i on your TV, do you really notice a huge difference?

29:54.180 --> 29:55.760
Not much, I really don't.

29:55.760 --> 30:01.380
So I mean, you're probably not going to really notice the difference on it, and anyways,

30:01.380 --> 30:07.860
He points out there's an analysis done by the video editor of Home Theater Magazine

30:07.860 --> 30:14.180
who basically said there's no noticeable difference between 1080i and 1080p.

30:14.180 --> 30:18.540
And so, I'll take it as you will, but remember Sony is the one.

30:18.540 --> 30:22.420
They are trying to sell those TVs, they are trying to sell Blu-ray, and making it a big

30:22.420 --> 30:26.300
selling point because, I don't know, the games aren't that great.

30:26.300 --> 30:30.980
Well, remember also that the next generation doesn't start until Sony says it does, remember?

30:30.980 --> 30:37.420
Yeah, somebody in chat reminded me of that a minute ago, so that's why somebody else was saying because I called

30:38.220 --> 30:43.960
99 nights a next-gen game and somebody said well now the 360 is out isn't it current gen and you know well

30:44.520 --> 30:50.020
Unfortunately Sony hasn't said yet that next-gen can start so you know 360 I guess I

30:50.900 --> 30:52.900
Don't know. It's a little silly

30:53.660 --> 30:58.500
I really want to see like Reggie and Peter Moore and

30:58.500 --> 31:01.780
and, um, what's the guy for Sony? Kaz?

31:01.780 --> 31:05.060
Kaz? Yeah, that guy. I want to see them all

31:05.060 --> 31:08.700
like in a Rumble Roses style mud wrestling match.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.700
With bikinis? No, without bikinis, please. Like in suits and ties.

31:12.700 --> 31:16.260
You know, just kicking the crap out of each other over the, uh, different system.

31:16.260 --> 31:19.900
You know Reggie would win, I'm sorry. I'm not just saying that as a Nintendo fanboy,

31:19.900 --> 31:20.700
but Reggie?

31:20.700 --> 31:26.180
You know he would throw down. He looks like he could

31:26.180 --> 31:29.180
kick some ass. We have some talk on Reggie, but we'll get to that a little later.

31:29.180 --> 31:32.180
Reggie? Oh god! You gotta love Reggie! Seriously!

31:32.180 --> 31:34.180
You know how bad I want him on this show?

31:35.180 --> 31:37.180
I would put out to get Reggie on this show. Alright, anyway.

31:38.180 --> 31:39.180
I'm sure you would.

31:39.180 --> 31:40.180
I know, I know.

31:40.180 --> 31:41.180
Uh, moving on.

31:41.180 --> 31:42.180
With Reggie, though?

31:42.180 --> 31:44.180
Uh...

31:45.180 --> 31:47.180
I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's happily married, isn't he?

31:47.180 --> 31:49.180
Well, then you're never gonna get him.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.180
Alright, anyway.

31:51.180 --> 31:52.180
Moving on.

31:52.180 --> 31:54.180
Wow, this show's hit a whole new low.

31:54.180 --> 31:59.220
And I thought last week was bad, God, I thought, you know, getting rid of the lesbians, we'd

31:59.220 --> 32:04.100
have ourselves a nice serious program tonight, but I had to go screw it up.

32:04.100 --> 32:09.140
Oh, this is something very serious, the ESRB, and of course the Entertainment Software Ratings

32:09.140 --> 32:14.660
Board is going to be launching a new public service announcement campaign.

32:14.660 --> 32:18.900
The PSAs will explain video game ratings to parents and encourage them to check the rating

32:18.900 --> 32:21.420
every time they purchase a video game for their kids.

32:21.420 --> 32:25.900
His campaign will be using TV, radio throughout the state of Georgia and itís going to be

32:25.900 --> 32:29.060
running in the coming weeks.

32:29.060 --> 32:34.300
Recent studies paid for by the ESRB show that 83% of parents with children who play video

32:34.300 --> 32:39.980
games are aware of the ESRB ratings and three-quarters reference them when buying games for their

32:39.980 --> 32:40.980
family.

32:40.980 --> 32:45.540
I couldnít help but think when I read this, havenít there already been many PSAs and

32:45.540 --> 32:47.540
campaigns for this?

32:47.540 --> 32:53.320
When I went into Target, there's this whole who wants to be a millionaire play, which

32:53.320 --> 32:56.500
I think is really funny because that whole thing is years old now.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.500
I think America is so over-millionaire.

32:58.500 --> 33:03.440
But they have this whole thing with Regis selling the ratings, basically.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.440
That's annoying sounding.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.700
But when I worked at EB... There's a baseball one, too.

33:07.700 --> 33:08.700
Yeah.

33:08.700 --> 33:15.820
On our EBTV we had every month, they had Tiger Woods promoting the ESRB ratings, and I think

33:15.820 --> 33:22.300
Derek Jeter was on one time too. It was, you know, I guess informative, but I think

33:22.300 --> 33:26.380
they don't give the parents enough credit because when I worked in EB, the

33:26.380 --> 33:30.000
parents would always check the ESRB ratings. It's like, oh, this game's T? They

33:30.000 --> 33:33.260
would ask my opinion and be like, yeah, if you're getting it for your four-year-old,

33:33.260 --> 33:37.380
that's probably not a good thing. There's always one retard that slips

33:37.380 --> 33:40.420
through the cracks though. And that's the one they pay attention to. And I mean that, I don't mean like

33:40.420 --> 33:43.620
literally, okay, I'm not totally insensitive, but I mean like, you know,

33:43.620 --> 33:50.340
Somebody who really just something is just you know wrong with the parents. There's just one. You know parent out there

33:50.340 --> 33:53.180
That's always you know their kids are screaming

33:57.780 --> 33:58.740
You know fine

33:58.740 --> 34:03.140
I got a bike around the thought of for them and then you know kids see something on there and

34:03.220 --> 34:08.160
Being a retard and his parents don't watch him he goes and punches his sister or something

34:08.160 --> 34:10.220
Oh my god. He learned it from the game

34:10.220 --> 34:15.760
He didn't want it because I'm not paying attention to him or anything. He's because of the game you bought him the damn game

34:15.760 --> 34:19.140
So then then she goes and sues, you know somebody

34:19.780 --> 34:23.540
Over the game and then you know, the whole thing comes down to you know

34:23.540 --> 34:27.720
Then Jack Jackie poop comes in goes see see it's what I'm talking about

34:27.720 --> 34:31.460
But the whole thing comes down to the parents, you know, you can put it out there

34:31.460 --> 34:32.400
You can put it in their face

34:32.400 --> 34:39.220
You can you know sell them the game and go this is rated team for this reason and you let them know or whatever

34:39.220 --> 34:43.900
oh as you're selling them the game and it won't matter it won't matter because

34:43.900 --> 34:49.780
they're stupid and they're just hell-bent on doing something stupid and

34:49.780 --> 34:52.340
killing themselves so lead a horse to water

34:52.340 --> 34:55.740
all right now black wolf since he lives in Georgia his show is based out of

34:55.740 --> 35:00.100
Atlanta area he says the difference here is that it is done with the assistance

35:00.100 --> 35:04.340
of the Georgia Attorney General instead of just the ESRB people listen to the

35:04.340 --> 35:09.180
Attorney General more I I actually doubt the truth behind that statement no if

35:09.180 --> 35:12.720
Bobby but I don't think the Attorney General having a hand in it's gonna

35:12.720 --> 35:17.360
change things that much but maybe it's just a California I don't know cuz you

35:17.360 --> 35:21.320
know whatever I don't know actually don't you remember years ago the

35:21.320 --> 35:24.940
California Attorney General was like really upset about Mortal Kombat and all

35:24.940 --> 35:27.980
that stuff and got involved with that stuff weren't the rating systems

35:27.980 --> 35:33.660
established in part because of him I want to say yeah huh no maybe I'm wrong

35:33.660 --> 35:37.880
then who knows anyways moving on here there's a

35:37.880 --> 35:43.660
a Spanish magazine, Nintendo Accion, that is reporting that the next issue will reveal

35:43.660 --> 35:48.600
the official price, the launch date, and the game lineup for the Wii. It says the issue

35:48.600 --> 35:54.100
is due to hit on September 15th. So people are saying, they're going to announce the

35:54.100 --> 35:59.740
official date on September 15th. Wow! Okay, I've read this on numerous sites...

35:59.740 --> 36:04.100
Hooray! Another Wii speculation story! Hold on, hold on. I've read this on numerous

36:04.100 --> 36:09.380
sites and there's a whole big hole in their logic here for example do you

36:09.380 --> 36:13.860
realize that I don't know they have to work on the magazine for a few months

36:13.860 --> 36:17.860
and you know go through all that editorial process and then print the

36:17.860 --> 36:21.260
magazine it doesn't just like magically poof right there so they're not gonna

36:21.260 --> 36:25.660
announce the date on to the 15th I bet you anything they're announcing it next

36:25.660 --> 36:30.980
Wednesday during let's big and that's where you're gonna find all your damn

36:30.980 --> 36:33.500
information that's where they're gonna get this information that's gonna be

36:33.500 --> 36:38.420
posted in the magazine so just wait a few more days and all the info will be

36:38.420 --> 36:42.580
there I don't understand okay all these gaming blogs are running this

36:42.580 --> 36:46.420
speculation thing you know like it's everywhere on the internet and I fucking

36:46.420 --> 36:50.940
told you guys last week exactly what day the Wii would be out and not a damn

36:50.940 --> 36:54.700
person picked up the story and said orange launch radio knows that the Wii

36:54.700 --> 37:02.300
will be out soon I'm very upset with the gaming community right now I'm still got

37:02.300 --> 37:08.080
my all my chips on the 18th of October really well that's that's I think it's a

37:08.080 --> 37:10.960
risky bet at this point I bet on soon I think I think he's in the right

37:10.960 --> 37:15.360
vicinity but what the hell am I doing I'm done with speculating we'll know

37:15.360 --> 37:20.680
what we know we will know when Reggie comes out and says BAM here is is he

37:20.680 --> 37:25.160
just go wow there's my junk this is the date

37:25.160 --> 37:30.600
real credit by the way earlier when we were talking about the mud wrestling

37:30.600 --> 37:33.600
Our chat room did seem to agree with us here.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.600
Ari Masan said, Reggie is cool.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.600
Zero Cool says, yeah, Reggie would kick ass and take names.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.600
DMN says, he's a big guy.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.600
Rama says, Reggie is half black.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.600
He will fuck everyone up.

37:43.600 --> 37:46.600
He will get ghetto in a heartbeat.

37:46.600 --> 37:51.600
FireResurrected says, I love how Sky calls himself a Sony fanboy and Nintendo fanboy.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.600
I'm just a games fanboy.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.600
I'm also a Microsoft fanboy.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
I didn't used to be.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.600
A long time ago, I used to hate Microsoft's game thing.

37:58.600 --> 38:05.060
But you know things change people change opinions change the Xbox was like my green kryptonite, you know

38:05.060 --> 38:10.320
I just couldn't touch it. That's the way a lot of us values to buy an Xbox, but you know what?

38:10.320 --> 38:12.320
I got tired of waiting and

38:12.440 --> 38:17.120
It was a good purchase. They finally started coming out with really really good games towards the season 3

38:17.120 --> 38:20.840
It might be a good purchase later on. I'm not gonna buy I think that's it, too

38:20.840 --> 38:23.120
I think I you know what you have a very good point

38:23.120 --> 38:26.040
I think the ps3 is gonna suffer the same fate of the Xbox in my mind

38:26.040 --> 38:29.700
I think later on the ps3 is going to be like a must-have system, but to start

38:29.700 --> 38:36.560
I'm just waiting for I'm waiting for some of their great first-party titles. I mean, I want a new Twisted Metal god damn it

38:36.560 --> 38:41.520
It's gonna look fucking amazing on the PlayStation 3 that'll probably sell the system for me right there

38:41.560 --> 38:46.180
But you know, there is no Twisted Metal at lunch. Yeah, people said the virtual

38:46.180 --> 38:49.380
There's no we off to a slow start. Look what happened it granted

38:49.380 --> 38:53.600
I didn't really buy any of the ratchet and clank games nor do I like the ratchet and clank games

38:53.600 --> 38:58.480
but, you know, that would be a cool game to have on there. Maybe, um, I don't know.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.720
I want Jumping Flash. Screw everything else if I could get a Jumping Flash game.

39:02.720 --> 39:07.000
An actual, you know, an actual Gran Turismo sequel.

39:07.000 --> 39:12.080
You would be fucking happy with a Fantavision sequel because your taste in games is fucked

39:12.080 --> 39:16.040
and I think anyone that's listened to this show long enough knows that by now. Your taste

39:16.040 --> 39:19.120
in games is absolutely fucked. Whatever, Fantavision was really fun. And

39:19.120 --> 39:23.640
Jumping flash. Yeah best. That's the reason that in Megaman 8 were the reasons

39:23.640 --> 39:29.480
I got a ps1 because jumping flash never mind Symphony of the Night Final Fantasy 7 slide

39:30.440 --> 39:37.260
Never mind, you know any of that stuff. It was all about fucking jumping jumping fly little robot bunny guy was so cool

39:40.500 --> 39:43.820
Well and somebody in the chat room said uh

39:43.820 --> 39:52.820
that they want an online jumping flash, GS68 or whatever, I would play it with you because that's a great sounding game.

39:52.820 --> 39:53.820
Can we get to the next story please?

39:53.820 --> 39:54.820
No.

39:54.820 --> 40:01.820
Alright, now one place that you might be able to get your hands on the Wii are these secret parties that are supposedly starting in September.

40:01.820 --> 40:05.820
Now this is kind of interesting because Nintendo is going to be having these private parties.

40:05.820 --> 40:11.820
What they're going to do is they're going to seek out people, I don't know, like on the internet, MySpace, or what they're doing.

40:11.820 --> 40:16.620
And they're going to invite 30 friends to this private party, so it's like an underground campaign.

40:16.620 --> 40:19.120
It's a random selection of Nintendo Ambassadors.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.620
You basically sign in, there's like some websites...

40:21.620 --> 40:25.220
Sign me up! Shit, I want to have an Orange Lounge Radio Wii party, wouldn't that be fun?

40:25.220 --> 40:26.520
Well technically since we're...

40:26.520 --> 40:29.220
I've said such nice things about Reggie on this program.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.920
I think that entitles us to a Wii party.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.720
You said you wouldn't have sex with him though, that's not very nice.

40:33.720 --> 40:37.520
That's respectful, that's not being rude, that's being respectful.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.520
I know.

40:38.520 --> 40:44.520
Well, you know what, we played it at E3, we'll get to play it soon enough.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.520
Hopefully.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.520
I mean, it's just the whole thing is buzzed.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.520
They really need to start some really serious advertising.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.520
I gotta tell you this though, this is how underground it is.

40:52.520 --> 40:56.520
They know that Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver are all going to have these parties.

40:56.520 --> 41:02.520
Supposedly some of the news is leaking through and a Chicago person actually emailed Kotaku

41:02.520 --> 41:07.520
and said that his friends are going to be bust rave style to a secret location to play games and have fun.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.440
games and have fun so like they're gonna have to go to this you know random

41:10.440 --> 41:14.360
parking lot in the ghetto side of town and get in the bus and then be shipped

41:14.360 --> 41:20.280
to the Wii and it's like you know hey man want some X want a hit how about

41:20.280 --> 41:25.560
that sleeping battle royale that's how the Wii's graphics are gonna be 3d drug

41:25.560 --> 41:31.240
influenced oh I figured it out yes yes indeed exactly that's awesome I'm a

41:31.240 --> 41:38.760
a genius. Well, speaking of L.A., American McGee, who has a wonderful game called Bad

41:38.760 --> 41:44.120
Day L.A., coming out in a couple weeks here, he's basically on the record saying the only

41:44.120 --> 41:52.340
real next-gen is the Wii. And his reasons for that, basically, that the only true next-gen

41:52.340 --> 41:56.880
console out there is the Wii, everything else is just a video card and processor upgrade,

41:56.880 --> 41:59.520
I guess because he's, you know, controls a lot different.

41:59.520 --> 42:04.560
Says, um, he believes that, um, you know,

42:04.560 --> 42:07.440
I don't know, they're really not invading, just kinda upgrading.

42:07.440 --> 42:13.560
So, better graphics and really where the games are is just better gameplay.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.520
You need to fuckin' release some more games, American McGee. That's all I gotta say about that.

42:17.520 --> 42:21.320
I don't think the Wii is next-gen so much as it is

42:21.320 --> 42:26.100
I'll do what I want, Jen. I mean, that's what Nintendo's doing.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.260
essentially, we'll do what we want!

42:28.260 --> 42:33.260
We're just gonna, you, Nintendo, Microsoft, I mean, Sony, Microsoft, you have

42:33.260 --> 42:34.820
fun over there fighting.

42:34.820 --> 42:38.720
We'll be off on this side doing our wee thing.

42:38.720 --> 42:39.620
Seriously.

42:39.620 --> 42:44.060
The whole thing was is, you know,

42:44.060 --> 42:45.100
pretty much

42:45.100 --> 42:48.260
he knows, well, I wouldn't really

42:48.260 --> 42:51.740
say that he knows what, you know, gaming is, but you know,

42:51.740 --> 42:54.700
I think he's trying to point out, it's just like what we say on the show all the time, you know,

42:54.700 --> 43:00.220
system is only as good as the games. And I think just by looking at the Wii, I mean playing

43:00.220 --> 43:04.300
some of these games using that control setup is going to be a lot of fun. And you don't

43:04.300 --> 43:07.900
need to have superb graphics to do it. And to be honest, a lot of the games that come

43:07.900 --> 43:12.660
out for the Nintendo system, especially a lot of the first party stuff, you don't need

43:12.660 --> 43:18.560
to render cartoons and super duper graphics. I mean they're just animated characters. They're

43:18.560 --> 43:24.980
realistic so yeah they can do it with that kind of technology and that kind of

43:24.980 --> 43:30.000
power so I don't know just play the game goddamn wait stop trying to like guess

43:30.000 --> 43:35.760
just we'll see who's you know gonna be at the top pretty soon I mean only a few

43:35.760 --> 43:41.440
months before these systems come out so why do we gotta speculate it's really is

43:41.440 --> 43:46.760
it that slow of a news week in a way sadly enough I mean we're all waiting

43:46.760 --> 43:48.320
for these systems to come out what else

43:48.320 --> 43:49.400
are we supposed to do in the meantime

43:49.400 --> 43:53.520
nobody wants to play 99 nights but me so

43:53.520 --> 43:55.700
I don't know yeah so we can just like

43:55.700 --> 43:58.800
point laugh at all the hype wars all

43:58.800 --> 44:01.480
right Jeremy Todd one interesting point

44:01.480 --> 44:03.320
in chat who says next gen has to have

44:03.320 --> 44:05.240
awesome graphics next gen is really just

44:05.240 --> 44:07.240
a change of the gen before it and the we

44:07.240 --> 44:09.520
certainly falls into that category sure

44:09.520 --> 44:14.000
true agreed all right well this could be

44:14.000 --> 44:15.560
another random direction the we is going

44:15.560 --> 44:21.400
in. You know how the DS was kind of the brain training system? Well, the Wii may be the

44:21.400 --> 44:26.300
body training system. There was a report published by Bloomberg that made mention of a new form

44:26.300 --> 44:32.500
of game in development at Nintendo. It's a Wii-based diet software. This Bloomberg report

44:32.500 --> 44:38.000
issued, I'm sorry, this Bloomberg report showed that there was the recent strong performance

44:38.000 --> 44:42.400
of Nintendo's Japanese stock, and it made mention of the new software in passing. Nintendo

44:42.400 --> 44:46.080
is developing diet-related and other forms of software for the Wii.

44:46.080 --> 44:50.760
The report noted that such titles, specifically Brain Age for the DS,

44:50.760 --> 44:54.340
have been able to target new users who aren't used to standard game controllers.

44:54.340 --> 44:58.760
Details were not given beyond this. Well, that would kinda coincide with the

44:58.760 --> 45:03.280
registering of the domain Wii Health, so... That would make sense.

45:03.280 --> 45:06.400
That's what I was thinking, too, is all those, you know, Wii things we read about

45:06.400 --> 45:07.540
previously, so...

45:07.540 --> 45:11.580
So, not too surprised there. What is kinda funny

45:11.580 --> 45:15.020
and surprising I guess is that the Wii is going to have

45:15.020 --> 45:19.420
or speculated to have a voice-to-text chat

45:19.420 --> 45:23.500
I guess you would call this an advanced voice-to-text

45:23.500 --> 45:26.980
chat because it'll actually detect I guess

45:26.980 --> 45:30.180
the kind of

45:30.180 --> 45:33.860
emotion behind your voice like if you're yelling it'll be bold

45:33.860 --> 45:37.140
caps and stuff like that, different colors

45:37.140 --> 45:41.420
and will maybe censor out explicit speech or

45:41.420 --> 45:44.500
converted to you know less explicit stuff

45:44.500 --> 45:49.660
but it's interesting though I know they've had problems before with their

45:49.660 --> 45:52.860
voice recognition so that'd be kind of funny talking to people

45:52.860 --> 45:56.420
it reminds me of almost like that Vista demo that they showed with the voice recognition

45:56.420 --> 46:00.860
it seems kinda risky to me maybe it's just me but that seems like a really

46:00.860 --> 46:02.820
risky thing to implement I don't know how

46:02.820 --> 46:08.260
how much I believe that to be honest. I don't even know why you would do voice to text chat anyways if you could just do voice chat

46:08.260 --> 46:10.260
Mean what would be the point? I

46:11.140 --> 46:13.100
Don't know. I

46:13.100 --> 46:16.000
Maybe it's just supposed to be one of those things that makes the Wii so unique

46:16.340 --> 46:21.020
And I like the idea of maybe that's how they will censor folks so that you don't

46:21.860 --> 46:26.700
It's like, you know when you sign on Xbox Live my god. I was playing on Xbox Live just like two days ago

46:26.700 --> 46:29.500
I was playing freaking marble blast right online

46:29.700 --> 46:30.200
Okay

46:30.200 --> 46:35.500
And these guys are in there are playing and I joined the game and like they're all yelling back and forth at each other

46:35.500 --> 46:39.580
you queer stop being such a queer you're a fag fuck you fuck you I'm gonna fuck

46:39.580 --> 46:45.980
up your marble but and I'm like dude you're playing marble blast not to knock

46:45.980 --> 46:50.740
marble blast it's a great game but it doesn't exactly strike me as the macho

46:50.740 --> 46:58.220
you know stereotypical macho man type of game my marbles are made of seal bitch

46:58.220 --> 47:03.820
exactly you're bound to hear that sort of stuff also like uno so no I got

47:03.820 --> 47:09.660
fucking Uno bitch. Suck it. I've never heard smack talking in Uno. Really? Yes, never.

47:09.660 --> 47:15.980
We need to start. Play more Uno. I don't want to get bad ratings. I'm gonna totally talk crap in,

47:15.980 --> 47:22.300
like, I don't know, totem ball or something. If that's multiplayer, I'm gonna fucking talk shit.

47:22.300 --> 47:25.660
Too bad, like, Bejeweled 2 isn't multiplayer. That would be sweet.

47:26.460 --> 47:29.500
FireResurrected in chat says, that's why you need to play with your listeners. I mean,

47:29.500 --> 47:32.460
that's true. I want to play games with the listeners. We'll set up, like, a time or

47:32.460 --> 47:37.020
something like a uh you know hey play games with us on xbox live type of night uh we'll do some

47:37.020 --> 47:43.260
like that reni says marbles are serious shit sky i can't wait to get saints bro i just can't wait

47:43.260 --> 47:52.780
to get that game i'm gonna talk so much crap black wolf says draw for biatch exactly see he he's got

47:52.780 --> 47:57.340
the right i want to have you know what didn't all games do an uno tournament recently i don't know

47:57.340 --> 48:02.380
i want to have like a shit talk in uno tournament that's graded not only on how well you play

48:02.380 --> 48:07.800
But how will you talk shit like remember that uh, what was that movie with the South Park guys years ago basketball, right?

48:07.800 --> 48:12.660
They have like they have the psych outs, right? Yeah, that's what we need is a psych out uno tournament

48:12.660 --> 48:16.580
I have no idea how we could pull that off, but we need like a shit talking uno tournament

48:16.580 --> 48:20.540
Here's what we need to do. Oh, yeah, I think you're gonna win this game. We'll suck on this reverse

48:20.860 --> 48:23.340
Here's what we need to do your mom sucked on that reverse

48:23.340 --> 48:27.340
we need to film it and we need to wait until they come out with the vision

48:27.340 --> 48:34.220
cameras and that will be the shit right there because you'll have you know

48:34.220 --> 48:39.460
yelling and it'll just be like you know it'll be awesome

48:39.460 --> 48:43.080
all right maybe we'll have to plan something like that I'll talk to a Scott

48:43.080 --> 48:47.020
offline I'm sure he'll love that idea I've got a story about Reggie tonight

48:47.020 --> 48:54.100
is like Reggie Knight on Orange Lounge Radio. I mean seriously, this man, well this man

48:54.100 --> 48:59.740
is kickin' ass. He's like the Chuck Norris of gaming. That's what it is. That's why I

48:59.740 --> 49:03.260
love Reggie. Don't be talking about Chuck Norris. Well I don't really like Chuck Norris,

49:03.260 --> 49:06.580
like you know I think World of Warcraft. Why are we talking about Chuck Norris? Okay look,

49:06.580 --> 49:09.660
World of Warcraft ruined Chuck Norris for me, would you agree with that? Like I used

49:09.660 --> 49:13.980
to love the Conan O'Brien thing, when he used to pull the lever and have to walk, come on,

49:13.980 --> 49:14.980
Tell me that wasn't awesome.

49:14.980 --> 49:15.980
It wasn't awesome.

49:15.980 --> 49:16.980
Okay, well, you're...

49:16.980 --> 49:17.980
See?

49:17.980 --> 49:18.980
Your taste in everything is fucked.

49:18.980 --> 49:19.980
I also have co-workers...

49:19.980 --> 49:24.220
You eat Taco Bell like five times a weekend because you have a crush on someone that works

49:24.220 --> 49:25.220
there.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.220
Something is wrong with you.

49:26.220 --> 49:28.220
So that's perfectly acceptable.

49:28.220 --> 49:32.660
Anyway, I got sick of Chuck Norris after all my co-workers were obsessed with him and bought

49:32.660 --> 49:37.980
books about him and then it happened and wow and I just wanted to die.

49:37.980 --> 49:41.180
Anyway, Reggie

49:41.180 --> 49:45.820
has said you know remember that way back when Peter Moore said

49:45.820 --> 49:49.740
about the Sony tell me why you would buy a $600 PlayStation 3

49:49.740 --> 49:53.140
people are gonna buy two machines they're gonna buy an Xbox and they're

49:53.140 --> 49:55.900
gonna buy a Wii for the price of one PlayStation 3

49:55.900 --> 49:59.180
and everybody's you know remember that was said back at E3 and everybody's eyebrows went up like

49:59.180 --> 49:59.720
oh

49:59.720 --> 50:03.380
Microsoft and Nintendo might be in bed together well

50:03.380 --> 50:07.220
they are not in bed together because you know what Reggie came back and said

50:07.220 --> 50:10.860
There was an article in USA Today about the Wii, and

50:10.860 --> 50:14.980
he said, quote, I'd much rather have the consumer buy a Wii,

50:14.980 --> 50:18.780
some accessories, and a ton of games, versus buying any of my competitors'

50:18.780 --> 50:19.580
products.

50:19.580 --> 50:24.300
See, you don't get in bed with Microsoft, you just might catch something.

50:24.300 --> 50:27.900
It's like, yeah, like Windows.

50:27.900 --> 50:32.100
Other interesting comments made in the interview, quote, we will offer online

50:32.100 --> 50:35.780
enabled games that the consumers will not have to pay a subscription fee for.

50:35.780 --> 50:40.100
they'll be able to enjoy that right out of the box. The Wii console is going to be

50:40.100 --> 50:41.300
Wi-Fi enabled

50:41.300 --> 50:45.060
so essentially you'll be able to plug it in and go. It won't have hidden fees or

50:45.060 --> 50:45.700
costs.

50:45.700 --> 50:49.180
P.S. suck it more. Actually that wasn't

50:49.180 --> 50:53.260
said but that's kind of what he was implying. I mean

50:53.260 --> 50:56.940
why didn't he just say, you know, suck it Microsoft, ours thing's gonna be free.

50:56.940 --> 51:01.980
And you know what, that is a big point. I mean

51:01.980 --> 51:07.700
I even though I I don't understand why you would need you know Wi-Fi adapter for the 360

51:07.700 --> 51:10.740
I mean, I just run fucking ethernet cable and go to my router

51:11.060 --> 51:14.860
But like if you really want to spend $99 for fucking Wi-Fi

51:15.540 --> 51:19.520
Adapter I mean that's ridiculous, but at least the weeds gonna have it out of the box however

51:19.520 --> 51:20.980
It doesn't have an ethernet cable

51:20.980 --> 51:21.800
You know port on there

51:21.800 --> 51:27.100
So you actually have to have a some sort of Wi-Fi connection whether it be some USB thing or Wi-Fi router

51:27.100 --> 51:32.340
Okay, that kind of sucks now fire resurrected brings up this excellent point that kind of says you know try

51:32.340 --> 51:34.340
He's trying to put Reggie in this place a little bit here

51:34.340 --> 51:38.460
This is an interesting comment, but we have to endure the fucking friend codes

51:39.340 --> 51:42.700
Ouch that that much of a gripe damn

51:43.220 --> 51:48.940
Yeah, it does not code. It's a password. You guys don't remember entering in password, okay?

51:48.940 --> 51:55.220
But but I do and I remember not liking it. We're beyond that now. I remember Justin Bailey dash dash dash, but no seriously

51:55.220 --> 52:02.300
Honestly, put it side by side with Microsoft's system where you can add people on the web

52:02.300 --> 52:03.300
and everything.

52:03.300 --> 52:06.460
I mean, okay, you've got to give that one to Microsoft.

52:06.460 --> 52:10.940
They've got the more ease of communicating with your friends in a way, huh?

52:10.940 --> 52:11.940
I think so.

52:11.940 --> 52:15.440
I mean, the Wii could change things, obviously.

52:15.440 --> 52:19.140
Just trying to do the stupid friend code stuff for Animal Crossing when I had that game for

52:19.140 --> 52:24.580
two weeks that was really obnoxious and I wished I could have just you know been

52:24.580 --> 52:29.820
able to maybe even go to some hub town and like hang out with people like oh

52:29.820 --> 52:33.740
you're really cool here I'm going to add you as my friend or something much

52:33.740 --> 52:38.800
easier act deft in our chat room says friend codes good on theory but Nintendo

52:38.800 --> 52:42.660
didn't do it the right way Jeremy Todd one seems to add to that but they have a

52:42.660 --> 52:46.180
different password for each and every different game they only need one friend

52:46.180 --> 52:50.180
code for the system and that would work fine.

52:50.180 --> 52:51.900
Interesting comments.

52:51.900 --> 52:56.280
Another place we always get interesting comments is our mailbag and even though DarkSakura

52:56.280 --> 53:00.440
is not here tonight to read the mail for us, I've borrowed her hazmat suit and I'm going

53:00.440 --> 53:05.340
to jump on into the mailbag and read some emails.

53:05.340 --> 53:06.340
You want to read an email, Shane?

53:06.340 --> 53:07.340
Yeah.

53:07.340 --> 53:08.340
Alright, come over here.

53:08.340 --> 53:09.340
Read an email.

53:09.340 --> 53:10.340
Alright.

53:10.340 --> 53:11.340
Why don't you read this email?

53:11.340 --> 53:15.860
This one comes to us from StevenNZ and Shane's going to read us this email here.

53:15.860 --> 53:22.860
Hi! I absolutely love your show. I have been listening for about one and a half years now,

53:22.860 --> 53:27.800
but just recently registered on your site. I heard in episode 193 that you guys may not

53:27.800 --> 53:34.440
be getting the Xbox 360 PGR3 bundle, so I would just like to tell you that over here

53:34.440 --> 53:42.000
in New Zealand, there's a... an, not a, an Xbox 360 bundle with Project Gotham 3 and

53:42.000 --> 53:48.000
Which is weird because us New Zealanders normally get things late or don't get anything at all. Thanks for the great show

53:48.940 --> 53:51.020
Steven New Zealand. All right. Well

53:52.000 --> 53:56.080
By the way, it has since come out. I mean the 193 was a little bit ago. So it has since come out

53:56.080 --> 53:59.880
We are not getting that project Gotham Racing bundle here. We're not getting bundles of a sort

53:59.880 --> 54:00.160
No

54:00.160 --> 54:03.000
My only thing though is that is this an official

54:03.200 --> 54:09.720
Microsoft sanctioned bundle or is this something like the local gaming store in New Zealand is doing like how GameStop does here?

54:09.720 --> 54:10.720
I think it is official.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.720
Oh that's cool.

54:11.720 --> 54:14.140
Because in other countries they're getting official bundles to help sell the system a

54:14.140 --> 54:17.140
bit more because you know they're having a little trouble.

54:17.140 --> 54:22.940
So I mean you see some bundles here like I know like bundle I've seen at like Fry's our

54:22.940 --> 54:25.340
local electronics chain over here.

54:25.340 --> 54:30.300
They've got a bundle with Ridge Racer 6 which you know as we mentioned last week Ridge Racer

54:30.300 --> 54:32.940
6 is only $19.99 so it's not a great deal.

54:32.940 --> 54:33.940
So yeah.

54:33.940 --> 54:39.700
But still though it is pretty decent I mean that they're doing that so I don't know.

54:39.700 --> 54:43.080
Alright, well let's go to our next email. Do you want to read another one, Shane?

54:43.080 --> 54:46.320
Yeah! Alright, here we go. Can I respond to?

54:46.320 --> 54:50.800
If you want. This one comes to us from Boston OLR fam. This is really long.

54:50.800 --> 54:53.920
Wait until you see the next one. Alright. Hi.

54:53.920 --> 54:57.800
I'm a relatively new listener and I really love your show.

54:57.800 --> 55:01.060
The format works well and the interaction between the three of you

55:01.060 --> 55:04.480
and any guests you have on definitely make the experience... You didn't read the

55:04.480 --> 55:06.280
part that said except for Miklotov.

55:06.280 --> 55:08.280
Well because it doesn't exist. I'm just kidding.

55:08.280 --> 55:11.280
Make the experience all that much more enjoyable.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.280
My question concerns Kid Icarus.

55:13.280 --> 55:19.280
When it came out for the original NES, I truly loved the game.

55:19.280 --> 55:25.280
And thought it ranked right up there with Metroid as far as playability and...

55:25.280 --> 55:28.280
I can't read it standing up like this because I'm at an angle.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.280
An interesting concept.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.280
An interesting concept.

55:30.280 --> 55:35.280
Why then, has there never been a sequel to this potentially fun franchise?

55:35.280 --> 55:38.000
Is there some sort of inside information

55:38.000 --> 55:39.480
uh... blah blah blah

55:39.480 --> 55:44.400
that have kept this from happening

55:44.400 --> 55:48.440
or am I one of a small minority of people who like the original game

55:48.440 --> 55:52.480
so there's just not enough interest to produce. Thanks for your time and keep

55:52.480 --> 55:53.740
up the great work

55:53.740 --> 55:56.680
Boston Ullrfan

55:56.680 --> 55:58.800
Wait, I want to respond!

55:58.800 --> 56:00.880
There was one on the GBA

56:00.880 --> 56:04.200
I don't remember if it's a sequel but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the same game

56:04.200 --> 56:11.320
Is it just because the Game Boy version didn't sell as well comparatively?

56:11.320 --> 56:12.840
Did it kill off the franchise or what?

56:12.840 --> 56:17.680
I honestly don't think a lot of people bought it because, I mean, Metroid got a sequel on

56:17.680 --> 56:20.160
Game Boy and we ended up getting Super Metroid.

56:20.160 --> 56:23.200
Yeah, Metroid II really did suck.

56:23.200 --> 56:25.960
All the future Metroids have been pretty darn good and Super Metroid is probably one of

56:25.960 --> 56:28.000
the best video games ever made, period.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.560
That's an amazing game.

56:29.560 --> 56:34.200
I guess Kid Icarus on Gameboy just really must have been horrible.

56:34.200 --> 56:37.320
It must have suffered from Metroid II syndrome where that game was really terrible, too.

56:37.320 --> 56:41.800
It just makes me cry inside because if Super Metroid was seriously the great,

56:41.800 --> 56:44.920
great, great, great, great, great video game it was,

56:44.920 --> 56:50.680
imagine what Super Kid Icarus could have been. I mean, it just makes me kind of sad.

56:52.200 --> 56:58.040
I know. I love Kid Icarus, actually, and when I had a PSP for two weeks, I played it on that,

56:58.040 --> 57:00.920
And that game is freaking hard, but it's awesome.

57:00.920 --> 57:05.680
I suppose it's possible that maybe with the Wii, especially with Pit being one of the

57:05.680 --> 57:10.800
new Smash Bros. characters, maybe now is the time for Kid Icarus to return finally.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.000
Because Metroid kind of made a big return on the GameCube.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.640
Maybe it'll make the same return and Kid Icarus will become a first person shooter.

57:17.640 --> 57:23.600
See, that's the problem, I don't want them to, like if they make a new Kid Icarus, I

57:23.600 --> 57:25.480
don't want it to be that different.

57:25.480 --> 57:28.200
Like, I don't want them to fuck with it like they did Metroid.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.040
I know a lot of you like the first person Metroid, but I don't care for it.

57:31.040 --> 57:33.600
You don't want to use the Wii controller to draw back the bowstrings?

57:33.600 --> 57:36.160
Okay, now that might be kind of cool, depending on...

57:36.160 --> 57:37.840
I don't want it to be first person!

57:37.840 --> 57:42.200
If I had to, like, run around and fight an eggplant wizard in first person, I think I

57:42.200 --> 57:45.920
would cry, because that was the scariest part of that game for me when I was younger.

57:45.920 --> 57:50.920
Because I did not want to be an eggplant with legs.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.920
See the eggplant?

57:51.920 --> 57:55.120
See, Kid Icarus had so many memorable characters like that.

57:55.120 --> 57:58.840
You know the scary Medusa looking thing and the dragon that flew that would yell at you

57:58.840 --> 57:59.840
if it saw you?

57:59.840 --> 58:01.840
That was so scary.

58:01.840 --> 58:02.840
Yeah, seriously.

58:02.840 --> 58:03.840
I loved it though.

58:03.840 --> 58:05.160
Oh, how can you not love computers?

58:05.160 --> 58:09.880
And the things that looked like noses with eyes that had a lot of nose hair coming out,

58:09.880 --> 58:12.160
I don't remember what they were called, but they were scary too.

58:12.160 --> 58:16.440
Legend of Zaku thinks he knows another game that ought to be making a return on the Wii.

58:16.440 --> 58:18.500
Punch Out.

58:18.500 --> 58:19.640
Super Punch Out was pretty good.

58:19.640 --> 58:20.640
It was a little bit overlooked.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
I never played that one.

58:21.640 --> 58:24.240
It was a little bit overlooked because I think it came out late in the Super Nintendo's run.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.280
Mike Tyson basically ruined it for everybody.

58:27.280 --> 58:28.360
Mike Tyson does it.

58:28.360 --> 58:30.960
You don't need Mike Tyson.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.080
How about George Foreman?

58:32.080 --> 58:35.080
I realize he's long gone, but I mean, he makes the grills.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.880
I think he's promoting the PlayStation 3.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.680
All right, I got to read this email.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.160
This is a great email.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.960
It's kind of long, but since it's well-written,

58:41.960 --> 58:43.000
I'm going to read the whole thing, OK?

58:43.000 --> 58:44.560
So everybody get the water and snacks.

58:44.560 --> 58:45.640
All right, shut up.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.440
No, this is a good email.

58:46.440 --> 58:46.980
Listen to this.

58:46.980 --> 58:48.040
This is about Sony.

58:48.040 --> 58:49.200
This is a really good, interesting point

58:49.200 --> 58:50.280
on the whole Sony debate.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.680
Hello, GS191 here, and just wanted

58:52.680 --> 58:56.840
put in my two cents on one of the reoccurring topics on the show, Sony.

58:56.840 --> 58:58.540
It's hard trying to like Sony these days.

58:58.540 --> 59:02.440
With their failing formats, overpriced and underperforming Blu-ray format, the underwhelming

59:02.440 --> 59:06.840
PlayStation 3, the whole rootkit fiasco, and let's not forget, they're the makers of the

59:06.840 --> 59:11.560
exploding Dell and Apple laptop batteries, is there any redeeming quality left in Sony?

59:11.560 --> 59:12.880
To me, I think not.

59:12.880 --> 59:17.240
First off, why do they insist on trying to push dead formats such as the Betamax, Minidisc,

59:17.240 --> 59:18.240
UMD, etc.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.480
The list goes on and on.

59:19.480 --> 59:20.480
And now comes Blu-ray.

59:20.480 --> 59:24.680
Sure, Blu-ray has the support of over 180 companies, but the thing that gets me is where

59:24.680 --> 59:26.360
is the consumer in all of this?

59:26.360 --> 59:30.800
I don't see the demand for Blu-ray or HD-DVD now since we basically don't have the majority

59:30.800 --> 59:35.480
of the population owning HD-TVs, let alone 1080p HD-TVs.

59:35.480 --> 59:39.400
This all leads up to the PlayStation 3 and Sony Computer Entertainment in general.

59:39.400 --> 59:43.600
I think that $600 of my hard-earned money is not worth it, even if it was bundled with

59:43.600 --> 59:47.920
a Blu-ray disc showing 6 million ways how Aerith can die for all I care.

59:47.920 --> 59:53.600
They have in no way ever explained to me why is this plastic box full of fans, transistors,

59:53.600 --> 59:56.340
chips, silicon is worth that price tag.

59:56.340 --> 01:00:00.400
They try to push how this is the next generation of gaming and it's proven in the games.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.160
Yeah, I see some screen and game footage from the launch titles for PlayStation 3 and I

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160
was very underwhelmed.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.160
A lot of them look like Xbox 360 and PC games.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.160
I cannot tell the difference.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:14.960
That right there says why spend $600 and I can shell out $400 or even $250 for a much

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.320
better gaming experience than have enough money for the games.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.520
Also eight of the games are already going to be on other consoles.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.960
That also really doesn't give me much incentive.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.720
I think they are really going for the action-oriented audience with this launch, but with many people

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:33.100
not seeing that Grade A title like Halo or Metal Gear at launch, why should I even bother?

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.440
My real problem is the whole PC notation.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.840
It's not a computer, people.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.180
If it's a computer, does this mean that I can upgrade the PS3 to a faster processor

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.700
or add more RAM?

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.700
Probably not.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:48.900
Even if it did, why would anybody want to upgrade?

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.900
It's like the 32X for the Genesis.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.080
The games were there, but nobody wanted to upgrade.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.380
The same would apply here.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.420
Besides, you're going to need a lot of fine tuning to text from a PC perfectly scaled

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.720
on a regular SD TV.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.940
This is what I think should have been done and can be done for SCE to turn things around.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:08.580
One, kill off the flash card reader and leave the memory stick in.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.960
Isn't that what you do with your Sony Vial laptops?

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:13.680
If I want to look at my photos, I will put them on the computer.

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:18.360
It's just added costs that could, not could, definitely have dropped the price down from

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.360
$600.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:23.580
Hell, replace it with, I don't know, regular legacy PS2 controller ports for people who

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.520
use PS2 controllers for DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, etc.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
2.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.800
Instead of getting rid of the HDMI port from the $500 version, why not disable the ability

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.360
of commercially made Blu-ray movies from playing?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.960
Sony can always release a downloadable upgrade that will enable the playback function.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.220
This is a lot better than watching downscaled Blu-ray movies because the movie has copy

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:46.020
protection in it and you don't even have the port for full resolution playback.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:50.240
If this happened, I think the $500 would be useful and great for my needs instead of being

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.460
the joke that it is.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.460
3.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.860
Sony, it's time for Kaz, Ken, and David to make a nice long nap until November.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:00.340
These three people make the PlayStation 3 more overblown than it already is.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.540
At least get them some decent PR people to limit what they say.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.540
4.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.200
Convince people why they should buy the PlayStation 3.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.440
This is the most important and the hardest thing their marketing department has to do.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:14.600
I would love to see Sony do an all-out blitz of great ads on why you should be even considering

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.720
a PlayStation 3 for the holiday season.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.580
All they need to do is showcase the games, do some comparisons, and especially convince

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.600
people how the hell $600 is justifiable on a gaming device.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.920
If they can do the last part, that would be great for them.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.360
I'm doubtful if they can do that, though.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.040
Well, that's what I think anyway.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:33.440
Keep up the great work, screw the haters, practice what you preach, and don't be a dick.

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.700
Sincerely, GS191.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.700
Now you may speak."

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:43.020
Okay, so he wanted to do actual upgrades later on, that was one of the things Kaz said that

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.700
they're looking forward to doing PC-type upgrades with more RAM, more stuff.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.140
Then it comes down to the problem, well now you don't have a standardized system to work

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.980
for, so how do you develop games?

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.220
That's not good for the consumer or for the publishers of these games or anybody even

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.420
thinking about the system because what the fuck do you develop for?

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:04.020
Now you just have to kind of figure out, okay, well what do people have?

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:09.900
always gonna develop for the lowest end well this is stupid the whole um you

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:13.580
know taking out the memory card slots and stuff like that they actually the

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:17.100
stripped-down version doesn't have them and to be honest if they even did have

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:23.120
them they're only like 12 bucks to install anyways so big deal and then

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.580
finally yeah they do need to actually actually tell me why I need to buy this

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.680
system because to be honest I was excited about the PlayStation 3 when I

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.220
went in the E3 I was like holy shit this is gonna be awesome there was games I saw you know trailers

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:43.140
for I'm like I gotta play these things I played them as like so what this is stupid the games

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:48.620
were big letdown and I know they're not finished but you know what I'm not talking about graphics

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:53.820
either I'm just really saying gameplay for these games sucked and the graphics were just like well

01:03:53.820 --> 01:04:01.340
I can see this on the 360 big deal so yeah they are gonna have a problem because basically Xbox

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.700
is lining up their system and the games coming out right now especially all

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:07.820
their first party stuff to trump everything that they're going to release

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:12.980
on the ps3 I mean you've got Gran Turismo HD or whatever they're calling

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:17.960
it now well Forza 2 kicks the crap out of that then they've got you know an

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.100
actual I guess you would kind of say almost like a halo game coming out Gears

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.220
of War which is gonna be just fucking ginormous and that's coming out you know

01:04:27.220 --> 01:04:32.180
week before the PlayStation 3 launch and to be honest blu-ray kind of sucks you

01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:37.620
don't really need the HDMI right now because you can still be able to pump

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.260
out the same stuff component wise until at least I think like 2009 but once they

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:46.020
go all digital then yes you will need the HDMI and you're gonna be fucked

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:51.260
because all your blu-ray discs are only gonna be able to output at 540 so half

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:57.100
the resolution yay that's really worth $600 and I agree the one good thing

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.460
thing though about HD DVD right now though is they're releasing all the discs with

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:05.940
their hybrid discs one side DVD one side HD DVD so say for example that you

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:10.180
are planning on buying HD DVD player down the line you can buy these hybrid

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:13.540
discs and you can still watch them now then later on when you get your new

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.700
system you don't have to go repurchase the actual movie you can just flip the

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:23.280
disc over and watch it in a higher resolution so I don't know whatever the

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.020
case they haven't done their advertising campaign yet and they're gonna need one

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.460
hell of an advertising campaign to get the system sold.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.980
Alright, I'm looking in chat and lots of feedback of course to this email in chat

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.020
and what's kind of funny is that the author of the email is in chat right now, so

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.300
kind of responding to comments there or just at least kind of looking at what people are saying.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.300
Gosh, there's a lot of stuff here. Let's see, I like the one that

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.140
Funnydale said. Also, let's remember the PlayStation 2 launched with

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.820
Fantavision and look at how well the PS2 did. That's because Fantavision is a

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.420
brilliant game. Well, you know what? I don't know about that.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.940
To give, you know, Fan of Vision, I did play Fan of Vision when it came out.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.180
It was one of the first games I rented because I didn't really have any games for it.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.480
And you know what? It was a game that had a different style of gameplay that was fun to play.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:11.180
It was simple, but it was fun. It comes down to, like, the Geometry Wars kind of, you know, scenario there.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:14.420
It's still a fun game. It made me simple, but it was fun to play.

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.580
Granted that I got bored with it after a while, but it doesn't matter. It's different.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:22.940
I never got bored with it because of those cutscenes with the live actors. Those were great.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:26.380
BlackWolf says the PlayStation 3 would sell out my area even if there were no

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:28.860
games for it. They don't care. They want the Sony system

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:32.820
and that's final. That's what, you know what, and that's what Kaz said. He's all

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:36.240
people would buy this system even if we sold it with no games.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.420
Well good, I hope that you're happy with your purchase. I mean, no one's saying,

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.820
no one, I'm not going to talk anyone out buying a PlayStation 3.

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.520
Go ahead and buy one if you want to, but you know what,

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.820
I hope some good games come out for you because so far I'm not impressed, so

01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:56.700
maybe down the line. It might be great. You know, one of those Final Fantasy 13s and one, you know,

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.220
Metal Gear Solid 4 and all that stuff.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:01.260
But the way I look at it, that's about a year off, so...

01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:04.740
I didn't even jump on board. I may look at the system in a year. I didn't jump on board with

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:08.140
PlayStation 1 until Final Fantasy 7. Exactly, I didn't either.

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:12.420
So, I don't know. Anyway, well, this is always a controversial topic. We'd love to hear your

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:13.020
thoughts.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.300
Mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send those emails.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.500
Just on one final note, you know, Sony is saying that something big

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.380
is coming and if in you know with the announcement something they're gonna

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:24.500
blow the roof off or something

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.940
can Sony dig themselves out of this hole with a big enough announcement

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.540
possibly but I think we have stories later on that'll just

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.540
kind of I don't know make the hole deeper

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:39.540
all right. Anyways, Game Fest 2006

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:44.140
took place recently and some news came out of that

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.580
including some other plans for the live marketplace and of course the

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:53.580
The marketplace has been doing great so far. Everybody has been downloading tons of stuff.

01:07:53.580 --> 01:08:01.580
They're saying that 38% of all marketplace downloads are game demos, trailers, and account for 25% of downloads.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:06.580
While Xbox Live Arcade titles make up for 17% of the total.

01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:14.580
And basically, of course, they know that demos are doing really well and the sales of games are especially high when they have demos for them.

01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:23.080
So you're going to see a lot more demos coming soon, but one thing you're also going to see pretty soon is a new kind of Marketplace item called Consumables.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:34.580
And Consumables you may kind of think about as, say for example, I'm playing Final Fantasy XI and on the Marketplace there's Gil for sale.

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:43.580
I can go buy Gil in like, you know, 100 pieces or whatever at a certain price and I can keep buying the same item over and over for the game.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:53.080
game. So you're basically able to buy almost like items for a game. And of course, beyond

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.120
these consumable items, because they're trying to make tons of money off of this stuff, they're

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.760
actually going to have more community stuff, including more community videos and hopefully

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:08.240
user-made content and stuff like that. Especially also with, what was it, the XNA thing that's

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.600
going to be happening where you can actually program for a live...

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:14.040
I think we have more information on that in the next half yeah so should be interesting

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.320
huh I I I don't know how I feel about that

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.360
I don't know um I don't know how I feel about the whole like buying

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.760
in-game currency and all that stuff I don't know

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.800
well here's here's something I mean when you think about it if you actually look like

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.240
say for example oblivion and you look at all those

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:34.720
add-ons that they have for it and because I mean when you're buying the

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.840
add-ons at like a buck 25 a pop

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.940
it's not that bad, I mean it doesn't seem like much but when you look back

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:45.240
at all that you've spent on this game, like say you actually

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.480
bought all of them and spent like a hundred bucks or something. Or it's like the DER add-on

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:52.120
packs too like five bucks for five songs but damn they make a killing on those

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.280
and you know even the Xbox Live Arcade

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:57.740
five, ten dollars a game doesn't seem like much but if you're buying one every

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.800
week like I've been lately, I have 22 arcade games right now on my Xbox

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.720
and I'm thought about it, I'm like, shit that's like a hundred and fifty bucks!

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:08.280
Microsoft's been working me, but granted you know I have 22 games that are all

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:14.580
you know, decent. I also look at Oblivion, they got taunted

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:19.060
the hell out of them for that whole horse armor thing and that's kinda it seems to

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.420
me like that's the kinda thing you're talking about like you can get this you

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:21.780
know

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.740
little item that you can use in your game well it didn't seem to me like the

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.640
horse armor had a very big reception to it

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.420
yeah no one picked up the horse armor but everything else people picked up

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:35.260
Oh, and see, Chyram agrees with me in there. Fire Resurrected said, accept horse armor.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.180
Yeah, horse armor is lame. It was an experiment though,

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:42.900
I guess. That's not really the item I would...

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.580
Horse armor? Who the fuck cares about pimping out their horse?

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:50.060
That's stupid. Alright, well I'll be getting a 23rd

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.940
Xbox Live Arcade game next week and I'm sure a lot of you will too,

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:57.660
but you better get it next week because it's going to be free for a certain

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.920
period of time here.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.900
you'll be able to log on to Xbox Live within the first 48 hours of release and

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.380
that would be

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.660
August 23rd at 8 a.m.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:13.160
like the standard time was GMT so that translates to 1 a.m. Pacific time okay

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.400
so Wednesday August 23rd at 1 a.m. Pacific time

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.040
for 48 hours only you will be able to download

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.120
Texas Hold'em for free. After that

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:27.640
800 Microsoft points or 10 bucks so prepare for those servers to be hammered

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.420
like hell

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.620
on Wednesday and Thursday to get that free game. At least those live arcade games are tiny

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.300
I mean it's not like I'm trying to download Saints Road Demo or something like that. I don't think it'll be so

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.780
bad especially now that you do the background downloadings

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:43.100
especially I think it'll be pretty nice. It should even be, I mean you got 48 hours I mean

01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.100
sure it'll be hammered but

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:48.620
Texas Holeman downloads are going to finish pretty quick so. Oh well

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.700
that's pretty awesome though. Yeah I'm kinda curious to see how this game turns out

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:53.740
I'm sure we will have a review next week and

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:58.020
hey if it's free I expect our listeners to all be grabbing this on Wednesday or

01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:58.760
Thursday

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.140
and we could have like a really big poker tournament there's no excuse that you can't

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.300
grab this game so

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:07.200
go get it. And you know what? It is supporting the camera I

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:13.100
think so yeah great great strip poker for reals not with the listeners please

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.820
k thanks

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:18.660
all the more reason I will send a frowny face feedback for you if I see any

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:24.380
skin. Anyways, this week we've got a lot more things coming out other than just

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.180
that Xbox Live Arcade game.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.540
Lots of stuff in the U.S. Well, maybe not a whole lot in the U.S., but

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:35.940
starting off on the Game Boy Advance, you can get a wonderful Yu-Gi-Oh! Double Pack

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.140
number two. Whoopee.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:42.300
Madden NFL, of course, coming out on every single system

01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:46.660
and, yeah, you can have a Mary Madden all day.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:52.640
On PlayStation 2 and the GameCube, you can get Pac-Man World Rally, which also features

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:58.140
the king, or not the king, but the prince from Katamari, so check that out.

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:04.440
On PC, some wonderful stuff, also Pac-Man World Rally in Madden, and hopefully Bad Day

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:08.880
L.A., but I hear that it might actually be delayed a week, so that's pretty cool.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:13.080
And then one that I thought was kind of funny, and I didn't even realize there was a first

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.000
this but prison tycoon to maximum security that sounds like an awesome

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.960
game that's pretty funny on a PlayStation 2 and the PSP you can

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:30.400
actually get world championship poker all in and then of course on the 360

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:37.560
just madden so it's a very madden week next week is a the week after that

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:43.560
Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, and Bomberman.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.560
Are you gonna pick up that new Bomberman? I wasn't too giddy about it when I saw it.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.560
I'll wait and see, because Konami usually sends me free stuff.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.560
Jamie's not here tonight, so allow me to help out those of you folks over in the UK with what is coming out on your neck of the woods.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.560
You guys, of course, also can download Texas Hold'em on the 23rd, so look out for that.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:08.960
On the 25th you're going to get Dig Dug Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, 99 Nights,

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.760
which isn't as bad as they all say it is if you like the slashing games, Reservoir Dogs,

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.080
World War I Aces of the Sky, World War II Battle Over Europe, and I like this one.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.480
It's a game called Let's Make a Soccer Team, coming from Sega of Europe.

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:24.480
That should be exciting.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.720
Shouldn't it be Let's Make a Football Team?

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.220
Looking forward, that's what it's called, looking forward a little further to the week

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:35.540
of September 1st, you're going to have games such as Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:41.740
York, The Takeover for PSP, Dungeon Siege 2, you guys are finally getting, and Saints

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:45.100
Row is also coming out for you guys, it's about the same time we're getting it, Star

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.820
Fox Command on the DS, Test Drive Unlimited on the Xbox 360, and for those of you folks

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:54.480
in the UK, a game that's near and dear to our hearts, Guitaro Man, finally makes its

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:59.180
way to the PSP and Guitaro Man lives, September 1st, enjoy.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:06.180
cool. One thing coming out probably this fall from mad cats is an xbox live arcade stick

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:13.140
and it looks like an old kind of Atari controller and people are I guess jumping on this scene

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:18.380
that's going to be pretty cool. It's supposed to also come with 100 gamer or not gamer points

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:25.380
100 microsoft points. One month free to xbox live gold and 3 xbox live arcade games. It's

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:30.140
Xbox Live arcade games. It's supposed to retail for $49.99.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:33.980
They said it's supposed to be releasing in October.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.580
And one thing though I gotta mention though, but just looking at this,

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:41.260
this looks horrible. I wouldn't want to buy this thing to be honest.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:44.460
I mean, granted, it's, I guess,

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:49.020
having a giant, you know, stick instead of a, you know, a left analog stick

01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:52.620
might be good for some arcade games.

01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:57.220
I mean, not all the arcade games out there are going to be retro, so do you really need

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.220
to buy another controller?

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:03.340
Yeah, but how horrible is Street Fighter II to play on that controller sometimes?

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:06.100
You're not going to be able to play Street Fighter on this controller either, if you've

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.100
taken a look at it.

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:11.640
It's looking like an old Atari controller.

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.660
And it basically has, instead of a left analog stick, it's got a giant, just kind of like

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.340
Atari joystick.

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:24.140
And then right next to that, the four buttons, and below that, the right analog stick, and

01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:27.660
to the left of that, the directional pad.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.580
So it's like a big clusterfuck of stuff with a stick on there.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:39.240
SSJ100Matt says, it looks like a crappy photoshop, and DJ Geni must have something against Mad

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:41.340
Cats because he calls them mad craps.

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.940
Mad Cats is really terrible at making anything, so...

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.940
Didn't they make Pump It Up?

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.940
No.

01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:47.940
I thought you were making Pump It Up in the US.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.300
Did they distribute in the US?

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:54.140
They distributed the dance pad, and I think they had a little part in it, but you know

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:55.140
what?

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:59.540
That's okay, because Pump, the greatness of Pump can outweigh the craftiness of Mad

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.540
Cats.

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:04.620
Oh, sorry, it was Mastiff actually, my bad, my bad.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.500
Like, had brought the game over here, but Mad Cats had to do with the past.

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.820
I knew Mad Cats did something with it.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:10.820
I'm not crazy.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.300
Well, it's not a Photoshop, it is actually a sales sheet, and it was spotted on EB Games'

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:20.100
website, and I'm sure we'll know more about this in a few weeks or so.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:24.840
Alright, well something I'm sure you can lay down a pre-order for now, along with this

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.940
joystick if you want it, is Prey 2.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.400
Apparently in a recent interview with 3D Realms' Scott Miller, their team is already working

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.420
on a Prey 2.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:37.660
There's really not a lot else to say about it, but there is a quote I have for you guys,

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:42.960
a quote from Scott Miller, quote, Prey 2, of course, we are addressing concerns about

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:47.680
combat as well as adding in more gameplay innovations.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:50.200
Very early, not a lot of hell else to say.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.920
I hope they speed up multiplayer.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.860
I did try multiplayer for the first time this week and I was really disappointed.

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:58.360
Even after that, that, well, go ahead.

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.360
Sorry, Loki.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:04.960
Well anyways, speaking of your bad multiplayer, they are going to be putting out a patch and

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.200
I, as far as I remember, I think it is already available for download.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.080
A patch came out.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.040
I can tell you, when I put in Prey the other day, it did patch, but I'm hearing it didn't

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.520
fix a damn thing with multiplayer and it was supposed to.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520
Right?

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520
Probably, yeah.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.000
It was supposed to be fixing, well the one for the PC is supposed to be fixing multiplayer

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.440
weapons exploit, crashed I guess on some of the machines when they were reading save games

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.920
and crashed at the startup of some machines.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:37.780
And I know that they were talking about later on adding content as far as new characters

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:41.780
including some of the females that were actually in the game.

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.780
Like gen and stuff?

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:44.780
Yeah, where you get to play as them.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:46.780
I don't know if that's any cool.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:52.780
But yeah, the Pre-Version 1.1 patch, it's basically just, you know,

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.780
updating multiplayer browsers to fix servers and just like a lot of server stuff.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:19:01.780
But the new content, though, they are going to be charging for it.

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:09.940
They said they're adding 6 new playable characters, including Jen, Mother, and Becky, I guess

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.900
a blonde victim, and 200 characters.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.580
They're putting a victim as a playable character?

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:18.580
There's just, okay, Becky, unless I'm just not far enough in the story yet, Becky is

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:23.140
just somebody that gets, like, killed in the very beginning, and you never learn her name.

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.700
You just watch her get-

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:28.140
A blonde victim that you occasionally see on slabs in a single-player play.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:32.140
Are they going to have the guy too that always goes, oh god, oh god!

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.420
There's always this random guy like when you see the little victim.

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:36.340
It's about alien abduction and the aliens are killing him.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.900
Hunter and Elite Hunter are two Hunter characters that they're adding.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.900
Interesting.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.540
So, that's interesting.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:43.540
I don't know.

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:48.220
Now our chat room is making all the mandatory Prey 2 jokes and you can guess where this

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:49.220
is going.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.260
Ravens Dolphin says, gee I have to wait 11 years for the next Prey.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:56.620
Funny Dale says, I'll be waiting for Prey 2 when it's released in 2015.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.500
making jokes about how long Prey was in development.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:03.660
DJ Genai says, no Prey 2, they need to finish Duke Nukem Forever.

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:04.660
Exactly.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.460
Stop getting distracted.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:07.460
Stop it.

01:20:07.460 --> 01:20:09.100
Make Duke Nukem Forever.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:13.220
They're getting way too distracted with that game.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.260
One more story for you guys, then we're going to go to a break here.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:20.460
Dragon Quest IX, it looks like it's happening of course.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.460
This really shouldn't be much of a surprise.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:27.800
Dragon Quest VIII kind of revived the series in a way here in the US, I mean sure we had

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:32.360
VII, but it kind of didn't make the waves that VIII did, VIII was truly like a return

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.360
to...

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.360
Poor blimey.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.480
Well didn't you, did you play Dragon Quest VIII?

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.480
Yeah.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480
Drew?

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480
It was awesome.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480
Wasn't it like a Super Nintendo with next-gen graphics?

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480
It was awesome.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.920
Yeah, it reminded me of Dragon Quest VI, so it was old school.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:48.920
It's exactly what some of the hardcore gamers wanted, so on August 11th, the Tokyo Symphony

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.960
Orchestra held a concert called the World of Dragon Quest.

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:57.880
Now what basically happened in an interview before the concert on the 11th, the music

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:03.400
composer Koichi Sugiyama mentioned how delighted he is that people have loved his music since

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.000
the Famicom era and how flattered he is with the orchestra's members' appreciation of

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
the games.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.120
He also happened to say, series producer Yuji Horii is really busy at the moment on Dragon

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.000
Quest IX and I'm really looking forward to what kind of game he's making at this

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.160
time as a gamer.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.260
It should be pointed out that Sugiyama is 75 years old, so he may have forgot about

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.080
any NDA's he was under.

01:21:27.080 --> 01:21:33.120
But at the same time, come on, obviously they're making a Dragon Quest IX at some point.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:37.180
Well, we're going to have a spin-off of Dragon Quest VIII, Dragon Quest Yangas.

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:44.280
I have exclusive news from Orange Onage Radio, Final Fantasy XIV coming out eventually.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:48.200
Wow, that's great, that's great, thank you for confirming that for us here.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.520
New and exciting.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.000
Wow, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're really on top of the latest news.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.640
