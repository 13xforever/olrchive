Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, August 13th, 2006. Is Squeenix going to get in the business of hardware?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Get ready for some retro Sega Genesis action.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What is holding up the PSP download service anyway?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,360
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another wonderful episode of

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,640
Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,400
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gaming culture, and of course, video

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,880
games that don't suck.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,680
But sometimes we have to talk about games that do suck, but only to tell you to avoid

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
them.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,840
Right, fellow co-host, Dark Sakura?

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,120
Yeah, Rob my fellow co-host and producer of orange lounge radio according to your voicemail

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,760
Your your voicemail has the same thing. I know all right

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,240
Cuz we're co producers in crime

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
And it makes it sound important when our friends and family call us and it also makes

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
Certain people in this room make fun of me when they leave me voicemail. I would never do such a thing

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,220
Also say hello to

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,220
Hi.

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,220
Hi, Loki.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,220
How you doing?

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,220
Good.

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,220
Good.

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,220
Hungry.

25
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,220
Hungry?

26
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,220
Why didn't you eat before the show tonight?

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,220
Here's some beer nuts.

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,220
I don't want nuts.

29
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,220
You don't like nuts, do you?

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,460
I don't like eating nuts.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,860
Tonight also we have some very special guests in the studio.

32
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,960
We actually have some guests tonight who have never been on the show before.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,380
That's a rarity because usually we get the same old people, but tonight we have some

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
guests.

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,660
Our first guest tonight is coming to us all the way from Wisconsin.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
Say hello to Magsy.

37
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Hi.

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:43,660
Hi, how you doing?

39
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,700
You can put the mic a little bit closer your mouth. Hi. Hi. How you doing? I'm okay. Yeah

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
I like your shirt. You have Mario on your shirt

41
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,180
Right on are you a gamer girl? Yes, what kind of games you like?

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,780
Don't be afraid to just get that microphone like right there by your mouth

43
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,120
Let's see I like RPGs I like platformers I actually like anytime type of game

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
As long as it's fun.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
What would you say is the best game you've played in the past year?

46
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
In the past year?

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Animal Crossing.

48
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Oh no, it's another Jamie.

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Alright, say hello as well to Chris, who's here tonight as well.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
Hi.

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Hi, how are you doing?

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm alive.

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
Alright.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm also good.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Alright, right on.

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
And you also are a gamer girl?

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I am also a gamer girl.

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
What would you say is the best game you've played in the past year?

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,640
No, I'm not addicted to animal crawl. I'd have to say Kingdom Hearts 2 because I'm

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,040
just a Disney, insane Disney fan, so I like listening to Donald freak out and Mickey all

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,880
ninja and cool, so that's my favorite so far.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,040
Very cool, very cool. Now, we should also point out tonight, first off, the girls outnumber

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,080
the guys, which is a little strange for me, I don't know, but also we should point out

64
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,420
Now Meg Z and Chris are actually together.

65
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,040
So we have gaming lesbians on tonight's show.

66
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Oh baby.

67
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Oh yes.

68
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,040
But no, that's great, it's a whole sexuality smorgasbord on tonight's program.

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,880
We have a little bit of everything, so that's fun.

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Yes we do.

71
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,880
We at Orange Lawns Radio, we're about the games, and you know, different types of people

72
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,280
that play the games.

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
So now, you two are the girls that hang out with Dark Sakura a lot on the weekend, right?

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,400
Or at least I know you do, Chris.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Megsy being from Wisconsin doesn't get to do that as much.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
But we hang out online a lot.

77
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,700
Yeah.

78
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,300
Now tell me the truth.

79
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,700
Pillow fights? Are there ever pillow fights?

80
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,000
No pillow fights, but we did have an orgy.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We had a Mississippi orgy.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
What's a Mississippi orgy?

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,100
It's when you get people in a room without their socks or shoes.

84
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,400
It was really hot.

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,200
It was hot.

86
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,600
So wait, if I take off my socks right now, because all I have on are my socks.

87
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh, oh, Megsy's taking off her socks.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,400
And I'm taking off my socks.

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,100
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, an orgy.

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
This is fun.

91
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,440
All right, let's get to the games.

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,080
Of course, the guys in the room are now going, it's a lesbian show.

93
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh yes, how could I forget our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,360
Click on chat if you're listening to us live here on this lovely Sunday evening.

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,400
And we'd love to hear your opinion.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,780
So and then of course, there we go, Jeremy Todd won OMG, they're having an orgy on the

97
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
show.

98
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:28,940
Tonight's going to be, it's a slow news week boys and girls. What can we say?

99
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,620
This is the type of stuff that happens during slow news weeks is we have

100
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,220
you know Mississippi orgies with lesbians. So this is

101
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,020
a good time. Alright, let's take it to the games though. We always like to talk about how is your

102
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,020
gaming week. So we'll start off with dark soccer. What types of games have you been

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,820
playing this week?

104
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,580
Well, I actually haven't played it yet because I'm waiting for

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,500
Meg Z to play it on Wednesday at my house. I have Dead Rising.

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,440
So, I'm gonna wait and then I'm gonna wait for her to come over to kill zombies, however

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,440
Dan called me while I was on the road saying, where's Dead Rising, Will and I want to play?

108
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
Okay.

109
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,000
So anyway, I did play some Animal Crossing, I played Pinball!

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,640
And I actually almost, I tried to hunt down the Saturn so I could play our Sega Ages collection

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,600
that we got from the guy who was the man behind Working Designs, who Dan just bought the Twilight

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Zone Pinball from.

113
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,660
He's really awesome.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,060
And Dan got me a monkey.

115
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
Like a real monkey that blinks poo?

116
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
A monkey ball monkey.

117
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
Oh.

118
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Right on.

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Yeah.

120
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
So I have a monkey.

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,060
That's cool.

122
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Chris has a monkey too.

123
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,060
I got her the monkey.

124
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
I work at Gamestop.

125
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,060
Oh, you work at Gamestop?

126
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
I work at Gamestop.

127
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,060
Very cool.

128
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,060
We have Gamestop Pride in here.

129
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,060
Gamestop Pride.

130
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,460
Oh, we have a story about Gamestop tonight.

131
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Uh oh.

132
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,020
It's up in part B. We'll talk about that later.

133
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Okay.

134
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
Alright.

135
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
Is that it for your games?

136
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,620
Then we also played the game where we mess with people's heads

137
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,140
But that that's yeah, that's that's a real-life game. I think all right my gimme week. I played Dead Rising. Which is like

138
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,980
So cool. I don't know how to describe it

139
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,700
It's so it's so great like zombie killing is love it really is I mean

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,580
I knew I was in love with Dead Rising the minute

141
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,580
I picked up the lawnmower and mowed over 70 zombies in a minute. I mean

142
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,160
I mean, whoever thought of this concept for a game, I want to kiss you.

143
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,060
I do, right on the lips.

144
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,120
This is a beautiful game.

145
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,720
More games should be like Dead Rising.

146
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,000
Now, Dead Rising's not perfect.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
There are some things that need to be fixed for Dead Rising 2.

148
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
One of them is that small-ass text size.

149
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,900
I mean, it's really hard to read.

150
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,040
Even on my HDTV, it's kind of hard to read the text.

151
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,160
I know a lot of people have been bitching about this, but seriously, the text has got

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
to be fixed.

153
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,920
The graphical style of Dead Rising isn't for everybody.

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,960
I let Mikoltov watch me play for a little bit, and he's like,

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,000
this game looks like crap.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
And I said, what are you smoking?

157
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,600
This game's beautiful.

158
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
It's a different art style.

159
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,920
It's a little bit cartoonish with the blood,

160
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,000
but it's zombies.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,240
It's supposed to be cartoonish.

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
And then the other thing that kind of annoys me is the

163
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,680
saving, because you have to save in a

164
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
bathroom or on a couch.

165
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
And it's really weird.

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,480
The first time you play, you're not ready for the fact

167
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,840
that you're going to die, and you're going to die fast.

168
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,600
And if you select the option that says Save and Quit, you

169
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,760
literally start all over. So it's a little weird because the game's main

170
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,280
mode is a 72 hour mode. It's not literally 72 hours.

171
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
Loki was telling me before the show every hour is five minutes. I couldn't figure it out.

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,600
I knew it was running faster than a real hour though. But the game was, you know,

173
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,760
kind of interesting where you would start that over if you selected that. But

174
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,800
that's kind of cool because you could power yourself up more and more and then

175
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,520
you know start the game in that mode. So I like powered myself up to level 3

176
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,480
And I was like you know what I'll start over because I was getting my ass kicked by zombies

177
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,740
But other than that other than those little bitches. I love the game

178
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,600
I mean, I love the fact that you can take pictures of zombies

179
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,780
You can put like I thought it was so hilarious like I put those little uh what are those mega man guys call they can

180
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,500
Never remember their names with the little yellow heads serve bots. Thank you

181
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,520
I put the little serve bots head on a bunch of zombies then took pictures of them all walking around

182
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,680
It's really funny, and then just getting to use all these weapons on zombie. It's a great aggression taking out game

183
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,060
I just kind of wish from the start there was like a sandbox mode where it was more like the demo

184
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Where it just drops you into a sea of zombies with all the items around you start going like I could do this game without

185
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,900
The story for fun and just like a party and also it would be nice if the game had multiplayer. I know

186
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,580
Oblivion didn't have multiplayer and it's a great game. So it's not like the game has to have multiplayer, but it would be so cool

187
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,060
I mean it would just make a cool thing even cooler. So

188
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,580
So, Dead Rising, I do recommend Dead Rising, I think a lot of you guys would have fun with

189
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
it.

190
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,580
But just, those little minor complaints aside might frustrate you for a little bit.

191
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,860
But then you take your aggression out on zombies with a lawnmower, and it's wonderful.

192
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,780
And then that hook that lets you pull their heads right off, it's great.

193
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
Sounds beautiful.

194
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,520
Yeah, it's fun.

195
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Killing is love.

196
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Killing zombies is love.

197
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's see, so there's Dead Rising and then I also play more Prey, because I'm slowly

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,660
but surely trying to make my way through Prey still, which is a great game because you never

199
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
die.

200
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,740
made for people who suck at first-person shooters like myself you just you'd

201
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,580
never die you just go to little spirit world shoot some shoot some Medusa heads

202
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,820
or whatever those things are and they come back to life it's beautiful love it

203
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:22,060
Loki how was your gaming week it was okay just played more Grand Theft Auto

204
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,760
Liberty City stories to tide me over until you know Vice City stories comes

205
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:36,320
out. I kicked ass this week, so it was awesome. Played Dead Rising, not too much though, just

206
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,000
during lunches. Got to play the lawnmower and chop zombies up at that, then pick up

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,820
the lawnmower and just slam it into their head. And we also, I played Chromehounds,

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,600
and yes I did play Chromehounds, and I have been on there and no one's joined our clan.

209
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,560
person you know fire resurrected excellent but um whatever you know talk

210
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,420
about the chrome hounds thing in a minute yes it's just I'm ready to go and

211
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,480
just no one else wants to whatever and then was it I watched someone play a

212
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,160
game that will not be named it was cool and creepy but we'll talk about that at

213
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,560
another time all right Magsy Chris anything you guys want to say what kind

214
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,420
games you've been playing this week? I played Animal Crossing on the plane. Yeah? Yeah.

215
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,000
Did they let you though? I thought because the DS had the wireless, they don't like it

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
when you play DS on the plane. I didn't have a problem with it. Oh, okay, that's good.

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
And I tried to finish Kingdom Hearts 2. See, I was real smart and played it the first time

218
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,740
around on proud mode. And I'm having a hard time beating it. Okay. And I played a really

219
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,980
old-school arcade machine

220
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,080
some of our brothers

221
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,380
that was fun

222
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,760
a big mario fan as i know she you know you have my own yes i am a big mario fan

223
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,700

224
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,180
paper mario on the game now some people thought that mario on the we look kind of

225
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,940
weird

226
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,140
uh... is that only always looks weird

227
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,600
uh...

228
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,540
very cool now you know i need i need to get from the lesbian perspective

229
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,740
Who's better, Peach or Daisy? Oh, Peach.

230
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,740
Why Peach? Because she's hotter.

231
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,180
I'll have you know though, whenever I play Mario Party, I always play as Peach.

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,500
Because she's also got attitude. You know, she's like, Peach is the winner!

233
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,620
That's me. I'm the winner whenever I play Mario Party.

234
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,540
Just thought I'd share. Any games you're looking forward to coming out soon?

235
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,220
Dirge of Cerberus. Oh, you like Vincent? I love Vincent.

236
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:45,580
She actually called when she was coming down here, she had me go to the GameStop and reserve

237
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,580
it.

238
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
That's awesome.

239
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:53,940
Yeah, I'm kind of with video games, like way over my head sometimes.

240
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Really?

241
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
But yeah.

242
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,700
I had it reserved at my GameStop and I realized I was going to be here and I was like, go

243
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,580
to the GameStop and reserve it so I can get it.

244
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,860
So you guys are going to play all night when it comes out?

245
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,860
Oh, probably.

246
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,260
I'm going to watch her play it.

247
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,760
I played it a little bit, E3, but it wasn't Final Fantasy enough for me, because it's

248
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,400
more like live action, which is cool, I know there's people that are into that more action

249
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,780
style game, but I'll still check it out when the final game comes out and make my final

250
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,560
decision then, but I hope you enjoy it.

251
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,200
You know the first time I played through Final Fantasy VII and I never even got Vincent?

252
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Because I'm so stupid, I never figured out to open the safe.

253
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,880
Well, it took me forever to figure out how to get him.

254
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,280
I got him first time without the book.

255
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
Well, look at you.

256
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Good for you.

257
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,280
And Yuffie. Well, Yuffie's easy to get. Just because Yuffie's easy.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,280
Chris, I'm sorry. Chris, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

259
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Well, again, I'm a gamer in the old school sense, so I play D&D and stuff like that,

260
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,280
but I do have Sims 2 on my Mac, and that kind of has me really, really addicted.

261
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
So, I play a lot of that.

262
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Do you like to kill your Sims? Because I know that's what Loki does.

263
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,280
Oh, hell yeah.

264
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
What are some clever death traps you come up with for your Sims?

265
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
My favorite one is

266
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,620
stick like have them go inside the pool and then take away the option to get them out of the pool and they'll slowly die because

267
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,060
They'll fall asleep and they'll drown and then another fun way is to put them

268
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,560
This is actually old old Sims you put them in a room with a bunch of stoves

269
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,380
Like we use one and then lock it like take away the door and a room would catch on fire

270
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,000
And then they burn to death. It's really fun

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,140
you know I'm screen and they scream really loud

272
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,840
you know I had a gay friend once who made his homo palace once on the Sims

273
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,880
and he put what's the most number seems you can have a house like a

274
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,000
yeah 8 in this game I think you can have like 12

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,320
okay one Sims one he had seven guys and it was like it was like Melrose place

276
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,580
they would all make out with each other and have sex with each other

277
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,560
and then there was one woman in the house but what she had to do she cleaned

278
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
up after all the guys

279
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,160
you know and she she finally died from exhaustion because they she forgot to

280
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,320
put a bathroom in the house so she had to clean up all their pee and had to do the cooking

281
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,680
for them and she finally died of exhaustion and like you know it's so funny because she

282
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,200
passes out in the middle of the room and the guys don't care they're still making out with

283
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200
each other and stuff they're like oh she just died it's really funny if you have them on

284
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,420
um I made the mistake of having put them on freestyle like they can pretty much if you're

285
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,760
not paying attention they'll do whatever the heck they want and like four or five of my

286
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,840
sims who weren't supposed to go make out with each other went and made out with each other

287
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,520
because they've in the second game they've got like chemistry like

288
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,040
lightning connection chemistry and they just ended up making out and then

289
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,840
getting pissed at each other because they watched the person they just made

290
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:45,520
out make out with somebody else hmm so it's drama more Melrose place oh yeah that's

291
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,040
some of the fun stuff to do with the sims oh I think that's why I came so

292
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,940
popular find my sims 2 disc cuz I miss playing it can you play that online no I

293
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,920
guess you can't because they had the sims online huh it's kind of moot anyway

294
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,760
because my DVD drive on my PC is busted so I'll have to get the Mac one anyway

295
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,880
because I'm getting my iMac soon let's see I'm reading chat room some other

296
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,560
folks are sharing their Sims stories here poo eater says I had made a house

297
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,600
with each sim in their own room with only one thing like one would have a TV

298
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,820
one would have a fridge one would have a toilet then enjoy the show so they have

299
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,400
to go to each other's houses to borrow things I guess that's kind of

300
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,880
interesting and PK Akira 88 is clearing up the DS thing on the plane for me

301
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,580
saying unless it's during takeoff and landing it really doesn't matter yeah

302
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,480
because they make you even make you turn off everything during takeoff and

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,640
landing you know I fly enough I should know that but I just never for some

304
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,440
reason I never bring my DS I do a lot of short flights I had my iPod and and

305
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,540
during takeoff and landing and they didn't seem to care really yeah well they

306
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:49,140
Either they didn't seem, the plane didn't crash, so.

307
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,980
Did you fly during all the chaos that was going on recently?

308
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,940
No, I actually totally missed all the chaos.

309
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Oh good.

310
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,780
I'm just recently hearing a little bit about what's been happening.

311
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Yeah.

312
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,700
Oh, there was a, not that we're getting into CNN podcasts, but this was basically, there

313
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,820
was a big terrorist plot that was thwarted that had to do with liquid explosives, so

314
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,080
So now, people can't bring liquids on planes right now

315
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,880
at all, like gels, liquids, anything.

316
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,200
That could be like toothpaste, soda, anything.

317
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,700
Really?

318
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,360
Isn't that weird?

319
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah.

320
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,160
They should ban all Taco Bell from the plane

321
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,480
because that causes some liquid explicit.

322
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
You're disgusting.

323
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,280
Absolutely disgusting.

324
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,120
All right, before we get into tonight's program,

325
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,240
we have some housekeeping to take care of.

326
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,640
First off, I want to point out on our website, www.orangelaunchrater.com,

327
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,240
we have brand new forums dedicated to the O.L. Army.

328
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,200
The O.L. Army concept, which is basically,

329
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,540
really the people don't have to listen to this program,

330
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,960
but it helps if you're an Orange Lounge Radio fan.

331
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,040
The cardinal rule of the O.L. Army is don't be a dick.

332
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,760
We just want to have fun playing the games

333
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,440
without any of that attitude or drama or smack talking,

334
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,080
unless you're smack talking Bobby Black Wolf, then it's fine.

335
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,040
We want to have a drama-free environment there.

336
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,680
So we made a whole new forum over there

337
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,540
on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for folks to start clans and games.

338
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,240
It's been working out pretty well so far.

339
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,680
We have folks in Halo 2, and a couple of folks in Guild Wars,

340
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,140
and I noticed the Steam games are getting a lot of folks.

341
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,180
So check that out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

342
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,680
One thing, however, we haven't been

343
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,220
getting a lot of participation in, as Loki mentioned earlier,

344
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,420
is ChromeHounds.

345
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,020
Now, here's the problem.

346
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,980
OrangeLoungeRadio somehow got talked

347
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,900
into doing a tournament on August 20th for ChromeHounds.

348
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,980
And we've talked a little bit of smack

349
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,220
leading up to this tournament.

350
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:43,420
No one has consulted me on anything in this, they nominated me to play this damn game for

351
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,500
one and it's hard enough when there's freaking Dead Rising coming out because that game is

352
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,000
very distracting especially when chrome hounds they move really slow there's no zombies in

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,440
it you know that kind of thing then then for some reason somehow no rules were discussed

354
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,040
at all no ground rules just somebody decided okay it's gonna be four on four teams and

355
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,980
stuff I never agreed to any of that I'll take them on one-on-one I'll beat his ass one-on-one

356
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,120
But you know what, if you're gonna get your fucking gamer friends who play all the time,

357
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
fuck that shit.

358
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,320
I will take you on one-on-one.

359
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,920
That is the way it's going down.

360
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,360
Well, okay, somehow we're suckered into this 4-on-4 thing, but the problem is we only have

361
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,680
two other people so far who said they'd do it.

362
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
So we need more people to do this.

363
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,400
So please, if you're a ChromeHounds player, you want to have a little fun on Sunday about

364
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,680
one o'clock Pacific time, please come and tour our forums and say you would like to

365
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
participate.

366
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,480
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to figure out how to get in there and I'll play as Mr. Spanky

367
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,800
in the ChromeHounds Invitational and that's gonna be kinda

368
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,700
sad because we're really gonna get our butts kicked. First we'll get our butts kicked by

369
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,240
Bobby

370
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,860
then we'll get our butts kicked by Scott. We'll come in last place in the tournament and never hear the

371
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,300
end of it.

372
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,580
But I do seem to recall by agreeing to this I did say we get to pick the next

373
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,060
game.

374
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:58,220
So gamer Andy better start working out to DDR because he's going down.

375
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,260
Here's the bad thing about ChromeHounds

376
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,480
First off, you have to be online in order for people to sign up for your clan, which

377
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,680
is retarded anyways.

378
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,400
Because what's the point of having that, you know, clan password thing if...

379
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I don't get it.

380
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,480
Because you have to prove them anyways, so that's kind of retarded.

381
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,320
We'll figure something out, so please O.L. Army, save us, and so we don't embarrass ourselves

382
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,480
too bad one week from today.

383
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm not going to embarrass myself, I'm just saying, you know, that's kind of fucked up.

384
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,480
Look, you can take them all on.

385
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Oh yeah, let me just take them all on while they're attacking my base and shit, and I

386
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I got a I can't be

387
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,300
Okay, blaze does have a good point hit stun from the ol army has already owned black wolf and Tetris

388
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,380
So if we lose miserably at this at least it'll be evened up so there can't be a lot of shit talking

389
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,820
Fine, I'll do my best. There we go. What I can't speak for the rest of them. There you go

390
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,140
All right. I won't be getting my ass handed to me. So please chrome hound players

391
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,420
We need your help come to the ol army forums immediately one other piece of housekeeping

392
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,440
keeping I want to get out there is that we actually have an addendum to a

393
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,200
previously reported on story. You know we here at Orange Launch Radio we try to

394
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
report accurate information but once in a while something's gonna slip through

395
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,080
the cracks that maybe wasn't correct oops but this is interesting because not

396
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,360
a lot of people know that this is not correct but we've received a trusted

397
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,640
anonymous tip so I can't tell you who it's from but it's a trusted source and

398
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,560
they're telling us that that song list we announced a couple shows back to

399
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,880
elite beat agents that's run on a lot of sites is wrong so that might actually be

400
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,840
good news for some people so folks that were a little disappointed at some of

401
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,040
the pick like didn't they have like Linkin Park and stuff in that list

402
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,160
whatever store what yeah which is kind of cool that you know Weird Al would

403
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,560
have been okay with but we have received a tip that that is absolutely wrong and

404
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,560
that only the demo songs are ones you can count on actually seeing in the full

405
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,920
version which would make sense but as for the rest of the song list you'll

406
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,700
You'll just have to wait and see.

407
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:01,800
And also the last housekeeping thing, of course, we upped our cap on listeners.

408
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:07,960
So yeah, instead of capping out at 50 or whatever, we've got a lot more than that.

409
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,920
So now you can listen without worrying about not being able to.

410
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,840
Yeah, so please come listen live to us on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

411
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,200
Time on OrangeOnTrader.com.

412
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,260
You shouldn't get locked out of the feed anymore because we have plenty of room now.

413
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,180
But of course, if you can't do it Sunday nights because you're watching, I don't know, what's

414
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
on Sunday nights?

415
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
Touched by an Angel or whatever?

416
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
Desperate Housewives.

417
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
Oh, Desperate Housewives.

418
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,180
Well, all those shows suck.

419
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
So if you...

420
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
No, it does not.

421
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,180
Buy a TiVo.

422
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Buy a TiVo.

423
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:39,500
So if you can't listen to us, let's say, okay, Megsy's making pouty faces at me.

424
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I can't get pouty faces.

425
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I like Grey's Anatomy.

426
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Do you?

427
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah.

428
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Isn't it just a bunch of doctors having sex with each other or something?

429
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Pretty much.

430
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I like Desperate Housewives.

431
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
That's pretty funny.

432
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
That does sound pretty hot.

433
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
So Desperate Housewives is a pretty hot show.

434
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I have seen a little bit of it.

435
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,740
It's pretty hot.

436
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,940
But anyway, if you have to watch your Desperate Housewives,

437
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,340
your Grey's Anatomy, you don't have a TiVo.

438
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,740
You could always listen to the All Games Re broadcast, which

439
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,620
is Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

440
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,780
also a little bit earlier for you east coast folks.

441
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
And central.

442
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,340
And central, like Wisconsin, if you want to listen to it live.

443
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,940
But of course, podcast is love.

444
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,540
And we know there's lots of you guys

445
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,020
that listen to us on the podcast feed.

446
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,600
And for that, we're most appreciative.

447
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,420
Thanks a bunch.

448
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,480
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news now, and we're gonna start it off tonight

449
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,780
with a story about the Wii, and I might be in trouble for that previous bet I made about

450
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,940
how there's not gonna be 20 games at Wii launch.

451
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,540
Well, it doesn't look like there's gonna be 20 first-party Wii games, so I'm gonna have

452
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,140
to go back and listen to the bet for sure, but it does look like there are gonna be 27

453
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,260
Wii games that are released on the day the Wii is out, which of course is still unknown,

454
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,540
but we do have 27 confirmed titles.

455
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,220
Loki seems to think it's gonna be more than 27.

456
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,420
I think it's more than that.

457
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,060
Really?

458
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,300
Yeah, because I know some that aren't even on that list.

459
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,220
Do you want me to read this list real quick for you guys?

460
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,180
All right, here we go.

471
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,420
So now I ask you folks in studio, if you had to buy two of those games from that list,

472
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,780
have enough money to buy two of the games, which two are you getting at launch?

473
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
Loki?

474
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,020
Um, I've already got him on order.

475
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,940
Red Steel and...

476
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,740
You know, to be honest, there's actually...

477
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,740
Did you mention GT?

478
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,740
Yes.

479
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,740
GT Pro Series.

480
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,260
Uh, GT actually looks pretty good, so, uh, Red Steel and GT.

481
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
Alright.

482
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Uh, Dark Sakura.

483
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
You don't know?

484
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Okay.

485
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Anybody...

486
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Uh, do our other girls know?

487
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Magsy, which two are you gonna get?

488
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,500
Um, I am number one Nintendo fangirl in the world, so I'll be getting Zelda.

489
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,140
And then, uh, for the second one, um, Red Steel, I think.

490
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,760
Red Steel, you like swords? You like ninjas?

491
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,400
Uh, yeah. I just looked it over. Yeah.

492
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,100
Uh, Dark Sakura, you think you know?

493
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,200
Yeah, I'm gonna get, um, Zelda and, uh, Metal Slug Anthology.

494
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,720
Mmm.

495
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,820
Chris, do you think you know which two you'd get?

496
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,380
Uh, probably Zelda and...

497
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,580
Cars.

498
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,280
Hahahaha!

499
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,160
You dork. Uh, hahaha!

500
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,580
I would- I can tell you right n- well...

501
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,000
Alright, oh, which two would I get? Oh, I'm so glad you asked. I would get...

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,240
I'm gonna get, I'm actually...

503
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,160
I'm gonna get three.

504
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,040
No, I know, but in real life I'm gonna get three. Okay, but which two? I would say...

505
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,860
I'm gonna say Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Excite Truck.

506
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,320
And I don't know why I'm... I don't know why I'm leaving out Zelda, but I'm

507
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,200
gonna borrow yours.

508
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,720
Yeah, you're gonna... We can trade.

509
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,040
I come into your house and play in your Zelda. If we all get two then we can all

510
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,400
we can all play with each other. That's right, there we go. We'll play with each other.

511
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,680
Well, there's a couple things missing. First off, I mean, where's Super Mario Galaxy?

512
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,480
I noticed, but didn't Miyamoto say a while back that it may not be

513
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,840
exactly ready at launch? It'll be in the launch window and that's what these are anyways.

514
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,960
There's also a few that I mentioned a couple weeks ago, Rapala Trophies, which

515
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,080
is supposed to be coming out for your fishing

516
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,860
fans, I guess. And there was also a couple that I'm mentioning this week that aren't

517
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,840
on that list, and they're part of Midway's lineup. And of course, Midway, we announced

518
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,800
weeks ago, Rampage Soul Destruction, now everybody's finally picked up on that. Two more that are

519
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:58,700
going to be added, they're Happy Feet, which is based on that really crappy movie that's

520
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
coming out.

521
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
I've got Happy Feet.

522
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
I want to see that.

523
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
Any Happy Feet?

524
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,940
Can I take the controllers to my feet and then do tap dancing?

525
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
That'll be fun.

526
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
I don't know.

527
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,220
But then also the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy are going to be getting in the game

528
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,780
as well.

529
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,800
So those are going to be two coming from Midway, and there's a lot more.

530
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,020
They're announcing seven at Let's Big in a couple weeks here.

531
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,020
Oh, that's true.

532
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,460
So that's definitely not the fullest.

533
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,740
Now, Funny Dale says he's going to get a Barbie's Horse Adventure for the Wii when it comes

534
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
out.

535
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,240
Is that a launch game or no? I don't think they even announced

536
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,520
Well, hopefully that would be fun with the Wii

537
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
All right

538
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,040
Anyway, that's all I have to say on the Wii. Well the Wii yeah, you know go Wii

539
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,560
But anyways a few things that were you know, definitely speculating besides the launch date

540
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,640
IGN's got speculation on the release date and the price point for it

541
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Oh, hooray, more release date and price speculation, just what this show needed, because I was

542
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:07,360
just thinking this week, gosh, we really haven't had a story on release date or price point

543
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,260
speculation in the past week, so we really need one tonight.

544
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
Thank you, Loki.

545
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,820
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

546
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,820
You're welcome.

547
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,720
And, of course, their speculation is November 2nd or November 12th, because apparently their

548
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,180
sources can't make up their minds on which it is.

549
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,780
probably because no one knows yet because they've given them a, you know, have your

550
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,680
games ready by, you know, this time period and then we'll, you know, announce the date

551
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,220
then. I mean, they don't have to launch with the third party games, I mean, because if

552
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,580
they come a few weeks later it's not going to matter. Then the price point they've announced,

553
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,560
they said $229 is going to be the price point and that, well, I don't know where they pulled

554
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
that out of.

555
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,840
How about their ass?

556
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:57,400
You know, I think that every, I think that I have heard every single date in the fourth

557
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,720
quarter, uh, guessed for the, for the Wii launch at work because I work at GameStop.

558
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,520
I think that everybody's guessed every single date for Wii launch, like, it's gonna be sometime

559
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
in fourth quarter.

560
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Folks, I have a big world exclusive for you guys.

561
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Wii here at Orange Launch Radio, we are absolutely confident we know the release date of the

562
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,100
Wii, and I'm going to give it to you. We have inside sources that have told us the actual

563
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:32,880
release date of the Wii, so here it is. The Wii will be released soon. And when it comes

564
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,380
out soon, then you can say, I heard that first on Orange Lounge Radio, and they were right,

565
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,120
right on Orange Lounge Radio for guessing the release date of the Wii. It was indeed

566
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:50,960
soon. Well, I'm actually saying, I'm still sticking with October 18th, just because it's

567
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,800
the anniversary. And, you know, but people say, oh, they don't release their systems

568
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,980
on Wednesdays, they release them on Sundays. Who gives a fuck? Okay, honestly, I mean,

569
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,400
they can do whatever they want, they're Nintendo. They can say, you know what, bitches, we decided

570
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,100
to release our game, we're gonna release it on Wednesday because, you know what, fuck

571
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,100
It's not just a W, it's WE. And our new mascot is Wario.

572
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Waluigi.

573
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
It's WE Wednesdays.

574
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Yeah, Waluigi is a pun.

575
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
I don't know.

576
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:25,100
And demonstrating the WE live on stage will be Giggling Lesbians.

577
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Let's hear it. Yay!

578
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
I have to explain this. Waluigi is a pun.

579
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,100
I thought Wario was a pun.

580
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,100
It sort of is, but Waluigi is.

581
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,100
It would be sort of Wariweed, which is bad.

582
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Yeah, that's why I thought that Wario was the same thing, they're both the same.

583
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Last night!

584
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Okay, no responding to things that aren't said in mics.

585
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Sorry.

586
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
Because now they think it's something dirty that you're responding to.

587
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,100
And I'm trying, we got an explicit tag last week, so I'm trying to avoid it this week, please.

588
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Oh, that's not even going to happen.

589
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,100
The lesbians are keeping it pretty clean tonight.

590
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,100
They left the pillows at home, so I'm pretty excited.

591
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
We can wrap it for you.

592
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,500
maybe maybe during the afterbirth we'll see all right let's uh let's keep it

593
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:19,300
moving speaking of Wario and Waluigi and the beautiful cast of the various Mario

594
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:26,660
games there is going to be a Mario Strikers sequel on the Wii and we have a

595
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:34,700
Happy Megsy. Are you a fan of Mario Strikers? I loved Mario Strikers as a rule I'm not a

596
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:40,020
big fan of sports games unless they have the word Mario in the title, but I really, really

597
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,340
enjoyed Mario Strikers.

598
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,700
Do you think you'll like Wii Sports, though, because of Miyamoto's giant head as one of

599
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,820
the characters?

600
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,220
I really don't know.

601
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,720
I mean, I'm hoping that it'll be fun just because it's on the Wii and you actually get

602
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,420
to, like, do stuff as opposed to just pushing a button on a remote control and then whoever

603
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,460
throws the football.

604
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,260
video of me on YouTube that somebody took of playing Wii Sports and I look

605
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,660
like I'm not having any fun at all like it's the most depressing but I really

606
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,660
enjoyed the game and I was just exhausted from the day oh hi new story

607
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:27,000
sorry yes Rob dear God I don't worship you but I do adore you story sorry okay

608
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,480
Yeah, so um they actually were saying that Super Mario Strikers was supposed to the sequel is supposed to be one of the games

609
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,420
It was announced at the games convention in Germany

610
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,340
And this speculation is going to be like a you know an online multiplayer strikers

611
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,400
So that sounds like it's a pretty good deal, and now I'm done Rob. You can interrupt me

612
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:51,240
Well, I was gonna say this from Chad is that Ari Masson of the oil army thinks he has the new marketing campaign

613
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,160
for the Nintendo Wii. So here's this giant enemy lesbian and you attack

614
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,640
its weak point for massive pleasure. Massive pleasure because it's a lesbian.

615
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:12,200
I love our chat room. Hugs and kisses to the OLR chat. I will check out

616
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,240
Super Mario Strikers on the Wii. It would be fun, I bet. You gonna check out mine?

617
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,560
Why not?

618
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,920
Because it's stupid.

619
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,080
The original game was stupid, and this one

620
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,680
will be equally as stupid.

621
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,800
Maisie's going to punch you.

622
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,120
All right, how about a Squeenix story

623
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,160
to break up the hate a little bit here in the room?

624
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,760
Squeenix are what we like to call Square Enix.

625
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,520
We call them Squeenix because a lot of their games make us Sque.

626
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,280
And what's going on there is that Yoichi Wada, who

627
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,800
is the president of Square, spoke recently

628
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,320
about what game creators need to do for next-gen platforms and how developers

629
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,640
will have to work together

630
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,840
to move the industry forward. There's a quote here,

631
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,040
this is one of the reasons Square Enix will collaborate with Taito, a company

632
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,760
that produces

633
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,280
physical hardware, he said. In our talks with Taito, ideas for an actual physical

634
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,400
product have come up.

635
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,320
In any case, we will be releasing some thing. It's interesting

636
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,920
in that it's not the sort of thing you would expect from Square Enix.

637
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,360
So they're talking about releasing a thing.

638
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:20,240
Like a hardware thing and I'm not talking about that sword from Dragon Quest back

639
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,880
Yeah, is this game console? What is this?

640
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:30,520
It's gonna be a games a game that does not have the word final or fantasy and it's a trans vibrator

641
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,240
No, what do you do you think maybe it's a I think maybe something they might do is maybe a dedicated

642
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,480
Like you remember those old like Game & Watch type games like maybe something like that, but a little more souped up, but a square

643
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,720
franchise or product maybe something like a game a standalone game plug-and-play

644
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,920
type whatever it is I'm sure it's gonna be another sequel to Final Fantasy 7 do

645
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:01,040
you think it's a console no no too crowded too crowded and now you just

646
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,720
don't see Square Enix getting into console although you know in Japan they

647
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,120
might do really well with the console now it's going to be a Final Fantasy 7

648
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,120
and then U.V. hits puberty or something.

649
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Alright, alright.

650
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,120
It's gonna be okay.

651
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I like Meg's idea.

652
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
It's gonna have Aerith as a zombie,

653
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
and you have to go around and shoot her.

654
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,120
Again and again and again.

655
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
And she keeps coming back.

656
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
And you just keep killing her.

657
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,120
She's the holy zombie.

658
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
Fire Resurrected sent me a private message,

659
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
and of course I read those publicly.

660
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,120
I'm not encouraging you to send me private messages, please.

661
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I get inundated with them during the show,

662
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,220
I thought this comment was good.

663
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,500
Squeenix is releasing an arcade machine.

664
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,340
Taito makes arcade machines.

665
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,300
That's a good thought.

666
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,020
What, we have Puzzle Bobble featuring Cloud?

667
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,740
I like this idea from Fire Bulma.

668
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,020
I loved Urgeyes.

669
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,460
How about Urgeyes in the arcades?

670
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,860
Or Final Fantasy.

671
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,580
So it was an arcade game first.

672
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:59,940
Final Fantasy 13 versus in the arcades.

673
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,460
OK, OK.

674
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,100
I used to go play at the bowling alley.

675
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,900
I used to play DDR.

676
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,980
They had an Urgeyes machine there in a virtual lawn.

677
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,660
I live there.

678
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,340
Anyways, speaking of stuff, I don't know, it's kind of funny.

679
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,260
There's another person out there making something very interesting.

680
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,740
So apparently some fan on the internet decided they want their Madden

681
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,420
holiday

682
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,460
to be coming a little bit early. So they've put out this fake Madden coupon.

683
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,700
The preferred customer coupon that's basically supposed to get you the game

684
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,900
when they get it, which is, you know, most of the retail stores are getting it a week

685
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:42,300
early, so that they can get it before street date, and it's hilarious because, okay, we

686
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,580
got this email first from EA, so they're very aware of it, and they've made all the retail

687
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,340
chains very aware of this, so it's not gonna work, and you're an idiot.

688
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,420
You know what, I have to, so somebody made a fake coupon that says you get Madden early

689
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
because you're special.

690
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:04,180
preferred customer early release voucher says xbox 360 xbox playstation 2 and gamecube versions

691
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,760
available at all at participating stores only it says basically entitles you um to getting

692
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
the game

693
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
i think

694
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
there's the keyword

695
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
dude you sit down

696
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,480
no i don't yeah you went wait sorry

697
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,080
participating stores only

698
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,520
some you know what i

699
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,800
you still have to participate

700
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,520
i still think there's gonna be some employee at a walmart target kmart type store that's

701
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,540
gonna fall for this or GameStop says maybe. Okay fine they'll go ahead and scan in said

702
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:37,540
coupon or not you know of it. They don't have to sell it to this guy. I mean but it's whatever

703
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:43,460
I mean fine. Go ahead and try to get your free Madden game early. It's Madden come on

704
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,940
it's not that different from last year so if you're really in a hurry to get it go right

705
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,180
ahead. Actually my understanding is the Madden fans were pretty disappointed with Madden

706
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,960
06 on the 360 so they're really looking forward to Madden 07. Yeah because something else

707
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,080
is better than something crappy I guess whatever but alright good luck oh and by the way it

708
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:11,460
says they forgot to run the coupon through spell checker because they you know misspelled

709
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:20,140
include its includes good job good job forgers speaking of EA and upcoming releases spore

710
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,660
you might need a coupon to get this early because apparently 2007 and we're not talking

711
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,820
early 2007 but more like this excuse me I got the hiccup suddenly the second

712
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:36,540
half of 2007 is when you're going to be getting spore this game seems to be

713
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,340
getting pushed back and back I originally remember this is going to be

714
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,020
late 2006 but now it looks like February or mid-2007 at least online game

715
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,420
retailers gamestop.com and EBgames.com have that list. Will Wright seemed to

716
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:55,980
say that it's not going to make it until July 2007 quote we're saying the second

717
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,140
half of next year 2007 for now wow so this game is really getting pushed back

718
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:07,740
but if the game looks like a ditty this game is epic it's like Sims times five I

719
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,980
mean it's it's just freaking huge this game it will be it's gonna be something

720
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,540
else if for nothing else than to throw aliens from your tractor beam in the

721
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,300
ship that was a lot of fun but we do know some games that will be coming out

722
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,780
and just and I'll go ahead and make this mention now since I'm not gonna be on

723
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,220
the show next week. I'm going to go ahead and do the next two weeks of European

724
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:31,140
release dates. How's that sound? Especially since there's all of crap

725
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:39,220
coming out this week. On the 18th we have Pathologic, Premier Manager 2006-2007,

726
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:46,180
ProShirt Golf blah blah blah, Specnaz, Project Wolf, Spinout on PSP. On the 23rd

727
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,400
we have Texas Hold'em, 25th a bunch of good stuff, Dig Dug, Digging Strike, El

728
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,560
El Matador, Madden 2007, Yay, Para World, and Reservoir Dogs.

729
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
And also Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, and World War 1 Aces of the Sky.

730
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,520
These are all European releases.

731
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,840
Excellent.

732
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,360
As far as releases go for this week, it's definitely going to be a lot better than last

733
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
week, but not by much.

734
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:17,720
You've got Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service on the Playstation 2, of course 99 Nights

735
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,640
on the Xbox 360.

736
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm excited about that one. On the DS you're getting Deep Labyrinth from Atlas

737
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,880
and Freedom Wings

738
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,000
which is kind of like a, almost like a pilot wings shooter type game. Sounds like

739
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,800
something I'd find in the women's sanitation aisle at the store or sanitary

740
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
things.

741
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,500
Let's see here.

742
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,440
The ever-generic World Racing 2 on the Xbox and Zonide on the Xbox which is

743
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,080
good for those Hikaruuka fans out there. Of course next week we have Madden NFL 07 coming

744
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:58,080
out as well as Pac-Man World Rally and doing a re-release of Zoo and Zookeeper on DS. Why?

745
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,960
I don't know why. You can play Zookeeper online, it's called Bejeweled. And Rapala trophies

746
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,960
on the PSP. But while I'm talking, I figured I would go over all those release dates that

747
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,060
all those release dates that seem to make the press headlines, you know, later on that

748
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:21,520
we've always mentioned, but for some reason, you know, get people else, you know, pay attention

749
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,600
to other places. But, let's go on to the PSP Oblivion, which we have coming out on March

750
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:34,320
15th, so that'll be coming. Definitely have a SKU for it. Of course, some of the other

751
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:40,360
ones I thought were interesting, Bioshock and Darkness are both coming out on April

752
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:47,360
5th, so check those out. And then some of my favorites of course would be the Konami

753
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,160
Games and I'm sure you're going to hear more of this coming pretty soon, but DDR

754
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,320
Universe is scheduled for December 2nd, so that should be pretty good. And Karaoke Revolution

755
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,000
American Idol. That's a big pushback for Universe, isn't it? Because I remember Universe

756
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,900
was originally scheduled earlier. And Karaoke Revolution American Idol is going to be coming

757
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,680
out looks like December 6th.

758
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,000
Also Ultramix 4, that's going to be coming out November 15th and what's really interesting

759
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,920
about it is the price for the actual game by itself, only $29.99.

760
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,720
So that's pretty good.

761
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,600
Another thing I was going to mention because we're going to be talking about game prices

762
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,200
later on, some cheap games and stuff.

763
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,120
One game that is out there that's probably the cheapest 360 game you're going to find

764
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,320
and this just dropped in price, you heard it here first.

765
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:41,940
Ridge Racer 6, $19.99, you can find it now at, you know, all participating real tellers

766
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
out there.

767
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,220
So, $19.99, and to be honest, that game is not a bad game, but for some reason, the worst

768
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,160
selling game in the United States for the 360s, so.

769
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Go check it out.

770
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
That's really strange because it's a fun game.

771
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,920
Isn't it the best seller in Japan?

772
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,960
Yeah, it's polar opposites.

773
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
It's just to show the difference in markets.

774
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Wow.

775
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,880
But, you know, speaking of other markets, though, there is a bit of news about Bully

776
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
in Europe.

777
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,360
you're saying that it's going to hit in October as well as I'm here Rockstar was

778
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,020
saying the October release date was going to apply to Europe as well as the

779
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,800
US the British Board of Film Classification said that they were

780
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,600
having issues with the the title saying but they said it wasn't anywhere near

781
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:27,960
ready however Rockstar saying it's hmm on its way

782
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,240
cool that's pretty interesting lots of guys I've been looking forward to bully

783
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,480
after seeing the trailer this week. The trailer looks good.

784
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,960
I haven't watched it yet. Megsy, I see you nodding your head. What's exciting you about

785
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,720
the game Bully?

786
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,960
Um, okay, so when I was a kid in school, I was a bully.

787
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,880
You were the bully. I was the bully. Okay. And so I'm looking forward to that game

788
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,200
and reliving my days

789
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,080
as a evil bully in a Catholic school. Wait, I thought it was the other way around, that you beat up the

790
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,600
bullies.

791
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:00,160
Oh, I thought it was that you are the bully. Maybe, see, I think in a good game you get to play

792
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,240
both ends of it.

793
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
Alright.

794
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,860
Loki, settle this, because you've been following this game more than I have.

795
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,320
Are you the bully or are you the person beating up the bully?

796
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,940
I think you're the person, you're just kind of a kid there and you're being bullied, and

797
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,260
I think you might also be the bully.

798
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,800
You're kind of like this kid that's just trouble, but it's like, you're trouble, but you've

799
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,920
gotten introduced to this, you know, basically kind of like a private school, so you're no

800
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,540
longer you know the big one on campus you know you're kind of you know getting

801
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,600
bullied so you are bullied but you're also getting bullied at the same time

802
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,720
it's basically school mayhem and that kind of stuff either way it's violence

803
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,800
it's violence and it makes Jack Thompson angry so how can you go wrong it has

804
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,120
schoolgirls making out with people so that's awesome which makes our lesbians

805
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:55,360
in house very happy happy Catholic schoolgirls in those cute little outfits

806
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:01,000
those are hot. Little skirts. I just bought a DVD that has those in them. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

807
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:11,400
Whoa! Hello! Where have you been shopping lately? Castro Street. Okay. Well, moving

808
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,840
right along. Let's talk about Xbox Live Arcade. Now, Major Nelson's blog is

809
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,440
saying that the Xbox Live Wednesday thing was over with the release of

810
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,640
Pac-Man this week, which by the way I forgot to mention I did download and

811
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,860
play this week. It's Pac-Man. You know what you're getting into. If you haven't played

812
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,900
Pac-Man yet, I don't think you're really a gamer if you haven't played Pac-Man at some

813
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,940
point in your life. So you know what to expect from the Xbox version of Pac-Man. There's

814
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,020
not a lot of frills. Sure, you get achievements, but Pac-Man is Pac-Man. But anyway, Major

815
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,460
Nelson says that's it. No more. But the official Xbox magazine seems to be begging to differ

816
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,060
a little bit. They have a release schedule, which includes August 16th, Texas Hold'em,

817
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,580
August 23rd, Time Pilot, which Jamie was on the ColecoVision at one point, hence why

818
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:06,780
you saw that, August 30th, Scramble, and September 6th, Luminous Live, and that's the one I'm

819
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,300
sure a lot of folks are looking forward to there. Time Pilot and Scramble, by the way,

820
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,460
are old-ass Konami games, if you've never heard of them. I like Time Pilot. I actually

821
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,380
played a Time Pilot arcade machine back in the day, and I wasn't half bad at it.

822
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,340
And for those who may remember, Nick Arcade Time Pilot was one of the games that they

823
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,560
did play on the show.

824
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
Was it really?

825
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,560
Yes.

826
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,560
That's awesome.

827
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,060
It was one of the games they played frequently on the show.

828
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,060
That's great.

829
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,060
Alright.

830
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:36,060
Well, we've got a little bit more news though as far as other old school stuff coming out.

831
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,060
Oh yes?

832
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:42,060
There's the Sega Genesis Collection for the Playstation 2 and PSP, a 30 game pack that

833
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
will be out.

834
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:51,100
um some of the games that are excuse me but there are some of the games to

835
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:56,280
mention was a sonnet the hedgehog shinobi fantasy star golden axe vector

836
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,320
man sword of vermilion comic zone Alex Kidd and rice star was another one

837
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,880
mentioned but those are all games that I'm all over does it sound like

838
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,320
something you're gonna get oh hell yeah as long as I have Alex Kidd and shinobi

839
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,320
I'll be really happy because it's actually I mean true that wasn't necessarily a Genesis game

840
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,340
It was my favorite Master System game and that started the whole Alex Kidd thing for me

841
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,360
Very cool

842
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,100
Does this sound like is this collection sound like something you want to pick up Loki?

843
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,400
Maybe not for me because honestly and

844
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,880
Most of them are already available on game tap and I agree that you know

845
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,680
You can there's a certain charm being able to have this stuff on the go like on the PSP and stuff

846
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:44,800
Which seems to me like maybe a response to all the emulation scene, you know, all the emulators have been going on on the PSP

847
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,040
Maybe this is a response to that

848
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,040
I mean honestly if it was gonna if I was gonna go by that standpoint

849
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,960
There wouldn't be any point because almost all of these games I own Genesis cartridges of

850
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,120
true so

851
00:46:55,120 --> 00:47:00,920
But at the same time it's convenient to have them on one disc so I can sit down with my controller in front of my

852
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,920
TV and play them instead of sit in front of my computer if I'm gonna sit in front of my computer and play a game

853
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
I'm gonna be on Warcraft

854
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,060
So, we'll

855
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:15,300
keep it moving here. I want to do a comment here in our chat room.

856
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,180
NintendoManiac64 says, Sega doesn't seem to realize that a lot of the gamers

857
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,180
in the Sega stuff have Gamecubes.

858
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,260
So, seeming to think that, you know, most of the Sega fans were actually in the

859
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:26,860
Gamecubes.

860
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,460
Yeah, that's true. Possibly, but you know what?

861
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,100
The Wii and the Virtual Console thing, I think, will take care of most of the Sega

862
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,540
fans

863
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,620
stuff on there. So, it should be a problem.

864
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:44,460
Well, I want to go to this story about Japan, a kind of a very random tangent here, talking

865
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,340
about arcade longevity over in Japan.

866
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,820
There was this in-depth article that ran on MSNBC, the Newsweek section of MSNBC.

867
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,620
It was an article, just a column that's talking about Japan's arcades, and this guy kind of

868
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,800
sets up the scene here in his article and says, quote, welcome to the arcades of Tokyo.

869
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,880
In Asia and particularly Japan, video game rooms not only live but thrive.

870
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,900
There are 9,500 arcades in the country, with more than 445,000 game machines made by Japanese

871
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,780
companies like Namco and Capcom.

872
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,400
In the U.S., of course, the story is much different.

873
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,980
Arcades are a rapidly dying breed, with only about 3,000 in operation, down from 10,000

874
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,980
a decade ago.

875
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,820
Though the popularity of home video systems like the PlayStation contributed to the decline,

876
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,100
Akagi says that execs at U.S. companies like Midway and Atari simply couldn't see the future

877
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,740
in arcades and abandoned the coin-op business.

878
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,740
And the article kind of goes on to make the speculation that what happened over in Japan

879
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:44,260
as opposed to here is that here most of the kids who used to go to arcades grew up and

880
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,220
moved into home console gaming, but in Japan most of the kids that played arcades have

881
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:53,140
grown up still going to arcades and still in that whole scene.

882
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:59,300
Now I know that Orange Lounge Radio was sort of born of an arcade thing, you know, we all

883
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,220
met playing DDR, which was a big arcade phenomenon at the time, I'm curious what you guys think

884
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,940
about this story about arcades in Japan versus US.

885
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,380
I'm going to guess that the arcades in Japan probably are better maintained than the arcades

886
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,540
in the United States.

887
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,900
You think so?

888
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,900
Why is it?

889
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,180
Why is that?

890
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:23,060
Maybe because, I don't know, the American arcades out there, they just pretty much have

891
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,580
them just to kind of fill space it seems like.

892
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:29,460
You know, like at movie theaters, something to kill time for the little kids, you know,

893
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,940
out of mommy and daddy's, you know, hair, um, or like a, you know, sun splash or something,

894
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,100
you know, just to kill time while you're waiting for water slides or something like that.

895
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,100
Birthday central.

896
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,820
Birthdays, yeah. But, um, they just let the machines go to crap, so.

897
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:48,900
I think there's also this, uh, little thing, you know, I think it especially applies to

898
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,220
America in general, where they think you hit a certain age, you grow up, you don't do this

899
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,500
anymore. In your home you can play your video game, but you don't go out, you know, as an

900
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,340
adult and play DDR in which I of course I beg to differ with of course but

901
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,500
there's still that it's still sort of taboo you know you're supposed to be

902
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,700
grown up that's true because I know it's even when we were playing DDR we used to

903
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,740
get a lot of funny stairs like what are those guys doing shouldn't they you know

904
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:26,260
be accounting or something that's okay and not in a good way I hate that I

905
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,220
I mean, I really hate that. People who don't know any better, they go,

906
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,720
DDR so gay! It's like, so what if it has flashing pink lights and, you know, Madonna

907
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,660
music? I mean,

908
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,860
it's something everybody can have fun with, right?

909
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,540
Yeah. But it's still, though, I think it's just a whole matter of attitude, you know.

910
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,380
There's, you know, 40-year-old businessmen in Japan get off work and go play

911
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,420
DDR or pop music or something. And they're not gay.

912
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,780
No. Well, we don't know that. Well, they might be. Some might be.

913
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,780
Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. So what if they're gay?

914
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,100
Magsy, you have a thought on this?

915
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,900
Do you have a thought on this? Sorry, I thought you, I see you with the mics. I thought, do you, are you an arcade gamer?

916
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
Um, somewhat.

917
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,520
If there is an arcade, I will play in it.

918
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,740
Have you ever been to an arcade in Japan? Yes, I have. Ooh, what'd you, what was it like when you were there?

919
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,740
Um, well, I was only there for a little bit because we, our train was leaving, but it was, it was very well kept,

920
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,420
from what I remember. Maybe that's the difference. The difference is, in Japan

921
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,220
they play Beatmania. In the United States they beat their spouse.

922
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,900
Wow.

923
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,020
Your logic is infallible. Exactly.

924
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,260
I'm awesome. That's all we need to know. By infallible I mean not really.

925
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:44,940
Speaking of couples not getting along here, one couple,

926
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,620
the E3 little guys and the ESA, you know those wonderful Kencha Hall exhibitors, they're

927
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:55,340
not really getting along too well with the ESA.

928
00:51:55,340 --> 00:52:01,500
And actually the ESA sent out some letters to these small Kencha Hall people kind of

929
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,780
informing them of what's going on with E3 next year.

930
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:12,100
And basically they said, as you may have read in the press releases, the E3 Expo has officially

931
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:18,700
been canceled, and it's involving and matured over the last 12 years, and now the needs

932
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,360
of the exhibitors and the key attendees has also changed.

933
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,320
And you know, it should also say in fine print, by the way, you're not a key attendee because

934
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,160
you do not have a booth in the bigger hall.

935
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,120
So fuck you.

936
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:34,960
So the ESA essentially wrote these people a letter that says, k thanks, bye.

937
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
It's basically, it's this, we would like to-

938
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Brad, my team was hanging out in Kencha Hall.

939
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,520
It's basically like this.

940
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,000
It's like, dear people from Kensha Hall, it's not you, it's us.

941
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,720
You know, we want to see other people.

942
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:58,760
You know, maybe we could be friends, just, you know, some days, some days, Kensha Hall,

943
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:04,580
I just want to cuddle, but you guys are so demanding.

944
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:10,100
You have to understand that, you know, my life is moving on and I need to move on too,

945
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,100
so...

946
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,860
We just need some distance.

947
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:18,660
We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere, profound gratitude for

948
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,460
your past support of this event.

949
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,580
It has been exciting and rewarding to see the growth and significance of this industry

950
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,920
mirrored on the exhibit floor of the E3 Expo through the years.

951
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,660
We look forward to many years of industry growth and viability and opportunity without

952
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,660
you.

953
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:40,660
basically added it there, at the end there, but not really, not really, but that'd be

954
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,660
funny.

955
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,380
And, Jamie, the Red Octane, I mean, with all due respect to Red Octane and the guitar users,

956
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,460
it's a fluke.

957
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,780
Nobody expected Guitar Hero to do as well as it did.

958
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:53,340
Them being there, you know, it was a fluke.

959
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,500
Actually, I expected it to do well.

960
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,980
But I'm talking about, you know, we're different because we've always loved, you know, we're

961
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,900
different, we're special, but I'm talking about like the mainstream folks.

962
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,580
You know, nobody would have thought Guitar Hero would have done as well as it really

963
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:10,800
did until people actually played it and found out, wow, it's actually kind of fun.

964
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,600
So I think the whole Red Octane is a fluke, and I think had there been an E3 next year,

965
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,260
Red Octane would have graduated to the big hall.

966
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,260
I have to laugh.

967
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,220
You get to go to the big boy chair, Red Octane!

968
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,860
No, I had to laugh.

969
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:27,460
I went to Fry's this week, you know, the electronics store that we have over here, which is giant,

970
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,180
and I was watching this woman watch her son play Guitar Hero, and she kept yelling at

971
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,980
She's like, it's almost like watching someone play DDR instead of saying, you know, left,

972
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,980
left, right, left.

973
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,620
She's all, green, green, green, red, you know, it's like, it's not helping.

974
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
Wow.

975
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,900
I can see that it's green.

976
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:54,500
Well, the ESA has some good news coming their way and it has to do with the state of Illinois

977
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,540
is being told to pay the ESA

978
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,740
a half a million dollars for messing up

979
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:05,260
big time. Basically what happened is that

980
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:10,640
it's not just half a million, it's $510,528.64

981
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,580
and the reason why they have to do it is because they did an

982
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:18,880
unconstitutional effort to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games

983
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,540
and essentially you know legal fees blah blah blah

984
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:28,400
it adds up.

985
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,500
If controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in promoting the positive

986
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,700
psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly accorded

987
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,460
to parents and families, not the state.

988
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,140
That coming from Judge Matthew F. Kenley.

989
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,140
Good for him.

990
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,620
Hopefully this will set a precedent.

991
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:52,020
We've had these in Minnesota and these other states trying to pass the same thing.

992
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,020
In Wisconsin?

993
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:58,740
Yeah, this needs to really be a shining example to them of what's going to happen when they

994
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,740
try to violate our rights.

995
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:05,740
And of course, the ESA had a field day, quote, Judge Kennelly's ruling sent two irrefutable

996
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,740
messages.

997
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,340
Not only are efforts to ban the sale of violent video games clearly unconstitutional, they

998
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,180
are a waste of taxpayer dollars.

999
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,180
Excellent.

1000
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,420
So the taxpayers not only get to pay for them to...

1001
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,420
Yep.

1002
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:22,100
The sad fact is that the state of Illinois knew this law was unconstitutional from the

1003
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,460
beginning taxpayers have a right to know that over half a million of their

1004
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,620
dollars and countless government hours were thrown away in this fruitless

1005
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:32,220
effort probably more than half a million dollars because you know to actually

1006
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,300
propose this bill and stuff you know all those luncheons that they have to hold

1007
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,380
and there are the past this stuff and the lobbyists of course

1008
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,740
magazine Mac man in our chat room is also from Wisconsin it says Wisconsin

1009
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,500
sucks I live there do you do you agree Maisie I see you're nodding your head

1010
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,060
you agree Wisconsin sucks yeah it does not it not a place for gamers no no

1011
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,260

1013
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,980
hit on by girls at the GameStop no okay so if we have any you know girls who

1014
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,220

1015
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:19,340

1016
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:26,180

1017

we dark Sakura oh hell yes and what happens when we get angsty people die

1018
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:44,220
so let's bring on the F use of the weak dark Sakura my F you of the week goes

1019
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:51,980
toward the sun the bright shining orb in the sky for leeching all of my energy

1020
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:57,660
burning my chest my poor boots are burnt and making me really sleepy to where I

1021
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,340
almost fell asleep on the road five times fuck you son

1022
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:08,340
Loki my a few goes to people that are extremely rude when it comes to parking

1023
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,380
their cars or not being able to park in their spaces we have this guy today when

1024
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:23,540
I was going to get my smoothie and why is that funny cuz I can't have a smoothie shall

1025
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:33,700
I explain smoothie amongst us is a euphemism for lesbian sex it's a big cup of smoothie

1026
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:41,920
then and I suddenly I want nothing but frappuccinos for the rest of my life why what's a frappuccino

1027
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,200
mean now it's like a sex oh okay well i'll take i'll take plenty of frappuccino thank you i need

1028
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,080
actually it's been a while since i've had a frappuccino oh loki sorry anyways um so there's

1029
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:58,160
some jackass that was sitting there his car had both of the doors open wide open and the guy wasn't

1030
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,760
nowhere to be seen in his car he was just sitting down enjoying you know a coffee or something in

1031
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,640
front of starbucks that happens to be next door but i don't know it's just really fucking rude

1032
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,960
when people you know park their cars especially with the doors open or especially over the line

1033
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,600
you get those wonderful suvs they're like my car is too big for one space so i'm gonna park in two

1034
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:23,360
compact spaces but your car's not compact so you shouldn't be you know parking in one compact space

1035
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:31,440
let alone both of them um is that it that's it my fu of the week would have to go towards sangria

1036
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:38,240
for having some type of un like unexplainable control over me because i drank a lot of it on

1037
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,840
Thursday, and I drank a lot of it on Friday. And I'm typically not a lush, but sangria

1038
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,720
makes me want to be, because it's really yummy. But if you're under 21, you shouldn't drink

1039
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,440
sangria. That's not good. Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to get out?

1040
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:01,920
I do, actually. I think it's on. Is it on? Yeah. Okay. My FU goes to homeless people

1041
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,360
in San Francisco, and I don't mean all of them. We went to the Castro district today,

1042
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,640
Which for those of you who do not know is the gay and lesbian district of San Francisco, and we're walking by

1043
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,480
There's a homeless guy

1044
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,480
Just relaxing on the side of the street where everybody and their mother were walking and his penis was just hanging

1045
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Give me a dollar

1046
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:35,560
He was just laying there, just hanging out. It wasn't even impressive either, I mean, there was a store right next to us with a big dog.

1047
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Wait, so he's just lying, I assume this is Market Street, or what is this? Oh, Castro.

1048
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:47,560
So he's just, well, I mean, okay, having someone's cock hanging out in the middle of Castro Street is not that uncommon, I hate to tell you.

1049
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,560
But it wasn't impressive.

1050
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,560
Okay, I see.

1051
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:55,560
I want an impressive cock when I go down, or Castro, serious.

1052
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:59,560
Alright, uh, Megsy, do you have any interviews of the week you'd like to get out?

1053
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:06,560
Yes, I do. I've got one, uh, me and Chris went up to, uh, Santa Cruz and went to...

1054
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,560
Oh, yeah.

1055
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:14,560
And went to the boardwalk, uh, and we were sitting on the beach, um, drawing stick figure porn in the sand.

1056
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:21,560
And, um, we looked over and we were commenting on how there are some people who should just not wear bathing suits.

1057
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,560
Um, mostly old guys.

1058
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,680
Oh, wearing like the Speedo suits? It gets better, hold on.

1059
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,680
Uh oh. So just as we were saying that, we look over and there's this

1060
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,740
old guy. He's like, he's gotta be like

1061
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,240
late 40s, early 50s.

1062
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,360
He's dark tan. He's dark tan.

1063
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,000
Balding. All hairy. He's all hairy.

1064
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,560
He's got like the bling bling.

1065
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,520
And so he's got this towel around him and I'm just like, oh my god, there's one of them.

1066
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,840
and when he takes the towel off he has

1067
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,480
a bright red Speedo with the Brazilian wax

1068
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,560
yeah yeah yeah we were looking and trying to determine if he was waxed or not

1069
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,960
we couldn't see we were kind of far away but

1070
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,200
I think he was

1071
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,680
and it gets better, wait, one more

1072
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,920
then not only did this guy have the audacity to go out of the house but also

1073
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,840
wear a bright red Speedo on the beach

1074
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:27,600
Uh, his girlfriend or his wife or something started taking pictures of him and he started posing for these pictures

1075
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,680
And adjusting himself

1076
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:37,360
And I am not making this up. I am not exaggerating at all. We have pictures. It's called pokemon snap

1077
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,560
Wow

1078
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,880
You know in other countries

1079
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,200
It's okay to wear speedo on the beach and a lot of times the people wearing them pretty hot like, you know

1080
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,680
I've seen pictures on the internet, you know, this guy was not hot. I know I

1081
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
Thought he was I see

1082
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,560
That's unfortunate

1083
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,620
Now we better get back into games or we're gonna get those angry emails, you know in those

1084
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:09,120
Happy stuff orange lounge radio. They never talk about games. They talk about guys and speedos

1085
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,700
Yeah, I hate orange. I hate you dark Sakura. Yeah, you're so mean

1086
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,640
You know what fuck a whole bunch of them and not in a good way

01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:58,460
Destiny Soldier, PC, Pac-Man World Rally, Mage Knight Apocalypse, Warhammer, Mark of

1117
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:04,600
Chaos, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron, and Hellgate London to be determined.

1118
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:10,340
I like in our chat room, I agree with this comment by Blackboy, Dot Hack Volume 1, yay.

1119
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,820
I played a little bit of that at A3, it was fun.

1120
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,280
I like the old Dot Hack games, they're fun.

1121
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,280
Good times.

1122
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,140
I like the cartoon anime, excuse me.

1123
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,140
It's fun.

1124
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,140
I haven't seen a whole lot of it, but it's fun.

1125
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:25,800
Have I ever had the chat about you know I don't really watch anime

1126
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,740
even though I know like a lot of our fans are really into it because the DDR

1127
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,020
connection and what have you I'm just I'm not really that into it

1128
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,340
it's okay but I'm just, I don't know. I go to an anime convention and I go

1129
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:39,060
these people look like they're having fun which is cool and all but I just I don't

1130
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:42,820
I don't get it. Cosplay. Oh well. Cosplay. Cosplay's

1131
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,620
cute I guess sometimes but sometimes it's also very ugly. Do you? What do you cosplay as?

1132
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,660
Wait, Maisie's telling us about her cosplay.

1133
01:06:50,660 --> 01:07:04,660
Um, let's see, I cosplayed as Belle Dandy from Oh My Goddess, uh, I cosplayed- I did, like, a girl version of Vash the Stampede from Trigun, uh, let's see, what else did I do?

1134
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,660
Have you ever done Lulu? Because lesbian Lulus are awesome from Final Fantasy X.

1135
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,660
You know, I was gonna do a Lulu.

1136
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:18,660
Ooh, that's hot. I might turn for that, we'll see. Alright, uh, anyway, uh, well let's keep it moving.

1137
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:25,200
Anywho, Sony's actually unveiled a brand new

1138
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,240
portable media player, as if they need another one,

1139
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,780
called the Mylo, not Mylo notice,

1140
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:35,660
but Mylo, M-Y-L-O. And basically

1141
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:38,900
it stands for My Life Online

1142
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,980
and it's gonna be also able to use

1143
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:47,060
Skype, Google, and Yahoo Chats. So that's kinda neat.

1144
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:53,060
It's scheduled to release in September, and it's supposed to retail for about $350.

1145
01:07:53,060 --> 01:08:04,060
It has a 940 megabytes of RAM, as well as able to play most of the current music formats,

1146
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:14,060
and also has a slide down QWERTY keyboard, unlike the PSP bastards, and a 2.4 inch screen.

1147
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,060
So, awfully tiny.

1148
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:21,620
but yeah so that's kinda interesting I guess they're trying to compete with

1149
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,180
the Zune or something like that

1150
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,660
but I don't know why don't you just get Blackberry

1151
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,540
seriously okay

1152
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:37,100
well you know more bad news for Sony honestly

1153
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,380
there's this blogger and you probably have seen this around the internet it's

1154
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:40,860
gotten

1155
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:44,140
dug in a lot of places just for the sheer irony of it

1156
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:49,140
It's this editor for the official PlayStation Magazine. Her name is Dana

1157
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,900
Jay, and she wrote this thing on her 1UP blog

1158
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:58,220
about how she plans on buying an Xbox 360 this November, even though she

1159
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:00,220
works for the official PlayStation Magazine.

1160
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,380
Basically saying that when they announced that the price would be $600,

1161
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,860
she found her enthusiasm sagging. Here's a quote.

1162
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:12,780
It's not that I find the concept of a $600 console insulting. Inflation happens

1163
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:16,780
and it's natural that, eventually, initial prices will be higher than they used to be.

1164
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:21,520
But when I know that a console's direct competitors cost two-thirds or half that price, it becomes

1165
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,500
harder for me to justify shelling out that kind of money, especially when I can probably

1166
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:29,860
get the Wii and the 360 combined for the cost of a PlayStation 3.

1167
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:34,780
It goes on to say, there are very few big titles that are PS3 exclusive.

1168
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:38,940
GTA IV and Assassins will be available for the 360 at the same time, and most of the

1169
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:43,060
big guns Final Fantasy 13 Metal Gear Solid 4 won't be hitting for quite some

1170
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:48,140
time after the launch that's kind of a big ouch but people seem to love that

1171
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:53,300
story because of the irony I don't know what it is but whatever what do you guys

1172
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:58,460
think is that just more pouring salt in the wounds of Sony or what they deserve

1173
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:04,940
them you think what you're really you're really against ps3 um yeah why um well I

1174
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:11,020
have my theories about ps3 but it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's worth the $600 price tag

1175
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:16,700
at all um and plus i kind of have a little vendetta against sony oh i want to hear about

1176
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:23,820
this what's the vendetta against sony um is just um well okay i'll i'll tell you the truth is that

1177
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:29,740
i get a lot of stupid sony fanboys in my store i want to hear about sony fanboys no you don't

1178
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:32,740
What do they do? What makes them stupid?

1179
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,740
Because they'll say stuff...

1180
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,740
Oh, sorry.

1181
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:41,740
They'll say stuff, they'll come in and tell me how great PS3 is gonna be,

1182
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,740
and I'll say, well, I'm not really looking forward to it.

1183
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,740
There's nothing I really like on it.

1184
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:48,740
And they'll try to convince me why I should get a PS3,

1185
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:52,740
and I'm looking at this guy saying, dude, I work in the freaking store.

1186
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,740
I think I know what I want.

1187
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,740
Well, I'm wearing probably this Mario shirt, you know,

1188
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,740
saying I want to get a Wii, not a PS3.

1189
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:03,580
I mean, I like my PS2. It's got cool RPGs on it, but for the most part, I don't like

1190
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:07,060
Sony.

1191
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:13,400
After having played PS3 games, you are 100% correct. They are crap.

1192
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:18,500
It's hard, because you make a good point at the end. You love the PlayStation 2, and I

1193
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,460
love the PlayStation 2. I think we all love the PlayStation 2, and I think that's why

1194
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:26,620
we all look at the PlayStation 3 and go, just keep putting out PS2 games, honestly. If that's

1195
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:28,180
That's where you're gonna go, just don't even bother.

1196
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:32,740
What they need to understand is, look at all these other console wars that have been going

1197
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:33,740
on.

1198
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,580
The Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.

1199
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:41,960
The Xbox and Playstation 2.

1200
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:47,740
Have you noticed a big, giant difference between the games that come out on both platforms?

1201
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,020
They look almost the same.

1202
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:55,180
They're very much the same.

1203
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,340
makes you think that they're gonna all of a sudden you know hey let's develop a

1204
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:02,140
game for the 360 and let's just spend some extra time on making a completely

1205
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:05,940
different game but it's actually the same game for the PlayStation 3 with

1206
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,660
better graphics but you know what they're not gonna spend the money to

1207
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:13,500
develop those games because you know what they can port the same game over

1208
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,760
and it'll be just fine on both systems. Let me go over the chat room real quick

1209
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,300
for some comments orangelanatrader.com click on chat Fire Resurrected of the

1210
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:26,580
The O.L. Army would like to say Amen, lesbian co-host person.

1211
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,580
Let's see.

1212
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:31,780
Macman says, but the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray, it is God in writable media.

1213
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,780
Interesting.

1214
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:37,060
If by God they mean, you know, God of BCs.

1215
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:40,660
Black Boy says the $500 PS3 isn't really so lame.

1216
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,660
Yes, it is.

1217
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,660
People are allowed to have difference of opinion.

1218
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:50,980
Fireboma says, damn, I wish I could resist the PS3, but I'm just going to shell out $600

1219
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,900
dollars for it anyway I am a consumer

1220
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,180
whore and how should have been the rest

1221
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,780
of that comment no you know what I have

1222
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,700
to know I still it despite all this I

1223
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:00,820
kind of feel like I'm gonna end up

1224
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,860
getting a PlayStation 3 anyway I will at

1225
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:04,860
some point but I'm not gonna launch yeah

1226
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,740
I'm not all excited about because the

1227
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:08,660
thing is about the launch games there's

1228
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,340
nothing that makes it really stand out

1229
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,740
for me there's I mean and and to be

1230
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,060
honest all the other games that are out

1231
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:17,180
there like even flat out to or not flat

1232
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,180
out to um full auto 2 was the one for me

1233
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,640
I was like whoo that looks really good, but it's coming out on the 360 later on and so it's not a big deal

1234
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:32,560
What I think is gonna be really interesting is seeing what their marketing campaign is gonna be for this and seeing how they're gonna try

1235
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,820
To convince people to spend the $600 for it

1236
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:40,240
I don't think you're gonna be able to you're gonna see that because those 1080p TVs out there

1237
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,840
I know because I'm pricing them right now. They're like three grand

1238
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,440
I mean now I'm sure there's gonna be some angry Sony fanboys out there that want to write

1239
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,680
you know, angry emails, Orange Lounge Radio, I hate you, Loki, you're a dick, nah nah nah.

1240
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:59,120
We welcome those emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and maybe we'll read some on next week.

1241
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,080
Why are you letting that lesbian speak on your show about PlayStation?

1242
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,300
She doesn't know what she's talking about, nah nah nah nah.

1243
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,360
Go back to munching carpet, nah nah nah.

1244
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:10,880
Alright, so mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

1245
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:17,480
So no, if you have an intelligent rebuttal, we would happily read your emails on there.

1246
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,760
if you write something stupid we're just gonna forward it to Magsy. And you know what? I

1247
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:28,560
really want to see the PS3 do well. I wanted to see them launch it with a new Twisted Metal

1248
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,000
game. That would have been awesome. That would have sold the system for me, but to be honest

1249
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
right now they seem to be a step behind everybody and the fact that they haven't released any

1250
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,480
details about what exactly their online service is going to be, because I think to be honest

1251
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,640
they don't know what it's going to be like right now. I don't even think they have that

1252
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:50,640
stuff finalized yet. So until I hear some more details about how wonderful this system

1253
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,640
is, based on specs and price alone, I'm not going to be buying it at launch.

1254
01:14:55,640 --> 01:15:03,640
Alright. Well, let's change the tune to something happier. DarkSakura, don't you agree?

1255
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,640
Yes.

1256
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,400
And DarkSakura always likes to make us happy by surfing the internet and telling us about

1257
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:13,640
her happy place on the internet this week and sharing it with the internet. So DarkSakura,

1258
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:16,960
What is your happy website of the week?

1259
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,440
My webpage of the week is Mr. Pinball.

1260
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:28,760
It's www.xmission.com slash tilde d-a-i-n-a slash pinball dot html.

1261
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,480
And basically Mr. Pinball is a site they restore, buy, sell, trade, repair pinball machines.

1262
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,960
They have classified ads, pricing guides, t-shirts, hats, bugs and more!

1263
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,720
Repair tips of the day, pinball collector registry, pinball machine photos.

1264
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:48,720
It's probably one of the oldest pinball sites on the internet as far as information, tips,

1265
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,720
that type of thing, so go check it out.

1266
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,720
Alright.

1267
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:53,720
Awesome.

1268
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,720
Anyways...

1269
01:15:54,720 --> 01:16:03,720
Oh, hi.

1270
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,720
My turn, huh?

1271
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,720
My bad.

1272
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,720
Moving on, I have one more...

1273
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,720
Well, you started talking, I thought you had the next story and

1274
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:14,720
Loki's sitting there going, I can make up a story.

1275
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,720
He's saying that I was awesome and that my taste in websites is, yeah.

1276
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,720
Oh, I thought, weren't we going to do Orange Lounge Lying Radio

1277
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,720
or something one week because everybody calls us liars anyway?

1278
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,720
Would you like to come up with the Orange Lounge Radio fib game news of the week?

1279
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,720
The fib game news of the week?

1280
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Yes.

1281
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,720
The Playstation 3 being good?

1282
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,720
Oh, Maisie has one.

1283
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,720
Okay, here's our not true Orange Lounge Radio news story of the week.

1284
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:42,260
the week. Sony has just announced that the PS3 will also include a George Foreman grill.

1285
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:46,160
The PlayStation 3 has already sold over 50 million units before its launch, making it

1286
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,440
the fastest system to ever reach that number. Amazing. You heard it here first on Orange

1287
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:56,280
Lounge Radio. I just bought mine off eBay. It'll also do your laundry and your homework.

1288
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:01,740
And it'll suck your lollipop clean! The ones you buy at Disneyland, the happiest place

1289
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:08,740
on Earth because pure people like to go to Disneyland. Moving on, here's a true article.

1290
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:15,920
Wait, I got one more. What? Okay, yeah. Okay. Landfill in San Francisco this week actually

1291
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:21,560
started rumbling from all the dual shocks that have been buried in there causing an

1292
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:28,560
earthquake, which is ironic because San Francisco gets a lot of earthquakes. Wow.

1293
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:31,560
Wow.

1294
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
Moving on.

1295
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,560
This story is true, even though some people think it's a lie.

1296
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,560
It really is true, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, the Burning Crusade.

1297
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,560
Lots of people get their characters to 60, and then it's all about the endgame.

1298
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,560
Endgame, endgame, endgame. Well, guess what?

1299
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:50,560
Endgames have typically been 40-man raids.

1300
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,560
Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, so on and so on.

1301
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:57,560
And that's not going to change, but what's going to happen is that the new endgames in the Burning Crusade,

1302
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,840
they're gonna be capped at 25 people. So

1303
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,600
folks are gonna have to get used to all new party setups and all new strategies

1304
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,520
for endgame battle because you're gonna be reduced in the amount of people you

1305
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:08,080
can take

1306
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,020
on those raids. So no more taking along Leroy Jenkins just for comic value.

1307
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,400
You're gonna have to get less people to work with so you're gonna have to take along

1308
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,080
folks who definitely know what they're doing and won't run into battle before

1309
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:21,080
you're all ready.

1310
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,360
But the chicken will still be good.

1311
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:26,040
FYI

1312
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:30,320
Anyway, that's gonna do it for the end of this segment of orange lounge radio here on the live show

1313
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,460
We're gonna take a break and that means our podcast is gonna get split at this point

1314
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:40,700
But be sure to tune in later this week for part B of orange lounge radio and we'll be back right after this

1315
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,200
Orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week

1316
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:51,080
