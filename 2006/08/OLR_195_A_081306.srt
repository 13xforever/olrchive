1
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:19,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 13th, 2006, is Squeenix going to get in the business of hardware?

2
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,876
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready for some retro Sega Genesis action.

3
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:25,118
[SPEAKER_00]: What is holding up the PSP download service anyway?

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:37,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another wonderful episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:43,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gaming culture and of course, video games that don't suck.

6
00:00:43,803 --> 00:00:44,323
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:11,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never do such a thing.

8
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:12,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't talking about you.

9
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:14,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Loki.

10
00:01:15,278 --> 00:01:15,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

11
00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:16,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

12
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

13
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:17,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

14
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:18,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Hungry.

15
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Hungry?

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you eat before the show tonight?

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some beer nuts.

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I want nuts.

19
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:25,642
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like nuts, do you?

20
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:26,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like eating nuts.

21
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:29,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight also we have some very special guests in the studio.

22
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:32,224
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have some guests tonight who have never been on the show before.

23
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rarity because usually we get the same old people.

24
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:36,845
[SPEAKER_03]: But tonight we have some guests.

25
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first guest tonight is coming to us all the way from Wisconsin.

26
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:41,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Megzi!

27
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:41,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

28
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:43,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how you doing?

29
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:45,316
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put the mic a little bit closer to your mouth.

30
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:45,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

31
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:46,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how you doing?

32
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:47,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

33
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:47,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

34
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:48,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your shirt.

35
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:49,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Mario on your shirt.

36
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wore that specially for the show.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a gamer girl?

39
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:52,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.

40
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games do you like?

41
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:54,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

42
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I like RPGs.

43
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:57,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to just get that microphone, like, right there by your mouth.

44
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:58,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

45
00:01:58,465 --> 00:01:59,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

46
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

47
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:02,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I like RPGs.

48
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I like platformers.

49
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually like any type of game, uh, as long as it's fun.

50
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,447
[SPEAKER_03]: The Best Game You've Played in the Past Year

51
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:36,262
[SPEAKER_07]: A-ha, a-ha, a-ha

52
00:02:58,473 --> 00:02:59,676
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,390
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

54
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Pillow fights?

55
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there ever pillow fights?

56
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,921
[SPEAKER_06]: No pillow fights, but we did have an orgy.

57
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:41,901
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a Mississippi orgy.

58
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:43,442
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a Mississippi orgy?

59
00:03:44,202 --> 00:03:47,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It's when you get people in a room without their socks or shoes.

60
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:49,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really hot.

61
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:50,164
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hot.

62
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:53,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So wait, if I take off my socks right now, because I'll have on my socks.

63
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, Megsie's taking off her socks.

64
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm taking off my socks.

65
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:00,767
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now officially having a Mississippi orgy.

66
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, an orgy.

67
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:03,588
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fun.

68
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:05,449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

69
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:06,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the games.

70
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:10,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the guys in the room are now going, it's a lesbian show.

71
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:10,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,981
[SPEAKER_03]: How could I forget our chat room?

73
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,541
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com.

74
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:17,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat if you're listening to us live here on this lovely Sunday evening.

75
00:04:18,222 --> 00:04:19,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd love to hear your opinion.

76
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, there we go.

77
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:24,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd, OMG, they're having an orgy on the show.

78
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's going to be, it's a slow news week, boys and girls.

79
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:28,845
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we say?

80
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:33,226
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the type of stuff that happens during slow news weeks is we have Mississippi orgies with lesbians.

81
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:34,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is...

82
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising Pinball

83
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:18,388
[SPEAKER_06]: and I actually almost, I tried to hunt down the Saturn so I could play our Sega Ages collection that we got from the guy who was the man behind Working Designs who Dan just bought the Twilight Zone pinball from.

84
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:19,789
[SPEAKER_06]: He's really awesome.

85
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan got me a monkey.

86
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:25,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a real monkey that flings poo?

87
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,533
[SPEAKER_01]: A monkey ball monkey.

88
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:27,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.

89
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:30,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I have a monkey.

90
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,177
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

91
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris has a monkey too.

92
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I got her the monkey.

93
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I work at GameStop.

94
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:37,768
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop Pride GameStop Pride

95
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So cool.

96
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to describe it.

97
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,774
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.

98
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, zombie killing is love.

99
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

100
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:13,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I knew I was in love with Dead Rising the minute I picked up the lawnmower and mowed over 70 zombies in a minute.

101
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:14,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

102
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever thought of this concept for a game, I want to kiss you.

103
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:19,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

104
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on the lips.

105
00:06:20,929 --> 00:06:21,950
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a beautiful game.

106
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,371
[SPEAKER_03]: More games should be like Dead Rising.

107
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Dead Rising's not perfect.

108
00:06:25,893 --> 00:06:27,835
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some things that need to be fixed for Dead Rising 2.

109
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:30,056
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is that small-ass text size.

110
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:31,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really hard to read.

111
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on my HDTV, it's kind of hard to read the text.

112
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have been bitching about this, but...

113
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:38,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, the text has got to be fixed.

114
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,764
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphical style of Dead Rising isn't for everybody.

115
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I let Mikhail Tov watch me play for a little bit, and he's like, this game looks like crap.

116
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, what are you smoking?

117
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,047
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's beautiful.

118
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:49,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different art style.

119
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:52,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit cartoonish with the blood, but it's zombies.

120
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:54,850
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be cartoonish.

121
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:58,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that kind of annoys me is the saving.

122
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to save in a bathroom or on a couch.

123
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really weird.

124
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:04,675
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you play, you're not...

125
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:08,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready for the fact that you're going to die, and you're going to die fast.

126
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:13,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you select the option that says save and quit, you literally start all over.

127
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,414
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little weird because the game's main mode is a 72 hour mode.

128
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:19,976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not literally 72 hours.

129
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:22,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki was telling me before the show every hour is 5 minutes.

130
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:23,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't figure it out.

131
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was running faster than a real hour though.

132
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:27,162
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game was...

133
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:43,506
[SPEAKER_03]: you know kinda interesting where you would start that over if you selected that but that's kinda cool because you get power yourself up more and more and then you know start the game in in that mode so I like powered myself up to level three and I was like you know I'll start over because I was getting my ass kicked by zombies

134
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:47,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than those little bitches, I love the game.

135
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact that you can take pictures of zombies.

136
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was so hilarious.

137
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:55,589
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those Mega Man guys called?

138
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I can never remember their names.

139
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,309
[SPEAKER_03]: With the little yellow heads.

140
00:07:58,669 --> 00:07:59,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Servbots, thank you.

141
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,691
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the little Servbots head on a bunch of zombies and took pictures of them all walking around.

142
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:04,591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.

143
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:05,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just...

144
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting to use all these weapons on zombies.

145
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great aggression taking out game.

146
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:18,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of wish from the start there was like a sandbox mode where it was more like the demo where it just drops you into a sea of zombies with all the items around you and you just start going.

147
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:22,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I could do this game without the story for fun and just like a party.

148
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:25,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it would be nice if the game had multiplayer.

149
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

150
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion didn't have multiplayer and it's a great game so it's not like the game has to have multiplayer but it would be so cool.

151
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would just make a cool thing even cooler.

152
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:35,101
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

153
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:36,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising.

154
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:37,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I do recommend Dead Rising.

155
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of you guys would have fun with it.

156
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,460
[SPEAKER_03]: But just those little minor complaints aside might frustrate you for a little bit.

157
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:46,502
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you take your aggression out on zombies with a lawnmower, and it's wonderful.

158
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that hook that lets you pull their heads right off.

159
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:49,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

160
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:50,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds beautiful.

161
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:51,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fun.

162
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:52,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing is love.

163
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:53,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing zombies is love.

164
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:55,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

165
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:59,826
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Dead Rising, and then I also play more Prey because I'm slowly but surely trying to make my way through Prey still.

166
00:09:00,725 --> 00:09:02,847
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a great game because you never die.

167
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's made for people who suck at first-person shooters like myself.

168
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,251
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd never die.

169
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:12,135
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go to a little spirit world, shoot some Medusa heads or whatever those things are, and then you come back to life.

170
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:12,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.

171
00:09:13,316 --> 00:09:13,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

172
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:16,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

173
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

174
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:26,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played Morgrantheth out of Liberty City Stories to tide me over until Vice City Stories comes out.

175
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I kicked ass this week, so it was awesome.

176
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:36,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Played Dead Rising, not too much though, just during lunches.

177
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:43,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to play the lawnmower and chop zombies up with that, then pick up the lawnmower and just slam it into their head.

178
00:09:44,561 --> 00:09:52,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also, I played Chromehounds, and yes, I did play Chromehounds, and I have been on there, and no one's joined our clan.

179
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:56,884
[SPEAKER_02]: One person, you know, Fire Resurrected, excellent, but...

180
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:22,574
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you know talk about the chrome hounds thing in a minute yes it's just i'm ready to go and just no one else wants to but whatever um and then was it i watched someone play a game that will not be named it was cool and creepy but we'll talk about that at another time all right uh magsy chris anything you guys want to say what kind of games you've been playing this week

181
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Animal Crossing on the plane.

182
00:10:25,301 --> 00:10:25,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

183
00:10:26,081 --> 00:10:27,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

184
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:28,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they let you though?

185
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:31,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought because the DS had the wireless they don't like it when you play DS on the plane.

186
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have a problem with it.

187
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's good.

188
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried to finish Kingdom Hearts 2.

189
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,025
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I was real smart and played it the first time around on proud mode.

190
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm having a hard time beating it.

191
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

192
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:48,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a really old school arcade machine Super Mario Brothers.

193
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:50,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fun.

194
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:52,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a big Mario fan?

195
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I noticed you have Mario on your shirt.

196
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:54,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am a big Mario fan.

197
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:59,898
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii and Super Paper Mario on the GameCube.

198
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some people thought that Mario on the Wii looked kind of weird.

199
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:03,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that okay?

200
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario always looks weird.

201
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:07,981
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

202
00:11:08,622 --> 00:11:08,862
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

203
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

204
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:12,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I need to get from the lesbian perspective.

205
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's better, Peach or Daisy?

206
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:14,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Peach.

207
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:17,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Why Peach?

208
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:18,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's hotter.

209
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have you know, though, whenever I play Mario Party, I always play as Peach.

210
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's also got attitude.

211
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:27,032
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she's like, Peach is the winner!

212
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:28,073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me.

213
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:30,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the winner whenever I play Mario Party.

214
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,255
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just thought I'd share.

215
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Any games you're looking forward to coming out soon?

216
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:34,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirge of Cerberus.

217
00:11:35,037 --> 00:11:35,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

218
00:11:35,618 --> 00:11:36,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You like Vincent?

219
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:37,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Vincent.

220
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:39,220
[SPEAKER_05]: She made me.

221
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mike?

222
00:11:41,342 --> 00:11:43,443
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually called when she was coming down here.

223
00:11:43,923 --> 00:11:45,685
[SPEAKER_07]: She had me go to the GameStop and reserve it.

224
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:48,987
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

225
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:50,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of...

226
00:11:51,961 --> 00:12:02,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it reserved at my GameStop, and I realized I was going to be here, and I was like, go to the GameStop and reserve it so I can get it.

227
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are going to play all night when it comes out?

228
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:05,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

229
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:14,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it a little bit, AE3, but it wasn't Final Fantasy enough for me because it's more like live action, which is cool.

230
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:22,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's people that are into that more action-style game, but I'll still check it out when the final game comes out, make my final decision then, but I hope you enjoy it.

231
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,381
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the first time I played through Final Fantasy VII, I never even got Vincent because I'm so stupid.

232
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:27,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I never figured out to open the safe.

233
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it took me forever to figure out how to get him.

234
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I got him first time without the book.

235
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:35,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look at you.

236
00:12:35,343 --> 00:12:36,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

237
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:37,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And Yuffie.

238
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:39,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Yuffie's easy to get.

239
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:40,707
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because Yuffie's easy.

240
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:42,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, I'm sorry.

241
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

242
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:56,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, again, I'm a gamer in the old school sense, so I play D&D and stuff like that, but I do have Sims 2 on my Mac, and that kind of has me really, really addicted.

243
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So I play a lot of that.

244
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like to kill your Sims?

245
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that's what Loki does.

246
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:04,320
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some clever death traps you come up with for your Sims?

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,921
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite one is...

248
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:07,613
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

249
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:34,026
[SPEAKER_03]: They scream, and they scream really loud.

250
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:41,336
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a gay friend once who made his homo palace once on The Sims, and he put, what's the most number of Sims you can have in a house?

251
00:13:41,356 --> 00:13:41,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Like eight?

252
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:44,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, eight, and in this game I think you can have like

253
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:45,957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

254
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,561
[SPEAKER_03]: and had to do the cooking for him and she finally died of exhaustion.

255
00:14:07,782 --> 00:14:11,988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny because she passes out in the middle of the room and the guys don't care.

256
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:13,910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still making out with each other and stuff.

257
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,992
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, she just died.

258
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,235
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny if you have them on...

259
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:43,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I made the mistake of having put them on freestyle like they can pretty much if you're not paying attention they'll do whatever the heck they want and like four or five of my sims who weren't supposed to go make out with each other went and made out with each other because they've in the second game they've got like chemistry like lightning connection chemistry and they just ended up making out and then getting pissed at each other because they watched the person they just made out make out with somebody else so it's drama more Melrose Place oh yeah it was a sim soap opera

260
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:47,209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some of the fun stuff to do with the Sims, though.

261
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,350
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why that game's so popular.

262
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find my Sims 2 disc, because I miss playing it.

263
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:51,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you play that online?

264
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:53,754
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I guess you can't, because they have the Sims online.

265
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:59,800
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of moot anyway, because my DVD drive on my PC is busted, so I'll have to get the Mac one anyway.

266
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm getting my iMac soon!

267
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

268
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:05,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I'm reading chat rooms.

269
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:08,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other folks are sharing their Sims stories here.

270
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:09,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Pooeater says,

271
00:15:09,969 --> 00:15:13,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I had made a house with each sim in their own room with only one thing.

272
00:15:13,591 --> 00:15:17,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, one would have a TV, one would have a fridge, one would have a toilet, then enjoy the show.

273
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have to go to each other's houses to borrow things, I guess.

274
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting.

275
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And PKakura88 is clearing up the DS thing on the plane for me, saying...

276
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:29,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's during takeoff and landing, it really doesn't matter.

277
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:32,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they make you turn off everything during takeoff and landing.

278
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:33,976
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I fly enough.

279
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:36,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know that, but I just never... For some reason, I never bring my DS.

280
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:38,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of short flights to LA.

281
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:43,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I had my iPod during takeoff and landing, and they didn't seem to care.

282
00:15:43,345 --> 00:15:43,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

283
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:44,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

284
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:47,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, either they didn't seem... The plane didn't crash, so...

285
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:54,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you fly during all the chaos that was going on recently?

286
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,029
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I actually totally missed all the chaos.

287
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:01,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just recently hearing a little bit about what's been happening.

288
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:07,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that we're getting into CNN podcasts, but this was basically...

289
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:08,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

290
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:35,176
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before we get into tonight's program, we have some housekeeping to take care of.

291
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:01,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're smack-talking Bobby Blackwolf, then it's fine.

292
00:17:02,741 --> 00:17:05,003
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want to have a drama-free environment there.

293
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:10,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made a whole new forum over there on OrangeMonster.com for folks to start clans and games.

294
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been working out pretty well so far.

295
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:17,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We have folks in Halo 2, and a couple folks in Guild Wars, and I noticed the Steam games are getting a lot of folks.

296
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:20,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out over on OrangeMonster.com.

297
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,907
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

298
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,635
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of smack leading up to this tournament.

299
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first off, no one has consulted me on anything in this.

300
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:43,880
[SPEAKER_02]: They nominated me to play this damn game, for one.

301
00:17:44,381 --> 00:17:48,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard enough when there's freaking Dead Rising coming out, because that game is very distracting.

302
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:53,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when Chromehounds, they move really slow, there's no zombies in it, that kind of thing.

303
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, for some reason, somehow, no rules were discussed at all, no ground rules, just somebody decided...

304
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:00,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

305
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,748
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need more people to do this.

306
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:31,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, if you're a Chromehounds player, you want to have a little fun on Sunday about 1 o'clock Pacific time, please come to our forums and say you would like to participate.

307
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:40,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'm going to have to figure out how to get in there and I'll play as Mr. Spanky in the Chromehounds Invitational and that's going to be kind of sad.

308
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:41,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

309
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:59,718
[SPEAKER_03]: GamerAndy better start working out to DDR, because he's going down.

310
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the bad thing about Chromehounds, first off.

311
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:07,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be online in order for people to sign up for your clan, which is retarded anyways.

312
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:13,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what's the point of having that clan password thing if... I don't get it.

313
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:18,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure something out.

314
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:22,480
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, OL Army, save us so we don't embarrass ourselves too bad one week from today.

315
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to embarrass myself.

316
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:25,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, you know, that's kind of fucked up.

317
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:26,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you can take them all on.

318
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:27,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

319
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:30,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just take them all on while they're attacking my base and shit.

320
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be...

321
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:33,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

322
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze does have a good point.

323
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:39,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitstun from the OL Army has already owned Blackwolf and Tetris.

324
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we lose miserably at this, at least it'll be evened up.

325
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So there can't be a lot of shit talking.

326
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:45,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

327
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my best.

328
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

329
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:47,234
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

330
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for the rest of them.

331
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

332
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't be getting my ass handed to me.

333
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,624
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, Chromehound players, we need your help.

334
00:19:55,084 --> 00:19:56,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to the OL Army forums immediately.

335
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:03,350
[SPEAKER_03]: One other piece of housekeeping I want to get out there is that we actually have an addendum to a previously reported on story.

336
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:10,996
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we try to report accurate information, but once in a while something's going to slip through the cracks that maybe wasn't correct.

337
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:11,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

338
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:19,823
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is interesting because not a lot of people know that this is not correct, but we've received a trusted anonymous tip

339
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:22,506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't tell you who it's from, but it's a trusted source.

340
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:29,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're telling us that that song list we announced a couple shows back to elite beat agents that's run on a lot of sites is wrong.

341
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might actually be good news for some people.

342
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:36,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks that were a little disappointed at some of the picks, like didn't they have like Linkin Park and stuff on that list?

343
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:37,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think.

344
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardware store.

345
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is kind of cool that, you know, Weird Al would have been okay with.

346
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have received a tip that that is absolutely wrong and that only the demo songs are

347
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:51,774
[SPEAKER_03]: are ones you can count on actually seeing in the full version, which would make sense.

348
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,237
[SPEAKER_03]: But as for the rest of the song list, you'll just have to wait and see.

349
00:20:55,637 --> 00:21:01,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the last housekeeping thing, of course, we upped our cap on listeners.

350
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:07,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, instead of capping out at 50 or whatever, we've got a lot more than that.

351
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:11,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can listen without worrying about, you know,

352
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:12,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being able to.

353
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so please come listen live to us on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on OrangeHandsRadio.com.

354
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:21,590
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't get locked out of the feed anymore because we have plenty of room now.

355
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,833
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, if you can't do it Sunday nights because you're watching, I don't know, what's on Sunday nights?

356
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:26,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Touched by an Angel or whatever?

357
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:28,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Desperate Housewives.

358
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:29,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all those shows suck.

359
00:21:30,116 --> 00:21:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you... Buy a TiVo.

360
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:33,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy a TiVo.

361
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can't listen to us on Sunday... Okay, Magsie's making pouty faces at me.

362
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:40,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get pouty face.

363
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:41,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Grey's Anatomy.

364
00:21:41,246 --> 00:21:41,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

365
00:21:42,006 --> 00:21:44,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it just a bunch of doctors having sex with each other or something?

366
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:44,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

367
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Desperate Housewives.

368
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:46,390
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny.

369
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sound pretty hot.

370
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So Desperate Housewives is a pretty hot show.

371
00:21:49,653 --> 00:21:50,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen a little bit of it.

372
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:50,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty hot.

373
00:21:51,734 --> 00:22:03,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if you have to watch your Desperate Housewives or Grey's Anatomy, you don't have a TiVo, you could always listen to the All Games Rebroadcast, which is Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

374
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a little bit earlier for you East Coast folks.

375
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:10,736
[SPEAKER_03]: and Central like Wisconsin if you want to listen to it live.

376
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:18,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, podcast, podcast is love and we know there's lots of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed and for that we're most appreciative.

377
00:22:18,126 --> 00:22:18,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a bunch.

378
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:29,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news now, and we're going to start it off tonight with a story about the Wii, and I might be in trouble for that previous bet I made about how there's not going to be 20 games that Wii launch.

379
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:47,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't look like there's going to be 21st party Wii games, so I'm going to have to go back and listen to the bet for sure, but it does look like there are going to be 27 Wii games that are released on the day the Wii is out, which of course is still unknown, but we do have 27 confirmed titles.

380
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki seems to think it's going to be more than 27.

381
00:22:49,278 --> 00:22:49,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more than that.

382
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:50,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

383
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:53,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I know some that aren't even on that list.

384
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:54,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to read this list real quick for you guys?

385
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:55,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

386
00:22:56,501 --> 00:23:25,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Avatar, The Last Airbender, Blazing Angels, Blitz the League, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors, Elebits, Excite Truck, Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, Madden NFL 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Metal Slug Anthology, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, and

387
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:39,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center, Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.

388
00:23:40,146 --> 00:23:47,430
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I ask you folks in studio, if you had to buy two of those games from that list, you only have enough money to buy two of the games, which two are you getting at launch?

389
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

390
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:50,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already got them on order.

391
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel and...

392
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you mention GT?

393
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:58,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, GT Pro Series.

394
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,053
[SPEAKER_02]: GT actually looks pretty good.

395
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:01,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel and GT.

396
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:04,257
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you don't know?

397
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:07,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Do our other girls know?

398
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzi, which two are you going to get?

399
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:13,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm number one Nintendo fangirl in the world, so I'll be getting Zelda.

400
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:17,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the second one, Red Steel, I think.

401
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:19,070
[SPEAKER_03]: You like swords?

402
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,650
[SPEAKER_03]: You like ninjas?

403
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:21,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just looked it over.

404
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:23,970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, do you think you know?

405
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to get Zelda and the Metal Slug Anthology.

406
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you think you know which two you'd get?

407
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:34,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably Zelda and Cars.

408
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,781
[SPEAKER_03]: You dork.

409
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,344
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you right now.

410
00:24:42,404 --> 00:24:43,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Which two would I get?

411
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

412
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:46,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get three.

413
00:24:46,868 --> 00:24:47,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Three.

414
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,463
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know, but in real life I'm going to get three.

415
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:55,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but which two?

416
00:24:56,144 --> 00:25:01,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say... I'm going to say Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Excite Truck.

417
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:03,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why I'm leaving... Excite Truck was cool.

418
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm leaving out Zelda, but I'm going to borrow yours.

419
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're going to... We can trade.

420
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming to your house and playing your Zelda.

421
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:14,854
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all get two, then we can all play each other's.

422
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:15,795
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

423
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,355
[SPEAKER_03]: We will play with each other's.

424
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:18,535
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple things missing.

425
00:25:18,615 --> 00:25:21,576
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, where's Super Mario Galaxy?

426
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:26,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed, but didn't Miyamoto say a while back that it may not be exactly ready at launch?

427
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:28,678
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be in the launch window, and that's what these are anyways.

428
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:32,920
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a few that I mentioned a couple weeks ago.

429
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Rappala Trophies, which is supposed to be coming out for your fishing fans, I guess.

430
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:44,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also a couple that I'm mentioning this week that aren't on that list, and they're part of Midway's lineup.

431
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:49,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, Midway, we announced weeks ago, Rampage Soul Destruction.

432
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody's finally picked up on that.

433
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more that are going to be added.

434
00:25:53,512 --> 00:25:55,994
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Happy Feet, which is based on that...

435
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really crappy movie that's coming out.

436
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:00,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got happy feet.

437
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:03,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see that.

438
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I take the controllers to my feet and then do tap dancing?

439
00:26:08,171 --> 00:26:08,631
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

440
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:08,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

441
00:26:08,972 --> 00:26:13,656
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy are going to be getting in the game as well.

442
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:17,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are going to be two coming from Midway.

443
00:26:17,719 --> 00:26:18,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more.

444
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,804
[SPEAKER_02]: They're announcing seven at Let's Big in a couple weeks here.

445
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:23,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.

446
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:23,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

447
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:26,407
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely not the fullest.

448
00:26:26,427 --> 00:26:30,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Funnydale says he's going to get a Barbie's Horse Adventure for the Wii when it comes out.

449
00:26:30,913 --> 00:26:31,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he going to be disappointed?

450
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a launch game or no?

451
00:26:33,236 --> 00:26:34,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they even announced anything like that.

452
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully.

453
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,642
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun with the Wii.

454
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:39,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

455
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:43,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's all I have to say on the Wii.

456
00:26:43,428 --> 00:26:45,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, go Wii.

457
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:50,671
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, a few things that we're definitely speculating besides the launch date.

458
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: IGN's got speculation on the release date and the price point for it.

459
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:57,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray!

460
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,816
[SPEAKER_03]: More release date and price speculation.

461
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:00,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what this show needed.

462
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:09,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was just thinking this week, gosh, we really haven't had a story on release date or price point speculation in the past week.

463
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,983
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really need one tonight.

464
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:11,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Loki.

465
00:27:11,944 --> 00:27:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

466
00:27:13,725 --> 00:27:14,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

467
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:24,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, their speculation is November 2nd or November 12th, because apparently their sources can't make up their minds on which it is.

468
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: because probably because no one knows yet because they've given them a, you know, have your games ready by, you know, this time period and then we'll, you know, announce a date then.

469
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:36,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they don't have to launch with the third-party games.

470
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because if they come a few weeks later, it's not going to matter.

471
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:48,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the price point they've announced, they said $229 is going to be the price point and that, well, I don't know where they pulled that out of.

472
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:49,640
[SPEAKER_05]: How about their ass?

473
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,642
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that

474
00:27:53,595 --> 00:28:02,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I have heard every single date in the fourth quarter guessed for the Wii launch at work because I work at GameStop.

475
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that everybody's guessed every single date for Wii launch.

476
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:09,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter.

477
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks, I have a big world exclusive for you guys.

478
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:18,474
[SPEAKER_03]: We here at Orange Launch Radio, we are absolutely confident we know the release date of the Wii.

479
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:19,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to give it to you.

480
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:22,936
[SPEAKER_03]: We have inside sources that have told us the actual release date of the Wii.

481
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:23,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is.

482
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:27,319
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii will be released soon.

483
00:28:32,199 --> 00:29:00,110
[SPEAKER_02]: and when it comes out soon then you can say I heard that first on Orange Lounge Radio and they were right right on Orange Lounge Radio for guessing the release date of the Wii it was indeed soon well I'm actually saying I'm still sticking with October 18th just because it's the anniversary and you know but people say oh they don't release their systems on Wednesdays they release them on Sundays who gives a fuck okay honestly I mean

484
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:01,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do whatever they want.

485
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:02,545
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Nintendo.

486
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,846
[SPEAKER_02]: They can say, you know what, bitches?

487
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:06,446
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to release our game.

488
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to release it on Wednesday because, you know what?

489
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:09,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

490
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:11,047
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts with a W and it's Wii.

491
00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:12,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And our new mascot is Wario.

492
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:14,367
Waluigi.

493
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:15,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Waluigi.

494
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,608
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wii Wednesdays.

495
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Waluigi's a pun.

496
00:29:19,168 --> 00:29:19,568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

497
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:24,849
[SPEAKER_03]: And demonstrating the Wii live on stage will be Giggling Lesbians.

498
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:25,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.

499
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:26,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

500
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to explain this.

501
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Waluigi is a pun because...

502
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:36,715
[SPEAKER_06]: It sort of is, but Wadoichi is because it would be sort of Wado-y, which is bad.

503
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:40,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why I thought that Wario was... Same thing, they're both the same.

504
00:29:42,058 --> 00:29:47,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night... Okay, no responding to things that aren't said in mics.

505
00:29:47,762 --> 00:29:48,123
Sorry.

506
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:51,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now they think it's something dirty that you're responding to.

507
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:57,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying... We got an explicit tag last week, so I'm trying to avoid it this week, please.

508
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not going to happen.

509
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:58,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Even...

510
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:01,838
[SPEAKER_03]: The lesbians are keeping it pretty clean tonight.

511
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,640
[SPEAKER_03]: They left the pillows at home, so I'm pretty excited.

512
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept it for you.

513
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:08,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe during the afterbirth, we'll see.

514
00:30:09,403 --> 00:30:11,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's keep it moving.

515
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Wario, and Waluigi, and the beautiful cast of the various Mario games, there is going to be a Mario Strikers sequel on the Wii.

516
00:30:26,295 --> 00:30:27,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a happy Megzi.

517
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:30,488
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a fan of Mario Strikers?

518
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:35,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think you'll like Wii Sports though because of Miyamoto's giant head as one of the characters?

519
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:48,950
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know.

520
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:59,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that it'll be fun just because it's on the Wii and you actually get to do stuff as opposed to just pushing a button on a remote control and then whoever throws the football.

521
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:06,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video of me on YouTube that somebody took of playing Wii Sports and I look like I'm not having any fun at all.

522
00:31:06,903 --> 00:31:07,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most depressing thing.

523
00:31:08,184 --> 00:31:10,846
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really enjoyed the game and I was just exhausted from the day.

524
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:11,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi, news story.

525
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:12,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

526
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:13,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Rob.

527
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:16,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear God.

528
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:22,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't worship you, but I do adore you.

529
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:23,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

530
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:23,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

531
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

532
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:27,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.

533
00:31:27,557 --> 00:31:35,483
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually were saying that Super Mario Strikers was supposed to, the sequel was supposed to be one of the games that was announced at the Games Convention in Germany.

534
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:40,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And this speculation is going to be like a, you know, an online multiplayer Strikers.

535
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:42,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So that sounds like it's a pretty good deal.

536
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm done, Rob.

537
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:45,429
[SPEAKER_06]: You can interrupt me.

538
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:53,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to say this from chat, is that Ari Mosson of the Oil Army thinks he has the new marketing campaign for the Nintendo Wii.

539
00:31:53,596 --> 00:32:00,180
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's this giant enemy lesbian, and you attack its weak point for massive pleasure.

540
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Massive pleasure, because it's a lesbian.

541
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:07,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I love our chat room.

542
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and kisses to the OLR chat.

543
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:14,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I will check out Super Mario Strikers on the Wii.

544
00:32:14,212 --> 00:32:15,173
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be fun, I bet.

545
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:16,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not.

546
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

547
00:32:17,476 --> 00:32:18,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's stupid.

548
00:32:19,918 --> 00:32:23,441
[SPEAKER_02]: The original game was stupid, and this one will be equally as stupid.

549
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:24,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Macy's going to punch you.

550
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:27,505
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

551
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:32,009
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a Squeenix story to break up the hate a little bit here in the room?

552
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeenix are what we like to call Square Enix.

553
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,454
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them Squeenix because a lot of their games make us squee.

554
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:50,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going on there is that Yoishi Wada, who is the president of Square, spoke recently about what game creators need to do for next-gen platforms and how developers will have to work together to move the industry forward.

555
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:52,661
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a quote here.

556
00:32:53,453 --> 00:32:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the reasons Square Enix will collaborate with Taito, a company that produces physical hardware, he said.

557
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:03,237
[SPEAKER_03]: In our talks with Taito, ideas for an actual physical product have come up.

558
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,838
[SPEAKER_03]: In any case, we will be releasing some thing.

559
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting in that it's not the sort of thing you would expect from Square Enix.

560
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:14,102
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're talking about releasing a thing.

561
00:33:14,762 --> 00:33:16,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hardware thing.

562
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:20,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not talking about that sword from Dragon Quest.

563
00:33:21,105 --> 00:33:22,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this game console?

564
00:33:22,526 --> 00:33:22,926
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

565
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:29,250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a game that does not have the word final or fantasy in the title.

566
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a trans vibrator.

567
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

568
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:40,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe it's a... I think maybe something they might do is maybe a dedicated... Like, you remember those old Game & Watch type games?

569
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:45,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something like that, but a little more souped up, but a square franchise or product.

570
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something like a game, a standalone game, plug-and-play type.

571
00:33:49,124 --> 00:33:52,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's going to be another sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

572
00:33:53,888 --> 00:33:54,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's a console?

573
00:33:55,529 --> 00:33:55,729
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

574
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

575
00:33:56,609 --> 00:33:57,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Too crowded?

576
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Too crowded, and... No.

577
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,392
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't see Square Enix getting into console?

578
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, in Japan, they might do really well with a console.

579
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:05,714
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

580
00:34:06,114 --> 00:34:10,116
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie hits puberty or something.

581
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:12,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

582
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:16,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be, okay, I like Megzy's idea.

583
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have Aerith as a zombie, and you have to go around and shoot her.

584
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Again and again and again.

585
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:23,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And she keeps coming back.

586
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,040
[SPEAKER_06]: You just keep killing her.

587
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,781
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the holy zombie.

588
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: FireResurrected sent me a private message, and of course I read those publicly.

589
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not encouraging you to send me private messages, please.

590
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I get inundated with them during the show, but I thought this comment was good.

591
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeenix is releasing an arcade machine.

592
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:40,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Taito makes arcade machines.

593
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:43,566
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thought.

594
00:34:43,586 --> 00:34:45,627
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Puzzle Bobble featuring Cloud.

595
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this idea from Firebomba.

596
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:48,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Urgeis.

597
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:50,208
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Urgeis in the arcades?

598
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Urgeis was in the arcades.

599
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an arcade game first.

600
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 13 versus on the, you know, in the arcades.

601
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:00,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

602
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to go play, the bowling alley used to play DDR.

603
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:04,853
[SPEAKER_06]: They had an Urgeis machine there and a virtual lawn.

604
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:05,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I lived there.

605
00:35:07,254 --> 00:35:07,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

606
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:08,354
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

607
00:35:08,714 --> 00:35:10,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, speaking of stuff...

608
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

609
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

610
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:18,682
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another person out there making something very interesting soon.

611
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:24,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently some fan on the internet decided they want their Madden holiday to be coming a little bit early.

612
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:27,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've put out this fake Madden coupon.

613
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:33,167
[SPEAKER_02]: A preferred customer coupon that's basically supposed to get you the game when they get it.

614
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:36,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, most of the retail stores are getting it a week early.

615
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,029
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they can get it before street day.

616
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:40,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hilarious because

617
00:35:41,817 --> 00:35:45,659
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360, XBOX PlayStation 2, and GameCube versions available at participating stores only.

618
00:36:07,972 --> 00:36:11,375
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically entitles you to get in the game.

619
00:36:11,775 --> 00:36:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the keyword!

620
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Participating stores only.

621
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:21,623
[SPEAKER_06]: You still have to participate.

622
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:29,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think there's going to be some employee at a Walmart, Target, Kmart type store that's going to fall for this or GameStop.

623
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,073
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go ahead and scan in said coupon or not know of it.

624
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,875
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to sell it to this guy.

625
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:38,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, I mean, fine.

626
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and try to get your free Madden game early.

627
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:49,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Madden, come on, it's not that different from last year, so if you're really in a hurry to get it, go right ahead.

628
00:36:49,317 --> 00:36:55,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my understanding is the Madden fans were pretty disappointed with Madden 06 on the 360, so they're really looking forward to Madden 07.

629
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because something else is better than something crappy, I guess.

630
00:36:59,924 --> 00:37:00,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but...

631
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:02,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good luck.

632
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:12,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and by the way, it says they forgot to run the coupon through Spellchecker because they, you know, misspelled include.

633
00:37:12,401 --> 00:37:13,082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inclus.

634
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

635
00:37:14,503 --> 00:37:15,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Forgers.

636
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:26,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of EA and upcoming releases, Spore, you might need a coupon to get this early because apparently 2007, and we're not talking early 2007, but more like the...

637
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The second half of 2007 is when you're going to be getting Spore.

638
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,674
[SPEAKER_03]: This game seems to be getting pushed back and back.

639
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:49,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I originally remembered this was going to be late 2006, but now it looks like February or mid-2007, at least online game retailers GameStop.com and EBGames.com have that list.

640
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Wright seemed to say that it's not going to make it until July 2007.

641
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, we're saying the second half of next year, 2007, for now.

642
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, so this game is really getting pushed back.

643
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:04,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the game looks like it did, this game is epic.

644
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:07,130
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Sims x 5.

645
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:10,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just freaking huge, this game.

646
00:38:11,273 --> 00:38:12,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be something else.

647
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:15,775
[SPEAKER_03]: If for nothing else than to throw aliens from your tractor beam in the ship.

648
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:16,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of fun.

649
00:38:17,216 --> 00:38:17,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

650
00:38:18,317 --> 00:38:20,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do know some games that will be coming out.

651
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:24,521
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll go ahead and make this mention now since I'm not going to be on the show next week.

652
00:38:25,485 --> 00:38:28,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm going to go ahead and do the next two weeks of European release dates.

653
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:29,446
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that sound?

654
00:38:29,866 --> 00:38:32,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially since there's all the crap coming out this week.

655
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:45,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the 18th we have Pathologic, um, Premier Manager 2006-2007, Pro Shirt Golf, blah blah blah, uh, SpecNAS, Project Wolf, uh, Spinout on PSP.

656
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:48,630
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 23rd we have Texas Hold'em, 25th, a bunch of good stuff.

657
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Dig Dug, Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, yay.

658
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:55,765
[SPEAKER_06]: PowerWorld, and Reservoir Dogs.

659
00:38:56,465 --> 00:39:00,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror, and World War I Aces of the Sky.

660
00:39:00,467 --> 00:39:02,167
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all European releases.

661
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:04,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

662
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:11,451
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as releases go for this week, it's definitely going to be a lot better than last week, but not by much.

663
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service on the PlayStation 2.

664
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:18,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, 99 Nights on the Xbox 360.

665
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:18,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

666
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:22,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that one.

667
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:31,370
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, you're getting Deep Labyrinth from Atlus and Freedom Wings, which is kind of like a pilot wings shooter type game.

668
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like something I'd find in the women's sanitation aisle at the store, or sanitary things.

669
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:38,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

670
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:47,334
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ever Generic World Racing 2 on the Xbox, and Zonide on the Xbox, which is good for those Hikaruku fans out there.

671
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:58,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, next week we have Madden NFL 07 coming out, as well as Pac-Man World Rally, and doing a re-release of Zoo and Zookeeper on DS.

672
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

673
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,079
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

674
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,600
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play Zookeeper online, it's called Bejeweled.

675
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rappala Trophies on the PSP.

676
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,136
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

677
00:40:33,294 --> 00:40:43,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, some of the other ones I thought were interesting, Bioshock and Darkness, are both coming out on April 5th, so check those out.

678
00:40:44,037 --> 00:40:54,760
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of my favorites, of course, would be the Konami games, and I'm sure we're going to hear more of this coming pretty soon, but DDR Universe is scheduled for December 2nd.

679
00:40:55,976 --> 00:40:57,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be pretty good.

680
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:59,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

681
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:01,140
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big pushback for Universe, isn't it?

682
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember Universe was originally scheduled earlier.

683
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: And Karaoke Revolution American Idol is going to be coming out, looks like, December 6th.

684
00:41:10,506 --> 00:41:13,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ultramix 4, that's going to be coming out November 15th.

685
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:19,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really interesting about it is the price for the actual game by itself, only $29.99.

686
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:20,954
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty good.

687
00:41:21,574 --> 00:41:22,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing...

688
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention, because we're going to be talking about game prices later on, some cheap games and stuff.

689
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:37,167
[SPEAKER_02]: One game that is out there that's probably the cheapest 360 game you're going to find, and this just dropped in price, heard it here first, Ridge Racer 6, $19.99.

690
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:42,351
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find it now at all participating retailers out there.

691
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:42,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So, $19.99.

692
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:49,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, that game is not a bad game, but for some reason, the worst selling game in the United States for the 360s, so...

693
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:51,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Bully in Europe

694
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:14,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockstar saying that the October release date was going to apply to Europe as well as the U.S.

695
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:24,026
[SPEAKER_06]: The British Board of Film Classification said that they were having issues with the title, but they said it wasn't anywhere near ready.

696
00:42:24,086 --> 00:42:27,749
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Rockstar saying it's on its way.

697
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

698
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty interesting.

699
00:42:31,397 --> 00:42:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.

700
00:42:32,278 --> 00:42:35,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking forward to Bully after seeing the trailer this week.

701
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The trailer looks good.

702
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched it yet.

703
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:38,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you nodding your head.

704
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:40,683
[SPEAKER_03]: What's exciting you about the game Bully?

705
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:43,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so when I was a kid in school, I was a bully.

706
00:42:45,106 --> 00:42:46,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you were the bully?

707
00:42:46,187 --> 00:42:46,987
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the bully.

708
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:47,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

709
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:53,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm looking forward to that game and reliving my days as an evil bully in a Catholic school.

710
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:55,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I thought it was the other way around, that you beat up the bullies.

711
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:57,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was that you are the bully.

712
00:42:59,015 --> 00:43:01,217
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think in a good game you get to play both ends of it.

713
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:04,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, settle this, because you've been following this game more than I have.

714
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the bully, or are you the person beating up the bully?

715
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:13,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're the person, you're just kind of a kid there, and you're being bullied, and I think you might also be the bully.

716
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of like this kid that's just trouble.

717
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:16,893
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that'll work.

718
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:26,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're trouble, but you've gotten introduced to this, you know, basically kind of like a private school, so you're no longer, you know,

719
00:43:27,737 --> 00:43:31,020
[SPEAKER_02]: The big one on campus, you know, you're kind of, you know, getting bullied.

720
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,662
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are bullied, but you're also getting bullied at the same time.

721
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:36,084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically school mayhem and that kind of stuff.

722
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:37,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's violence.

723
00:43:37,805 --> 00:43:38,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's violence.

724
00:43:38,686 --> 00:43:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's violence, and it makes Jack Thompson angry.

725
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how can you go wrong?

726
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:46,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has schoolgirls making out with people, so that's awesome.

727
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:48,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes our lesbians in-house very happy.

728
00:43:48,354 --> 00:43:49,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that makes me happy.

729
00:43:49,515 --> 00:43:51,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Catholic school...

730
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:55,428
[SPEAKER_07]: CatholicSkullGirls in those cute little outfits.

731
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:56,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are hot little skirts.

732
00:43:57,188 --> 00:43:58,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bought a DVD that has those in them.

733
00:43:59,609 --> 00:43:59,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa!

734
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:00,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

735
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:00,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

736
00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:01,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

737
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:02,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

738
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:02,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello!

739
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:03,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been shopping lately?

740
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Castro Street.

741
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:07,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

742
00:44:09,952 --> 00:44:10,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.

743
00:44:11,164 --> 00:44:14,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along, let's talk about Xbox Live Arcade.

744
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:24,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Major Nelson's blog is saying that the Xbox Live Wednesday thing was over with the release of Pac-Man this week, which, by the way, I forgot to mention I did download and play this week.

745
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:26,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pac-Man, you know.

746
00:44:28,228 --> 00:44:29,148
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you're getting into.

747
00:44:29,228 --> 00:44:35,850
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played Pac-Man yet, I don't think you're really a gamer if you haven't played Pac-Man at some point in your life.

748
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what to expect from the Xbox version of Pac-Man.

749
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:40,671
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of frills.

750
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:42,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, you get achievements, but Pac-Man is Pac-Man.

751
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Major Nelson says that's it.

752
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:45,492
[SPEAKER_03]: No more.

753
00:44:45,812 --> 00:44:49,935
[SPEAKER_03]: But the official Xbox magazine seems to be begging to differ a little bit.

754
00:44:49,975 --> 00:44:58,621
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a release schedule, which includes August 16th, Texas Hold'em, August 23rd, Time Pilot, which Jamie was on the ColecoVision at one point.

755
00:44:59,501 --> 00:45:00,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Why you saw that.

756
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:05,846
[SPEAKER_03]: August 30th, Scramble, and September 6th, Luminous Live.

757
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:08,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to there.

758
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:12,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Pilot and Scramble, by the way, are old-ass Konami games, if you've never heard of them.

759
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Time Pilot.

760
00:45:13,191 --> 00:45:17,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played a Time Pilot arcade machine back in the day, and I wasn't half bad at it.

761
00:45:17,313 --> 00:45:22,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who may remember, Nick Arcade Time Pilot was one of the games that they did play on the show.

762
00:45:22,477 --> 00:45:23,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it really?

763
00:45:23,277 --> 00:45:23,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

764
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:24,238
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

765
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:26,239
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the games they played frequently on the show.

766
00:45:27,921 --> 00:45:28,481
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

767
00:45:29,773 --> 00:45:34,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic the Hedgehog, Shinobi, Phantasy Star, Golden Axe

768
00:45:56,013 --> 00:46:02,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Vector Man, Sword of Vermillion, Comic Zone, Alex Kidd, and Ristar was another one mentioned.

769
00:46:04,399 --> 00:46:06,060
[SPEAKER_06]: But those are all games that I'm all over.

770
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it sound like something you're going to get?

771
00:46:08,061 --> 00:46:08,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

772
00:46:09,202 --> 00:46:16,367
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, I'll be really happy because it's actually... I mean, true, that wasn't necessarily a Genesis game.

773
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:17,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my favorite Master System game.

774
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:20,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And that started the whole Alex Kidd thing for me.

775
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:21,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

776
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:25,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this collection sound like something you want to pick up, Loki?

777
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:25,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

778
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:27,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

779
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:28,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for me.

780
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, most of them are already available on GameTap.

781
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:38,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree that there's a certain charm being able to have this stuff on the go, like on the PSP and stuff.

782
00:46:39,114 --> 00:46:42,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Which seems to me like maybe a response to all the emulation scene.

783
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:44,855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the emulators have been going on on the PSP.

784
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:46,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is a response to that.

785
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:50,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, if I was going to go by that standpoint, there wouldn't be any point.

786
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:52,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Because almost all of these games I own Genesis cartridges of.

787
00:46:53,948 --> 00:46:54,188
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

788
00:46:54,588 --> 00:47:04,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but at the same time, it's convenient to have them on one disc so I can sit down with my controller in front of my TV and play them instead of sit in front of my computer.

789
00:47:04,314 --> 00:47:06,995
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to sit in front of my computer and play a game, I'm going to be on Warcraft.

790
00:47:10,817 --> 00:47:12,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep it moving here.

791
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do a comment here in our chat room.

792
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:21,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendomaniac64 says, Sega doesn't seem to realize that a lot of the gamers into Sega stuff have GameCubes.

793
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:22,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So, seeming to think that...

794
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the Sega fans were actually into GameCubes.

795
00:47:28,156 --> 00:47:30,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, possibly, but you know what?

796
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:35,299
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii and the Virtual Console thing I think will take care of most of the Sega fan stuff on there.

797
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,559
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be a problem.

798
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I want to go to this story about Japan.

799
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a very...

800
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Longevity Welcome to the arcades of Tokyo.

801
00:47:45,959 --> 00:47:48,462
[SPEAKER_03]: In Asia and particularly Japan, video game rooms not only live but thrive.

802
00:48:04,796 --> 00:48:12,723
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 9,500 arcades in the country with more than 445,000 game machines made by Japanese companies like Namco and Capcom.

803
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:15,705
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, of course, the story is much different.

804
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:21,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcades are a rapidly dying breed with only about 3,000 in operation down from 10,000 a decade ago.

805
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:25,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Though the popularity of home video systems like the PlayStation contributed to the decline,

806
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:34,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Akagi says that execs at US companies like Midway and Atari simply couldn't see the future in arcades and abandoned the coin-op business.

807
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:40,588
[SPEAKER_03]: And the article kind of goes on to make the speculation that what happened over in Japan as opposed to here is that here...

808
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:45,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the kids who used to go to arcades grew up and moved into home console gaming.

809
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:52,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Japan, most of the kids that played arcades have grown up still going to arcades and still in that whole scene.

810
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:58,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know that Orange Lounge Radio was sort of born of an arcade thing.

811
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We all met playing DDR, which was a big arcade phenomenon at the time.

812
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what you guys think about this story about arcades in Japan versus the U.S.

813
00:49:07,015 --> 00:49:12,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to guess that the arcades in Japan probably are better maintained than the arcades in the United States.

814
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:14,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You think so?

815
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:15,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it?

816
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:16,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

817
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:25,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because, I don't know, the American arcades out there, they just pretty much have them just to kind of fill space, it seems like.

818
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:31,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like at movie theaters, something to kill time for the little kids, you know, get out of mommy and daddy's, you know, hair.

819
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:37,999
[SPEAKER_02]: or like in, you know, Sunsplash or something, you know, just the kill time while you're waiting for water slides or something like that.

820
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday Central.

821
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:39,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthdays, yeah.

822
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,442
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just let the machines go to crap, so.

823
00:49:43,902 --> 00:49:53,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's also this little thing, you know, I think it especially applies to America in general, where they think you hit a certain age, you grow up, you don't do this anymore.

824
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:58,970
[SPEAKER_06]: In your home, you can play your video game, but you don't go out, you know, as an adult and play DDR or

825
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:01,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, of course, I beg to differ with, of course.

826
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:05,056
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's still that... It's still sort of taboo, you know.

827
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:06,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to be grown up.

828
00:50:07,919 --> 00:50:11,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, because I noticed even when we were playing DDR, we used to get a lot of funny stares.

829
00:50:11,882 --> 00:50:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are those guys doing?

830
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:17,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't they, you know, be accounting or something?

831
00:50:18,128 --> 00:50:19,329
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so gay!

832
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:22,592
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in a good way.

833
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:25,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

834
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:28,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really hate that.

835
00:50:28,064 --> 00:50:30,985
[SPEAKER_03]: People who don't know any better, they go, DDR so gay.

836
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:35,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so what if it has flashing pink lights and, you know, Madonna music?

837
00:50:35,227 --> 00:50:38,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's something everybody can have fun with, right?

838
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:43,469
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still, though, I think it's just a whole matter of attitude, you know.

839
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:49,071
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, you know, 40-year-old businessmen in Japan get off work and go play DDR or poppin' music or something.

840
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:50,291
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not gay.

841
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:50,971
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

842
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we don't know that.

843
00:50:52,432 --> 00:50:53,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they might be.

844
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:53,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Some might be.

845
00:50:53,632 --> 00:50:54,593
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

846
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:55,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

847
00:50:55,173 --> 00:50:55,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if they're gay?

848
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:57,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzi, you have a thought on this?

849
00:50:58,007 --> 00:50:58,187
What?

850
00:50:58,527 --> 00:50:59,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a thought on this?

851
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:03,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I see you with the mic, so I thought... Are you an arcade gamer?

852
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:04,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, somewhat.

853
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:07,551
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is an arcade, I will play in it.

854
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:10,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been to an arcade in Japan?

855
00:51:10,372 --> 00:51:10,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have.

856
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, what was it like when you were there?

857
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:19,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was only there for a little bit because our train was leaving, but it was very well kept, from what I remember.

858
00:51:19,337 --> 00:51:20,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's the difference.

859
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:23,579
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is, in Japan, they play Beatmania.

860
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:26,040
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, they beat their spouse.

861
00:51:30,322 --> 00:51:30,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

862
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:32,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Your logic is infallible.

863
00:51:33,264 --> 00:51:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

864
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:35,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm awesome.

865
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we need to know.

866
00:51:36,546 --> 00:51:38,127
[SPEAKER_06]: By infallible, I mean not really.

867
00:51:39,848 --> 00:51:51,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of couples not getting along here, one couple, the E3 little guys and the ESA, you know those wonderful Kensha Hall exhibitors?

868
00:51:51,536 --> 00:51:54,978
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really getting along too well with the ESA.

869
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,921
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the ESA sent out some letters to these

870
00:51:59,865 --> 00:52:05,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Small Kitchen Hall people kind of informing them of what's going on with E3 next year.

871
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:21,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically they said, as you may have read in the press releases, the E3 Expo has officially been cancelled and it's involving and matured over the last 12 years and now the needs of the exhibitors and the key attendees has also changed.

872
00:52:22,228 --> 00:52:28,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it should also say in, like, fine print, by the way, you're not a key attendee because you do not have, you know, booth in the bigger hall.

873
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,131
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fuck you.

874
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:34,392
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ESA essentially wrote these people a letter that says, K, thanks, bye.

875
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:39,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, it's basically like this.

876
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:44,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dear people from Kenja Hall, it's not you, it's us.

877
00:52:44,936 --> 00:52:47,617
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to see other people.

878
00:52:48,357 --> 00:52:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

879
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could be friends.

880
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:59,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Some days, Kensha Hall, I just want to cuddle.

881
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:02,173
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys are so demanding.

882
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:10,401
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand that my life is moving on and I need to move on too.

883
00:53:10,542 --> 00:53:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need some distance.

884
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere, profound gratitude for your past support of this event.

885
00:53:20,779 --> 00:53:28,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been exciting and rewarding to see the growth and significance of this industry mirrored on the exhibit floor of the E3 Expo through the years.

886
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:33,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to many years of industry growth and viability and opportunity without you.

887
00:53:33,403 --> 00:53:35,783
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically added there on the end there.

888
00:53:37,444 --> 00:53:37,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

889
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, but that'd be funny.

890
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:46,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie, though, Red Octane, I mean, with all due respect to Red Octane and the Guitar Heroes, it's a fluke.

891
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:49,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody expected Guitar Hero to do as well as it did.

892
00:53:49,625 --> 00:53:53,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Them being there, you know, it was a fluke.

893
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:54,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I expected it to do well.

894
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:58,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but I'm talking about, you know, we're different because we've always loved music.

895
00:53:58,431 --> 00:53:59,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're different.

896
00:53:59,252 --> 00:53:59,832
[SPEAKER_03]: We're special.

897
00:54:00,233 --> 00:54:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking about like the mainstream folks.

898
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:09,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody would have thought Guitar Hero would have done as well as it really did until people actually played it and found out, wow, it's actually kind of fun.

899
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

900
00:54:11,234 --> 00:54:12,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the whole Red Octane is a fluke.

901
00:54:12,776 --> 00:54:17,199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think had there been an E3 next year, Red Octane would have graduated to the big hall.

902
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:20,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to go to the big boy chair, Red Octane!

903
00:54:20,903 --> 00:54:21,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to laugh.

904
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:25,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Fry's this week, an electronic store that we have over here.

905
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this giant.

906
00:54:27,388 --> 00:54:32,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was watching this woman watch her son play Guitar Hero, and she kept yelling at him.

907
00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:36,636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like watching someone play DDR instead of saying, Left!

908
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:37,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

909
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:37,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Right!

910
00:54:37,717 --> 00:54:37,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

911
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:38,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

912
00:54:38,577 --> 00:54:39,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

913
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

914
00:54:39,718 --> 00:54:40,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

915
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:40,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Red!

916
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not helping.

917
00:54:43,582 --> 00:54:43,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

918
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:45,404
I can see that it's green.

919
00:54:46,705 --> 00:55:00,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the ESA has some good news coming their way, and it has to do with the state of Illinois is being told to pay the ESA a half a million dollars for messing up.

920
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:01,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time.

921
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:18,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what happened is that, let's see, it's not just half a million, it's $510,528.64, and the reason why they have to do it is because they did an unconstitutional effort to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games.

922
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:24,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, you know, legal fees, blah, blah, blah, it adds up.

923
00:55:25,809 --> 00:55:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

924
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:38,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, if controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in promoting the positive psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly accorded to parents and families, not the state.

925
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: That coming from Judge Matthew F. Kennelly.

926
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:43,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for him.

927
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:45,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully this will set a precedence.

928
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:50,650
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had these, what is it, in Minnesota and these other states trying to pass the same thing?

929
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:52,573
[SPEAKER_06]: In Wisconsin?

930
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:53,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

931
00:55:53,834 --> 00:56:00,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this needs to really be a shining example to them of what's going to happen when they try to violate our rights.

932
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the ESA had a field day.

933
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:06,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, Judge Kenley's ruling sent two irrefutable messages.

934
00:56:06,264 --> 00:56:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are efforts to ban the sale of violent video games clearly unconstitutional, they are a waste of taxpayer dollars.

935
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:12,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

936
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,813
[SPEAKER_03]: So the taxpayers not only get to pay for them to... Yep.

937
00:56:15,913 --> 00:56:19,516
[SPEAKER_03]: The sad fact is that the state of Illinois's new... Illinois, sorry...

938
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: knew this law was unconstitutional from the beginning.

939
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:29,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Taxpayers have a right to know that over half a million of their dollars in countless government hours were thrown away in this fruitless effort.

940
00:56:29,446 --> 00:56:37,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably more than half a million dollars because, you know, to actually propose this bill and stuff, you know, all those luncheons that they have to hold in order to pass this stuff.

941
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:40,745
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lobbyists, of course.

942
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:46,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzy, Macman in our chat room is also from Wisconsin and says, Wisconsin sucks.

943
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:46,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I live there.

944
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:48,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree, Megzy?

945
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you're nodding your head.

946
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:50,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree Wisconsin sucks?

947
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:51,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does.

948
00:56:51,612 --> 00:56:52,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a place for gamers?

949
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:53,153
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

950
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:57,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're in Madison, then come visit my GameStop.

951
00:56:57,536 --> 00:56:57,996
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

952
00:56:58,336 --> 00:56:58,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I work there.

953
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get hit on by boys at the GameStop?

954
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:02,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

955
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:03,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get hit on by girls at the GameStop?

956
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:04,280
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

957
00:57:05,101 --> 00:57:05,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

958
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have any, you know,

959
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Girls Who Like Girls, and Madison.

960
00:57:09,267 --> 00:57:11,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they need to be... Oh, wait, no, she's taken.

961
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You better not... Mine!

962
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:17,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris will come out there and cut you off.

963
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:21,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean your hair.

964
00:57:22,592 --> 00:57:27,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, when taxpayer dollars are wasted, we get angsty, don't we, DarkSakura?

965
00:57:27,234 --> 00:57:27,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yes.

966
00:57:27,994 --> 00:57:29,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when we get angsty?

967
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:31,876
[SPEAKER_06]: People die!

968
00:57:40,552 --> 00:57:42,993
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's bring on the FUs of the week, DarkSakura.

969
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:45,093
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes toward the sun.

970
00:57:46,114 --> 00:57:48,895
[SPEAKER_06]: The bright shining orb in the sky.

971
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:55,076
[SPEAKER_06]: For leeching all of my energy, burning my chest, my poor boots are burnt.

972
00:57:56,417 --> 00:57:59,138
[SPEAKER_06]: And making me really sleepy to where I almost fell asleep on the road five times.

973
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:01,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, sun!

974
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:03,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

975
00:58:04,644 --> 00:58:05,124
[SPEAKER_02]: My F.U.

976
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:10,666
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to people that are extremely rude when it comes to parking their cars or not being able to park in their spaces.

977
00:58:11,066 --> 00:58:19,389
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this guy today when I was going to get my smoothie and... Why is that funny?

978
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:22,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't have a fruit smoothie?

979
00:58:23,391 --> 00:58:24,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall I explain?

980
00:58:24,811 --> 00:58:27,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoothie amongst us is a euphemism for lesbian sex.

981
00:58:32,694 --> 00:58:34,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big cup of smoothie then.

982
00:58:35,295 --> 00:58:38,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly I want nothing but Frappuccinos for the rest of my life.

983
00:58:41,176 --> 00:58:42,336
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a Frappuccino mean?

984
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:43,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's gay sex.

985
00:58:44,577 --> 00:58:45,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

986
00:58:45,277 --> 00:58:46,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll take plenty of Frappuccino.

987
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:47,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

988
00:58:47,418 --> 00:58:48,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's been a while since I've had a Frappuccino.

989
00:58:49,278 --> 00:58:50,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Loki, sorry.

990
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:53,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there's some jackass that was sitting there.

991
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,101
[SPEAKER_02]: His car had both of the doors open, wide open, and the guy was nowhere to be seen in his car.

992
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:01,441
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just sitting down...

993
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:05,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoying, you know, a coffee or something in front of the Starbucks that happens to be next door.

994
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:12,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know, it's just really fucking rude when people, you know, park their cars, especially with the doors open, or especially over the line.

995
00:59:12,864 --> 00:59:18,628
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get those wonderful SUVs, they're like, my car's too big for one space, so I'm gonna park in two compact spaces.

996
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:24,433
[SPEAKER_02]: But your car's not compact, so you shouldn't be parking in one compact space, let alone both of them.

997
00:59:26,254 --> 00:59:26,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is that it?

998
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:27,435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

999
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:31,518
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week would have to go towards Sangria,

1000
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:41,203
[SPEAKER_03]: for having some type of unexplainable control over me because I drank a lot of it on Thursday and I drank a lot of it on Friday.

1001
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:45,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm typically not a lush, but Sangria makes me want to be because it's really yummy.

1002
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:49,225
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're under 21, you shouldn't drink Sangria.

1003
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:50,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.

1004
00:59:51,765 --> 00:59:53,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to get out?

1005
00:59:53,586 --> 00:59:54,446
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, actually.

1006
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on.

1007
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:57,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on?

1008
00:59:57,227 --> 00:59:57,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1009
00:59:57,447 --> 00:59:57,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1010
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:04,580
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to homeless people in San Francisco, and I don't mean all of them.

1011
01:00:05,481 --> 01:00:12,587
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to the Castro District today, which, for those of you who do not know, is the gay and lesbian district of San Francisco.

1012
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:24,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were walking by, and there's a homeless guy just relaxing on the side of the street where everybody and their mother were walking, and his penis was just hanging right out.

1013
01:00:25,915 --> 01:00:26,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a dollar!

1014
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:30,038
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just laying there, just hanging out.

1015
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:31,359
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't even impressive either.

1016
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:32,040
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't.

1017
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a store right next to us with a big dong.

1018
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so he's just lying on, I assume this is Market Street?

1019
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:40,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what is this?

1020
01:00:40,786 --> 01:00:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Castro.

1021
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:47,671
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's just, well, I mean, okay, having someone's cock hanging out in the middle of Castro Street is not that uncommon, I hate to tell you.

1022
01:00:47,891 --> 01:00:48,872
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't impressive.

1023
01:00:49,372 --> 01:00:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I see.

1024
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:53,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I want an impressive cock when I go down Castro Street.

1025
01:00:53,595 --> 01:00:53,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1026
01:00:57,168 --> 01:00:59,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh, Megsy, do you have any interviews of the week you'd like to get out?

1027
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:00,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1028
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:07,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I've got one, uh, me and Chris went up to, uh, Santa Cruz and went to... Oh, yeah.

1029
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:14,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And went to the boardwalk, uh, and we were sitting on the beach, um, drawing stick figure porn in the sand.

1030
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:21,367
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, we looked over and we were commenting on how there are some people who should just not wear bathing suits.

1031
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:24,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, mostly old guys...

1032
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:26,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wearing, like, the Speedo suits?

1033
01:01:26,837 --> 01:01:27,558
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets better, hold on.

1034
01:01:27,638 --> 01:01:28,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

1035
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:31,582
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as we were saying that, we look over, and there's this old guy.

1036
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:36,146
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, like, he's gotta be, like, late 40s, early 50s.

1037
01:01:37,507 --> 01:01:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dark tan.

1038
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:44,873
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dark tan, balding, all hairy, he's all hairy.

1039
01:01:45,073 --> 01:01:46,815
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got, like, the bling bling.

1040
01:01:48,797 --> 01:01:52,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's got this towel around him, and I'm just like, oh my god, there's one of them.

1041
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:57,129
[SPEAKER_05]: and when he takes the towel off, he has a bright red Speedo.

1042
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,450
[SPEAKER_07]: With the Brazilian wax.

1043
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:05,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking and trying to determine if he was waxed or not.

1044
01:02:05,632 --> 01:02:09,154
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't see, we were kind of far away, but I think he was.

1045
01:02:10,815 --> 01:02:11,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

1046
01:02:11,775 --> 01:02:12,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gets better.

1047
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:12,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

1048
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:14,618
[SPEAKER_05]: One more.

1049
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:25,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, not only did this guy have the audacity to go out of the house, but also wear a bright red Speedo on the beach, his girlfriend or his wife or something started taking pictures of him.

1050
01:02:26,065 --> 01:02:27,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started posing for these pictures.

1051
01:02:29,888 --> 01:02:31,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And adjusting himself.

1052
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am not making this up.

1053
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not exaggerating at all.

1054
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:36,192
[SPEAKER_03]: We have pictures.

1055
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:37,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Pokemon Snap.

1056
01:02:40,655 --> 01:02:40,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1057
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:46,792
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in other countries, it's okay to wear a Speedo on the beach.

1058
01:02:46,852 --> 01:02:48,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times, the people wearing them are pretty hot.

1059
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I've seen pictures on the internet, you know.

1060
01:02:51,213 --> 01:02:52,114
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy was not hot.

1061
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1062
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought he was.

1063
01:02:54,394 --> 01:02:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1064
01:02:55,034 --> 01:02:55,775
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the sad part.

1065
01:02:55,955 --> 01:02:56,615
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unfortunate.

1066
01:02:56,935 --> 01:02:57,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to tell about the other one?

1067
01:02:58,656 --> 01:02:58,856
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1068
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:03,137
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we better get back into games or we're going to get those angry emails, you know, and those reviews.

1069
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:05,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1070
01:03:06,012 --> 01:03:07,493
[SPEAKER_01]: They never talk about games.

1071
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,254
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about guys in Speedos.

1072
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:11,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Orange Lounge.

1073
01:03:11,256 --> 01:03:13,177
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you, DarkSakura.

1074
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:13,918
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so mean.

1075
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:14,839
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1076
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:16,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck a whole bunch of them.

1077
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,721
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in a good way.

1078
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:18,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean like with a pogo stick.

1079
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,823
[SPEAKER_03]: No frappuccinos or smoothies for them?

1080
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:23,205
[SPEAKER_03]: No frappuccinos, no smoothies.

1081
01:03:23,285 --> 01:03:25,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I've decided the euphemism for straight sex is potato.

1082
01:03:26,688 --> 01:03:26,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's

1083
01:03:27,694 --> 01:03:28,655

1085
01:03:29,775 --> 01:03:29,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

1086
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:30,496

01:08:31,969 --> 01:08:32,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1167
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:37,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, more bad news for Sony, honestly.

1168
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,271
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this blogger, and you probably have seen this around the internet.

1169
01:08:40,311 --> 01:08:44,072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten dug in a lot of places, just for the sheer irony of it.

1170
01:08:44,972 --> 01:08:47,793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this editor for the official PlayStation magazine.

1171
01:08:47,873 --> 01:09:00,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Dana J., and she wrote this thing on her 1UP blog about how she plans on buying an Xbox 360 this November, even though she works for the official PlayStation magazine.

1172
01:09:00,976 --> 01:09:06,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically saying that when they announced that the price would be $600, she found her enthusiasm sagging.

1173
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:07,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quote.

1174
01:09:38,487 --> 01:09:44,412
[SPEAKER_03]: and most of the big guns, Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, won't be hitting for quite some time after the launch.

1175
01:09:45,493 --> 01:09:47,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a big ouch.

1176
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:49,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But people seem to love that story because of the irony.

1177
01:09:49,636 --> 01:09:52,138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is, but whatever.

1178
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:53,659
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

1179
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:57,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just more pouring salt in the wounds of Sony, or what?

1180
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:58,643
[SPEAKER_05]: They deserve them.

1181
01:09:59,564 --> 01:10:01,245
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really against PS3?

1182
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:03,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

1183
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:03,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1184
01:10:04,168 --> 01:10:04,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1185
01:10:04,827 --> 01:10:11,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have my theories about PS3, but it doesn't seem like it's worth the $600 price tag at all.

1186
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:15,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, I kind of have a little vendetta against Sony.

1187
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:17,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I want to hear about this.

1188
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:18,156
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the vendetta against Sony?

1189
01:10:21,118 --> 01:10:27,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, I'll tell you the truth, is that I get a lot of stupid Sony fanboys in my store.

1190
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:29,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about Sony fanboys.

1191
01:10:29,284 --> 01:10:29,684
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

1192
01:10:30,723 --> 01:10:31,263
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?

1193
01:10:32,003 --> 01:10:32,643
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes them stupid?

1194
01:10:32,944 --> 01:10:46,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they'll say stuff, they'll come in and tell me how great PS3 is going to be, and I'll say, well, I'm not really looking forward to it, there's nothing I really like on it.

1195
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll try to convince me why I should get a PS3, and I'm looking at this guy saying, dude, I work in the...

1196
01:10:52,106 --> 01:10:54,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I know what I want.

1197
01:10:54,028 --> 01:10:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm wearing probably this Mario shirt, you know, saying I want to get a Wii, not a PS3.

1198
01:10:58,551 --> 01:10:59,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like my PS2.

1199
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:04,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got cool RPGs on it, but for the most part, I don't like Sony.

1200
01:11:06,957 --> 01:11:12,000
[SPEAKER_06]: After having played PS3 games, you are 100% correct.

1201
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:12,821
[SPEAKER_06]: They are crap.

1202
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, because you make a good point at the end.

1203
01:11:16,701 --> 01:11:17,922
[SPEAKER_03]: You love the PlayStation 2.

1204
01:11:18,422 --> 01:11:19,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love the PlayStation 2.

1205
01:11:19,522 --> 01:11:20,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all love the PlayStation 2.

1206
01:11:20,903 --> 01:11:26,345
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why we all look at the PlayStation 3 and go, just keep putting out PS2 games, honestly.

1207
01:11:26,385 --> 01:11:28,085
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's where you're going to go, just don't even bother.

1208
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:33,027
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to understand is, look at all these other console wars that have been going on.

1209
01:11:33,327 --> 01:11:36,028
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.

1210
01:11:37,549 --> 01:11:39,610
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox and PlayStation 2.

1211
01:11:41,861 --> 01:11:46,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed a big, giant difference between the games that come out on both platforms?

1212
01:11:46,946 --> 01:11:49,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they look almost the same.

1213
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:53,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're very much the same.

1214
01:11:53,692 --> 01:12:07,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so, what makes you think that they're going to all of a sudden, you know, hey, let's develop a game for the 360, and let's just spend some extra time on making a completely different game, but it's actually the same game for the PlayStation 3 with better graphics, but...

1215
01:12:07,952 --> 01:12:08,252
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1216
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:11,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to spend the money to develop those games.

1217
01:12:11,474 --> 01:12:12,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

1218
01:12:12,135 --> 01:12:15,276
[SPEAKER_02]: They can port the same game over and it'll be just fine on both systems.

1219
01:12:15,357 --> 01:12:17,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go over to the chat room real quick for some comments.

1220
01:12:17,498 --> 01:12:19,119
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLawnRadio.com, click on chat.

1221
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,042
[SPEAKER_03]: FireResurrected of the OL Army would like to say, Amen, lesbian co-host person.

1222
01:12:26,423 --> 01:12:26,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1223
01:12:27,504 --> 01:12:31,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Macman says, But the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray, it is God in writable media.

1224
01:12:32,367 --> 01:12:32,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

1225
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:35,569
[SPEAKER_06]: If by God they mean, you know, God of BCs.

1226
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackboy says the $500 PS3 isn't really so lame.

1227
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:41,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

1228
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:44,028
[SPEAKER_03]: People are allowed to have difference of opinion.

1229
01:12:44,608 --> 01:12:50,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says, damn, I wish I could resist the PS3, but I'm just going to shell out $600 plus for it anyway.

1230
01:12:53,183 --> 01:12:54,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a consumer whore.

1231
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:20,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and to be honest, all the other games that are out there, like even FlatOut 2, or not FlatOut 2, Full Auto 2 was the one for me.

1232
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:21,531
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ooh, that looks really good.

1233
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:24,754
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's coming out on the 360 later on, and so it's not a big deal.

1234
01:13:25,555 --> 01:13:34,842
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think is going to be really interesting is seeing what their marketing campaign is going to be for this, and seeing how they're going to try to convince people to spend the $600 for it.

1235
01:13:35,763 --> 01:13:38,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're going to see that, because those 1080p TVs out there,

1236
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I know because I'm pricing them right now.

1237
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,056
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like three grand.

1238
01:13:45,076 --> 01:13:49,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm sure there's going to be some angry Sony fanboys out there that want to write angry emails.

1239
01:13:49,778 --> 01:13:51,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, I hate you.

1240
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:52,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're a dick.

1241
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,720
[SPEAKER_03]: We welcome those emails.

1242
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and maybe we'll read some on next week.

1243
01:13:59,082 --> 01:14:02,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you letting that lesbian speak on your show about PlayStation?

1244
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:03,284
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't know what she's talking about.

1245
01:14:04,285 --> 01:14:05,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to munching carpet.

1246
01:14:05,485 --> 01:14:05,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so...

1247
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:16,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com So, no, if you have an intelligent rebuttal, we would happily read your emails on air.

1248
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you write something stupid, we're just going to forward it to Megzi.

1249
01:14:19,584 --> 01:14:20,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

1250
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:24,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to see the PS3 do well.

1251
01:14:24,466 --> 01:14:28,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see them launch it with a new, like, Twisted Metal game.

1252
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:29,969
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been awesome.

1253
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:37,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have sold the system for me, but, you know, to be honest, right now they seem to be a step behind everybody, and the fact that they haven't released any details about

1254
01:14:38,635 --> 01:14:40,796
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly their online service is going to be.

1255
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think, to be honest, they don't know what it's going to be like right now.

1256
01:14:44,698 --> 01:14:46,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think they have that stuff finalized yet.

1257
01:14:47,139 --> 01:14:55,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So until I hear some more details about how wonderful this system is, based on specs and price alone, I'm not going to be buying it at launch.

1258
01:14:56,264 --> 01:14:56,784
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1259
01:14:58,025 --> 01:15:01,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's change the tune to something happier.

1260
01:15:02,047 --> 01:15:03,228
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, don't you agree?

1261
01:15:03,748 --> 01:15:03,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1262
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:11,812
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura always likes to make us happy by surfing the internet and telling us about her happy place on the internet this week and sharing it with the internet.

1263
01:15:12,192 --> 01:15:14,934
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, what is your happy website of the week?

1264
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:20,197
[SPEAKER_06]: My webpage of the week is MrPinball.

1265
01:15:21,398 --> 01:15:26,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's www.xmission.com slash tilde d-a-i-n-a

1266
01:15:26,806 --> 01:15:33,429
[SPEAKER_06]: slash pinball.html And basically, Mr. Pinball is a site they restore, buy, sell, trade, repair pinball machines.

1267
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:37,311
[SPEAKER_06]: They have classified ads, pricing guides, t-shirts, hats, mugs, and more!

1268
01:15:37,811 --> 01:15:41,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Repair tips of the day, pinball collector registry, pinball machine photos.

1269
01:15:42,293 --> 01:15:49,336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably one of the oldest pinball sites on the internet as far as information tips, that type of thing.

1270
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:50,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So, go check it out.

1271
01:15:51,477 --> 01:15:51,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1272
01:15:53,138 --> 01:15:54,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1273
01:15:54,959 --> 01:15:55,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

1274
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:03,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi.

1275
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:04,384
[SPEAKER_03]: My turn, huh?

1276
01:16:04,444 --> 01:16:04,784
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1277
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, I have one more.

1278
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:09,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you started talking.

1279
01:16:09,227 --> 01:16:10,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you had the next story.

1280
01:16:10,508 --> 01:16:14,190
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki's sitting there going, I can make up a story.

1281
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:18,293
[SPEAKER_06]: He's saying that I was awesome and that my taste in websites is, yeah.

1282
01:16:18,353 --> 01:16:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought, weren't we going to do Orange Lounge Lying Radio or something one week?

1283
01:16:21,575 --> 01:16:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody calls us liars anyway.

1284
01:16:23,236 --> 01:16:26,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to come up with the Orange Lounge Radio Fib Game News of the Week?

1285
01:16:27,058 --> 01:16:28,499
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fib Game News of the Week?

1286
01:16:28,579 --> 01:16:28,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1287
01:16:29,401 --> 01:16:30,361
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 being good?

1288
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:31,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Megzy has one.

1289
01:16:31,742 --> 01:16:34,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's our not-true Orange Lounge Radio news story of the week.

1290
01:16:35,263 --> 01:16:39,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has just announced that the PS3 will also include a George Foreman grill.

1291
01:16:42,205 --> 01:16:48,307
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 3 has already sold over 50 million units before its launch, making it the fastest system to ever reach that number.

1292
01:16:48,327 --> 01:16:48,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

1293
01:16:49,307 --> 01:16:50,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first on Orange Lounge Radio.

1294
01:16:50,988 --> 01:16:52,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I just bought mine off eBay.

1295
01:16:52,188 --> 01:16:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll also do your laundry and your homework.

1296
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,379
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll suck your lollipop clean.

1297
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:04,882
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones you buy at Disneyland, the happiest place on earth because pure people like to go to Disneyland.

1298
01:17:06,582 --> 01:17:08,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, here's a true article.

1299
01:17:09,163 --> 01:17:09,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I got one more.

1300
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:10,264
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1301
01:17:10,364 --> 01:17:10,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

1302
01:17:12,225 --> 01:17:12,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1303
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:22,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Landfill in San Francisco this week actually started rumbling from all the dual shocks that have been buried in there causing an earthquake, you know.

1304
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:25,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is ironic because, you know, San Francisco gets a lot of earthquakes, so.

1305
01:17:28,735 --> 01:17:29,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1306
01:17:31,878 --> 01:17:32,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

1307
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:36,242
[SPEAKER_03]: This story's true, even though some people think it's a lie.

1308
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:40,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is true, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, the Burning Crusade.

1309
01:17:40,546 --> 01:17:44,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people get their characters to 60, and then it's all about the endgame.

1310
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:45,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Endgame, endinggame, endgame.

1311
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:46,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

1312
01:17:47,597 --> 01:17:50,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Endgames have typically been 40-man raids.

1313
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:53,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, so on and so on.

1314
01:17:53,201 --> 01:17:59,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not going to change, but what's going to happen is that the new endgames in the Burning Crusade, they're going to be capped at 25 people.

1315
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:09,194
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks are going to have to get used to all new party setups and all new strategies for endgame battle because you're going to be reduced in the amount of people you can take on those raids.

1316
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:13,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So no more taking along Leroy Jenkins just for comic value anymore.

1317
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:20,958
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to take along folks who definitely know what they're doing and won't run into battle before you're all ready.

1318
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,771
[SPEAKER_03]: But the chicken will still be good, FYI.

1319
01:18:26,272 --> 01:18:29,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's going to do it for the end of this segment of Orange Lounge Radio.

1320
01:18:29,674 --> 01:18:33,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on the live show, we're going to take a break, and that means our podcast is going to get split at this point.

1321
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:39,021
[SPEAKER_03]: But be sure to tune in later this week for Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

1322
01:18:39,382 --> 01:18:40,763
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be back right after this.

1323
01:18:41,303 --> 01:18:46,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1324
01:18:46,727 --> 01:18:51,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
