Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 196 for this, August the 20th of 2006.
And we're in part B of our podcast.
Thank you guys so much for downloading us on iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast or whatever podcast program you decided to use to check us out.
We really appreciate it.
You're supporting independent radio and that is quite awesome.
So thank you guys very much.
We're here to celebrate the gamer lifestyle and gaming culture.
and you know anybody can just repeat what you read on gamer blogs but you know when it's real people and real gamers been doing this for a while talking about it we like to think it puts a different angle on everything so thank you guys for checking us out so we're gonna get right back into the news and kind of along with independent gaming I guess this kind of fits into that whole thing doesn't it Loki exactly because if you want to make an independent game and have it on live then you're in luck
Microsoft is actually releasing a new package called XNA that will help you do that.
It's going to be some development tools and libraries to help develop a game and actually eventually get it onto live arcade or something like that.
It is going to cost you though to get it actually onto live and all that stuff.
$99 I believe.
But you can develop it free and at least be able to upload it to your own Xbox or whatever.
But
Yeah, it should be pretty cool.
Details on it are a bit scarce right now, but they are going to be adding some info coming up in the next couple weeks here when it actually launches.
So it's actually pretty cool though.
And basically, like I said, the $99 subscription or whatever per year allows you to become part of this Creators Club, which will offer you downloadable samples of games to help you get your stuff created.
Also, um,
Thanks for watching!
But this is a neat idea.
I really like the idea of, you know, some of these games that we see created could graduate to Xbox Live, essentially, and really buff up the Xbox Live community.
I think it's kind of a smart response, in a way, to Nintendo's Virtual Console, which will have many, many, many games on it to start.
It's kind of a way for Xbox Live Arcade to sort of buff up, so to speak.
And this also says that they're going to... The subscription also gets you a copy of the runtime libraries for...
And that's why some people like it
Well said.
BlackWolf says, you can't send a game you wrote for the 360, send to someone who does not pay that $99 a year.
True, but hypothetically, games made with this, what I was saying is that games made with this could, like the cream of the crop, could graduate to regular Xbox 360, right?
Yeah.
That's the idea, I hope.
So that would be kind of neat.
Yeah, so that's kind of what they're hoping for, at least.
All right.
Devil May Cry, Sins Remembered
Evil Unleashed is a gaming site that has an interview with the director in which he talks about how it's been challenging to bring Devil May Cry to the screen.
Quote, did not want to see a film that was completely from their own writers as it would not be a pure representation of what I could offer them as a filmmaker.
It's only going to be a 50 minute picture and it's basically kind of being used to sort of promote R.L.
Scott as a filmmaker, but hey, it's Devil May Cry.
He has worked on some other...
Hollywood Productions as well, including The Legend of Bagger Vance and Underworld.
So we'll see.
He's going to be using this promo to try and sell a full-length feature called Devil Hunter.
So we'll see how good this movie actually is.
It sounds like it's going to be shown at DragonCon.
It should be interesting for those of you folks that are attending.
And I understand our good buddy Bobby Blackwell is actually going to be on a podcasting panel there, kind of similar to what we did at Fonamay.
And I think the whole thing is airing on all games.
So check that out, a little closer to DragonCon.
That's pretty cool.
and especially if you're looking for the game movies probably the biggest game movie you're going to be looking for forward to I should say well maybe not the biggest game movie there is going to be a Hitman movie script that's actually leaked out and Latino Review of course the usual suspect for reviewing those types of scripts since they actually reviewed I think the Halo 3 script maybe I can't remember I know they've gotten their hands on like Transformers and stuff but anyways
They have a review of the Hitman script, and they said that it's actually going to be pretty good as far as the movie goes.
Whether this is going to be one of the better adaptations out there right now, of course, I think the mark's going to be set by Halo 3, whenever the hell that gets out.
The mark will definitely not be set by Dead or Alive, the movie, because that's going to suck.
But lots of TNA, I hope.
But anyways, moving on, we've got some stuff for Chromehounds.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I know you can actually go to the online store in Chromehounds once you've purchased them and buy an infinite amount of them.
I haven't really played enough Chromehounds to really tell, so why don't you answer that question because you've actually played Chromehounds.
Is it going to be worth the points?
I don't know.
I mean, I think 100 points for all of them would be good, but it's like 160 points for each one, and there's about, you know... Well, if people buy horse armor, I mean...
There's gonna be somebody that buys this.
But you know what, though?
A horse armor's... I don't know, unless you're really hardcore in the armored core, then maybe.
But the only thing I don't like about it is you don't really know what the parts are until you actually buy them.
So, I mean, you don't know what the stats are on them.
That's a little different.
And I think that's kind of one thing that, you know, maybe the PlayStation 3 will have an advantage of over, like, say, the marketplace...
And on live right now, you actually get to see, you know, say if you're going to purchase tracks or whatever, you can see it in the game and see the specs for it.
Then use your Microsoft points to buy, you know, well, Sony points, whatever you're going to call them, to buy those items.
Whereas this, it's kind of like Light Arms 1.
Hmm, well, what the hell is that, you know, so.
Yeah, I'll probably buy them.
Because I'm a sucker for that crap.
This isn't too much of a surprise when you consider we had a story about six months ago or so when Guitar Hero was first getting big that said they wanted to do a variety of sequels to Guitar Hero.
So, I don't know.
Is this going to be oversaturation?
I wonder if they'll make a sequel and the game will actually be good.
You're like the one person that doesn't like Guitar Hero.
Why don't you like Guitar Hero?
It's not fun and I hate the music.
But you like Guitar Freaks, right?
I like it just a little more, which means I still don't like it.
Huh.
I had to ask, I had to ask.
No, they need the hat.
They should have Madonna Hero.
Somebody in the chatroom agrees with me.
Saikun says Guitar Hero blows.
That's two people.
I'm sure that there is going to be a backlash against Guitar Hero because of the uber popularity the game has had.
I like Guitar Hero.
It's a great game.
The only thing that ruffles my feathers is when people say it's this original new concept that's never been done before.
That bugs me too.
Or when people say that Beatmania was a copy of Guitar Hero.
I'm like, uh, no.
I'll say it before, I'll say it again Guitar Hero made music games like that accessible
Yeah, yeah.
Made it mainstream.
That's absolutely right.
And of course, there are the people who are going to hate it because they're into you now because it made it into mainstream.
Sad but true, it's a game where people are going to look at it and they're not inclined to go, that's gay.
Like, you know, when people are playing DDR, you have the, you know, stupid a-holes that walk by the machine and look at the people playing DDR and go, that's gay.
Yet, for some reason, playing a plastic guitar in the middle of your living room is not gay.
Actually, that's funny because we have one of my...
Boss is at work.
He's a guitarist.
And when we did the interview with the local news station here, and I got a copy of the game finally, I showed him it, and he's all pretty much, that's gay.
It kind of is funny when you think about it.
He's all, that's crap.
That's not a real guitar.
That's a toy.
How about with all these Guitar Hero sequels, we get Guitar Hero gay?
I mean, SingStar did it, right?
Oh, God.
We already have Karaoke Revolution for that.
The Karaoke Revolution is cool!
And they have the country one, which would totally not be gay.
Now, Karaoke Revolution American Idol, I don't know, sounds pretty gay to me.
You don't know the song list.
I'm assuming the song list is probably... Since it is licensed through American Idol, I'm assuming we've got Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia, Ruben... You can assume all you want, but just hold your reservations.
Alright, fine.
I'll hold my reservations for a few more days, and then... Once it gets fully announced with the song list, then you can say...
Well, that's a terrible game.
Like I say, but until then, you're not allowed to say that.
Harry K. Ames sums it up very well in our chatroom.
People who use gay as an insult are gay.
But I don't use it as an insult.
Rob probably does.
I do.
Loser.
Fine, but now I want to be like, that's homosexual.
Then you're from the Midwest.
But gay, no, look, look.
Gay means two things.
Gay means happy and gay means likes to, is a man that likes to date other men or a woman who likes to date other women.
It's like a dual meaning thing.
Hey, you know what?
This is off topic, so why don't you get back on topic?
Great.
All right, one thing that is definitely not gay is Epix.
Remember Epix?
They were a big company on the Commodore 64.
No, okay, how about Impossible Mission?
I don't know any of these games.
California Games?
I remember California Games.
There you go, thank you.
Okay, look, Epix has been dormant for a long, long time.
System 3 is the development house that changed its name to Studio 3 and then back to System 3, and they are bringing back the Epyx name as well as Epyx Games.
In January, System 3 is going to release Impossible Mission for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS.
Stay a while, stay forever!
If you've ever played Impossible Mission, you'll get that.
Oh god, that was my favorite Commodore 64 game.
Oh my, yes, that's what that does for me, is nostalgia squee all over, definitely.
Hopefully it's better than the Impossible Mission 2 that was on the Genesis, I think?
It was pretty bad.
It was a pretty bad translation.
Anyway, there's also going to be California Games coming to both systems in May.
They won't be remakes of the original titles.
They won't be 3D either.
Quote, you gotta keep the gameplay mechanics the same or else it ceases to be the original game and you're only using the game brand to sell games.
It ceases to be Impossible Mission or California Games or what have you.
What we're doing is we're incorporating the original gameplay and mechanics and bringing the gameplay up to date.
I like this guy.
I like this guy.
You do not update a game like you update, say, NARC.
That isn't the way you do it.
You don't put Bill Bellamy in anything.
This guy has got it.
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they produce.
You know what?
I'm going to write him a letter and try to get him on the show.
I want to talk to this guy.
I like the way he thinks.
Anyways, I'm kind of on a completely different subject.
And speaking of updating things, the Phantom console is back.
They're actually going to be re-emerging the console as a PC download service.
and, um, yeah.
So you'll actually be able to, um, download Phantom games to your PC.
Which it was anyways.
I mean, it was basically a PC.
Will they disappear as soon as I download them?
No.
But yeah, there's official relaunts going on over at the website, phantom.net.
Yay.
Do we care?
You gotta give these guys credit because they just keep trying and trying and eventually something will happen.
Shane, what have they done?
They've tried.
They had a fun little booth at E3.
I really liked their booth at E3.
That was a nice booth to sit in.
I mean, literally, I could have set money on fire, and that would have been fun, too.
But you wouldn't want to sit on that.
They have an interesting little Flash video, and I might add, they probably spent more time on the Flash video than they did the actual, I don't know, Phantom.
I'm sorry, I don't know how to spin this a nice way.
What have they done that I can touch and play with?
Because they're obviously not good people.
Well, you can touch and play with the Phantom Lapboard.
Look, no, no, no.
I'm saying the reverse.
I mean, I don't blame the people.
I blame the management behind this whole thing and the marketing, obviously.
I mean, some poor-ass decisions were made.
I just think it's nice that they think that somebody still cares and they're still trying...
You know what, though?
If you're interested in checking out The Phantom, you can either check it out in Germany next week during Leipzig, or you can check it out at Digital Life coming October 12th through the 15th.
Blackwolf says they should put out a game called Phantom Vision.
I wouldn't play that.
Now, what it boils down to is they can't make vaporware systems anymore, so they're just going to offer vaporware over the internet, stuff that's never going to ever be released.
Hey, look, if anyone from Phantom is listening and thinking we're giving you guys a bad rap, seriously, you are cordially invited to come on the show and defend yourself.
Wait, wait, wait, I got it, I got it.
Freedom of speech.
Doesn't matter.
They're going to release Duke Nukem Forever on Phantom Online.
That'd be hilarious.
They might be trying to put out something eventually, but you still give them credit for putting money into something that's not going to work.
I like DJ Jani's thought in chat here.
Fast and the Furious, Oregon Trail Drift Remix.
I guess that's a Phantom game that's going to come out.
If they released something that had an organ trail in it, you know it would sell like 20 copies to the people that still care.
Wang Gang Midnight Organ Trail Tune.
Well, look, Phantom, you're not alone in taking a lot of heat for being a console.
The PlayStation 3.
Some more news about the PlayStation 3.
There was a report that was released this week that basically said, quote, By the time third-generation consoles reach market maturity in 2011...
The PlayStation 3 will once again be the market leader.
Boy, I wish I could be an analyst.
I get paid to talk out of my ass.
I mean, maybe.
I don't know.
Maybe, but based on what's there right now, I don't see it happening.
According to the nation, you talk out of your ass for free.
Is this going to take them to 2011?
Anyway.
But by then we'll all be rich, and that's why... Another thing that should be noted, PlayStation 3s have still not gone into production, and we're not that far away from the launch date.
So as we get further and further out here, shortages become more and more likely.
Yeah, I love that.
PlayStation 3 will dominate it all.
Ah, we haven't started making them yet.
Don't worry.
We'll stay up late.
The Night Before.
We'll get them all then.
I'd like to start off tonight since DarkSakura isn't here.
I would like to give an F you to my bad grammar skills and give a big giant F you to Loki for making fun of them and laughing in my ear which throws me off even further.
You dick.
Well, Shane's a dick too and he likes Fantavision.
Like that's a bad thing.
Loki, your F you's of the week.
F you to stupid people who can't fucking pull up to the goddamn stoplight or the line.
I've seen people with like six car lengths
before the stop sign or stoplight or whatever.
They're just stopped there.
Talking on their cell phones, of course, because they're jackasses and not paying attention to where they need to be.
Or the people that drive in the goddamn bike lane because they're not paying attention or driving over the lanes and all over the place.
They should really ban cell phone use while driving.
Nico Tavi.
Okay, I got two FUs for short.
FU to eating rabbit, because rabbit actually ended up not tasting that great.
I was very disappointed.
However, lamb is... Lamb is worse than rabbit, so... Lamb.
It tastes like dirty meat, and I actually like my meat not...
Okay, what is your other FU, Mr. Jumping Flash is the best game ever?
It's not the best game ever, it's just really far up there.
My other FU goes to myself for not learning a certain Taco Bell employee's work schedule so I can stalk him effectively.
FU to the fact he's probably under 18 and this is all being documented.
He's so not under 18.
And if he is, I can delete this.
Drew, you're FU.
Alright, FU to having a clean house, kind of a realization that, yeah, he does the forest pretty well, but Mr. Clean's a dick.
Parks off all the allergies I ever had and some I didn't know I had.
FU to obligatory stupid drivers, especially in the country called Lanes area.
Learn how to fucking park, would ya?
I'm just trying to get in, out, no fucking about, and these people are just blocking the driveway.
That's about it.
Alright.
Anyway, speaking of stupid, there's a stupid idea going around on Kotaku here.
Apparently people have been emailing them saying, Hey!
You know that awesome movie, Snakes on a Plane?
Is there going to be a video game?
No.
No, there's not.
And they're like, well, why the hell not?
So they propose that
I feel like I'm like the only person my age who hasn't seen Snakes on a Plane yet I haven't seen it No You two are lame, go see it Why?
If I was ten years older and closer to your age Which is a lie, you are not that much younger than me, I'm sorry to say I would still not go see it, I am too No you're not How old are you?
Old enough to be 10 years younger than you.
Then you would be 18, and it would be okay for you to be stalking the...
Taco Bell guy who's probably not an agent.
That's what I've been saying.
Alright.
Drew, you actually saw the movie, right?
Yeah, I saw the movie.
Was it worth the hype?
It kicked ass.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm at that point where I'm like, I feel like Snakes on a Plane jumped the shark before it ever came out.
It lived up to the hype in the sense that we knew it was going to be cheesy, we knew it was going to be a bad movie, but it has the Rocky horror appeal.
It's best when it's seen in a theater.
You have to have the audience participation.
You have to have the audience participation.
I'll give it a try, but see, now I'm worried that I missed opening weekend because no one will go see it with me, that I'm going to just kind of miss out on everything.
You threw snakes?
You went with some of the Something Awful kids?
Yeah, I went with a pair of goons.
We had rubber snakes around our necks at random points.
We were just throwing snakes down into the crowd, and the people were enjoying it.
Everyone was heckling and riffing and throwing the snakes back and forth.
It was a good time, but the movie itself will probably just lose its appeal when it's not in a theater.
You know what movie was underappreciated for audience participation value?
Showgirls.
Absolutely frightening.
Next up.
That's pretty funny.
Showgirls.
Moving on to something that...
could be only popular as a cult phenomenon.
The PlayStation 3, oh, we're so, we pick on them so much, I feel bad.
I really tried not, I tried to find positive stories.
I do, I do too.
But then they go and say we're not making it.
Well, this is, I mean, okay, so the PlayStation 3 hasn't gone into development yet, but what happened recently is Sega had a PlayStation 3 day, and there was a demo of Full Auto 2 Battle Lines, and IGN got to take a peek at this, and basically, to make a long story short, you know, obviously the dev kits are there,
The controller was smart enough to realize what system and what player it's connected to And the PlayStation Network appears to be up and running at this time So the PlayStation Network platform appears to be up and running Because these folks were demoing the game on there And so the developers were able to use it So something's ready So I guess that's a good sign Full Auto 2 wasn't bad I remember playing it at E3, it wasn't bad I like Full Auto It was okay
Yeah, it was okay.
I don't know.
I kind of think there'll be other driving games that'll make me go, wow, a little more, but... Like, uh... Never mind.
I don't know.
Like...
I'm not going to say it.
I swear to God I'm not going to say it.
I wish they could do like a Mario Kart.
I mean it's inevitable we'll have a Mario Kart on the Wii, but like a Mario Kart in like super high def 720 and all that because obviously the Wii is not going to support that.
I would like to see a very pretty Mario Kart.
We need to get in contact with Square and have them do Rad Racer 3.
How about Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation?
Chocobo Racing 2 on the PlayStation 3.
That's what I'd like to see.
That'd work.
All right.
Fine by me.
We can agree on that.
Speaking of the Wii.
Yeah.
Speaking about the Wii and online, kind of the repeat of something we were talking about earlier with Reggie, and talking about how the online service is going to be free, and basically kind of enhancing the way you're going to be playing games, which, you know, you've probably already been doing that on Xbox Live.
But yeah, it's basically, it's going to be massive amounts of hands-on activity, as well as showcasing exactly how the Wii games are different.
They're talking about the...
of course their brand new games and how they're going to market them and stuff and of course we're going to create advocacy and we're going to make it so that everyone who tries the Wii experience talks to their friends and neighbors so of course they're going to do that because they're not showing it to the press they're showing it to secret parties of ravers laughing
I'll get my pacifier and candy bracelets ready for the Wii bus to come by.
No, but their online service is going to be okay.
I'll get my Darude CD.
Look at the... I mean, here's the thing, too.
I mean, if you look about it, the DS Wi-Fi Connect service, you know, we hear people talking about that and stuff, but we forget that PSP actually has their infrastructure mode that, you know, is Wi-Fi online, too.
But, I mean, you don't really see them pushing that very much, which I find very interesting.
Sony's not even trying to say, hey, by the way, our games are also connected over the internet as well, but they don't really have a service provided.
I don't think they actually use Sony's servers or anything.
Kind of like the PlayStation 2 does.
I thought that was interesting.
Alright.
Star Trek Legacy
E3, E3, E3, E3
They are trying to encapsulate everything.
And it's basically a ship strategic command fighting game, which I think a lot of people are going to be really into, especially the Star Trek kind of fans.
I think that kind of is a natural fit.
And in seeing the early demo, it looks really, really good.
The game graphically is really well.
And I kind of thought it was cool what they did in the demo.
And this was all real time when they did it.
They kind of duplicated the big fight from the end of Star Trek II, Wrath of Khan.
Rayhound
RayHound is actually pretty cool.
You actually don't shoot any weapons in this game.
What you have is these turrets that are shooting at you, these lasers, and you can pull up a shield that causes the laser to spin around you in an orbital fashion.
You use that to throw the lasers back into the actual turrets themselves.
Each level, as it progresses, more and more turrets are on the screen and it gets more crazy.
You know, it's the kind of simple gameplay that's fun, and what's great is you can actually download it for free.
So, what you need to do is definitely check out the game, because I did, and it's awesome.
You can find it at www.18.big.or.jp, and then the little ampersand symbol, hikoza.prod, and then
That should pull it up for you.
Or just basically search for Warning Forever and Rayhound and you'll find it in any search engine.
But it's pretty sweet.
So check it out.
Beat the Host
with a stick.
I'll play.
We're going to take a caller.
No, because tonight you and Miklatov count as hosts.
So you might get beaten with a stick.
All right, let's go to the phones and get a caller for tonight's game.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Oh my God, I got picked.
Who is this?
Raven's Dolphin!
Hello, Raven's Dolphin!
How are you doing tonight?
I'm doing fine.
Alright, now... Sounds really fine.
Yeah, he's happy he got pictures.
This is going to be a fun game.
Raven's Dolphin, how would you say your knowledge is on old school video games?
Super Nintendo to NES, I guess.
I guess pretty good.
Okay, would you be willing to challenge one of our hosts tonight in exactly who's got more skill in identifying songs from old school video games?
Come on, you know you want to throw down.
Yeah, yeah, I'll try.
I'm pretty sure I know old school video games.
Alright, Raven's Dolphin, there's three people you can challenge tonight.
You can't challenge me because I wrote the damn thing, but you can challenge Drunami, Miklatov, or Loki.
Who's it going to be?
RavensDolphin, I have to ask you to leave our chat room.
I see you logged in there right now.
Actually, I'm just going to go ahead and kick you from chat because we can't have them helping you out.
I'm kicking both those names from chat right now.
Alright, you ready to play?
No, not yet.
I still haven't closed the chat client yet.
8-Bit Video Games
and whoever gets more wins.
And if you actually win tonight's game, we will let you do something very special in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio regarding the DDR premieres we announced earlier this evening, alright?
Alright.
Sound good?
I'll try my best.
I can't guarantee anything.
Alright, well try your best.
That's all we can ask.
And of course, chat room, feel free to play along.
You guys will actually get to hear this twice because you'll get to hear it again when Loki comes back and folks playing on the podcast as well.
We have a lot of folks out there that I know think they could do really well on this, so see how well you do.
Alright, you ready, Raven's Dolphin?
You only get to hear it once.
You ready?
Alright, here we go.
All right, Raven's Dolphin, you have 30 seconds to name back 10 games.
Go.
Metroid.
Yes.
Fight Club.
I meant fight.
Punch Out.
Sorry, Punch Out.
Yes.
Mario 3.
Yes.
Ice Climber.
Yes.
Final Fantasy.
Yes.
I don't know the other ones.
I was going to say Excitebite, but I'm sure that's wrong.
No.
I sure heard, what was it?
I forget.
I told you.
Five seconds.
I forget.
That's it.
All right, time's up.
You got five out of ten.
You got half of them.
That's not that bad.
You got Metroid, Punch-Out, Mario 3, Final Fantasy, and Ice Climber, okay?
Okay.
We're going to see if Loki does any better.
Drunami, if you'd be so kind, run out and get Loki for us.
All right, Raven's Dolphin, stay on the line and see how it does.
Oh, you bet.
All right.
All right.
Welcome back, Loki.
All right.
And Loki's getting situated here back in studio.
Okay, here's how it's going to work, Loki.
You're going to hear a one-minute clip of ten old-school 8-bit Nintendo games music all strung together.
Then you're going to have 30 seconds after you hear the clip to repeat back to me the ten songs that you heard in the clip.
In order?
No.
Any way you want.
Okay?
Okay.
Alright, so you ready?
Here we go.
You only get to hear this once.
Now, you can actually make notes or make notes there if you want, okay?
Because we let him write, but he wasn't allowed to be in the chat room to do that.
So you can't be in chat either, Loki.
Well, I'm not even watching chat.
I'm just... All right.
Hold on.
I want to kick you from chat anyway.
All right.
You're a bastard.
All right.
You ready?
Hold on.
All right.
All right.
He's bringing up Notepad here.
Yes, I am.
We are playing Beat the Host here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Do you feel pretty confident about how you did Raven's Dolphin?
Don't tell him the score, but do you think you feel confident with your score?
I feel pretty.
Alright.
You feel pretty?
I feel pretty too.
Alright, you ready, Loki?
I am.
Quit wasting time here.
Here we go.
All right, Loki, that was the clip.
You have 30 seconds to say them back.
Go.
Super Mario Bros.
3.
Yes.
Final Fantasy.
Yes.
Ice Climber.
Yes.
Goonies 2.
Yes.
Metroid.
Yes.
And, oh, crap.
I should write down more of these.
That's all I got.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
And time's up!
He tied with me, didn't he?
Alright, yep, it tied up!
Raven's Dolphin got five and Loki got five, so it's all tied up.
And since I wasn't creative enough to think of a tiebreaker, it will just have to be a stalemate, okay?
That's fine by me.
Alright, so Raven's Dolphin, you know what, we could be nice.
What do you think, Loki?
Should we just give him the prize anyway?
All right, RavensDolphin, we'll see you back here in two weeks.
You're going to help us out with the DDR Power Preview, okay?
Ooh, can't wait.
All right, sounds good.
That's genuine excitement.
But, RavensDolphin, I bet you're dying to know what the correct answers were.
I'm dying.
All right, here we go.
Here they are, chat room.
Metroid.
I can't believe Noah got the next one.
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
Oh, I forgot the way down.
This is why.
Super Mario Bros. 3.
Willow Shadowgate Final Fantasy Ice Climber Goonies 2
Gyruss, which you DDR people should know, Gyruss And lastly, Ninja Gaiden
That was the 10.
You should be lucky that you did not pick me, because I got 6.
Oh, thank god.
Well, I would have had 6 too, had I wrote down all the titles instead of saying, I'll remember the first two.
I think I would have got like 3, so I was the easy kill.
So you could have won flat out if you told me.
But I told the chatroom I knew a lot of them, so I saved face.
But now that I admitted it, I lost the saving face.
All right, chat room once posted there, so I will post the list there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Click on chat.
There's the list for you folks in chat.
RavensDolphin, thanks so much for playing our dumb little game with us.
Sorry you did not get to beat the host tonight, but maybe next time.
You got to push him a little bit.
It was a push.
Yeah, that was fun.
All right, anything else you want to share with the listeners before we let you go and get back to the news?
Snakes on a Plane looks funny.
A little bit.
Anyway.
I was trying to see how well the chat room did there.
It looks like some folks really like the game.
I want to see that again.
So we'll do that.
It looks like Willow is the big stumper for most people there.
For what it's worth, I thought the last one was Double Dragon, not Ninja Gaiden.
It's very close.
I know for next time to write down everything I hear instead of just saying, oh, I'll remember those and not to go back.
It's tough.
I figured folks in chat would really like that game and the folks listening on the podcast because you kind of get to play longer.
You should have done more random games like throwing Kickle Cubicle or something like that.
You know what?
If we do it again...
Maybe it'll be Super Nintendo, maybe Arcade.
You know, if I wanted to be really mean, I'd do Commodore 64 games.
Do Virtual Boy games.
All right.
Maybe some other time we'll do Beat the Host with a stick, but for now we're going to get back into the gaming news.
Anyways, there is a rumor going around this week that Walmart had stopped selling Bully because of pressure from a certain somebody, and we'll call him J...
T, and rhymes with Fuck Omsen
and it was funny though because Walmart spokesperson John Simley, he made a comment and he said, I'd like to give credit to Jack Thompson but there are a lot of Jack Thompsons out there and we are just listening to our customers.
I think he means there are a lot of Jackoffs out there.
And it says the decision has not been made on whether the chain which sells 127 million customers a day will carry Bully once it is rated and available for sale.
If it comes out as adults only, we think that's something that we're not going to carry.
I think first we look at the rating.
More likely it's going to be mature.
I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart anyway, because indirectly you're supporting their electronics department, which would be the music as well.
And I hate, hate, hate the fact they censor music the way they do.
They refuse to sell CDs in the store unless there's a clean version available.
It's like, you know, here at Walmart we're going to sell the statue of David, but we've put, you know, tighty-whities on it.
You know, it's like, that's not, you've ruined the art.
You know, I don't, anyway, this is kind of getting a little bit outside, but I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart.
And I realize some folks feel they have no other choice living in a remote area, you know, where maybe Walmart is the only big game retailer you have, but...
Online, my friends.
Seriously, I would rather buy my, even if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would rather buy my games online than buy them at Walmart.
And this show will never be carried at Walmart, thanks to my little rant there, but that's alright.
I don't care.
We're too far off the radar for Big Bad Walmart.
I will admit I bought my copy of 99 Nights at Target, which probably isn't much better, but the other place I wanted to go to first was out of it, and I really wanted 99 Nights.
Hey, Target got a mention in a Freeze Pop song.
That makes them okay by me.
Call me a hypocrite if you want.
I don't care.
All right.
XBOX LIVE VISION CAMERA
and Freeverse, who made Toy Sight for the Apple iSight.
Was this the game we played at E3 for a little bit?
I seem to remember.
But it was on, like, the PC camera, wasn't it?
No, it was the Vision camera.
It's just that it sucked because there's people walking behind you, so you had to raise, like, one hand to... You used your hands, like, think of iToy, basically.
It was like trying to play iToy with the Today Show behind you, that whole set where they have all the people moving and it just throws everything off.
You couldn't do it.
However, though, there is some...
Rumors, though, actually I should say that that might not exactly be true, that Totem Ball's coming with it.
The reason being is that some of the live vision cameras have actually sneaked out in Toys R Us lately, and some people have already purchased them.
And they said that it's included one month of Xbox Live Gold, as well as a registration key for Uno, as I previously said on a podcast.
And...
But what you might end up finding out a little bit later on, as I think I mentioned before, there is two bundles that they're going to be having.
One that's for $39.99 and one that's $79.99.
And the $79.99 one might come with Totem Ball.
And I think it's supposed to come with a year of Xbox Live Gold as well.
Interesting.
All right, well, we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take your calls.
If you want to call our show, you can hit us up on the Skype line at InteractWithUs over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, or you can pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.
But remember, that is not an 800 number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, you best be getting some permission.
We already have a call.
Let's go to the line.
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, Rob.
It's the other Drew.
The other Drew.
Is this the Drew that goes by Cutress online?
That would be it.
Hey, how you doing?
Hey Shane.
What?
Kick him off right now.
No, no, no.
I gotta let him plug the site he works for.
No, we're good buddies with this site.
So Cutress, where do you work?
I guess it's more of a hobby, but so is what we do.
Oh, well, it's not like I was just calling in to plug DDR Freak, but yeah, there you go.
Alright, I wanted to let you plug DDR Freak, though.
So what are you calling in about tonight?
Well, first off, I had to make sure that everyone knew that Sui Koden sucks.
Why are you letting him still talk?
Because it's funny.
It's not, he's saying lies.
Let's take a quick vote.
How many people think Cutris is funny in the room?
Let's see.
Oh, we got two.
And how many people think Cutress is not funny?
And we have two.
Oh, and I break ties.
No, actually, the two full-time hosts here voted that he is funny, and the two peon guests voted that he wasn't funny.
I'm going to delete a lot of stuff off your computer tonight.
Cutress, please.
Stop poking me.
Look, let's stop taking up his time.
Cutress, please, whatever you want to say on your mind besides the fact that Suikoden sucks.
Well, for one thing, next time you do the music game, you need to have Mega Man music in there because that's sort of mandatory.
Look, I have to save something for next time.
I couldn't blow the Blaster Master wad on the first go, okay?
And Mega Man and all that other stuff.
You know I love me some Mega Man and some Blaster Master, but I have to wait.
Yeah, if you had gotten me in, I would have gotten seven of ten.
Oh, looks like I do have some competition.
A little Drew vs. Drew action, huh?
That sounds like a porno, be quiet.
That was the intent.
What games have you been playing lately, Drew?
Well, I just finished Dragon Quest a couple days ago.
I'm pretty much wrapping up all the rest of the endgame stuff in that, and pretty much everything I have is packed up.
Right now, I kept out Front Mission 4 and Curse of Darkness.
Very cool.
That's basically all I've got until I move into my new house and unpack everything again.
I just quit FFXI so that I could finally start playing my console games again.
I remember quitting Final Fantasy XI to free myself to play other video games.
You come back, you always do.
I remember when I quit also, which didn't happen last night or today.
Yeah, by the way, Miklatov signed back up for Final Fantasy XI last night because he's weak, everybody.
He's weak.
Okay, real quick.
I've got to ask this real quick.
DDR Freak
You know, I've gotten to play it only once, and I only played two games of it, and basically I was just so out of shape and out of whack that I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore because I was taking up too much time from other people.
I know people are complaining about the sync and everything, but I haven't noticed any problems myself.
I'm enjoying it.
It's fun.
That's all there really is to it.
No, I didn't notice the sync problems either, I have a life, but I agree with you on the fact that we all got out of shape, because Konami didn't put out a new game for forever, we all got burned out on Extreme, and now we're all fat and don't want to play DDR again.
Wait, sync?
Get it?
Shut up!
Is there two in one thread on the forums?
You know, I'm not the sort of guy that runs vertex squared through my head when I'm having sex, so I don't notice these sync issues.
Oh, and the group sucks.
Wow.
Okay, Cutris, anything else you want to share with our listeners so we can take more calls?
No, just thanks for having me on the show again, and I wish I could hang out with you guys more.
Not a problem.
Come visit the bay.
It's a real bummer about E3, but maybe there'll be something.
We should have a DDR con or something fun.
Yeah, hopefully.
I can't wait to hang out with you guys again.
Sounds good.
Have a good one, Cutris.
Take care.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
All right.
Thank you, Cutris, for being on the program tonight.
Let's take another call.
Drew, real quick.
How's that for new low?
I'm actually making get it jokes on the air.
Alright, be quiet.
Let's go to another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's Ranma.
Who do you think it is?
Hello, Ranma.
God, you have a way of getting through every week.
What's on your mind?
We're getting hammered tonight, too, and you get through.
What's up?
Oh, I have three things I want to talk about.
Three things.
Make them quick.
Number one.
First thing, this whole high def versus standard def mission, fuck it.
I have a nice 20 inch TV, it's standard def, it looks great.
I don't care about this high def live stream, it's just a concept.
I mean, I just don't get it, you know?
It's just... Ranma, surely you've heard this old saying, okay?
Have you ever heard this old saying?
Once you go black, you never go back?
That's because we won't let you go free.
Yeah.
Same.
Apply that thought to an HDTV.
Seriously.
Because, like, once I bought an HDTV, I can't watch Standard anymore.
I know, I used to play my PSU on a 55 inch high definition TV, but when I moved I had a 20 inch SD, standard deaf television, to me it just looks the same, I enjoy both of it, you know?
Alright, well, you know, I can appreciate that because that tells me that you are about the game first, the graphics second.
Yes, definitely.
Alright, what's the second thing you wanted to call in about?
I was kind of tired of the DDR fanboys in chat.
Shut up.
It's just a game.
What were they saying in chat?
I missed it.
I mean, it was about your announcement about DDR.
Somebody said, you guys sold out the Kanaan.
I'm like, what the hell, you know?
Better than selling out to Roxor.
We didn't sell out to anybody.
I haven't seen any of this money.
We're not getting any money for this, so tell me how we're selling out.
We're doing this because we like DDR and we like this, you know.
Hmm, let's see, we are a radio station, and on radio stations they play music, DDR of which has a lot of music.
This partnership makes a lot of sense to me.
I don't know about the rest of you.
This is something that we would have done for Konami three years ago, but whatever, it's finally happening now, it's great.
Alright, number three.
The last thing is the whole thing about the PS3, it's $400, $500.
Some people are forgetting about another console that came out that was just as expensive.
What's that?
Neo Geo
But then again, the Neo Geo wasn't exactly... You know, the Neo Geo was like the rich kid system, you know what I mean?
Like, everybody knew some rich kid who actually had a Neo Geo.
And the difference is, it had games that kicked major amounts of ass.
It did, but it also, towards at least the end of the run... Like, you know, the first wave of games was pretty cool, but towards the end of the run, it was all Bust a Move, King of Fighters, you know, 99, all that stuff.
I mean, that's all it ever was, in the end.
Which is kind of sad.
Is there something wrong with King of Fighters?
No, but I'm just saying I wouldn't buy a console just for King of Fighters.
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciated the Neo Geo, but I wouldn't have spent that much money on it.
What is Madden?
What is Madden?
It's the same game over and over with little upgrades.
Right?
That's why I don't play men.
I play Tecmo Bowl.
Alright.
Tecmo Bowl for life.
Ranma, we gotta let you go.
Take more calls.
One more thing.
Rat Racer 3, PS2.
That's what I want.
Bye.
Bring it.
With the 3D glasses, I hope.
Your calls, we're taking them tonight here on OrangeLoungeRadio.com Go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on interact with us Or you can always pick up the telephone and call us that way 916-226-9067 Hey podcast listeners, are you pissed off at the call-in segment because it's always the same people calling in?
Well, you should call us sometime Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
It's DMN Hi DMN, what's on your mind?
Not much.
I wanted to comment about the whole BDR TV show thing, too.
But first, I want to congratulate you guys on getting that association with Konami.
I'm really excited about hearing the new music.
We're excited about it, too.
We think it's going to be a fun time.
Thank you.
Awesome.
Now let's bag on the TV show a little bit.
A little bit.
Here's the thing.
I'm going to be a bit of a devil's advocate about this whole slumber party gang thing.
Fair enough.
We need it.
um you've got to look whenever you're at the arcade being the seasoned DDR veterans that all of us are who do you see that annoys the ever loving shit out of you on those machines the target audience is number party girls birthday party girls yeah alright yeah so I think Konami is targeting that demographic I think they're doing it right I think it's going to be a laughing stock fest for the rest of us but I think it'll
whoever watches Saturday Morning TV and it'll sell more copies and that's what Konami wants right and to play devil's advocate to devil's advocate I understand what Konami's trying to do with that and you know you do make a good point but you can't help but as a long time DDR fan before there were little girls everywhere you can't help but cringe a little bit inside because this doesn't help the whole people walking behind the machine going that's gay thing that I was talking about earlier you know
Yeah, well no, I cringe at the thought too, but I see where they're going from a business standpoint.
So, I kind of wish if they're going to do this, that they would also do a DDR Macho show on Spike TV as well or something.
No, I don't know, I just... You know, I think...
You can't let society, and this goes with anything, you can't let society tell you what to do, essentially, and if you enjoy something, you should wear it proud, you know what I mean?
So even though we joke about, you know, we don't like the people that come behind the machine and go, that's gay, that's gay, I think that you should have enough confidence in yourself to be able to do whatever you want, you know what I mean?
And I think if you do, and DDR is a very social game, a friendly game, and I remember some kid once did this to me when I was on the machine, and Jamie tore him a new asshole.
He was like, do you want to challenge him on the game?
Do you want to fight?
Here, I will pay for you to play against Rob, and we'll see who does better on the game.
That situation has happened with all of us.
That's why Jamie's on this program, by the way, because she has her moments of gold like that, which you just gotta love.
You just gotta love.
I think we should look on the bright side of this whole slumber party girls though.
It might appeal to the 20-something female demographic who thinks it's oddly cute.
Might get more of a turnout in the arcades there.
Alright, DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
Go to PAX and the Wii's coming soon.
Alright, thank you very much.
We appreciate that.
Alright, bye-bye.
Take care, guys.
All right, let's do at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio, and then we'll probably go and tie up the show.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Yes, this is Bobby.
Hi, Bobby.
You mean Bobby Blackwolf?
Sure.
Okay, yes.
Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show on AllGames.com Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific.
Hint, hint.
What's on your mind?
I wanted to share my opinion on something real quick.
Lies.
These are lies that he's going to be talking about.
It's about this game.
It's called Suikoden.
Ah, yes, Suikoden.
I've heard of this game.
Can we hang up on him, please?
Miklatov, didn't you get your name from a character in Suikoden 2?
Yes, he's the best character ever.
An ambiguously gay character in Suikoden.
Ambiguous.
All right.
Yes, Bobby, I'd love to know your thoughts on Suikoden.
I thought it sucked.
I think you suck.
Okay, why does Suikoden suck?
No, it's mainly just to piss Miklatov off.
Oh, okay.
And it works.
You actually think it's a good game, deep inside?
I like the first and the third one.
What about two?
Besides the translation?
It was so hard to find.
I haven't played it.
I can't even find it.
Oh, yeah, because it's like $250.
Yeah, I'm not going to pay $250.
Play five.
I wrote that game really well.
All right.
Bobby, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No, that was it.
I was just doing this for the chat room.
All right, I appreciate it.
This is what we call quality radio.
All right, take care, Bobby.
Comedy gold.
You can hear little gems like that on his program every week.
I like how people call in to make me whine.
That's why you're here.
That's really fun.
That's why you're here, because you're a whiner.
All right, any last-minute stories, folks, on Orange Lounge Radio tonight?
But of course.
Okay.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But it's still in development, so look forward to more stuff from that.
And of course, if you're looking for a nice clone, in fact, I think a lot of people got in trouble for the Grid Wars.
Now they have Trigonometry Wars, the final version, out for the PSP.
You can download it on PSP Updates.
Definitely something fun if you like Geometry Wars.
I heard about all the scandal going around there with Geometry Wars.
Yeah.
The clones, at least.
And people getting sued and stuff.
I have one quick last minute story, if you're done with that one.
I just want to say real quick, with Madden 07 coming out, Slashdot ran a recent piece.
E.A.
Online Account
and Granting Electronic Arts the ability to collect your name, address, and credit card information as well as a variety of demographic information about how you use their products.
Not only that, they explicitly say that they may tie these demographics to your personal information.
It's not anonymous here.
Now, a site called Gamers With Jobs actually cornered EA and Microsoft about these issues and they were met with silence.
The multiplayer version of FEAR, FEAR Combat
has been released to the public for free.
You can sign up for a free CD key and a download of the game.
I don't know the link offhand, but I know we have a link to it in our OL Army Clan section.
There's already an OL Army Clan building up for this.
I definitely want to check out the game next week.
I just finished downloading and installing it.
I'm going to be checking it out tonight.
Very cool.
Oh my god, I'm so scared of this game, I just saw.
What's that?
Remember how I mentioned last week Happy Feet's coming out on the Wii?
I've got Happy Feet!
Okay, Happy Feet, for those who don't know, is kind of like a spoof of... Will they have Happy Wii?
Okay.
No, no, no, get this.
Okay, so Happy Feet, basically, as you might know or not know, it is...
A movie kind of spoofing the whole March of the Penguins thing.
It's got penguins doing stuff.
However, Happy Feet the game is going to be like DDR.
And with arrows and all.
So when I said you could strap the Wii controller to your feet, I wasn't exactly too far off, was I?
No, you were not.
Interesting.
So that's kind of interesting.
Some other fun stuff, especially when we get into the speculation area here.
The PSP being redesigned, kind of almost like a PSP Lite.
It's supposed to be coming out in March.
Gee, I wonder where they got that idea.
Well, it says it's supposed to be like the PSP Lite.
It didn't call it the PSP Lite.
Anyways, PSP 2 or whatever.
It's going to include 8 gigs of flash memory for storing your wonderful movies and stuff on, as well as they're getting rid of
GS68 in our chatroom says, Please fix the D-pad, Sony.
And then finally...
Of course, gotta mention this.
Speaking of speculation, the Xbox 360 is supposed to get another skew.
And apparently, rumor for now, it's gonna be a black Xbox 360 with a built-in HD DVD drive, an HDMI AV out, 250 gig hard drive, and PVR functions, like Xbox Live slash DirecTV or that kind of stuff.
Planned for $600 US.
Oh, yeah, that's a brilliant idea.
This is in the official Xbox magazine.
Oh, rumor for now.
Wait, you had me going bullshit until you said it was in the official Xbox magazine?
Yeah, it's rumor, though.
Probably.
Okay, I don't know.
A black Xbox 360, huh?
Something for the emo kids.
Maybe, I don't know.
It sounds a little weird, but I don't know.
And finally, I thought I'd mention the lineup since Arcade Wednesdays is still going on.
and, of course, we had Texas Hold'em coming out free of charge, as we mentioned, for 48 hours.
The week after that, though, we'll be seeing some more stuff, including, I know, what was it?
Time Pilot.
Time Pilot.
Yay!
Time Pilot and then Scramble.
Yeah, I can do without Scramble.
So, yeah.
That's it.
Huh, interesting.
As somebody mentioned in the chat room, and it's true, the...
Black Xbox 360 isn't that special because those are the dev kits also.
And you have the faceplates too, right?
What?
I mean, you could make your Xbox 360 black looking with the new faceplates.
Well, I'm just saying, we already have 360s in existence that are black, so it's not like...
Thanks for watching!
Well, I guess it's about time to wrap up the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us this week.
But we do have one more story for you guys tonight, Loki.
We saved this for the end because this is just one of those WTF stories.
Well, if you were a high school student and, of course, in a math class, you probably were playing with a TI calculator or TI-83 in this case.
Well, there's somebody creating a homebrew calculator
and more.
It's 50% done so far and it looks pretty cool.
If I remember correctly, they actually did port Link's Awakening 2 at TI83 back in the day.
A completely original Zelda game on a calculator?
The only good thing about the old graphing calculators was that you could type letters into them.
I know I used to do this for calculus tests all the time.
I'd put in the notes in my calculator and cheat.
Exactly.
Because I was smart.
Well, I remember with, like, the TI-83, you know, big thing when I was just going in high school is they actually, you know, finally got it to run assembly on there and then you could do grayscale and just, like, crazy shit on a calculator.
I don't know.
I remember that's why I had to drop my calculus class because I was programming games in it instead of listening.
A lot of TI-83 love in the chat room.
GS68 says, I use my TI-83 Plus to play FireTrack.
Kind of a crappy shmup.
And some folks are saying, yay, Zelda game, and so on and so forth.
EvilCheese666, OMG, I love those calculators.
So a lot of love for the old graphing calculators.
Alright, well, that's about the end of the program, but of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
I'm sure if DarkSakura were here, she would say reject false icons, but she'll be back next week.
I should point out about next week.
Next week's show will not be taped live on Sunday night.
This is because, I know this is going to sound hella lame,
I have concert tickets on Sunday that I got for my birthday and the person didn't realize that I would have Orange Lounge so of course I gotta go because it's a birthday gift and I'm going to see Journey how cool is that I'm hoping they'll have the old school game there but yeah so we're going to pre-tape next week more news to come to the LiveJournal community we'll probably pre-tape live earlier in the week we'll let you know when as soon as we work it out between the three of us let's go around and get everybody's final thought now Miklatov your final thought
I hope my ticket to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour comes pretty soon through the mail.
Because I want it really bad.
What?
My ticket to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour.
Loser!
Whatever!
That show's awesome!
Wow, that is almost as lame as Suikoden.
I hate everybody.
Alright, um...
Drew, thank you for being on the show again.
Appreciate it.
Did I go a whole night without calling you 23rd Magus?
I think I did.
Yes, you did.
Alright, very good.
Then your name transition is about complete.
Final thoughts for our listeners.
Be excellent to each other.
Loki, as always, thank you.
Correction.
That was almost as lame as Suikoden.
Oh, do you have an actual final thought?
No.
Okay.
And my final thought is Easy Cheese, for no real reason.
I'm just thinking about Easy Cheese right now.
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Gaming Radio.
