To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 194 for this August the 6th of 2006.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.880
And we're going to get right back into the gaming news, but just a quick reminder, if

00:30.880 --> 00:34.840
this is the first time you're downloading Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that we

00:34.840 --> 00:38.640
tape Sunday nights and then release the show in two parts.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.460
So this is the second part that you're hearing now.

00:40.460 --> 00:44.400
So if you want to hear part A, please go back into the podcast feed and find it, which you

00:44.400 --> 00:48.600
can on our website at orangeloungeradio.com or the same place that you downloaded this

00:48.600 --> 00:50.760
podcast undoubtedly.

00:50.760 --> 00:52.800
More gaming news now, Loki.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.840
this news is actually a little bit about the DS and how it might interact with

00:57.840 --> 01:01.440
the Wii and stuff. One of the things that they're speculating is going to be

01:01.440 --> 01:07.960
announced on the 23rd as well in their Nintendo press conference there is going

01:07.960 --> 01:13.600
to be about motion sensing control coming to the DS and they're saying that

01:13.600 --> 01:17.600
one of the first games is actually going to use it is Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

01:17.600 --> 01:21.120
which you might remember is coming on the DS and on the Wii so that's going to

01:21.120 --> 01:25.280
be interesting. It's going to basically be an accessory that slides into the Game Boy

01:25.280 --> 01:29.740
Advance slot very similar to the rumble cart. And they're going to also be using it with

01:29.740 --> 01:35.740
games like Excite Truck and Downhill Jam for the Wii will allow you to connect your DS

01:35.740 --> 01:41.380
or DS Lite wirelessly to the Wii and use it as a controller. It says the size of the accessory

01:41.380 --> 01:47.620
is going to be about the same as the Game Boy Advance rumble packs that they have right

01:47.620 --> 01:49.860
out for the DS and DS Lite.

01:49.860 --> 01:54.900
And like I said, they're going to be showing it off at the Leipzig Games Convention on

01:54.900 --> 01:56.380
the 23rd.

01:56.380 --> 02:00.820
So speculation for now, but sounds feasible, something.

02:00.820 --> 02:05.660
I could see that, especially with the whole, you know, DS is going to download stuff from

02:05.660 --> 02:06.920
the Wii.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.860
You know, well, I mean, not the exact same games you're playing on the Wii, but you know

02:10.860 --> 02:11.860
what I mean?

02:11.860 --> 02:14.600
Like there'll be certain things that you can download to your DS, so I could see that maybe

02:14.600 --> 02:18.400
the motion sensing carries over into what they want to do on the DS, it makes sense.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.560
I mean, hell, think about, what was it, Game Boy Advance had the, uh,

02:23.560 --> 02:24.560
Warrior War Twisted and stuff?

02:24.560 --> 02:27.140
Well, yeah, not just Warrior War Twisted, but I'm thinking the Kirby game, the Kirby

02:27.140 --> 02:29.700
rolling game, Tilt and Tumble, thank you.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.260
So it's nothing new, in a way.

02:32.260 --> 02:35.860
But they're saying that I think this is going to be more than just one direction, more than

02:35.860 --> 02:40.560
just tilting it back and forth, it's actually going to be, you know, kind of like the Playstation

02:40.560 --> 02:44.240
controller is right now, how they're going to be doing it with that

02:44.240 --> 02:48.120
more along that lines. Not quite what the Wii is, but

02:48.120 --> 02:51.520
you know, more than just the Game Boy Advance cards.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.520
Fair enough. So they're taking it to the next level. It is the next-gen after all.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.800
Definitely. I'm still more excited about

02:59.800 --> 03:02.800
the new item coming out for the DS.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.540
Basically, there's going to be a new Chocobo game

03:06.540 --> 03:14.000
Coming out on the DS by Square Enix. It's chocobo to mahou no ehon, which means chocobo in the magic picture book

03:16.300 --> 03:18.300
Basically it's about a

03:18.820 --> 03:23.460
Chocobo farm and a chocobo lives there and the caretaker named Shiroma

03:23.820 --> 03:30.380
Which I love puns in games because the bad guy in the game's name is Kuroma. Shiro means white Kuro means black

03:30.940 --> 03:32.340
haha

03:32.340 --> 03:34.100
and so

03:34.100 --> 03:38.160
They have to go into the magical picture book world, which sort of makes me think of Winnie the Pooh now

03:40.100 --> 03:43.680
But it's going to be 3d and

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
Supposed to be

03:50.800 --> 03:56.460
From what I'm seeing it's actually looks like it's gonna be a really cute game just from the no big surprise there

03:56.460 --> 04:01.840
Yeah, choke a bow is fat chocobo gonna be the star because that goes chocobo is my favorite chocobo is not a star

04:01.840 --> 04:04.760
However, I think that fat chocobo needs to be like a special character

04:05.360 --> 04:12.080
Absolutely, maybe too many greens you turn into fat chocobo. Maybe but um, maybe the DS can have a new special attachment

04:12.080 --> 04:18.360
That'll actually make your DS smell like chocobo so we can actually know what a chocobo smells like if you like chicken, but

04:18.960 --> 04:20.960
like chicken, but

04:21.140 --> 04:25.680
But at any rate it will be released in winter in Japan. There is no

04:25.680 --> 04:32.400
announcement yet for the US or anywhere else but we're going to get it I'm

04:32.400 --> 04:34.920
pretty sure. You know what's kind of funny though is they're also coming out with

04:34.920 --> 04:38.080
another game that kind of ties into the whole Chocobo and like Nintendogs thing.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.280
Remember cats that came out on the Game Boy Advance how it was like that game

04:42.280 --> 04:46.800
where they're making one for the DS. And Nintend cats? Not Nintend cats but just

04:46.800 --> 04:52.320
cats. Well they need a Nintend cats. That'd be awesome. Now see our chat rooms totally

04:52.320 --> 04:55.360
getting into the fat Chocobo thing over at orangelaunchradio.com click on

04:55.360 --> 04:59.720
chat we have Blaze says fat chocobo equals fan service and he says fat

04:59.720 --> 05:05.880
chocobo is to pwn Wonder Dog Harold says smells like teen chocobo get it and then

05:05.880 --> 05:09.960
Bandit gets a little more morbid he wants some chocobo nuggets because you

05:09.960 --> 05:13.320
know they're just they're just like chicken I guess choco nuggets choco

05:13.320 --> 05:19.040
nuggets that sounds like chocolate dipped big nuggets which is disgusting

05:19.040 --> 05:22.920
the fried moogle pom-poms cuz they're kuporific can I tell you a secret and it

05:22.920 --> 05:27.360
has nothing to do with video games I apologize but you remember that time we

05:27.360 --> 05:30.400
took I think you were with that we took the road trip with mikkel tov I want to

05:30.400 --> 05:33.220
say it was when we were driving down for e3 or so you know exactly what you're

05:33.220 --> 05:37.480
talking about dip the Wendy's chicken nuggets in the chocolate shake I thought

05:37.480 --> 05:42.940
that was weird he is weird Drew's given the thumbs up over there what dude I

05:42.940 --> 05:48.040
used to work at Wendy's I know I did that all the time that's great it is a

05:48.040 --> 05:52.040
tradition it's gross I tried it it's great these are the chicken nuggets

05:52.040 --> 05:57.120
real chicken that means they're like made of this product that makes shake

05:57.120 --> 06:01.520
taste good or something sorry for the side note but you know when you say

06:01.520 --> 06:06.280
choco nuggets it makes me think of that concoction putting the VG cats what's

06:06.280 --> 06:13.200
that it was a kentucky ferrago chocobo it's an old VG cats of course I also

06:13.200 --> 06:17.920
like the mug nuggets I want to say on our myspace which gives me an excellent

06:17.920 --> 06:21.480
opportunity to plug the orange launch radio myspace over at myspace.com

06:21.480 --> 06:26.480
I think there's an old, we have show clips on there, and I think one of them has Kentucky

06:26.480 --> 06:29.360
Fried Chocobo in it from like a few episodes ago.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.360
Kentucky Farraga Chocobo.

06:30.360 --> 06:33.360
I have to keep it right.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.340
Anyway, moving on to a completely different topic that has nothing to do with the rest

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
of this.

06:38.340 --> 06:43.520
I guess cool contraptions, since we're talking about things that can be added on.

06:43.520 --> 06:50.120
Of course the Xbox Live camera is coming out soon, and apparently one of our buddies, Godfrey

06:50.120 --> 06:56.120
at Gamertag Radio. He actually got one of the cameras already. Man, we should make our

06:56.120 --> 07:01.240
show exclusive to one of the consoles, then maybe they'll send us some stuff too. No,

07:01.240 --> 07:05.260
I'm just teasing, that's awesome though. But actually they scored an interview with arcade

07:05.260 --> 07:11.120
manager Aaron Greenberg, and it actually confirmed that some of the old Xbox Live arcade games

07:11.120 --> 07:16.360
are going to be updated to make them more compatible with the vision camera. Spades,

07:16.360 --> 07:20.320
Bankshop Billiards 2 and other classic titles. Of course, we all know Uno is ready to go

07:20.320 --> 07:24.520
with the camera, but now if you don't want to play Strip Uno, you can play Strip Billiards

07:24.520 --> 07:25.320
or Strip Spades.

07:25.320 --> 07:29.880
Man, they're really trying to push that Bankshop Billiards 2. I mean, first they make it 3D,

07:29.880 --> 07:31.040
now they're adding the camera.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.040
Yeah, they're trying.

07:32.040 --> 07:37.900
Man, I don't know. It's kind of funny. But, unfortunately, Bankshop Billiards 2 will never

07:37.900 --> 07:43.660
be as popular as Gears of War, and Emergence Day can't come any sooner, but it is coming

07:43.660 --> 07:46.000
November 12th. That is a Sunday, folks.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.260
I hate to say it, but I think it's a big duh that this game is coming out in November.

07:50.260 --> 07:53.540
I don't think it took a genius to figure that out, you know what I mean?

07:53.540 --> 07:55.940
And so, yeah, emergency is coming out.

07:55.940 --> 07:59.780
They also announced that they're going to be doing a special edition packaging of it

07:59.780 --> 08:05.620
as well, so you can score that on November 12th, and of course this is going to be probably

08:05.620 --> 08:10.180
the next biggest thing to Halo 3, so definitely worth checking out.

08:10.180 --> 08:14.460
One thing that we do know, there will be no demo for it, so you're going to have to wait

08:14.460 --> 08:16.600
a little bit longer to play the game.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
Interesting.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.640
I just wanted to say real quick before we move on, our chat room is lighting up on the

08:20.640 --> 08:23.240
whole webcam story.

08:23.240 --> 08:29.720
Jeremy Todd 1 says, great, now we get to watch more dogs painting while we're panting, although

08:29.720 --> 08:33.160
watching a dog paint might be kind of exciting on the camera.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.160
That might be a good use of it.

08:34.160 --> 08:38.040
Only if the dog is as good as Bob Ross and barks the commentary.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.040
Now we get to watch more dogs panting while we're playing arcade games, and I'm sure that's

08:41.040 --> 08:45.360
a reference to the dude who was spotted on Uno that just had the cam on his dog.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.360
You know what?

08:46.360 --> 08:48.920
If I ever get a dog, I will put the camera on the dog.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.920
I put it on Shermy.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.160
I'm gonna send Godfrey a Uno challenge just so I can see the cam.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.240
I'll be like, Godfrey, turn the cam on, I wanna see it!

08:56.240 --> 08:59.880
And remember, teenage girls, you cannot get pregnant over webcam.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.880
So keep that in mind when you're doing Xbox Live in the future.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.720
Gorilla seems to think they should do strip Halo.

09:05.720 --> 09:09.860
And DJ Cables and Bits wants them to add the camera to Street Fighter 2.

09:09.860 --> 09:12.720
By the way, if you want to know what's up with all the strip gaming references, earlier

09:12.720 --> 09:17.840
in the show we've debated the uses for the Xbox Live camera, and we seem to believe here

09:17.840 --> 09:22.960
at Orange Launch Radio that the use that it probably will get, more than anything, is

09:22.960 --> 09:27.160
turning your favorite Xbox Live arcade game into strip whatever the game is.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.160
Strip Uno.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.400
I hope they have poker with that camera.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.400
And I know they do have the camera.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
But the Texas Hold'em, right?

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
Yeah.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.400
That'll have the camera support.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.120
I think they should use a drinking game.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.360
Speaking of the collector's edition of it, it's going to retail for $69.99.

09:39.360 --> 09:44.260
It's going to feature an official art book called Destroyed Beauty, and a bonus DVD featuring

09:44.260 --> 09:48.520
an inside look of the making of the game, probably some of that stuff that was on live

09:48.520 --> 09:53.980
as well as the stuff on MTV, if you remember back when they had the Road to Emergence Day

09:53.980 --> 09:55.920
or whatever they were calling that show.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.540
So check it out, November 12th.

09:58.540 --> 10:02.320
There's also something else to check out, of course we've all been pretty excited about

10:02.320 --> 10:04.200
Guitar Hero 2.

10:04.200 --> 10:10.840
Red Octane had a party in Australia, basically, showing that there were three more songs going

10:10.840 --> 10:12.820
to be in the game.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.300
That puts our track count around 11 now.

10:15.300 --> 10:19.280
There's going to be Stone Temple Pilots, Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart, Anthrax's Madhouse,

10:19.280 --> 10:21.620
Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.000
That's pretty cool.

10:23.000 --> 10:28.260
As far as the other eight that were previously announced, there's Reven Horton Heat's Psychobilly

10:28.260 --> 10:34.000
Freakout, Kiss Strutter, Black Sabbath War Pigs, Butthole Surfers,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.580
who was in my room last night.

10:35.580 --> 10:39.240
Van Halen's really got me Rush's YYZ, which I've played,

10:39.240 --> 10:40.520
and is fantastic.

10:40.520 --> 10:43.280
The bass is so awesome in that game.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.640
And also Primus, John the Fisherman,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.640
and Arterial Black by Drizzt.

10:50.640 --> 10:52.240
I'm waiting for Gwar.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
They need Gwar in that.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.400
I don't see my Gwar.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.320
And you know what I don't see, which is a damn crying shame,

10:58.320 --> 11:09.760
is there's no ACDC, that is a damn cryin' shame, and no Metallica, what's up with that?

11:09.760 --> 11:13.920
I have to mention this, and they're still talking about the cam thing, but this is great

11:13.920 --> 11:17.120
because this goes back to what they were talking about earlier in the program, you remember

11:17.120 --> 11:22.480
how we got issued the challenge by Bobby Blackwell for ChromeHounds, that's going to be taking

11:22.480 --> 11:28.160
place I guess some inner podcast war thing bandit decided to step it up and

11:28.160 --> 11:32.400
says good then when the cam comes out we can all see black wolf sad face after we

11:32.400 --> 11:38.440
all beat him in whatever game he chooses so wrong well done bandit not us well

11:38.440 --> 11:41.920
done bandit okay how about taking a step further and challenging that we love we

11:41.920 --> 11:47.720
love Bobby no no there's certain things podcasters don't do with each other and

11:47.720 --> 11:52.440
that's one of them exactly when we talk about love the independent podcast we

11:52.440 --> 11:55.840
We don't mean love the independent podcast, okay?

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
You lie.

11:56.840 --> 11:57.840
You lie!

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
You liar.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.840
Take his mic away, Loki.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.840
Please.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
Use it for a better purpose.

12:01.840 --> 12:02.840
Yeah, he doesn't need to have that mic.

12:02.840 --> 12:09.160
Speaking of a better purpose, I think MTV's Music Awards needs a better purpose because

12:09.160 --> 12:13.880
they're now honoring game music and sort of honoring game music.

12:13.880 --> 12:19.320
They have two different categories now, best video game score and best video game soundtrack.

12:19.320 --> 12:26.640
The nominees for best video game score include Hitman Blood Money, with Jesper Kidd doing

12:26.640 --> 12:32.320
the music on that, so good luck to him because he was awesome, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,

12:32.320 --> 12:38.760
Tom Salta doing the music for that, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Leon Willett and Evan

12:38.760 --> 12:46.160
Magnet Johansen, love that little nickname in there, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, thank

12:46.160 --> 12:47.520
Thank you, that's what I was waiting for.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.880
Uh, Jeremy Soule and Julian Soule.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.840
As you were reading that off, I was going, where's Oblivion?

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
Where's Oblivion?

12:52.840 --> 12:53.840
Where the hell's Oblivion?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.420
And Electroplankton, which is user-generated.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.200
I don't know how that has a soundtrack, you know.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.920
You know how MTV and their weirdo award shows always throws in some kind of interesting

13:03.920 --> 13:07.400
candidate in a lot of categories, like the movie awards always have something weird in

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
there?

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
That's what it is.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
Now, the best video-

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
Ah, that's cool.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.000
Oblivion would be my favorite, but that's-

13:13.000 --> 13:18.480
game soundtrack. They have Fight Night Round 3, Burnout Revenge, which I like some of the

13:18.480 --> 13:25.360
songs on there, NBA 2K6, Driver Parallel Lines, and Mark Echo's Getting Up. Which, you know,

13:25.360 --> 13:29.680
I'm surprised. Didn't Dance Dance Revolution a couple of years ago get nominated in one

13:29.680 --> 13:34.160
of those categories? Yeah. But not this year. No Love for the DDR. It was extreme too, best

13:34.160 --> 13:39.240
soundtrack. What about Guitar Hero? That's very surprising with all the mainstream press

13:39.240 --> 13:41.640
love for Guitar Hero. I'm very surprised that's not there.

13:41.640 --> 13:46.600
Hmm, don't know. Conspiracy, MTV hates Guitar Hero,

13:46.600 --> 13:50.640
News at 11. MTV also hates a lot of cool stuff. MTV hates you,

13:50.640 --> 13:54.080
actually. That's why you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because we love you.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.520
And Jamie loves you, and Jamie's going to surf the internet up and down.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.760
Yeah, she doesn't love you, but she loves you. Oh baby.

14:00.760 --> 14:04.180
And she surfs the internet up and down every week to find a website that you

14:04.180 --> 14:05.500
ought to be looking at.

14:05.500 --> 14:12.500
because she cares. She serves up, up, down, down, left, right, left.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.720
What's the website of the week?

14:14.720 --> 14:18.580
The website of the week as mentioned in part A of the podcast, which if you haven't

14:18.580 --> 14:23.180
listened to, then you're a big dumbass. I'm sorry. Then you're special.

14:23.180 --> 14:26.060
Thanks. Thank you for losing our new listeners for us.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.900
No, no, no, no, no.

14:27.900 --> 14:33.460
They just need to get a hard dose of my charming bubbly personality.

14:33.460 --> 14:34.820
Or something like that.

14:34.820 --> 14:41.740
The side of the week is the Castlemania dungeon, which is the place to go to for anything,

14:41.740 --> 14:50.220
you know, Akuma, Dracula X, or sorry, I should just say Dracula's castle, or Castlemania,

14:50.220 --> 14:51.220
anything having to do with it.

14:51.220 --> 14:58.260
You have sprite rips, characters, history, sound clips, artwork, emulation, even fan

14:58.260 --> 14:59.260
fiction.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.540
Castlemania fan fiction.

15:01.540 --> 15:12.220
This is a site I have been going to for at least 8 years.

15:12.220 --> 15:21.380
The Castlevania Dungeons URL is castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com slash dungeon.html.

15:21.380 --> 15:25.420
If you Google search Castlevania Dungeon it will be the first site that pulls up.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.260
It's absolutely fabulous.

15:27.260 --> 15:35.500
The site itself has had over 200,000 hits since it started in 1997.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.100
So it's pure awesomeness.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.900
Now one thing I have to say about that site though is I do believe I've been to the forums

15:41.900 --> 15:48.660
on that site and it was back when, you remember when we had the exclusive news about the whole

15:48.660 --> 15:54.160
new Castlevania DS game, why did I forget, Portrait of Ruin, was that the name of it?

15:54.160 --> 15:58.200
We had the news about Portrait of Ruin before any of the big sites did, their users didn't

15:58.200 --> 15:59.200
believe us.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.680
At least on the forums, on the forums.

16:01.680 --> 16:02.680
That's alright.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.040
That's okay, they have to believe us now.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.360
You can send those apology letters to mailbag at orangelongtrader.com, enclose cookies.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.360
I have a runner-up.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
What's that?

16:10.360 --> 16:11.360
Side of the week.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.880
Okay, well it's not your side of the week.

16:13.880 --> 16:14.880
Whatever.

16:14.880 --> 16:19.560
If I may mention one more thing though about this, I want to give public kudos to the folks

16:19.560 --> 16:24.000
who run Castlevania Dungeon, for keeping it alive as long as you have.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It's beautiful.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.400
Oh yeah, I'm only giving the forum users a hard time.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.880
I would have been skeptical of us, too.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
It's fine.

16:29.880 --> 16:35.840
Well, anyways, this could also be the site of the week, like an actual site, go-to site.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.320
In Las Vegas, they have the Pinball Hall of Fame, where you can go and visit it.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.480
And if you're interested in checking out this place, you can go play all the games.

16:43.480 --> 16:48.400
And they have games ranging from the 1950s and up to 1990s Pinball.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.400
pinball museum org

16:50.960 --> 16:55.160
So if you're in Vegas go check it out. Seriously. That was almost a consideration

16:55.160 --> 16:58.520
Why have I not been to Vegas for like the past few years like there's all these things

16:58.520 --> 17:00.920
I have to go see I have to see this we need to do a road trip

17:00.920 --> 17:04.760
I have to see Celine Dion. I know I'm just kidding. I don't have to see her. I'm kidding

17:04.760 --> 17:09.160
I'm kidding. The woman has only done one good song in English, and it was a meatloaf song

17:10.800 --> 17:12.800
She sounds like crap in English

17:12.800 --> 17:18.220
So late dear Celine Dion, if you listen to our podcast, please stick to French. Thank you

17:18.220 --> 17:24.580
She she did the Cyndi Lauper song too, and that really upset me. But anyway, this isn't to talk about Celine Dion

17:24.820 --> 17:26.740
It's to talk about

17:26.740 --> 17:28.620
gaming companies

17:28.620 --> 17:30.700
No, no god. No, never

17:31.340 --> 17:37.360
Is it new is her cell phone game out? Has anyone downloaded it? Does anyone care? I'm gonna look and

17:37.360 --> 17:43.240
And for you guys, the listeners, I will be brave, and I will pay the $5 to download it

17:43.240 --> 17:46.000
so I can review it on the program for you folks.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.040
Just for you guys, because I love you.

17:49.040 --> 17:56.760
Alright, look, we're here to talk about big gaming companies such as EA, and EA has announced

17:56.760 --> 18:02.700
in their quarter one report that revenues were up 13% from last year, but net loss also

18:02.700 --> 18:09.920
increased in the same period from 58 million to 81 million.

18:09.920 --> 18:15.040
They actually did this whole earnings report and did a conference call.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.520
They talked with Gama Sutra and Gama Sutra ran this report here, EA revealed, we have

18:20.520 --> 18:24.940
ramped up game production for the Wii and DS Lite following significant excitement over

18:24.940 --> 18:27.380
the Nintendo-created consoles at E3.

18:27.380 --> 18:32.360
That's a broken sentence, but that's alright, I think you get what it's saying there.

18:32.360 --> 18:37.160
party Wii titles won't be more than $49.99, suggesting that Electronic Arts Games may

18:37.160 --> 18:42.640
debut for Wii at $49.99 at launch, but they haven't really committed to that. If you want

18:42.640 --> 18:45.680
to read more details on the call, visit gamasutra.com.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.640
Wanna hear something poopy?

18:47.640 --> 18:53.520
Ok. Activision titles, they just updated their prices in our system and they all jumped $10.

18:53.520 --> 18:59.020
Now they're all $59.99 for the Wii. Boo! I'm sure they'll change once they see that everybody

18:59.020 --> 19:00.760
else is $49.99.

19:00.760 --> 19:13.180
see well speaking of losses I feel so bad for them sort of Sega Sammy loses a

19:13.180 --> 19:20.100
their profit basically dropped down 93% at least from their pachinko machine

19:20.100 --> 19:24.500
sales ouch yeah which is actually kind of surprising since pachinko is like

19:24.500 --> 19:32.500
hardcore you know in Japan but still um yeah they had a profit of 779 million

19:32.500 --> 19:39.500
yen about 6.8 million dollars which dropped from 10.7 billion yen so that's

19:39.500 --> 19:44.940
quite a bit of loss and they're blaming upfront development costs for game

19:44.940 --> 19:52.620
making and had a loss of 4.06 billion yen in the games division which was

19:52.620 --> 19:58.860
twice as much as last year's losses um they're still saying however that

19:58.860 --> 20:04.740
despite this setbacks they are going to the previous full year earnings would a

20:04.740 --> 20:13.420
their commitment was stay on track so yeah all right let's see we'll see um a

20:13.420 --> 20:18.180
very interesting story I'm related to gaming this is also another story

20:18.180 --> 20:22.300
actually coming from Gama Sutra go figure full spectrum warrior is being

20:22.300 --> 20:30.300
used to treat PTSD in war veterans and that would be short for post-traumatic

20:30.300 --> 20:36.140
thank you everybody all right the idea this is a quote from the article the

20:36.140 --> 20:39.660
idea being to be in the high stimulus environment for a long period of time

20:39.660 --> 20:44.100
maintaining a low psycho psychological arousal commented Dennis would a doctor

20:44.100 --> 20:46.820
at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego California where the treatment is

20:46.820 --> 20:50.020
currently being tested on non-combat personnel.

20:50.020 --> 20:53.280
The person can then take that learning in the therapeutic environment and transport

20:53.280 --> 20:57.080
it out or generalize it to day-to-day life.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.260
Very interesting, huh?

21:00.260 --> 21:01.260
Very interesting.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.660
So see, there's good news about video games too.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.660
Exactly.

21:04.660 --> 21:11.460
It's not all murders and death and stuff, you know, beating hookers, unlike war.

21:11.460 --> 21:16.700
But anyway, let's see what's in our mailbag.

21:16.700 --> 21:18.380
Every week we let you guys email us.

21:18.380 --> 21:23.040
It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura likes to put on her hazmat suit

21:23.040 --> 21:27.180
and get geared up and jump on in there and read the mail.

21:27.180 --> 21:28.180
But first...

21:28.180 --> 21:29.500
I had to replace the hazmat suit.

21:29.500 --> 21:34.180
But first, Dark Sakura has a special announcement she would like to give to our listeners.

21:34.180 --> 21:35.180
Yes, I do.

21:35.180 --> 21:36.180
Yes, I do.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.180
Basically...

21:37.180 --> 21:38.180
Now, this is...

21:38.180 --> 21:40.460
As you might have heard in the first part of the show, I had my hair done at this really

21:40.460 --> 21:46.100
cool place in the Castro in San Francisco called the John Brody Salon.

21:46.100 --> 21:50.780
just wanted to make a mention on August 13th they're doing a grand opening

21:50.780 --> 21:55.020

22:33.360 --> 22:37.760
emergency fund and breast cancer emergency fund hooray for good cause yep all right

22:38.560 --> 22:41.040
now let's get into the mailbag yes please

22:48.800 --> 22:52.960
you know sometimes though i can't hear this music without thinking of uh the old version of our show

22:52.960 --> 22:58.160
with you singing i know i'm sorry it's okay well our first email comes from jeremy todd one who's

22:58.160 --> 23:02.880
hanging out in our chat room says uh since the dead rising demo came out this past week i found

23:02.880 --> 23:07.840
an easter egg in it that's pretty cool if you look at the restaurant's banner you will see that it

23:07.840 --> 23:13.440
says jill's sandwich could this be an easter egg pointing to resident evil when barry says to jill

23:13.440 --> 23:18.640
you were almost a jill sandwich especially since they are both zombie games just a cool easter

23:18.640 --> 23:24.560
egg i thought i'd share i think it is absolutely that's funny that is pretty cool krispy kreme um

23:24.560 --> 23:28.400
actually asked a question has nothing to do with video games do any of you guys watch lost that

23:28.400 --> 23:31.180
That show totally ruptures my boxers.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.180
I have friends who do.

23:32.180 --> 23:33.180
I don't watch TV at all.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.180
Yeah, that's me too.

23:34.180 --> 23:37.080
I have my two best friends watch it, but I don't.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.800
It's weird.

23:38.800 --> 23:42.520
It's not that I dislike the show, I just, you know, between the show and Quirk.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.160
It takes away from your Survivor time.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.720
No, I didn't even really watch Survivor last year.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.280
You know what I have been watching, though, is Big Brother.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.640
I can't get enough of that show.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.120
I know, I know it's crap reality, but I just, it's...

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
I love it.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.560
I call them unreality shows.

23:55.560 --> 23:56.560
Go, Danielle.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.560
Go, Danielle.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
But I don't watch TV, so no.

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
Alright.

24:01.560 --> 24:06.560
Also, from our dear friend Rob, with two B's. Robway.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.560
It links me to an article on GameSpy, and just to read his email, it says,

24:11.560 --> 24:13.560
It's amazing to look at-

24:13.560 --> 24:17.560
Basically, three years ago, GameSpy did an article on top ten dying game genres.

24:17.560 --> 24:21.560
It's amazing to look at now because Microsoft is single-handedly resurrecting the puzzle game,

24:21.560 --> 24:24.560
and the old games on Live Arcade are from some of these.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.560
The rest are being covered by Nintendo's Wii controller.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.680
The one I think they got wrong was Mei's first person shooter still dominates.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.780
The one I think they are right about is full motion video.

24:33.780 --> 24:37.460
Full motion video will never be in game, will forever be in games, but not as a primary

24:37.460 --> 24:38.460
gameplay element.

24:38.460 --> 24:42.820
I think that inspiration for new games can come from these genres and feel fresh.

24:42.820 --> 24:48.140
Basically the top ten that were listed was space shooters, like Asteroids, Xevious, Space

24:48.140 --> 24:55.320
Invaders, R-Type, Radiant, Silver Gun, Ikaruga, um, Ikaruga though is trying I think to bring

24:55.320 --> 24:56.320
it back.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.720
games, Tetris, Bus to Move, Puyo Puyo, light gun games like Duck Hunt, House of the Dead,

25:00.720 --> 25:08.320
Lethal Enforcers. Um, next up was, uh, Text Adventures. Hey, we still have Orange

25:08.320 --> 25:14.140
Lounge Radio the game. Then Maze Games. And I love, though, they linked Mouse Trap,

25:14.140 --> 25:17.720
which was like my favorite ColecoVision game ever. Mouse Trap was a great game.

25:17.720 --> 25:22.680
Virtual Reality, which I think, you know, like the Virtual Boy Power Glove games.

25:22.680 --> 25:30.040
yeah although I actually have a what was the one that was supposed to be for a

25:30.040 --> 25:34.560
eternal champions hmm I have whatever that was it came with the journal

25:34.560 --> 25:40.560
champions um the activator thank you I do own one and also educational games

25:40.560 --> 25:46.880
were listed Oregon Trail was the example so many our forums posted a link to

25:46.880 --> 25:52.080
where you can play Oregon Trail online I'd seen it before but it's a good good

25:52.080 --> 25:56.160
thing to check out full motion video was number three with like night trap mad

25:56.160 --> 26:01.200
dog McCree dragon's lair I'm sorry dragon's lair there's that HD one I

26:01.200 --> 26:07.000
actually do I will be putting out a review of dragon's lair HD coming up in

26:07.000 --> 26:14.080
the next week or so because it's freaking rad it's pretty um to the beat

26:14.080 --> 26:18.880
them up like streets of rage double dragon River City ransom technically

26:18.880 --> 26:27.040
there was one released which was that really awful final fight but no really

26:27.040 --> 26:31.120
awful final fight I must have missed that game and the last one listed is

26:31.120 --> 26:37.120
graphic adventure which includes space quest King's quest maniac mansion monkey

26:37.120 --> 26:41.440
island salmon max oh hell I forgot to mention during housekeeping so I'll

26:41.440 --> 26:46.480
mention it now the silver lining folks the King's quest 9 but not really the

26:46.480 --> 26:50.360
fan project that changed his name to the Silver Lining, they released a patch for their demo

26:50.360 --> 26:53.700
and it's available on our site. So if you downloaded the demo last week, please download

26:53.700 --> 26:56.880
the patch. It's available on our site in the download section. Thank you for reminding

26:56.880 --> 26:57.880
me.

26:57.880 --> 26:58.880
You're welcome.

26:58.880 --> 27:03.480
Yeah, actually the beat-em-up is not completely dead, but yeah, it is dying. I think the last

27:03.480 --> 27:06.960
notable beat-em-up I saw was Guilty Gear Isuka.

27:06.960 --> 27:12.560
Yeah. Well, I did the, like, you know, and they actually started putting those in as

27:12.560 --> 27:15.360
little side games in the Tekken series.

27:15.360 --> 27:19.280
Well, if you want to talk about beat-em-ups on the PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment, which is,

27:19.280 --> 27:23.520
I think, Guilty Gear X2 Reload or something like that, but anyways, that is going to have

27:23.520 --> 27:27.320
a beat-em-up in it, as well as a fighting game for the PSP, and the next beat-em-up

27:27.320 --> 27:30.880
I can think of is Yakuza, which is coming out on the PS2, and that's actually done by

27:30.880 --> 27:36.080
Sega Sammy, so, that's September, I think, if I remember correctly, so, it should be

27:36.080 --> 27:37.080
good.

27:37.080 --> 27:40.640
Well, JeremyTodd1 sends us another one that I did think was notable.

27:40.640 --> 27:47.640
Um, hello, O.L.R. Jeremy Todd1 here. I'm not going to say again for fear that Rob will freak out again.

27:47.640 --> 27:54.640
He's certainly getting a lot of face time on the program, but hey, we let anybody email us or join the chat room, so...

27:54.640 --> 27:55.640
Well, to continue with the email.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.640
That's right.

27:56.640 --> 28:02.640
Um, would it be possible to listen to O.L.R. live on my 360? No? Yep, I expected that.

28:02.640 --> 28:09.640
But a company named TV- Tversity, I guess, um, has made their program for the 360. Here's a quote from them.

28:09.640 --> 28:13.220
With Tversity, the menus on the Xbox 360 are extended to include

28:13.220 --> 28:17.080
internet content, making it possible to access radio stations, podcasts, and photo

28:17.080 --> 28:17.580
feeds.

28:17.580 --> 28:21.720
So would this allow 360 owners to be able to listen to OLR Live using their

28:21.720 --> 28:22.780
Xbox 360?

28:22.780 --> 28:25.780
And I can't test this out right now because my 360 isn't connected to the

28:25.780 --> 28:27.800
internet right now and it is too much of a hassle to move it.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.040
He said he tried it last week and he didn't get it to work. He's in our chat room right now.

28:31.040 --> 28:35.120
Okay. I'll check it out. Forward the email to my personal account so I can check it out.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.640
To me it sounds like it's something that you would use like the Windows Media

28:38.640 --> 28:42.000
center type of thing or something like that. I'd be curious though.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.840
We could listen to live over the 360, I'm all over that.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.560
You actually can, because I mean, Dan listens to MP3s off my computer all the time.

28:49.560 --> 28:53.920
Well that's just streaming MP3s from a PC. Yeah, all I'd have to do is somehow trick the computer

28:53.920 --> 28:57.440
into thinking you're playing a regular MP3 when it's a streaming MP3.

28:57.440 --> 29:02.040
That's the trick. So, there must be something. Or just download the podcast on your

29:02.040 --> 29:03.280
computer and link it.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.880
Yeah, you could do that too. Well, no, no, he wants to listen to it because you know we have the music,

29:06.880 --> 29:10.620
the music and the live shows that we don't podcast so I can't think of how

29:10.620 --> 29:13.780
to get that to work yeah well who knows maybe this program will work at some

29:13.780 --> 29:20.420
point well the last one is from rye mm-hmm I'm just emailing to say it's

29:20.420 --> 29:24.820
like this is the oler I love you email the one that made me go squeak I'm just

29:24.820 --> 29:28.460
emailing to say how great you guys and girl are I have listened to Orange

29:28.460 --> 29:32.940
Lounge for almost a year but recently registered online anyways I listened to

29:32.940 --> 29:36.140
your podcast and several others but what ended up happening is all the other

29:36.140 --> 29:39.640
podcast just gave up on podcasting with no warning just stopped and left me

29:39.640 --> 29:43.220
really annoyed because they all stopped in a short period so thank you OLR for

29:43.220 --> 29:48.520
being a reliable source for video game news um you know it's tough to do

29:48.520 --> 29:53.600
podcasts every week and I think a lot of people they hear other podcasts and they

29:53.600 --> 29:56.480
want to do their own podcast and you know I'm all for that you know people

29:56.480 --> 30:01.220
want to have a voice but sometimes I think people don't realize how difficult

30:01.220 --> 30:05.480
it is you know it is it does take a lot of dedication and work that you don't

30:05.480 --> 30:08.480
necessarily see in the hours that we're doing the show you know putting it all

30:08.480 --> 30:14.120
together and that's why I have a you know I have a great respect for other

30:14.120 --> 30:17.560
independent podcasters that you know stick with it and nothing against the

30:17.560 --> 30:20.160
ones who don't end up sticking with it you know when you don't have time for it

30:20.160 --> 30:24.200
you don't have time for it but you know it's it's trickier than I think a lot of

30:24.200 --> 30:28.360
people sometimes give it credit for I'm glad that we make time for you guys

30:28.360 --> 30:32.840
heart heart well our love I thought of another TV show I have been watching and

30:32.840 --> 30:35.660
it's a reality show but it's a good one even you'd like it what it's called who

30:35.660 --> 30:39.360
wants to be a superhero yes I know I've been hearing about that and I adore

30:39.360 --> 30:44.480
Stanley except I hate major victory on that I hate him I hate him he can go die

30:44.480 --> 30:49.880
in a fire what yeah I have the first two episodes on the right now come on let me

30:49.880 --> 30:52.800
watch them later in the week yeah you got it actually my my favorite right

30:52.800 --> 30:56.480
now is monkey woman at least major victory had some style to it yeah but

30:56.480 --> 31:01.960
he's an ass he kind of went oh I like monkey woman and yeah I like that woman

31:01.960 --> 31:06.640
is a very Marvel name because like right now that mama has a song on her

31:06.640 --> 31:12.360
Myspace it's awesome well it's funny because I love their names because I did

31:12.360 --> 31:14.840
check out some of the names because actually two of my favorite characters

31:14.840 --> 31:20.520
right now in the Marvel Universe are Big Bertha and Squirrel Girl oh god I love

31:20.520 --> 31:25.240
Squirrel Girl she beat Dr. Doom and now I'm a real dork so let's just close the

31:25.240 --> 31:29.120
mailbag gaming gaming let's get back to gaming and close the mailbag mailbag at

31:29.120 --> 31:32.000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we look forward to getting your emails.

31:32.000 --> 31:38.760
Yeah, speaking of really cool stuff, one of the things that was coming out of E3 was definitely

31:38.760 --> 31:45.660
Crysis and basically Crytek's brand new game using their CryEngine 2.0, for those who don't

31:45.660 --> 31:49.680
know that's the next gen Far Cry type of game.

31:49.680 --> 31:54.520
Well what's interesting though is they're actually looking for people, well they had

31:54.520 --> 32:01.920
a job posting for people to work on a console version of, you know, something for the Far

32:01.920 --> 32:08.520
Cry series. So, you know, one would speculate that, well, it's coming out on the PC, probably

32:08.520 --> 32:15.520
coming out on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. So, pretty interesting. That game looks pretty

32:15.520 --> 32:22.300
sweet. I mean, just the level of detail is amazing. So, should be cool. Speculate away

32:22.300 --> 32:30.940
boys and girls. Well speaking of as far as things being planned SNK is not

32:30.940 --> 32:36.820
actually planning on doing anything for the PlayStation 3 until 2009 according to

32:36.820 --> 32:42.100
Kotaku. That's a long ways away. What the hell are they waiting for? The price to drop?

32:42.100 --> 32:46.540
I don't know. You mean they can't port over another king of fighters or metal

32:46.540 --> 32:55.380
But the quote by Yoshihito Koyama that he told Kotaku was that, and I'll go ahead and

32:55.380 --> 32:58.940
read this to quote, my first impression is that it's expensive.

32:58.940 --> 33:00.580
The PlayStation 2 is good enough.

33:00.580 --> 33:01.580
It's small and cheap.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.740
For us, the manufacturers, we don't have to invest in a new system, and the PlayStation

33:04.740 --> 33:06.300
3 is a risk.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.020
There won't be enough consoles at launch.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.420
Few consoles mean few software sales.

33:10.420 --> 33:13.980
We need to wait three or four years, maybe 2009, 2010 is a good time to release a game

33:13.980 --> 33:14.980
for the PS3.

33:14.980 --> 33:19.440
bring up a very good point though and this is the same reason why, what was it,

33:19.440 --> 33:23.260
the Splinter Cell double agent was delayed because they thought there's not

33:23.260 --> 33:27.000
enough 360 consoles out there and so they delayed the game. You're gonna see a

33:27.000 --> 33:30.680
lot of this with the PlayStation 3 games being delayed till like fall of next

33:30.680 --> 33:34.480
year because of this. Interesting, that's much bigger the news than I initially

33:34.480 --> 33:37.840
give that credit for when we were prepping the show. That's pretty big

33:37.840 --> 33:42.720
because that's SNK kind of taking a stand saying, you know, we're just not

33:42.720 --> 33:48.740
feeling it from Sony. But again, you know, to play Devil's Advocate though, SNK doesn't

33:48.740 --> 33:53.080
exactly put out a lot of games that, you know, I think of SNK and I think about, you know,

33:53.080 --> 33:57.840
games that still look kind of 16-bit. Not that that's a bad thing, because, you know,

33:57.840 --> 34:02.120
playability is what's important, so they could, you know, continue to exist on the PlayStation

34:02.120 --> 34:09.200
2, and there's going to be your, you know, the guy who doesn't consider himself a gamer

34:09.200 --> 34:13.220
or herself a gamer but still has a PlayStation 2 in their house you know

34:13.220 --> 34:16.200
there's still an audience to make games for. I think that they should go through

34:16.200 --> 34:20.520
and actually port some of the games that were really cool on the Neo Geo over

34:20.520 --> 34:25.280
like make an update to them like what about you know the ever ignored Magical

34:25.280 --> 34:29.520
Lord I mean that game I love that game that when it was on you know the Neo Geo

34:29.520 --> 34:32.840
played the arcade and stuff or even like you know I want to say they did

34:32.840 --> 34:36.700
baseball stars or something like that. It makes me weep that magical drop I can

34:36.700 --> 34:40.940
only get on my cell phone they need to like make that I mean I I know that they

34:40.940 --> 34:44.500
like the port games and maybe do like slight graphical updates to them and

34:44.500 --> 34:47.140
stuff like that that's fine because that's what's in right now is you know

34:47.140 --> 34:50.860
people updating some of the retro games and stuff and they really need to pay

34:50.860 --> 34:54.900
attention to some of these older games that were on I mean there there was more

34:54.900 --> 34:59.540
on the Neo Geo than Metal Slug and King of Fighters so come on there was some I

34:59.540 --> 35:03.380
should do a new Fatal Fury game or something like that I mean just put

35:03.380 --> 35:06.800
something out that's different I mean and I know they're not doing it for the

35:06.800 --> 35:09.740
PlayStation 3 that's fine because they're types of games that they release

35:09.740 --> 35:13.260
right now unless they're doing something brand-new don't really need the power of

35:13.260 --> 35:19.220
the PlayStation 3. Did SNK do Adventure Island? No, that was Hudson. Why do I remember an

35:19.220 --> 35:22.340
Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx? Because there was an Adventure Island on the

35:22.340 --> 35:26.580
TurboGrafx. Didn't Hudson work really closely? And Adventure Island 2. Didn't Hudson work

35:26.580 --> 35:31.540
really closely with NEC or something? Because Bomberman 93 and Bomberman 94

35:31.540 --> 35:35.220
were also mainstay, um, turbo graphics games.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.500
Nevermind, Konami, didn't Konami buy them now?

35:37.500 --> 35:39.060
Yeah, Konami's doing the Hudson stuff.

35:39.060 --> 35:42.900
Well then, Konami needs to put out an Adventure Island game, which is, I just completely...

35:42.900 --> 35:44.300
You know what Konami needs to do?

35:44.300 --> 35:44.800
Huh?

35:44.800 --> 35:46.020
Another Super Konami world.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.020
Yes.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.020
Good luck.

35:48.020 --> 35:53.140
They're still doing Bomberman, uh, Bomberman X-Zero, which is coming out in a couple weeks.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.260
There's also the Bomberman game on the Wii.

35:55.260 --> 35:59.660
Oh, there's some love for Magical Drop in the chat room, that gives me warm fuzzies.

35:59.660 --> 36:05.580
Rama says I heart magical drop and DMN professes his love for me when I named magical drop. That's very sweet

36:06.180 --> 36:11.500
I'm just saying that you know, they really do have a larger library of games than those two and

36:12.380 --> 36:16.600
You know metal slug was an awesome game and I did spend a lot of quarters on it

36:16.600 --> 36:23.060
But goddamn stop really porting this game to every single console. I mean and to be honest, you know

36:23.700 --> 36:28.940
Metal slug one through four or whatever. They're up to now. They're all the same

36:28.940 --> 36:35.320
I mean they all look exactly the same with slightly different artwork in there. They haven't changed anything, but hey whatever

36:35.320 --> 36:36.860
It's a fun game, so

36:36.860 --> 36:38.580
Just need some new stuff

36:38.580 --> 36:40.740
You know I think number one

36:41.460 --> 36:46.820
This is probably going to be a slippery start of a slippery slope. I mean if SNK is taking a stand like this

36:47.860 --> 36:53.820
What's to say that some more companies may decide to take similar stands and?

36:53.820 --> 36:57.420
and the PS3 may not be as powerful at launch as we thought.

36:57.420 --> 37:01.900
It's funny you mention that, Drew, because the next story I have is about

37:01.900 --> 37:02.800
Atari.

37:02.800 --> 37:07.740
And it's very interesting. There was an interview on gamesindustry.biz

37:07.740 --> 37:10.260
with Bruno Bonnell, who's the CEO at Atari,

37:10.260 --> 37:15.340
and Atari has said they have no plans to release any games for the PS3 until at

37:15.340 --> 37:16.740
least 2007.

37:16.740 --> 37:20.980
But they're citing a lack of information being the reason why

37:20.980 --> 37:25.180
they are not going to develop for the console but then the weird thing is he

37:25.180 --> 37:30.420
comes out and says that quote picking up the high end of the market the hardcore

37:30.420 --> 37:36.300
passionate fans and describing the ps3 so they're taking a little more of a

37:36.300 --> 37:39.780
soft approach to this like well you know the ps3 is definitely gunning for that

37:39.780 --> 37:42.740
audience but since we don't know shit about it we're not developing for it

37:42.740 --> 37:53.100
next year so very interesting and as far as also interesting is concerned well

37:53.100 --> 37:58.460
honestly it's not really too much of a surprise but John was stranglehold is

37:58.460 --> 38:06.740
actually delayed until first quarter 2007 and it was the very well received

38:06.740 --> 38:12.720
83 is supposed to be one of the top ones to be released it's in development by

38:12.720 --> 38:18.440
midway but it's still a little bit you know to be honest and I actually looked

38:18.440 --> 38:23.320
at the dates on this in my system at work it's only delayed two weeks it just

38:23.320 --> 38:27.720
happened to fall from December to January so it is first quarter now

38:27.720 --> 38:33.520
everybody's like oh it's 2007 it's like two weeks I mean seriously folks games

38:33.520 --> 38:37.240
get delayed first you know what though but that is it is still big news because

38:37.240 --> 38:42.360
that means you miss Christmas they miss rice anyways it was it was I think well

38:42.360 --> 38:45.460
well maybe not they were like a week away from Christmas but still though I

38:45.460 --> 38:49.880
mean it's not a big deal by that time though I mean you're not gonna picking

38:49.880 --> 38:56.840
up for Christmas so I guess that's true most people out there I mean no you're

38:56.840 --> 39:03.160
not gonna have kids doing that so I don't know what if I don't get John

39:03.160 --> 39:09.700
John Woo Stranglehold, I'm gonna cry, I love you, I want a hard rider BB gun and John Woo

39:09.700 --> 39:10.700
Stranglehold.

39:10.700 --> 39:14.940
Anyways, speaking of things though that you might be able to pick up before Christmas

39:14.940 --> 39:21.580
though, we mentioned it before and I think I said the 360 bundle not happening in the

39:21.580 --> 39:23.140
United States.

39:23.140 --> 39:24.140
That's a fact.

39:24.140 --> 39:27.220
Well, one thing that we do know is going to be happening is it might be happening in other

39:27.220 --> 39:30.660
countries in Canada and in Mexico.

39:30.660 --> 39:38.220
For example, in Canada, Futureshop is taking pre-orders for this system now with Project

39:38.220 --> 39:43.500
Gotham Racing 3 and 3 months of Xbox Live Gold and 1250 Marketplace Points.

39:43.500 --> 39:48.600
So that's pretty good evidence there, but if that's not good enough for you, Mexico,

39:48.600 --> 39:51.200
the official Xbox site, has it on their page.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.760
So I would say that pretty much confirms that it's coming out.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.760
So take a look at that.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.200
Damn you Canada and damn you Mexico.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.200
Mexico.

39:59.200 --> 40:05.620
But anyways, yeah, so it's it is coming out. They're saying though. That's supposed to retail. I think about

40:06.140 --> 40:12.180
$3.99 so it's not bad and being that the game's dropped in price down to $29.99. So I

40:12.700 --> 40:14.700
Don't know. Hell. Yeah, I've been to Mexico

40:15.580 --> 40:17.500
so

40:17.500 --> 40:19.500
Should be interesting

40:21.380 --> 40:25.280
If you caught that reference you're you're pretty smart anyway

40:25.280 --> 40:30.120
Anyway, you know how we had that story.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.320
I think Loki just kind of shouted it out at the end of the last episode, but remember

40:33.320 --> 40:37.720
how we had the top 20 gay characters from games or something?

40:37.720 --> 40:38.720
And who took the cake?

40:38.720 --> 40:39.720
Tingle.

40:39.720 --> 40:46.520
Well, isn't it strange that now Nintendo is sending out a survey all about Tingle?

40:46.520 --> 40:51.120
A new survey is up at Nintendo's website and it's trying to gauge what people really think

40:51.120 --> 40:52.120
about Tingle.

40:52.120 --> 40:54.720
Here are some of the questions from the survey.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.720
After reading about this game, how did you feel about Tingle when he showed up in a Zelda

40:58.720 --> 41:00.100
game?

41:00.100 --> 41:05.040
After reading the article on Nintendo Power, did your opinion of Tingle change?

41:05.040 --> 41:07.520
Which of these best describes your view of Tingle?

41:07.520 --> 41:09.480
I'll read the answers to this one.

41:09.480 --> 41:14.720
Funny, interesting, boring, annoying, none of the above, and flamey.

41:14.720 --> 41:18.440
No, I'm just kidding, the last one's not there.

41:18.440 --> 41:22.960
Rupeeland incorporates a unique gameplay system in which everything costs rupees.

41:22.960 --> 41:26.280
The trick is that you never know how you need to pay.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.880
What do you think of this system?

41:27.880 --> 41:30.000
Fun, crappy, whatever.

41:30.000 --> 41:35.960
And do you feel that Tingle is an interesting enough character to deserve his own game?

41:35.960 --> 41:38.580
But I thought this question is very interesting as well.

41:38.580 --> 41:42.680
If Tingle made an appearance in the upcoming title The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess

41:42.680 --> 41:46.260
for GameCube and Wii, how would you feel?

41:46.260 --> 41:51.020
I would be excited, I'd be annoyed, and I'd hit that.

41:51.020 --> 41:54.380
Just kidding about the third one.

41:54.380 --> 41:55.380
That's so sad.

41:55.380 --> 41:56.380
So sad.

41:56.380 --> 41:59.660
But speaking about a game I would hit, that would be Spore.

41:59.660 --> 42:05.740
And Spore, you know, is going to be coming out on consoles now, according to Will Wright.

42:05.740 --> 42:11.020
And you know, one of the things that they were saying is that they were actually developing

42:11.020 --> 42:15.720
it for consoles, and that's been one ongoing problem with consoles is that they don't have

42:15.720 --> 42:16.720
a mouse.

42:16.720 --> 42:23.320
a very good random access device for putting on the screen. A console controller really

42:23.320 --> 42:29.480
makes you want the game avatar based so you don't move on the character. That's why RTS

42:29.480 --> 42:33.840
games suck on the consoles. With Spore, about half of the game is avatar based already.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.940
The creature game and the space game, it would be pretty easy for us to make intermediate

42:37.940 --> 42:44.380
levels avatar based. So from the beginning we thought about how we could move Spore onto

42:44.380 --> 42:49.140
platforms including consoles so I mean duh it's coming to consoles I mean come

42:49.140 --> 42:53.340
on might not be right away you know like the PC game but it's coming I mean

42:53.340 --> 42:58.780
that's just stupid if they don't so wow that's a really gay picture sorry

42:58.780 --> 43:03.260
somebody somebody in chat just put a picture of the upcoming tingle game and

43:03.260 --> 43:09.860
it's uh what do you call it like tingles flamboyant romp in like rupee land or

43:09.860 --> 43:10.860
or something, I mean.

43:10.860 --> 43:12.500
Tim, Tingle visits the Castro.

43:12.500 --> 43:17.140
The fabulous romp of Tingle in Ruby Land.

43:17.140 --> 43:18.620
Tingle goes to the bath house.

43:18.620 --> 43:22.420
I mean, seriously, that's pretty gay.

43:22.420 --> 43:24.620
Let me put it this way with Spore.

43:24.620 --> 43:26.460
All Spore would have to do is buy me a drink

43:26.460 --> 43:27.720
and I'd make sweet love to it.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.860
I mean, it's a beautiful game.

43:29.860 --> 43:31.620
I want to play it so bad, so bad.

43:31.620 --> 43:33.500
I was so mad that we couldn't play it at E3.

43:33.500 --> 43:34.460
We just had the demo.

43:34.460 --> 43:36.540
You keep seeing on all these news sites and stuff

43:36.540 --> 43:39.260
that 3D model feature where you create a creature

43:39.260 --> 43:45.260
And you basically, you know, hit print, and it'll, you know, you pay like ten bucks or whatever to get it shipped to you,

43:45.260 --> 43:48.260
and they will ship you a model of your character, a little statue.

43:48.260 --> 43:49.260
That's cool.

43:49.260 --> 43:50.260
That is awesome.

43:50.260 --> 43:51.260
Are you gonna do that?

43:51.260 --> 43:52.260
Oh hell yes, I'm doing that.

43:52.260 --> 43:53.260
That sounds like something you'd do.

43:53.260 --> 43:56.260
You'd get like five of them and have them declare war on each other, and...

43:56.260 --> 43:57.260
It's like a little kid playing with you.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.260
We can have contests and give them away to people.

43:59.260 --> 44:00.260
Yeah.

44:02.260 --> 44:03.260
Alright.

44:03.260 --> 44:17.900
Well, um, you know, I shake my head at this, just because poor, poor Sony, poor Sony trying

44:17.900 --> 44:29.420
to be like Microsoft again, they are apparently now, um, wanting to, uh, call their, uh, rewards

44:29.420 --> 44:33.140
system on their online service

44:33.140 --> 44:36.660
they want to call it entitlements. Much like

44:36.660 --> 44:40.460
achievement points.

44:40.460 --> 44:45.740
The only problem though is that

44:45.740 --> 44:48.820
the two words are

44:48.820 --> 44:52.620
they can't really use anything against it though

44:52.620 --> 44:57.460
because by definition they are

44:57.460 --> 45:03.220
irreconcilable. I mean, I like what's pointed out here on this article

45:03.220 --> 45:07.220
on, uh, it's on Joystick actually, that, um,

45:07.220 --> 45:11.320
achievement is the act of accomplishing or finishing while entitlement is the

45:11.320 --> 45:12.260
state of being

45:12.260 --> 45:15.620
furnished with a right to claim something. So

45:15.620 --> 45:21.300
by definition they can get away with it, however, it's still

45:21.300 --> 45:24.340
really close. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So if you're entitled to it,

45:24.340 --> 45:27.700
why do you have to earn it yeah

45:27.700 --> 45:31.580
it's a weird title but at the same time you know what I don't think

45:31.580 --> 45:36.380
II it it's not a big surprise that PlayStation is going this route and

45:36.380 --> 45:42.600
I II you know it kinda works for the Xbox so why not do a similar system you

45:42.600 --> 45:43.940
know if it works

45:43.940 --> 45:47.100
I'm not surprised you're gonna pick it up and do it I mean if you think about

45:47.100 --> 45:48.180
it okay didn't

45:48.180 --> 45:52.580
Xbox kind of incorporate rumbling into their controller because Sony did it in

45:52.580 --> 45:53.380
a work there

45:53.380 --> 45:56.940
good I mean yeah I mean if it works one place why not

45:56.940 --> 46:00.860
why not do it yeah I think we need it but it is a dumb name

46:00.860 --> 46:04.540
Entitlements is not the right name there unless they're doing something

46:04.540 --> 46:06.940
unless they have their own unique spin on this I don't know

46:06.940 --> 46:11.700
latency you have to understand Microsoft totally copied Sony in this case

46:11.700 --> 46:15.460
I mean the evidence is there I mean

46:15.460 --> 46:19.980
Microsoft had a time traveling device and they went into the future to see

46:19.980 --> 46:21.860
that Sony was going to come up with entitlements

46:21.860 --> 46:26.860
They went back in time and created achievements. Why isn't anyone doing

46:26.860 --> 46:28.740
anything about this? That's what I want to know.

46:28.740 --> 46:32.620
Why are they letting Microsoft get away with this kind of crap?

46:32.620 --> 46:36.300
This is really, really wrong.

46:36.300 --> 46:40.060
Sony, I feel sorry for you.

46:40.060 --> 46:44.140
Anyways, you're crazy. I'm not crazy.

46:44.140 --> 46:47.540
I'm just thinking... Blaze in our chat room says you're awesome.

46:47.540 --> 46:50.580
But the only person in there that says you're awesome, just for the record.

46:50.580 --> 46:53.960
Don't worry, I only have Ridge Racer on my mind.

46:53.960 --> 46:59.200
Anyways, so speaking of the PlayStation 3 and the 360,

46:59.200 --> 47:03.160
during one of the Game Informer interviews with

47:03.160 --> 47:07.120
the creators of The Darkness, they were asking, you know,

47:07.120 --> 47:11.760
what do you like about working on the PS3 and how is it different from the 360?

47:11.760 --> 47:14.760
Will there be any major differences between the two versions of the game?

47:14.760 --> 47:19.020
And their response was, so far the two versions look pretty much the same,

47:19.020 --> 47:24.180
quite unsurprisingly since we both use the same shader source code and content for both

47:24.180 --> 47:29.540
platforms they will be identically gameplay-wise. There will only be a few minor cosmetic differences

47:29.540 --> 47:34.660
such as in the Playstation 3 we'll have better quality video for in-game TVs and the Xbox

47:34.660 --> 47:39.820
360 will have a bit more room for textures and memory. In other words, both of the games

47:39.820 --> 47:45.820
are going to be almost exactly the same. Very much like how Playstation 2 and Xbox games

47:45.820 --> 47:49.340
are almost exactly the same with slight minor differences

47:49.340 --> 47:53.140
so why do i have to pay two hundred extra dollars for a system that'll have

47:53.140 --> 47:56.160
games that are almost exactly the same as the three sixty because they'll have

47:56.160 --> 48:00.100
exclusive games you can't get on three sixty

48:00.100 --> 48:01.760
oh i'm sorry

48:01.760 --> 48:03.180
i am still

48:03.180 --> 48:07.100
the tekken horror and i have to final fantasy thirteen middle gear solid four

48:07.100 --> 48:11.960
who gives a rat's ass about final fantasy thirteen it's twenty million versions

48:11.960 --> 48:15.340
me hello me uh... tekken

48:15.340 --> 48:19.580
Tekken Tekken. I'll buy Tekken 2. Don't get me wrong. Tekken 2 came out already.

48:19.580 --> 48:23.100
Tekken also. Nerd.

48:23.100 --> 48:27.020
Alright. That is a joke that has not been patented in your toilet paper

48:27.020 --> 48:27.700
drink book.

48:59.460 --> 49:01.180
on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

49:01.180 --> 49:06.320
It's Ron Mazzaltoleme and I am dead tired from coming back from Otacon.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.280
What went on at Otacon? Hey!

49:09.280 --> 49:17.360
Oh, man, I just came back from the biggest anime convention in the country, believe it.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.680
What was the coolest thing that happened at Otacon?

49:20.680 --> 49:25.640
One of the coolest things to me was a friend of mine got hit by a car going to the convention

49:25.640 --> 49:26.640
center.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.640
He went to the hospital.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.040
That doesn't sound cool.

49:29.040 --> 49:33.320
No, what's cool about it was they let him go and we were all at Hooters the night having

49:33.320 --> 49:35.560
dinner.

49:35.560 --> 49:36.560
Were you in cosplay?

49:36.560 --> 49:37.560
Yes.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.560
Please say yes.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.560
I

49:41.160 --> 49:48.860
Didn't stop stop stop stop because I proud of it have gone around Disneyland just as shorty from best to move to

49:50.440 --> 49:52.440
Oh, yeah

49:53.560 --> 49:57.460
Degree of nerdiness, okay. Yeah the dirt and damn proud of the

49:58.360 --> 50:05.380
Thousandth one time I'm going to violate your childhoods right now with this week. I'm posting in the chat room right now

50:05.380 --> 50:10.380
Okay please explain this, explain this for the podcast listeners who won't know what the hell you're talking about.

50:10.380 --> 50:11.380
AHHHHHHH!

50:11.380 --> 50:13.380
Oh no. What is this?

50:13.380 --> 50:14.380
I haven't even seen this.

50:14.380 --> 50:15.380
That is so cool!

50:15.380 --> 50:16.380
Is that a Waldo?

50:16.380 --> 50:17.380
Yes that's right!

50:17.380 --> 50:18.380
And a Carmen Sandiego!

50:18.380 --> 50:19.380
My mic is Waldo!

50:19.380 --> 50:22.380
Now if they had a wedding who could find it?

50:24.380 --> 50:26.380
That's kind of funny.

50:26.380 --> 50:27.380
Wow.

50:27.380 --> 50:28.380
That's a Carmen Sandiego!

50:28.380 --> 50:30.380
No I like the Carmen Sandiego better than the Waldo.

50:30.380 --> 50:31.380
No offense.

50:31.380 --> 50:33.380
That's just good for us.

50:33.380 --> 50:35.380
Seriously, how did you find those two?

50:35.380 --> 50:38.380
Where in the world was she?

50:38.380 --> 50:40.380
Wherever Waldo was, apparently.

50:40.380 --> 50:42.380
Ooh, are they fucking?

50:42.380 --> 50:43.380
Are they fucking?

50:43.380 --> 50:45.380
What is Waldat going to think?

50:45.380 --> 50:46.380
Ooh.

50:46.380 --> 50:48.380
Or Wilmette, what was her name?

50:48.380 --> 50:50.380
I can't even remember.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.380
This is scandal.

50:52.380 --> 50:54.380
Waldo and Carmen Sandiego were off doing it.

50:54.380 --> 50:56.380
But check this out.

50:56.380 --> 50:58.380
We have what's called anime parliament

50:58.380 --> 51:02.380
where people can bring their grievances about anime to a panel.

51:02.380 --> 51:12.380
Waldo pulled Carmen Sandiego out and accused her of using all the government's resources to find her while he was still missing for 15 years.

51:12.380 --> 51:20.380
That is quite possibly the lamest thing I've heard in my entire life.

51:20.380 --> 51:22.380
No way, that's awesome. That's awesome like a hot dog.

51:22.380 --> 51:30.380
I mean, it's lame in a funny way, but you know, I'm just like, my god, anime conventions really are the capital of nerd country, aren't they?

51:30.380 --> 51:34.820
today I want to go to other con next year because enemy expo is a piece of

51:34.820 --> 51:39.940
crap Oh chat room book my room now because right now half the hotels are

51:39.940 --> 51:45.060
already sold out dear God Waldo's friend was Wanda by the way according to DMN in

51:45.060 --> 51:50.140
chat okay we'll talk about that run John okay here's that what else I want to

51:50.140 --> 51:53.420
know what what types of video game content were there at the con and was

51:53.420 --> 51:58.740
OLR horde I didn't know it oh well I was there represent all I knows there was a

51:58.740 --> 52:03.380
couple of Tekken and Smash Brothers tournaments. I tried to get pictures but

52:03.380 --> 52:09.620
you know my grief from the last con. The funk almost killed me. They put the

52:09.620 --> 52:13.920
the gaming room in the big place of the center and still as I'm

52:13.920 --> 52:16.900
coming down the escalator 30 feet away I can smell it.

52:16.900 --> 52:21.900
Run Sean. I have a suggestion for you for cosplay next year to avoid fanboy

52:21.900 --> 52:29.960
funk yes larva wear the mask um blaze in our chat room is trying to get into the

52:29.960 --> 52:32.920
zing here by saying you know because I was talking about anime conventions

52:32.920 --> 52:36.840
being the capital nerd country blaze says a sky remember that you are hosting a

52:36.840 --> 52:42.480
podcast about video games touche touche burn well well done wait wait you're

52:42.480 --> 52:45.580
supposed to make a point I was slightly that was do you say touche that was

52:45.580 --> 52:48.300
haven't made a point that was two degrees okay my culture wants me to go

52:48.300 --> 52:52.660
to Dragon Con which actually would be reasonable since that's actually near my

52:52.660 --> 52:57.000
family. Dragon Con's in Bobby's neck of the woods he'd let us stay at his house

52:57.000 --> 53:03.460
I bet. We can play ChromeHounds all night long. Yuri Lover says we should go to

53:03.460 --> 53:09.560
Yuri Con but actually I'm going to Yali Con. Of course. And oh my god our

53:09.560 --> 53:15.080
costumes arrived me and Chris and Megzi are cosplaying organization 13

53:15.080 --> 53:20.220
characters and our trenches arrived I'm going to be scarred for life should I see

53:20.220 --> 53:27.420
pictures drew I can scar you even worse than that anime next 2007 we're doing

53:27.420 --> 53:33.560
original organization 13 cosplay it's Jesus Christ and the 12 disciples as

53:33.560 --> 53:38.480
organization 13 all the key blades that's beautiful you know what just have

53:38.480 --> 53:44.340
dinner already be online after the show I gotta let you go Rama we want to get

53:44.340 --> 53:49.180
other calls in but thank you for calling okay all right and by the way for those

53:49.180 --> 53:53.940
folks that say hey it's the same people that always call in why don't you call

53:53.940 --> 53:58.340
in because I hate reading that about the show where it's the same people always

53:58.340 --> 54:04.700
call in then you're obviously listening so why don't you call in I don't get it

54:04.700 --> 54:09.660
so let's go to the speaking of so that being said hello you're on orange lounge

54:09.660 --> 54:14.700
radio who's this it's one and only Legend of Zaku hello Zaku what's on your

54:14.700 --> 54:20.420
mind my friend um basically the fact you know obviously the VMA is not having you

54:20.420 --> 54:26.740
know any music games for that you know lame but yet somewhat important video

54:26.740 --> 54:30.340
game soundtrack domination I'm sorry is it yeah could could the record be

54:30.340 --> 54:33.060
starting right now actually if we could put this on record my next statement

54:33.060 --> 54:36.740
Excuse me, one moment.

54:36.740 --> 54:37.740
Fuck MTV!

54:37.740 --> 54:38.740
Thank you.

54:38.740 --> 54:39.740
Yeah, same exactly.

54:39.740 --> 54:47.160
And you have to understand that MTV pretty much, you know, they suck the dick of hip

54:47.160 --> 54:50.520
hop and rap just because it rates in more money.

54:50.520 --> 54:55.140
And you know, this leads you to believe that MTV's that desperate for cash that they'll

54:55.140 --> 54:56.900
pour themselves out for it.

54:56.900 --> 54:58.320
Um, okay.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.640
All those music channels nowadays anyways are just all reality TV anyway.

55:01.640 --> 55:08.360
think that's worse uh g4 were for g4ia you know guitar heroes being nominated for game of the year

55:09.720 --> 55:14.680
and so that leads me to believe that they're gonna you know they're gonna bow down to guitar

55:14.680 --> 55:21.400
i thought g4 wasn't doing an award show anymore um they're doing g4ia and according to i thought

55:21.400 --> 55:27.240
g4i got cancelled uh strange because i just uh whatever i'll believe you i'll believe you

55:27.240 --> 55:35.460
But anyways, you know, you see how on one side they praise rap so much, but on the other,

55:35.460 --> 55:40.320
they just, you know, they pretty much bow down to something that's, you know.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.320
Back it up, though.

55:41.320 --> 55:42.320
Back it up, though, Zaku.

55:42.320 --> 55:47.200
Now, without getting into an MTV discussion, because this is a game show, I think what

55:47.200 --> 55:52.560
it is about, you kind of said it there, you said they do it because it brings in the money.

55:52.560 --> 55:53.560
That's what it's about.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.560
It's about money.

55:54.560 --> 55:55.560
Exactly.

55:55.560 --> 56:08.020
The whole thing is now based on the almighty dollar and they lost touch of who they were

56:08.020 --> 56:09.020
for years now.

56:09.020 --> 56:14.260
It used to be all about music and now it's just whoring themselves out, but that's besides

56:14.260 --> 56:15.260
the point.

56:15.260 --> 56:22.180
MTV lost touch about what 1994 1985 interesting comment in general interesting comment in chat room

56:24.300 --> 56:30.940
MT a blade says MTV owns X fire. I like X fire. I use it. Okay. Okay, that's 1.2

56:31.260 --> 56:33.900
MTV their suck actually started in 96

56:35.420 --> 56:39.800
In 94 we still had him a head bangers ball in 120 minutes. Yeah

56:39.800 --> 56:41.800
Yeah, and we still had really good shows.

56:41.800 --> 56:44.300
We still had AMP in those years too, so...

56:44.300 --> 56:44.800
Oh yeah.

56:44.800 --> 56:47.800
The downhill trend began when remote control went off TV.

56:47.800 --> 56:48.800
Yeah, when remote control lost it.

56:49.300 --> 56:50.300
Oh yeah, that was it.

56:50.300 --> 56:52.800
Alright, I gotta take it back on video games.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.800
So, Zaku, anything else? No, that's alright.

56:55.800 --> 57:01.800
Um, not really, just, you know, the whole thing about, maybe, you know,

57:01.800 --> 57:07.300
if you, for like anime conventions, shouldn't they just give out deodorant sticks at the door?

57:07.300 --> 57:08.800
They have before!

57:08.800 --> 57:18.800
I mean, antiperspirant, not even deodorant. Antiperspirant does a good job at absorbing sweat and thus killing odor before it even begins.

57:18.800 --> 57:24.800
A wise person, a coworker of mine, who I really respect, once told me,

57:24.800 --> 57:27.800
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a drink.

57:27.800 --> 57:28.800
That's true.

57:28.800 --> 57:32.800
They can put baking soda in the sprinkler system.

57:32.800 --> 57:36.800
And that's a good thing I'm not that hardcore about gaming.

57:36.800 --> 57:38.800
You know that at least I bathe.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.800
Alright, this is going to be the geek analogy here, okay?

57:41.800 --> 57:44.800
To keep hygiene before, you know, before anything else.

57:44.800 --> 57:46.800
Alright, last thought, Magus.

57:46.800 --> 57:48.800
This is going to be the geek analogy.

57:48.800 --> 57:52.800
Just as you cannot move the blob, you cannot get rid of confunk.

57:52.800 --> 57:53.800
It cannot be.

57:53.800 --> 57:57.800
Actually right now you can't move the blob because he's lost his mutant powers.

57:57.800 --> 58:00.800
I'll just cosplay as a big can of Febreeze for the next month.

58:00.800 --> 58:07.360
I'll probably expect that if I go to an anime convention, just the smell of B.O. throughout

58:07.360 --> 58:08.360
the whole building.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.920
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go because we gotta take more calls, but thank you very

58:10.920 --> 58:13.080
much for your input as always.

58:13.080 --> 58:19.600
Just for the record, G482006 is going on and their theme is Fake News Show, I'm glad that's

58:19.600 --> 58:20.600
very original.

58:20.600 --> 58:23.920
What do you mean their theme is Fake News Show?

58:23.920 --> 58:29.760
It's Fake News Show, like their G482006 Unite, Vote, Award, Argue is their theme.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.760
Alright, let's get at least one more call here.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.760
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

58:33.760 --> 58:37.760
Good afternoon, or good evening from Seattle. This is DMN.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.760
DMN, my friend! What's on your mind?

58:39.760 --> 58:41.760
I'm upset with you.

58:41.760 --> 58:43.760
Why are you upset with me?

58:43.760 --> 58:44.760
DarkSakura's pissed.

58:44.760 --> 58:46.760
You're supposed to love me.

58:46.760 --> 58:49.760
I do. You don't return my calls anymore.

58:49.760 --> 58:54.760
Well, I can't help changing my number and you not going to the trouble of stalking me.

58:54.760 --> 58:58.760
Look, it's the new hairdo. Now the boys won't leave her alone.

58:58.760 --> 59:02.760
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.

59:02.760 --> 59:06.760
And what leads you to be calling our lovely program tonight, Mr. DMN?

59:06.760 --> 59:10.760
Well, I call first off with terrible, terrible news.

59:10.760 --> 59:11.760
What's that?

59:11.760 --> 59:17.760
Nintendo decided to make me work Sundays now until about 5.30, so I don't get home until 6 or 7.

59:17.760 --> 59:20.760
So, that means ATH is on hiatus.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.760
Awww, I'm sorry to hear that.

59:23.760 --> 59:27.760
Yeah, but I'm going to give that Wii away, one Wii or another.

59:27.760 --> 59:34.760
Alright, could we write a letter to Nintendo begging for clemency or something?

59:34.760 --> 59:36.760
Alright, fine.

59:36.760 --> 59:42.760
I'm calling for several reasons, I have a laundry list, but I'll try to keep them as short as possible.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.760
Alright.

59:43.760 --> 59:47.760
First of all, the $299 leave, total garbage.

59:47.760 --> 59:49.760
Why is this garbage?

59:49.760 --> 59:56.760
Reggie Filane, our company president, has made it quite clear that that 50 wii will not be priced over $249.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.760
That's it. Well said.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.760
That's pretty much all I can say on that. That's pretty much all that needs to be said.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760
Ooh, you know something we don't know, huh?

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.760
Yeah.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:11.760
You do! You do! Oh, God, I'm so jealous that you work for Nintendo sometimes.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:12.760
Yeah.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:20.760
At the same time, I'd hate that, because, you know, on this radio program, I would probably get fired so fast by saying that crap.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.760
Alright, so anyway, change of subject.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.440
no the things the things that I the things that I share with you guys I'm

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.160
very very selective about that's fine um but also you guys are talking about EA

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.400
EA could make a lot more money if they decided to stop spamming everybody with

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.760
Madden and actually not kill their franchises like oh I don't know SSX at

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.080
the same time though EA has spore coming out and they have said that they are

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.640
gonna develop more for the Wii and DS so maybe they are changing their tone a

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.640
I would think that $50 as a price point for software is pretty much going to be the norm.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:08.640
I think what Loki said earlier, if it goes any higher than that, developers are going to have to take a second look at their price points.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.640
Well, anything else you want to say to our listeners tonight, D.M.N.?

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.640
Stakes on a plane is in less than two weeks. Go see it.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.480
Yeah, we'll be there the day. I'm going to Disneyland

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.280
Because I promised somebody

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.040
weeks ago

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:32.640
Bacon and yeah, that's it. All right. Bye DMN. All right. Bye guys. All right. Thank you guys so much for your phone calls

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.160
We appreciate it. And if you didn't get in tonight, go ahead and try it again next week

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:40.220
We really appreciate you guys trying to call in and participate with our program. It's great

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.880
Alright any last-minute stories anybody wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight's program. Um, no

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.880
I'm trying to think. All things considered, it's been somewhat of a slow news week.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.160
Yeah. When the big news is all coming from Xbox Live Arcade, which I think we had like

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.520
five stories on tonight, you know, I think it's a kind of a slow week. No offense to

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.640
the arcade, I love the Xbox Live Arcade, but that's not

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:08.480
the, you know, brain, or I should say the center of gaming right now.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.360
GameTap partnered with Konami.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:17.360
Well yeah, I checked out Gametab, Castlevania, Frogger and Contra, Hard Corps.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.360
Yeah, they have the Genesis-Castlevania game on there now, which is cool.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.360
So that's kind of neat.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.360
What else did they do?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.360
Oh yeah, I was going to say there was that new device, I guess you would call it a device,

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360
Exploder HD.

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.360
They're putting down the PlayStation 2 to upscale all their games to 720p or 1080i,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.360
which I thought was kind of neat.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:45.060
I don't know how great they're going to look, but that is something that's coming.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:49.080
So I guess watch for reviews on that.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.200
What's the other thing too?

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.440
Oh, I think we mentioned last week that Test Drive Unlimited, that the price was dropping

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.960
down to $35.99 of, well apparently that only applies to the US.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.600
So if you're in the UK, you're still paying full price for it.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.600
So that sucks.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.560
Funny Dale in the chat room wants me to point out, and I remember Ecstifer of all people

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:14.680
show me this earlier this week, World of Warcraft now has a Myspace page so you can add music

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:19.680
from the game to your Myspace and I guess other like little animations and things like

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:25.680
that so you can pimp your Myspace with World of Warcraft bling, if you're so inclined.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.800
And Rockstar cancelled the Xbox version of Bully, which is funny because I still haven't

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.340
even seen the PlayStation 2 version of Bully yet and waiting for that one to come out,

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:39.620
someday. I hope they do a 360 version but they said they weren't, so...

01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:42.740
Oh well. I won't wait.

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:48.620
Alright. Well, then I believe that is going to bring our show to a close. Thank you

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.660
guys so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:54.980
It's that time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.060
Drew, thank you so much for being here tonight. Appreciate it.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:03.140
Unfortunately, I can't call you Dr. Drew because that name's taken, so you'll just have to be...

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:07.040
unfortunately taken reverend drew or something or professor drew well like

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.960
professor drew

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:11.260
the post now cuz you kinda let you know the glasses you can have that

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.800
professor look to you are a final thought pie

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.740
low gear final thought my final thought is

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.340
I gotta ask a certain somebody for certain something that I want

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.820
my final thought is a you're not gonna get it

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.540
be die monster you don't belong in this world

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.540
And Dark Soccer, your final thought?

01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:34.540
A. Reject false icons.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:39.540
B. It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:46.540
Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio and podcasting.
