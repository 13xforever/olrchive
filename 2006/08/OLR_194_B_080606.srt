00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,548

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 194 for this August the 6th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:28,134
[SPEAKER_10]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

6
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:52,264
[SPEAKER_10]: More gaming news now, Loki.

7
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:58,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this news is actually a little bit about the DS and how it might interact with the Wii and stuff.

8
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:11,594
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that they're speculating is going to be announced on the 23rd as well in their Nintendo press conference there is going to be about motion sensing control coming to the DS.

9
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:13,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're saying that...

10
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:21,673
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the first games that's actually going to use it is Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, which you might remember is coming out on the DS and on the Wii, so that's going to be interesting.

11
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:27,356
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to basically be an accessory that slides into the Game Boy Advance slot, very similar to the Rumble Kart.

12
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:33,380
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to also be using it with games like Excite Truck and Downhill Jam for the Wii.

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,143
[SPEAKER_08]: It will allow you to connect your DS or DS Lite wirelessly to the Wii and use it as a controller.

14
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,946
[SPEAKER_08]: It says the size of the accessory is going to be about the same as...

15
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:49,081
[SPEAKER_08]: and the Game Boy Advance Rumble packs that they have right now for the DS and DS Lite.

16
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:55,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, they're going to be showing it off at the Leipzig Games Convention on the 23rd.

17
00:01:56,303 --> 00:02:01,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So, speculation for now, but sounds feasible, something.

18
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:06,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I could see that, especially with the whole, you know, DS is going to download stuff from the Wii.

19
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:08,066
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, well, I mean, not...

20
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Game Boy Advance had the Kirby Rolling Game.

21
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:10,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's nothing new, in a way.

22
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,417
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're saying that I think this is going to be more than just one direction.

23
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:37,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more than just tilting it back and forth.

24
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:42,659
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually going to be, you know, kind of like the PlayStation 3 controller is right now.

25
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,120
[SPEAKER_08]: How they're going to be doing it with that.

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,880
[SPEAKER_08]: More along that line.

27
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not quite what the Wii is, but, you know, more than just the Game Boy Advance cards.

28
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:52,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough.

29
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:54,263
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're taking it to the next level.

30
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,384
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the next gen after all.

31
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:57,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.

32
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:02,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still more excited about the new item coming out for the DS.

33
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:08,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's going to be a new Chocobo game coming out on the DS by Square Enix.

34
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:14,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Chocobo to Mahou no Eihon, which means Chocobo in the Magic Picture Book.

35
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:28,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's about a Chocobo farm, and a Chocobo lives there, and a caretaker named Shiroma, which I love puns in games, because the bad guy in the game's name is Kuroma.

36
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:30,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Shiro means white, Kuro means black.

37
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:31,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha.

38
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:38,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, uh, they have to go into the magical picture book world, which sort of makes me think of Winnie the Pooh now.

39
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:55,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, it's going to, uh, be, uh, 3D and, uh, supposed to be, uh, from what I'm seeing, it actually looks like it's going to be a really cute game, just from the

40
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:56,518
[SPEAKER_10]: No big surprise there.

41
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:57,338
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Chocobo.

42
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:59,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Fat Chocobo going to be the star?

43
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Fat Chocobo is my favorite.

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,881
[SPEAKER_01]: Fat Chocobo is not the star.

45
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,803
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I think that Fat Chocobo needs to be like a special character.

46
00:04:05,343 --> 00:04:05,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

47
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe if you eat too many greens, you turn into Fat Chocobo.

48
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:08,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

49
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:16,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the DS can have a new special attachment that will actually make your DS smell like Chocobo so we can actually know what a Chocobo smells like.

50
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Like chicken butt.

51
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:19,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Like chicken butt.

52
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Ninten Cats Ninten Cats

53
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Our chat room is totally getting into the Fat Chocobo thing.

54
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.

55
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,759
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Blaze says, Fat Chocobo equals fan service.

56
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Eddie says, Fat Chocobo is to pwn.

57
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,864
[SPEAKER_10]: WonderDog Harold says, Smells like teen Chocobo.

58
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:04,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it?

59
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Bandit gets a little more morbid.

60
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:08,949
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants some Chocobo nuggets.

61
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, they're just like chicken, I guess.

62
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:12,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Choco-nuggets.

63
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:13,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Choco-nuggets.

64
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:15,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew's giving the thumbs up over there.

65
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:15,955
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

66
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,024
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry for the side note, but when you say Choco Nuggets, it makes me think of that concoction.

68
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think of VG Cats.

69
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:06,476
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

70
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,897
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Kentucky Faraga Chocobo.

71
00:06:11,717 --> 00:06:12,737
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an old VG Cats.

72
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:15,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I also like the Mog Nuggets or whatever they call it.

73
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:22,240
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say on our MySpace, which gives me an excellent opportunity to plug the Orange Launch Radio MySpace over at MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

74
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,341
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's an old, we have show clips on there, and I think one of them has Kentucky Fried Chocobo in it.

75
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Kentucky Faraga Chocobo

76
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:58,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, we should make our show exclusive to one of the consoles.

77
00:06:58,854 --> 00:07:00,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Then maybe they'll send us some stuff, too.

78
00:07:01,074 --> 00:07:01,854
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just teasing.

79
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:02,574
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome, though.

80
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:15,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, they scored an interview with arcade manager Aaron Greenberg, and it actually confirmed that some of the old Xbox Live arcade games are going to be updated to make them more compatible with the Vision Camera.

81
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Spades, Bank Shop Billiards 2, and other classic titles.

82
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, we all know Uno is ready to go with the camera.

83
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,964
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to say it, but I think it's a big duh

84
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,890
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it took a genius to figure that out.

85
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:16,486
[SPEAKER_08]: to play the game.

86
00:08:16,606 --> 00:08:17,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

87
00:08:17,547 --> 00:08:23,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say real quick before we move on, our chat room is lighting up on the whole webcam story.

88
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:27,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, great, now we get to watch more dogs painting while we're panting.

89
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:28,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Not painting.

90
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,831
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:01,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Teenage girls, you cannot get pregnant over webcam, so keep that in mind when you're doing Xbox Live in the future.

92
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:08,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Gorilla seems to think they should do Strip Halo, and DJ Kibbles and Bits wants them to add the camera to Street Fighter 2.

93
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:25,685
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, if you want to know what's up with all the Strip gaming references, earlier in the show we've debated the uses for the Xbox Live camera, and we seem to believe here at Orange Lounge Radio that the use that it probably will get, more than anything, is turning your favorite Xbox Live arcade game into Strip.

94
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:29,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they have poker with that camera.

95
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know they do have the camera.

96
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they should do a drinking game.

97
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:38,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of the collector's edition of it, it's going to retail for $69.99.

98
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:46,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to feature an official art book called Destroyed Beauty and a bonus DVD featuring an inside look of the making of the game.

99
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably some of that stuff that was on live as well as the stuff on MTV.

100
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:55,346
[SPEAKER_08]: If you remember back when they had the Road to Emergency or whatever they were calling that show.

101
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Check it out, November 12th.

102
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,075
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also something else to check out.

103
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we've all been pretty excited about Guitar Hero 2.

104
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:11,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Red Octane had a party in Australia, basically, showing that there were three more songs going to be in the game.

105
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:14,469
[SPEAKER_01]: That puts our track count around 11 now.

106
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:20,555
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be Stone Temple Pilots, Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart, Anthrax's Madhouse, Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil.

107
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,116
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

108
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:40,448
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the other eight that were previously announced, there's Revan Horton Heat's Psychobelly Freakout, Kiss Strutter, good song too, Black Sabbath War Pigs, But Whole Surfers, who was in my room last night, Van Halen's You Really Got Me, Rush's YYZ, which I've played and is fantastic.

109
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,230
[SPEAKER_01]: The bass is so awesome in that game.

110
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Primus, John the Fisherman, and Arterial Black by Drist.

111
00:10:50,686 --> 00:10:51,627
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm waiting for GWAR.

112
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,208
[SPEAKER_01]: They need GWAR in that.

113
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:54,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see my GWAR.

114
00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:03,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what I don't see, which is a damn crying shame, is there's no ACDC.

115
00:11:04,656 --> 00:11:06,157
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a damn crying shame.

116
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,499
[SPEAKER_01]: And no Metallica.

117
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,279
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with that?

118
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to mention this.

119
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:16,784
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still talking about the cam thing, but this is great because this goes back to what they were talking about earlier in the program.

120
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:17,305
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember how...

121
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:24,999
[SPEAKER_10]: We got issued the challenge by Bobby Blackwolf for Chromehounds that's going to be taking place, I guess some inner podcast war thing.

122
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:34,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Bandit decided to step it up and says, good, then when the cam comes out, we can all see Blackwolf's sad face after we all beat him in whatever game he chooses.

123
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:36,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it wrong?

124
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done, Bandit.

125
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:39,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Well done, Bandit.

126
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:41,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, how about taking it a step further and challenging Bobby to strip Uno?

127
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,588
[SPEAKER_10]: We love Bobby.

128
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:48,234
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there's certain things podcasters don't do with each other and that's one of them.

129
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:49,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

130
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:55,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, when we talk about love the independent podcast, we don't mean love the independent podcast, okay?

131
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,358
[SPEAKER_10]: You lie.

132
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:57,478
[SPEAKER_10]: You lie.

133
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:58,539
[SPEAKER_09]: You liar.

134
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Take his mic away, Loki, please.

135
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:00,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Use it for a better purpose.

136
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he doesn't need to have that mic.

137
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:13,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of a better purpose, I think MTV's Music Awards needs a better purpose because they're now honoring game music and sort of honoring game music.

138
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,565
[SPEAKER_08]: They have two different categories now.

139
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:18,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Video Game Score and Best Video Game Soundtrack.

140
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:27,491
[SPEAKER_08]: The nominees for Best Video Game Score include Hitman Blood Money with Jesper Kidd doing the music on that.

141
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck to him because he was awesome.

142
00:12:30,452 --> 00:12:34,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Tom Salta doing the music for that.

143
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:42,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Dreamfall The Longest Journey Leon Willett and Evan Magnet Johansson Love that little...

144
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:51,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion, Jeremy Soule, Electroplankton You know how MTV in their weirdo award shows always throws in some kind of interesting candidate in a lot of categories?

145
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the movie awards always have something weird in there.

146
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:08,788
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it is.

147
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the best video... Ah, that's cool.

148
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Oblivion would be my favorite, but that's... Video game soundtrack goes to... They have Fight Night Round 3, Burnout Revenge, which I like some of the songs on there, NBA 2K6, Driver Parallel Lines, and Mark Echo's Getting Up, which, you know, I'm surprised.

149
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:30,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't Dance Dance Revolution a couple years ago get nominated in one of those categories?

150
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:30,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

151
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:31,866
[SPEAKER_08]: But not this year.

152
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:33,267
[SPEAKER_08]: No love for the VDR.

153
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:33,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It was extreme, too.

154
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:34,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Best soundtrack.

155
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:35,889
[SPEAKER_10]: What about Guitar Hero?

156
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:36,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Guitar Hero.

157
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,114
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very surprising with all the mainstream press love for Guitar Hero.

158
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,556
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very surprised that's not there.

159
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:42,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know.

160
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Conspiracy.

161
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:46,443
[SPEAKER_10]: MTV hates Guitar Hero.

162
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:47,084
[SPEAKER_10]: News at 11.

163
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,608
[SPEAKER_01]: MTV also hates a lot of cool stuff.

164
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:51,150
[SPEAKER_10]: MTV hates you, actually.

165
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,233
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because we love you.

166
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie loves you.

167
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:57,502
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jamie's going to surf the internet up and down.

168
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:59,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, she doesn't love you, but she loves you.

169
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:00,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, baby.

170
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:05,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And she surfs the internet up and down every week to find a website that you ought to be looking at.

171
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:05,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Up and down.

172
00:14:06,006 --> 00:14:06,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Because she cares.

173
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,727
[SPEAKER_10]: She surfs up, up, down, down, left, right, left.

174
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:10,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Left, right, B, A, start.

175
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:13,409
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the website of the week?

176
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:15,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Castlemania Dungeon

177
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:49,946
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the place to go to for anything, you know, uh, Akuma Jo, uh, Dracula X, or, sorry, I should just say Dracula's Castle, um, or Castlevania.

178
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:51,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything having to do with it.

179
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:58,748
[SPEAKER_01]: You have sprite rips, characters, history, sound clips, artwork, emulation, even fanfiction.

180
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Castlevania fanfiction.

181
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a site I have been going to for at least, um, eight years.

182
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband actually introduced me to this site.

183
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:24,994
[SPEAKER_01]: The Castlevania Dungeons URL is castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com slash dungeon.html But you can also, if you Google search Castlevania Dungeon, it will be the first site that pulls up.

184
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:26,996
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's absolutely fabulous.

185
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:31,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the site itself has had over 200,000 hits since it started in 1997.

186
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pure awesomeness.

187
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:38,575
[SPEAKER_10]: www.DarkSakura.com

188
00:15:59,604 --> 00:16:00,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha ha!

189
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:01,367
[SPEAKER_10]: At least on the forums.

190
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:02,429
[SPEAKER_10]: That's alright.

191
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,131
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.

192
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:03,932
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to believe us now.

193
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:08,181
[SPEAKER_10]: You can send those apology letters to mailbag at orangelongtrader.com enclosed cookies.

194
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a runner up.

195
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,040
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

196
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,141
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not your side of the week.

197
00:16:13,781 --> 00:16:14,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

198
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,283
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may mention one more thing, though, about this.

199
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:23,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give public kudos to the folks who run Castlevania Dungeon for keeping it alive as long as you have.

200
00:16:23,906 --> 00:16:24,786
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.

201
00:16:24,866 --> 00:16:25,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

202
00:16:25,086 --> 00:16:27,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm only giving the forum users a hard time.

203
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:28,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have been skeptical of us, too.

204
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:29,228
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

205
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:35,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, this could also be the site of the week, like an actual site, go-to site.

206
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:39,633
[SPEAKER_08]: In Las Vegas, they have the Pinball Hall of Fame where you can go and visit it.

207
00:16:40,193 --> 00:17:09,327
[SPEAKER_08]: and if you're interested in checking out this place you can go play all the games and they have you know games ranging from the 1950s and up to 1990s pinball pinballmuseum.org so if you're in Vegas go check it out seriously that was almost a consideration why have I not been to Vegas for like the past few years like there's all these things I have to go see I have to see this we need to do a road trip live in Vegas I have to see Celine Dion no I'm just kidding I don't have to see her I'm kidding I'm kidding the woman has only done one good song in English and it was a meatloaf song

208
00:17:11,184 --> 00:17:12,905
[SPEAKER_01]: She sounds like crap in English.

209
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:17,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear Celine Dion, if you listen to our podcast, please stick to French.

210
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

211
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,332
[SPEAKER_10]: She did the Cyndi Lauper song, too, and that really upset me.

212
00:17:22,913 --> 00:17:24,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, this isn't to talk about Celine Dion.

213
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,097
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to talk about gaming companies.

214
00:17:29,077 --> 00:17:30,779
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, God no, never.

215
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Is her cell phone game out?

216
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anyone downloaded it?

217
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:36,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone care?

218
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:37,604
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to look into it.

219
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:44,747
[SPEAKER_10]: For you guys, the listeners, I will be brave, and I will pay the $5 to download it so I can review it on the program for you folks.

220
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,307
[SPEAKER_08]: For the listeners.

221
00:17:45,827 --> 00:17:47,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Just for you guys, because I love you.

222
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,350
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

223
00:17:51,071 --> 00:18:05,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, we're here to talk about big gaming companies such as EA, and EA has announced in their quarter one report that revenues were up 13% from last year, but net loss also increased in the same period from $58 million to $81 million.

224
00:18:05,621 --> 00:18:05,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm.

225
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:14,255
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually did this whole earnings report and did a conference call.

226
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:18,977
[SPEAKER_10]: They talked with Gamasutra, and Gamasutra ran this report here.

227
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,458
[SPEAKER_10]: EA revealed, That's a broken sentence, but that's alright.

228
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:22,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you get what it's saying there.

229
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:42,107
[SPEAKER_10]: First Party Wii titles won't be more than $49.99, suggesting that Electronic Arts games may debut for Wii at $49.99 at launch, but they haven't really committed to that.

230
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,990
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to read more details on the call, visit Gamasutra.com.

231
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:46,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to hear something, Poopy?

232
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:47,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

233
00:18:48,473 --> 00:18:53,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Activision titles, they just updated their prices in our system, and they all jumped $10.

234
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:54,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they're all $59.99 for the Wii.

235
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Boo!

236
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they'll change once they see that everybody else is $49.99.

237
00:18:59,482 --> 00:18:59,722
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

238
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:10,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of losses, I feel so bad for them, sort of.

239
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:20,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega Sammy loses, their profit basically dropped down 93%, at least from their Pachinko machine sales.

240
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Ouch.

241
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is actually kind of surprising since Spachinko is like hardcore, you know, in Japan, but still.

242
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:38,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had a profit of 779 million yen, about 6.8 million dollars, which dropped from 10.7 billion yen.

243
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:41,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's quite a bit of loss.

244
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,471
[SPEAKER_01]: They're blaming upfront development costs for game making.

245
00:19:46,391 --> 00:20:11,993
[SPEAKER_01]: and had a loss of 4.06 billion yen in the games division which was twice as much as last year's losses they're still saying however that despite this setbacks they are going to the previous full year earnings their commitment was to stay on track so yeah let's see we'll see

246
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:15,886
[SPEAKER_10]: A very interesting story related to gaming.

247
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,327
[SPEAKER_10]: This is also another story, actually, coming from Gamasu.

248
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:19,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Go figure.

249
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:25,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Full Spectrum Warrior is being used to treat PTSD in war veterans.

250
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:32,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be short for post-traumatic... Thank you, everybody.

251
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:32,875
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

252
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:36,037
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a quote from the article.

253
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:42,400
[SPEAKER_10]: The idea being to be in the high-stimulus environment for a long period of time, maintaining a low psycho-psychological arousal.

254
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Dennis Wood, Doctor at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, California

255
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see what's in our mailbag.

256
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:34,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.

257
00:21:34,976 --> 00:21:35,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.

258
00:21:36,317 --> 00:21:44,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, as you might have heard in the first part of the show, I had my hair done at this really cool place in the Castro in San Francisco called the John Brody Salon.

259
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:47,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make a mention.

260
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:56,272
[SPEAKER_01]: On August 13th, they're doing a grand opening celebration with proceeds going to a Benefit AIDS Emergency Fund and the Breast Cancer Emergency Fund.

261
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:58,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts at...

262
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:28,178
[SPEAKER_01]: 6pm they're having a cocktail hour 7pm with a fashion show 8pm raffle drawing and the dress code is to be stylish so if anyone is interested in attending you can go to www.johnbrodysalon.com that's j-o-h-m-b-r-o-d-y salon.com and click on the RSVP tab you can't get in unless you're on the list donation suggested is $10 raffle tickets are $5 a piece

263
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:30,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be a fun time.

264
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:35,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it goes to benefit the AIDS Emergency Fund and Breast Cancer Emergency Fund.

265
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Hooray for good cause.

266
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

267
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:37,860
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

268
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Now let's get into the mailbag.

269
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

270
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:53,666
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes I can't hear this music without thinking of the old version of our show with you singing.

271
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:53,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

272
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:54,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

273
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:54,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

274
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:55,716
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.

275
00:22:55,856 --> 00:22:59,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our first email comes from JeremyTodd1, who's hanging out in our chatroom.

276
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:03,900
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, since the Dead Rising demo came out this past week, I found an Easter egg in it.

277
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,260
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

278
00:23:05,961 --> 00:23:09,242
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the restaurant's banner, you will see that it says Jill's Sandwich.

279
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:15,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Could this be an Easter egg pointing to Resident Evil when Barry says to Jill, you were almost a Jill sandwich?

280
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since they are both zombie-esque games.

281
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a cool Easter egg I thought I'd share.

282
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:19,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is.

283
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:20,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

284
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:22,348
[SPEAKER_10]: That's funny.

285
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:23,068
[SPEAKER_01]: That is pretty cool.

286
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:26,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Krispy Kreme actually asked a question that has nothing to do with video games.

287
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Do any of you guys watch Lost?

288
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,842
[SPEAKER_01]: That show totally rocks my boxers.

289
00:23:31,064 --> 00:23:31,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends who do.

290
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't watch TV at all.

291
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:33,886
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me too.

292
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:36,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I have my two best friends watch it, but I don't.

293
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:37,489
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weird.

294
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,112
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that I dislike the show.

295
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Between the show and work... It takes away from your Survivor time.

296
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,717
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I didn't even really watch Survivor last year.

297
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:48,319
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I have been watching, though, is Big Brother.

298
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't get enough of that show.

299
00:23:50,787 --> 00:23:53,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know it's crap reality, but I just, it's... I love it.

300
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:55,332
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them unreality shows.

301
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:56,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Go Danielle, go Danielle.

302
00:23:57,794 --> 00:23:59,716
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't watch TV, so no.

303
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:00,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

304
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:11,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, from our dear friend Rob, with two B's, Robway, linked me an article on GameSpy, and just to read his email, it says...

305
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:24,098
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing to look at now because Microsoft is single-handedly resurrecting the puzzle game, and the old games on live arcade are from some of these.

306
00:24:24,498 --> 00:24:26,779
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are being covered by Nintendo's Wii controller.

307
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,062
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I think they got wrong was Maze, First Person Shooter still dominates.

308
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:33,664
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I think they were right about is Full Motion Video.

309
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:38,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Full Motion Video will forever be in games, but not as a primary gameplay element.

310
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that inspiration for new games can come from these genres and feel fresh.

311
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:51,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the top ten that were listed was Space Shooters, like Asteroids, Xevious, Space Invaders, R-Type, Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga.

312
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:52,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

313
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:55,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Icarugo, though, is trying, I think, to bring it back.

314
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Puzzle games, Tetris, Best Move, Puyo Puyo.

315
00:24:58,933 --> 00:25:01,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Light gun games like Duck Hunt, House of the Dead, Lethal Enforcers.

316
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:06,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up was Text Adventures.

317
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,640
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we still have Orange Lounge Radio, the game.

318
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maze games.

319
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:16,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love, though, they linked Mousetrap, which was like my favorite ColecoVision game ever.

320
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:17,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Mousetrap was a great game.

321
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Virtual Reality, which I think, you know, like the Virtual Boy Power Glove games.

322
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:31,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, although I actually have a, what was the one that was supposed to be for Eternal Champions?

323
00:25:32,944 --> 00:25:34,885
[SPEAKER_01]: I have whatever that was that came with Eternal Champions.

324
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:37,367
[SPEAKER_01]: The Activator, thank you, I do own one.

325
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, educational games were listed.

326
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:43,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon Trail was the example.

327
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:48,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody in our forums posted a link to where you can play Oregon Trail online.

328
00:25:49,033 --> 00:25:52,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd seen it before, but it's a good thing to check out.

329
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:57,328
[SPEAKER_01]: FullMotionVideo was number three with Night Trap, Mad Dog McCree, Dragon's Lair.

330
00:25:57,929 --> 00:25:59,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Dragon's Lair.

331
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:00,870
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that HD one.

332
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:07,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be putting out a review of Dragon's Lair HD coming up in the next week or so.

333
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:10,447
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's freaking rad.

334
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:11,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty.

335
00:26:13,568 --> 00:26:17,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, the beat-em-up, like Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, River City Ransom.

336
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:23,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, there was one released, which was that really awful Final Fight.

337
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But, no.

338
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:27,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Really awful Final Fight.

339
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I must have missed that game.

340
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:37,480
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one listed is Graphic Adventure, which includes Space Quest, King's Quest, Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island.

341
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:38,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Salmon Man.

342
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,194
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell, I forgot to mention during housekeeping, so I'll mention it now.

343
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:51,701
[SPEAKER_10]: The Silver Lining folks, the King's Quest IX, but not really, the fan project that changed its name to the Silver Lining, they released a patch for their demo, and it's available on our site.

344
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,163
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you downloaded the demo last week, please download the patch.

345
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:56,105
[SPEAKER_10]: It's available on our site in the download section.

346
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for reminding me.

347
00:26:57,786 --> 00:26:58,527
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.

348
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:02,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, the beat-em-up is not completely dead, but yeah, it is dying.

349
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the last notable beat-em-up I saw was Guilty Gear Isuka.

350
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:07,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

351
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:14,485
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I did the, like, you know, they actually started putting those in as little side games in the Tekken series.

352
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:26,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you want to talk about beat-em-ups on the PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment, which is, I think, Guilty Gear X2 Reload or something like that, but anyways, that is going to have a beat-em-up in it as well as a fighting game for the PSP.

353
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:34,441
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next beat-em-up I can think of is Yakuza, which is coming out on the PS2, and that's actually done by Sega Sammy, so that's September, I think, if I remember correctly.

354
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:35,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So, should be good.

355
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:39,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, JeremyTodd1 sends us another one that I did think was notable.

356
00:27:42,618 --> 00:27:44,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR, JeremyTodd1 here.

357
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,641
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say again for fear that Rob will freak out again.

358
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:56,007
[SPEAKER_10]: He's certainly getting a lot of FaceTime on the program, but hey, we let anybody email us or join the chat room, so... Well, to continue with the email.

359
00:27:56,027 --> 00:27:56,407
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

360
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:59,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be possible to listen to OLR live on my 360?

361
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:01,050
[SPEAKER_01]: No?

362
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:06,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I expected that, but a company named TV... T-Versity, I guess?

363
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,831
[SPEAKER_01]: has made their program for the 360.

364
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:09,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a quote from them.

365
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:17,437
[SPEAKER_01]: With T-Versity, the menus on the Xbox 360 are extended to include internet content, making it possible to access radio stations, podcasts, and photo feeds.

366
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:22,640
[SPEAKER_01]: So would this allow 360 owners to be able to listen to OLR live using their Xbox 360?

367
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't test this out right now because my 360 isn't connected to the internet right now and it is too much of a hassle to move it.

368
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,925
[SPEAKER_10]: He said he tried it last week and he didn't get it to work.

369
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:30,925
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in our chat room right now.

370
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:31,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

371
00:28:31,986 --> 00:28:32,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll check it out.

372
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,028
[SPEAKER_10]: Forward the email to my personal account so I can check it out.

373
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:41,052
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, it sounds like it's something that you would use with the Windows Media Center type of thing, or something like that.

374
00:28:41,172 --> 00:28:42,873
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be curious, though.

375
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:45,734
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could listen to it live over the 360, I'm all over that.

376
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:49,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually can, because Dan listens to MP3s off my computer all the time.

377
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's just streaming MP3s from a PC.

378
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:57,101
[SPEAKER_10]: All it would have to do is somehow trick the computer into thinking you're playing a regular MP3 when it's a streaming MP3.

379
00:28:57,121 --> 00:28:58,102
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the trick.

380
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,903
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there must be something.

381
00:29:00,683 --> 00:29:03,166
[SPEAKER_01]: or just download the podcast on your computer and link it.

382
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you could do that too.

383
00:29:04,247 --> 00:29:04,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, no.

384
00:29:04,987 --> 00:29:09,192
[SPEAKER_10]: He wants to listen to the music and the live shows that we don't podcast.

385
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:11,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of how to get that to work.

386
00:29:11,854 --> 00:29:12,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, who knows?

387
00:29:12,355 --> 00:29:13,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe this program will work at some point.

388
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:17,840
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one is from Rye.

389
00:29:19,001 --> 00:29:21,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just emailing to say this is the OLR.

390
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,245
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you email.

391
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:23,606
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that made me go squee.

392
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,796
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just emailing to say how great you guys and girl are.

393
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:31,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listened to Orange Lounge for almost a year but recently registered online.

394
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:42,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I listened to your podcast and several others but what ended up happening is all the other podcasters gave up on podcasting with no warning, just stopped and left me really annoyed because they all stopped in a short period.

395
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:44,811
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, OLR, for being a reliable source for video game news.

396
00:29:46,472 --> 00:29:51,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's tough to do podcasts every week and I think a lot of people...

397
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,236
[SPEAKER_10]: They hear other podcasts and they want to do their own podcasts.

398
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:55,996
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm all for that.

399
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:56,957
[SPEAKER_10]: People want to have a voice.

400
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:01,599
[SPEAKER_10]: But sometimes I think people don't realize how difficult it is.

401
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:08,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It does take a lot of dedication and work that you don't necessarily see in the hours that we're doing the show and putting it all together.

402
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:16,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I have a great respect for other independent podcasters that stick with it.

403
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:19,008
[SPEAKER_10]: And nothing against the ones who don't end up sticking with it.

404
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:20,929
[SPEAKER_10]: When you don't have time for it, you don't have time for it.

405
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,422
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's trickier than I think a lot of people sometimes give it credit for.

406
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that we make time for you guys.

407
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:29,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Heart.

408
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:30,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart.

409
00:30:30,445 --> 00:30:30,785
[SPEAKER_10]: All our love.

410
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:32,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought of another TV show I have been watching.

411
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,141
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a reality show, but it's a good one.

412
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:34,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Even you'd like it.

413
00:30:34,981 --> 00:30:35,201
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

414
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,743
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Who Wants to Be a Superhero.

415
00:30:36,783 --> 00:30:37,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know.

416
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:38,744
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hearing about that.

417
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:39,985
[SPEAKER_01]: And I adore Stan Lee.

418
00:30:40,366 --> 00:30:42,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Except I hate Major Victory on that.

419
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:43,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate him.

420
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:43,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate him.

421
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,009
[SPEAKER_10]: He can go die in a fire.

422
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:46,451
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Tevo, right?

423
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have the first two episodes on there right now.

424
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:50,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me watch them later in the week.

425
00:30:50,714 --> 00:30:51,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you got it.

426
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:53,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, my favorite right now is Monkey Woman.

427
00:30:54,117 --> 00:30:56,018
[SPEAKER_07]: At least Major Victory had some style to it.

428
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:56,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but he's an ass.

429
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:57,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Monkey Woman.

430
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,611
[SPEAKER_10]: and, yeah, I like Fat Mama.

431
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:03,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Lucky Woman is a very Marvel name.

432
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:07,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, like, right now... Fat Mama has a song on her MySpace.

433
00:31:07,595 --> 00:31:08,176
[SPEAKER_10]: It's awesome.

434
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:18,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, it's funny because I love their names because... I did check out some of the names because actually two of my favorite characters right now in the Marvel Universe are Big Bertha and Squirrel Girl.

435
00:31:19,263 --> 00:31:19,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

436
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:21,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Squirrel Girl.

437
00:31:21,265 --> 00:31:21,905
[SPEAKER_01]: She beat Doctor Doom.

438
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:24,173
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I'm a real dork.

439
00:31:24,353 --> 00:31:26,533
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just close the mailbag.

440
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:28,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get back to gaming and close the mailbag.

441
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

442
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,616
[SPEAKER_10]: We look forward to getting your emails.

443
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:42,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of really cool stuff, one of the things that was coming out of E3 was definitely Crysis and basically Crytek's brand new

444
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Game using their CryEngine 2.0.

445
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,449
[SPEAKER_08]: For those who don't know, that's the next-gen Far Cry type of game.

446
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's interesting, though, is they're actually looking for people.

447
00:31:54,212 --> 00:32:03,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they had a job posting for people to work on a console version of something for the Far Cry series.

448
00:32:04,817 --> 00:32:07,358
[SPEAKER_08]: One would speculate that, well, it's coming out on the PC.

449
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:34,421
[SPEAKER_08]: probably coming out on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 so pretty interesting that game looks pretty sweet I mean the level of detail is amazing so should be cool speculate away boys and girls well speaking of as far as things being planned SNK is not actually planning on doing anything for the Playstation 3 until 2009 according to Kotaku

450
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,555
[SPEAKER_10]: The PlayStation 2 is good enough.

451
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:41,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It's small and cheap.

452
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:43,918
[SPEAKER_10]: For us, the manufacturers, we don't have to invest in your system.

453
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:44,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And the PlayStation 3 is a risk.

454
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:07,874
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be enough consoles at launch.

455
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Few consoles mean few software sales.

456
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:11,620
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to wait three or four years.

457
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 2009, 2010 is a good time to release a game for the PS3.

458
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,387
[SPEAKER_08]: That does bring up a very good point, though.

459
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the same reason why, what was it?

460
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:26,270
[SPEAKER_08]: The Splinter Cell Double Agent was delayed because they thought there's not enough 360 consoles out there and so they delayed the game.

461
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:31,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to see a lot of this with the PlayStation 3 games being delayed until like fall of next year because of this.

462
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:32,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

463
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:36,075
[SPEAKER_10]: That's much bigger news than I initially gave that credit for when we were prepping this show.

464
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:43,800
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty big because that's SNK kind of taking a stand saying, you know, we're just not feeling it from Sony.

465
00:33:44,661 --> 00:33:47,002
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, you know, to play devil's advocate though,

466
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:54,745
[SPEAKER_10]: S&K doesn't exactly put out a lot of games that, you know, I think of S&K and I think about, you know, games that still look kind of 16-bit.

467
00:33:55,085 --> 00:34:10,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that that's a bad thing because, you know, playability is what's important so they could, you know, continue to exist on the PlayStation 2 and there's going to be your, you know, the guy who doesn't consider himself a gamer or herself a gamer

468
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:11,412
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

469
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:34,207
[SPEAKER_08]: or even like, you know, I want to say they did Baseball Stars or something like that.

470
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:37,710
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me weep that Magical Drop I can only get on my cell phone.

471
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,171
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to, like, make that.

472
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:44,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know that they like the port games and maybe do, like, slight graphical updates to them and stuff like that.

473
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:53,764
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine, because that's what's in right now is, you know, people updating some of the retro games and stuff, and they really need to pay attention to some of these older games that were on.

474
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:58,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there was more on the Neo Geo than Metal Slug and King of Fighters, so come on.

475
00:35:00,209 --> 00:35:02,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Do a new Fatal Fury game or something like that.

476
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just put something out that's different.

477
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:07,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and I know they're not doing it for the PlayStation 3.

478
00:35:07,353 --> 00:35:13,997
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine, because there are types of games that they release right now, unless they're doing something brand new, don't really need the power of the PlayStation 3.

479
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Did SNK do Adventure Island?

480
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,160
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that was Hudson.

481
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I remember an Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx?

482
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:22,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was an Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx.

483
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:24,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't Hudson work really closely?

484
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:24,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And Adventure Island 2.

485
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:28,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't Hudson work really closely with NEC or something?

486
00:35:28,923 --> 00:35:35,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Bomberman 93 and Bomberman 94 were also mainstay TurboGrafx-based.

487
00:35:35,184 --> 00:35:35,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Never mind, Konami.

488
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:37,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't Konami buy them now?

489
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Konami's doing the Hudson stuff.

490
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:41,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then Konami needs to put out an Adventure Island game.

491
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,046
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what Konami needs to do?

492
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:45,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Another Super Konami World.

493
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:47,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

494
00:35:47,327 --> 00:35:52,968
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still doing Bomberman X Zero, which is coming out in a couple weeks.

495
00:35:52,988 --> 00:35:54,348
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also the Bomberman game on the Wii.

496
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's some love for Magical Drop in the chatroom.

497
00:35:58,461 --> 00:35:59,602
[SPEAKER_10]: That gives me warm fuzzies.

498
00:35:59,682 --> 00:36:01,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma says, I heart Magical Drop.

499
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And DMN professes his love for me.

500
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I named Magical Drop.

501
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:05,646
[SPEAKER_10]: That's very sweet.

502
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:11,249
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying that they really do have a larger library of games than those two.

503
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:37,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Metal Slug was an awesome game and I did spend a lot of quarters on it but god damn stop really porting this game to every single console and to be honest Metal Slug 1 through 4 or whatever they're up to now they're all the same they all look exactly the same with slightly different artwork in there they haven't changed anything but hey whatever it's a fun game just need some new stuff

504
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:44,524
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think, number one, this is probably going to be a start of a slippery slope.

505
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:57,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if SNK is taking a stand like this, what's to say that some more companies may decide to take similar stands and the PS3 may not be as powerful at launch as we thought.

506
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:02,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny you mention that, Drew, because the next story I have is about Atari.

507
00:37:03,764 --> 00:37:05,005
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's very interesting.

508
00:37:05,505 --> 00:37:10,126
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an interview on GamesIndustry.biz with Bruno Bonell, who's the CEO at Atari.

509
00:37:10,726 --> 00:37:16,148
[SPEAKER_10]: And Atari has said they have no plans to release any games for the PS3 until at least 2007.

510
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:23,171
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're citing a lack of information being the reason why they are not going to develop for the console.

511
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:32,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But then the weird thing is, he comes out and says that, quote, picking up the high end of the market, the hardcore, passionate fans, in describing the PS3.

512
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:37,414
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they're taking a little more of a soft approach to this.

513
00:37:37,474 --> 00:37:43,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, well, you know, the PS3 is definitely gunning for that audience, but since we don't know shit about it, we're not developing for it until next year.

514
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,456
[SPEAKER_10]: So, very interesting.

515
00:37:48,297 --> 00:38:01,941
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as also interesting is concerned, well, honestly, it's not really too much of a surprise, but John Woo's Stranglehold is actually delayed until first quarter 2007.

516
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:07,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the very well-received at E3.

517
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:11,320
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be one of the top ones to be released.

518
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,101
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in development by Midway.

519
00:38:14,302 --> 00:38:15,662
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just delayed a little bit.

520
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:21,105
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, to be honest, I actually looked at the dates on this in my system at work.

521
00:38:21,405 --> 00:38:22,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only delayed two weeks.

522
00:38:23,286 --> 00:38:26,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It just happens to fall from December to January.

523
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:27,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is first quarter.

524
00:38:27,528 --> 00:38:29,228
[SPEAKER_08]: So now everybody's saying, oh, it's 2007.

525
00:38:29,268 --> 00:38:30,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

526
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:31,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like two weeks.

527
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:32,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, folks.

528
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:34,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Games get delayed for stupid reasons.

529
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:35,385
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, though?

530
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:38,267
[SPEAKER_10]: But that is, it is still big news because that means you missed Christmas.

531
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,369
[SPEAKER_08]: They missed Christmas anyways.

532
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:42,991
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, I think, well, maybe not.

533
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,713
[SPEAKER_08]: They were like a week away from Christmas.

534
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:47,915
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, though, I mean, it's not a big deal.

535
00:38:47,956 --> 00:38:50,878
[SPEAKER_08]: By that time, though, I mean, you're not going to be picking up for Christmas.

536
00:38:51,198 --> 00:38:51,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

537
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:53,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people have their Christmas gifts.

538
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go for Christmas, Mommy!

539
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:58,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, no, you're not going to have kids doing that, so.

540
00:39:00,486 --> 00:39:01,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why.

541
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:05,380
[SPEAKER_04]: If I don't get John Woo's stranglehold, I'm gonna cry.

542
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:10,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Lel, and I want a Rad Rider BB gun and John Woo's stranglehold.

543
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:11,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, um...

544
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:22,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of things, though, that you might be able to pick up for Christmas, though, I know we mentioned that before, and I think I said, you know, the 360 bundle not happening in the United States.

545
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:23,616
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a fact.

546
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:29,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, one thing that we do know is going to be happening is it might be happening in other countries, in Canada and in Mexico.

547
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,120
[SPEAKER_08]: For example...

548
00:39:32,557 --> 00:39:34,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn you Canada and damn you Mexico.

549
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:34,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Mexico.

550
00:39:59,724 --> 00:40:02,165
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, yeah, so it is coming out.

551
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:06,707
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying, though, that it's supposed to retail, I think, about $3.99.

552
00:40:06,847 --> 00:40:08,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's not bad.

553
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:13,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And being that the game's dropped in price down to $29.99, so, I don't know.

554
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah, I've been to Mexico!

555
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:18,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So, should be interesting.

556
00:40:21,913 --> 00:40:24,455
[SPEAKER_10]: If you caught that reference, you're pretty smart.

557
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:25,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway...

558
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:28,569
[SPEAKER_10]: You know how we had that story.

559
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:32,991
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Loki just kind of shouted it out at the end of the last episode.

560
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:37,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember how we had the top 20 gay characters from games or something?

561
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:38,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And who took the cake?

562
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:38,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Tingle.

563
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:46,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, isn't it strange that now Nintendo is sending out a survey all about Tingle.

564
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:51,778
[SPEAKER_10]: A new survey is up at Nintendo's website and it's trying to gauge what people really think about Tingle.

565
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:53,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's some of the questions from the survey.

566
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:58,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Before reading about this game, how did you feel about Tingle when he showed up in a Zelda game?

567
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:03,874
[SPEAKER_10]: After reading the article on Nintendo Power, did your opinion of Tingle change?

568
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,577
[SPEAKER_10]: Which of these best describes your view of Tingle?

569
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:08,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll read the answers to this one.

570
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:14,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Funny, interesting, boring, annoying, none of the above, and flamey.

571
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:16,025
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm just kidding.

572
00:41:16,045 --> 00:41:16,725
[SPEAKER_10]: The last one's not there.

573
00:41:17,226 --> 00:41:17,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

574
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:22,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Rupeeland incorporates a unique gameplay system in which everything costs rupees.

575
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:25,729
[SPEAKER_10]: The trick is that you never know how you need to pay.

576
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,350
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think of this system?

577
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:29,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Fun, crappy, whatever.

578
00:41:29,872 --> 00:41:34,576
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you feel that Tingle is an interesting enough character to deserve his own game?

579
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:37,758
[SPEAKER_10]: But I thought this question is very interesting as well.

580
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:45,244
[SPEAKER_10]: If Tingle made an appearance in the upcoming title The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess for GameCube and Wii, how would you feel?

581
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:47,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be excited.

582
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:49,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be annoyed, and I'd hit that.

583
00:41:50,861 --> 00:41:51,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding about the third one.

584
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:55,124
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so sad.

585
00:41:55,564 --> 00:41:56,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So sad.

586
00:41:56,485 --> 00:41:59,047
[SPEAKER_08]: But speaking about a game I would hit, that would be Spore.

587
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:05,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And Spore is going to be coming out on consoles now, according to Will Wright.

588
00:42:05,611 --> 00:42:08,132
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that they were saying is...

589
00:42:10,026 --> 00:42:13,769
[SPEAKER_08]: A console controller really makes you want the game avatar based so you don't move on the character.

590
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why RTS games suck on the consoles.

591
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:33,484
[SPEAKER_08]: With Spore, about half the game is Avatar-based already.

592
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:39,029
[SPEAKER_08]: The Creature game and the Space game, it would be pretty easy for us to make intermediate levels Avatar-based.

593
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:45,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So from the beginning, we thought about how we could move Spore onto platforms including consoles.

594
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:48,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, duh, it's coming to consoles.

595
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:49,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

596
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:53,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It might not be right away, you know, like the PC game, but it's coming.

597
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,921
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's just stupid if they don't.

598
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:55,642
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

599
00:42:56,752 --> 00:42:57,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a really gay picture.

600
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:02,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, somebody in chat just put a picture of the upcoming Tingle game.

601
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:06,177
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, it's, uh, a little bit fruity.

602
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:10,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you call it, like, Tingle's flamboyant romp in, like, Rupeeland or something, I mean?

603
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn, Tingle visits the Castro.

604
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,761
[SPEAKER_10]: The fabulous romp of Tingle in Rupeeland!

605
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:18,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Tingle goes to the bathhouse.

606
00:43:18,602 --> 00:43:20,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, that's pretty gay.

607
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:23,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, let me put it this way with Spore.

608
00:43:24,665 --> 00:43:27,447
[SPEAKER_10]: All Spore would have to do is buy me a drink and I'd make sweet love to it.

609
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,049
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a beautiful game.

610
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:31,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to play it so bad.

611
00:43:31,451 --> 00:43:34,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I was so mad that we couldn't play it at E3 that we just had the demo.

612
00:43:34,673 --> 00:43:47,924
[SPEAKER_08]: You keep seeing on all these news sites and stuff that 3D model feature where you create a creature and you basically hit print and you pay like 10 bucks or whatever to get it shipped to you and they will ship you a model of your character, a little statue.

613
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,345
[SPEAKER_10]: That's cool.

614
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:50,187
[SPEAKER_08]: That is awesome.

615
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:50,867
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to do that?

616
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:52,228
[SPEAKER_10]: That sounds like something you'd do.

617
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:55,349
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd get like five of them and have them declare war on each other.

618
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:57,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a little kid playing with G.I.

619
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:57,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe's.

620
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have contests and give them away to people.

621
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:02,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

622
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:15,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I shake my head at this just because poor, poor Sony.

623
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:19,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor Sony trying to be like Microsoft again.

624
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:32,919
[SPEAKER_01]: They are apparently now wanting to call their rewards system on their online service.

625
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,200
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to call it entitlements.

626
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:37,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like achievement points.

627
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:40,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

628
00:44:43,524 --> 00:44:45,605
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem though is that

629
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:52,420
[SPEAKER_01]: The two words are... They can't really use anything against it, though.

630
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, by definition, they are irreconcilable.

631
00:44:58,581 --> 00:45:03,043
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean... I like what's pointed out here on this article.

632
00:45:04,623 --> 00:45:05,624
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Joystick, actually.

633
00:45:06,424 --> 00:45:06,644
[SPEAKER_01]: That...

634
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:14,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Achievement is the act of accomplishing or finishing, while entitlement is the state of being furnished with a right to claim something.

635
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,421
[SPEAKER_01]: So, by definition, they can get away with it.

636
00:45:17,681 --> 00:45:21,943
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's still really close.

637
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

638
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're entitled to it, why do you have to earn it?

639
00:45:27,345 --> 00:45:28,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a weird title.

640
00:45:29,106 --> 00:45:30,626
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, you know what?

641
00:45:30,806 --> 00:45:36,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think... It's not a big surprise that PlayStation is going this route, and...

642
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:42,474
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it kind of works for the Xbox, so why not do a similar system?

643
00:45:42,554 --> 00:45:46,356
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if it works, I'm not surprised they're going to pick it up and do it.

644
00:45:46,396 --> 00:45:53,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you think about it, okay, didn't Xbox kind of incorporate rumbling into their controller because Sony did it and it worked there?

645
00:45:53,681 --> 00:45:54,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point.

646
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:58,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, if it works one place, why not do it?

647
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:00,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they need to pick the right word, though.

648
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:01,125
[SPEAKER_10]: But it is a dumb name.

649
00:46:01,165 --> 00:46:02,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Entitlements is not the right name.

650
00:46:03,767 --> 00:46:06,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless they're doing something, unless they have their own unique spin on this.

651
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:06,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

652
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:07,945
[SPEAKER_01]: A little latency.

653
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Why isn't anyone doing anything about this?

654
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:11,568
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want to know.

655
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:17,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are they letting Microsoft get away with this kind of crap?

656
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,138
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really, really wrong.

657
00:46:36,158 --> 00:46:39,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony, I feel sorry for you.

658
00:46:40,943 --> 00:46:42,524
[SPEAKER_08]: You're crazy.

659
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:45,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not crazy.

660
00:46:45,827 --> 00:46:47,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze in our chatroom says you're awesome.

661
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,512
[SPEAKER_10]: But the only person in there that says you're awesome, just for the record.

662
00:46:51,155 --> 00:46:53,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry, I only have Ridge Racer on my mind.

663
00:46:55,036 --> 00:47:07,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so, speaking of the PlayStation 3 and the 360, during one of the Game Informer interviews with the creators of The Darkness, they were asking, you know, what do you...

664
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:09,884
[SPEAKER_08]: like about working on the PS3?

665
00:47:10,025 --> 00:47:11,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And how is it different from the 360?

666
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Will there be any major differences between the two versions of the game?

667
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:26,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And the response was, so far the two versions look pretty much the same, quite unsurprisingly, since we both use the same shader source code and content for both platforms, they will be identically gameplay-wise.

668
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:36,673
[SPEAKER_08]: There will only be a few minor cosmetic differences, such as in the PlayStation 3, we'll have better quality video for in-game TVs, and the Xbox 360 will have a bit more room for textures and memory.

669
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:38,054
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words,

670
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:41,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Both of the games are going to be almost exactly the same.

671
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:44,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Very much like how PlayStation 2 and Xbox games

672
00:47:45,891 --> 00:47:48,793
[SPEAKER_08]: are almost exactly the same, with slight minor differences.

673
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:54,997
[SPEAKER_08]: So, why do I have to pay 200 extra dollars for a system that'll have games that are almost exactly the same as the 360?

674
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they'll have exclusive games you can't get on the 360.

675
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa!

676
00:48:00,441 --> 00:48:01,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

677
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:01,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

678
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:09,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I am still the tech and whore, and I have to... Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4... Who gives a rat's ass about Final Fantasy XIII and its 20 million versions?

679
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:10,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.

680
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.

681
00:48:12,009 --> 00:48:12,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Me.

682
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, me.

683
00:48:13,129 --> 00:48:14,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken.

684
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Tekken, Tekken, Tekken.

685
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,790
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll buy Tekken 2.

686
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't get me wrong.

687
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:19,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Tekken 2 came out already.

688
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:20,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you know what?

689
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken also.

690
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:22,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Nerd.

691
00:48:23,712 --> 00:48:24,312
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

692
00:48:24,712 --> 00:48:27,633
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a joke that has not been patented in your toilet paper joke book.

693
00:48:27,693 --> 00:48:28,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Skype line.

694
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:29,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm taking.

695
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:30,873
[SPEAKER_10]: The Skype line is opening up.

696
00:48:31,153 --> 00:48:32,874
[SPEAKER_10]: www.orangelontrader.com.

697
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:36,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Click on Interact With Us to get all the information on the Skype line where you can call us right now.

698
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:37,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Or...

699
00:48:38,547 --> 00:48:39,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

700
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:06,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Ranma Satome, and I am dead tired from coming back from Otakon.

701
00:49:06,387 --> 00:49:07,668
[SPEAKER_05]: What went on at Otakon?

702
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:09,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey!

703
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

704
00:49:12,592 --> 00:49:16,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I just came back from the biggest anime convention in the country.

705
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:17,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe it.

706
00:49:17,275 --> 00:49:19,376
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the coolest thing that happened at Otakon?

707
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:25,861
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the coolest things to me was a friend of mine got hit by a car going to the convention center...

708
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:27,657
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to the hospital.

709
00:49:27,737 --> 00:49:28,797
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't sound cool.

710
00:49:29,558 --> 00:49:33,800
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what's cool, Paul, is they let him go, and we were all at Hooters the night having dinner.

711
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:36,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you in cosplay?

712
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:37,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

713
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:38,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Please say yes.

714
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:38,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

715
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:42,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerds.

716
00:49:42,284 --> 00:49:48,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, because I have gone around Disneyland dressed as Shorty from Best of Move 2.

717
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:48,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerd.

718
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:49,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Nerd.

719
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:50,789
Nerd.

720
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:53,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, you know what we're doing right now?

721
00:49:53,314 --> 00:49:55,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, it's only a degree of nerdiness, okay?

722
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:57,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Nerds and damn proud of it.

723
00:49:57,816 --> 00:49:59,697
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

724
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:05,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to violate your childhoods right now with this link I'm posting in the chatroom right now.

725
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:10,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, please explain this for the podcast listeners who won't know what the hell you're talking about.

726
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:13,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, what is this?

727
00:50:13,265 --> 00:50:13,805
[SPEAKER_10]: That is so cool!

728
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:16,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a Waldo?

729
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:17,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's right.

730
00:50:18,001 --> 00:50:19,302
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Mike is Waldo.

731
00:50:19,743 --> 00:50:22,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if they had a wedding, who could find it?

732
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,788
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of funny.

733
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:27,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

734
00:50:27,169 --> 00:50:28,571
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a Carmen Sandiego.

735
00:50:28,591 --> 00:50:33,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I like the Carmen Sandiego better than the Waldo, no offense.

736
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:34,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, how did he find those two?

737
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:37,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in the world was she?

738
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever Waldo was, apparently.

739
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,372
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they fucking?

740
00:50:43,632 --> 00:50:44,914
[SPEAKER_10]: What is Waldeck going to think?

741
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:47,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Or Wilmette.

742
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:47,877
[SPEAKER_10]: What was her name?

743
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:48,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Waldeck?

744
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:49,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Wilmette?

745
00:50:49,098 --> 00:50:49,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even remember.

746
00:50:49,939 --> 00:50:52,061
[SPEAKER_10]: This is scandal.

747
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Waldo and Carmen Sandiego are off doing it.

748
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,404
[SPEAKER_05]: But check this out.

749
00:50:56,904 --> 00:51:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: We have what's called Anime Parliament where people can bring their grievances about anime to a panel.

750
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:11,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Waldo pulled Carmen Sandiego out and accused her of using all the government's resources to find her while he was still missing for 15 years.

751
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:20,681
[SPEAKER_10]: That is quite possibly the lamest thing I've heard in my entire life.

752
00:51:20,701 --> 00:51:21,902
[SPEAKER_01]: No way, that's awesome.

753
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:30,726
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's lame in a funny way, but you know, I'm just like, my god, anime conventions really are the capital of nerd country, aren't they?

754
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:35,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go to Otacon next year because Anime Expo is a piece of crap.

755
00:51:36,669 --> 00:51:40,651
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to book my room now because right now half the hotels are already sold out.

756
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:41,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear god.

757
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:45,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Waldo's friend was Wanda, by the way, according to DMN in chat.

758
00:51:47,618 --> 00:51:48,721
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about that, Ranchan.

759
00:51:48,881 --> 00:51:50,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's what else I want to know.

760
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:54,191
[SPEAKER_10]: What types of video game content were there at the con and was OLR horde?

761
00:51:55,473 --> 00:52:01,017
[SPEAKER_05]: All I know is there was a couple of Tekken and Smash Bros.

762
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:01,537
[SPEAKER_05]: tournaments.

763
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:06,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to get pictures, but you know my grief from the last con.

764
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,281
[SPEAKER_05]: The funk almost killed me.

765
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:16,767
[SPEAKER_05]: They put the game room in the big place in the center, and still, as I'm coming down the escalator, 30 feet away, I can smell it.

766
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:22,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a suggestion for you for cosplay next year to avoid fanboy funk.

767
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:24,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Larva.

768
00:52:26,414 --> 00:52:26,974
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear the mask.

769
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:33,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze in our chat room is trying to get into the zing here by saying, you know, because I was talking about anime conventions being the capital of nerd country.

770
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze says, Sky, remember that you are hosting a podcast about video games.

771
00:52:38,984 --> 00:52:39,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Touche.

772
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:39,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Touche.

773
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:40,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Burn.

774
00:52:41,263 --> 00:52:41,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, well done.

775
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:42,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

776
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:45,487
[SPEAKER_07]: You're supposed to make a point first, and then you say touche.

777
00:52:45,507 --> 00:52:46,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You haven't made a point yet.

778
00:52:46,248 --> 00:52:47,169
[SPEAKER_07]: That was two degrees of calm.

779
00:52:47,189 --> 00:52:53,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, PodCulture wants me to go to DragonCon, which actually would be reasonable since that's actually near my family.

780
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:55,877
[SPEAKER_10]: DragonCon's in Bobby's neck of the woods.

781
00:52:55,957 --> 00:52:57,638
[SPEAKER_10]: He'd let us stay at his house, I bet.

782
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:02,423
[SPEAKER_10]: We could play Chromehounds all night long.

783
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:05,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yuri Lover says we should go to YuriCon, but actually I'm going to YaliCon.

784
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:06,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course you are.

785
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:10,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, our costumes arrived.

786
00:53:11,045 --> 00:53:15,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Chris and Megzi are cosplaying Organization XIII characters.

787
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And our trenches arrived.

788
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:20,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be scarred for life should I see pictures.

789
00:53:22,211 --> 00:53:24,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Drew, I could scar you even worse than that.

790
00:53:25,252 --> 00:53:30,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Anime Next 2007, we're doing original Organization XIII cosplay.

791
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:35,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Jesus Christ and the Twelve Disciples as Organization XIII, all with Keyblades.

792
00:53:36,624 --> 00:53:37,344
[SPEAKER_05]: That's beautiful.

793
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,005
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

794
00:53:38,085 --> 00:53:39,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have dinner already.

795
00:53:41,146 --> 00:53:41,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Lunchtime.

796
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:42,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Be online after the show.

797
00:53:42,706 --> 00:53:43,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to let you go, Ranma.

798
00:53:44,007 --> 00:53:45,948
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to get other calls in, but thank you for calling, okay?

799
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:46,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.

800
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,248
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

801
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:54,171
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, for those folks that say, hey, it's the same people that always call in, why don't you call in?

802
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I hate reading that about the show.

803
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:58,693
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same people that always call in.

804
00:53:59,673 --> 00:54:02,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you're obviously listening, so why don't you call in?

805
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:04,675
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't get it.

806
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:10,440
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's go to, speaking of, so that being said, hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

807
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,241
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one and only Legend of Zaku.

808
00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Zaku, what's on your mind, my friend?

809
00:54:16,083 --> 00:54:28,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, basically the fact, you know, obviously the VMA is not having, you know, any music games for that, you know, lame, but yet somewhat important video game soundtrack nomination.

810
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:30,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, could the record be starting right now?

811
00:54:31,031 --> 00:54:33,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, if we could put this on record, my next statement.

812
00:54:33,913 --> 00:54:34,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, one moment.

813
00:54:36,517 --> 00:54:37,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck MTV!

814
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:39,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, same, exactly.

815
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:49,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to understand that MTV pretty much, you know, they suck the dick of hip-hop and rap just because it rates in more money.

816
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:56,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this leads you to believe that MTV's that desperate for cash that they'll pour themselves out for it.

817
00:54:57,555 --> 00:54:58,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, okay.

818
00:54:58,235 --> 00:55:01,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All those music channels nowadays, anyways, they're just all reality TV, anyway.

819
00:55:01,596 --> 00:55:02,516
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that's worse?

820
00:55:03,257 --> 00:55:08,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, G4, for G4, you know, Guitar Hero's being nominated for Game of the Year.

821
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:14,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, that leads me to believe that they're gonna, you know, they're gonna bow down to Guitar Hero.

822
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought G4 wasn't doing an awards show anymore.

823
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:18,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, they're doing G4ia.

824
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:20,101
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

825
00:55:20,141 --> 00:55:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And according to... I thought G4ia got cancelled.

826
00:55:24,258 --> 00:55:25,078
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

827
00:55:54,432 --> 00:56:08,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, it's an economy based, the whole thing is now based on the almighty dollar and they lost touch with themselves, you know, they lost touch of who they were, you know, for years now.

828
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:14,723
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be all about music and, you know, now it's just whoring themselves out, but that's besides the point.

829
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:17,785
[SPEAKER_07]: MTV lost touch about, what, 1994, 1985?

830
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting comment in chat room, interesting comment in chat room.

831
00:56:20,707 --> 00:56:20,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

832
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:26,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Blaze says MTV owns X-Fire.

833
00:56:27,754 --> 00:56:28,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I like X-Fire.

834
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I use it.

835
00:56:29,075 --> 00:56:29,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

836
00:56:29,795 --> 00:56:31,816
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 1.2 MTV.

837
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:33,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Their suck actually started in 96.

838
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:35,997
[SPEAKER_01]: In 94, we still had Headbangers Ball and 120 Minutes.

839
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:41,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and we still had really good shows.

840
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:45,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We still had Amp in those years, too, so... Oh, yeah.

841
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:47,785
[SPEAKER_01]: The downhill trend began when Remote Control went off TV.

842
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:48,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, when Remote Control lost it.

843
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:50,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, that was it.

844
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:53,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I gotta take it back on video games.

845
00:56:53,207 --> 00:56:54,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Zaku, anything else?

846
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's alright.

847
00:56:56,428 --> 00:57:07,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not really, just, you know, the whole thing about... Maybe, you know, if you... For, like, anime conventions, shouldn't they just give out deodorant sticks at the door?

848
00:57:07,653 --> 00:57:08,653
[SPEAKER_03]: They have before.

849
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just... I mean, antiperspirant, not even deodorant.

850
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:18,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Antiperspirant does a good job at, you know, absorbing sweat and thus killing odor before it even begins.

851
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Maxes.

852
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:27,598
[SPEAKER_10]: A wise person, a co-worker of mine who I really respect, once told me, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

853
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:28,839
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

854
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: They can put baking soda in the sprinkler system.

855
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:36,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a good thing I'm not that hardcore about gaming.

856
00:57:37,505 --> 00:57:39,087
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that at least I bathe.

857
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:42,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, this is going to be the geek analogy here, okay?

858
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:45,252
[SPEAKER_03]: To keep hygiene before, you know, before anything else.

859
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, last thought, Magus.

860
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:48,896
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to be the geek analogy.

861
00:57:48,936 --> 00:57:52,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as you cannot move the blob, you cannot get rid of Confunk.

862
00:57:53,331 --> 00:57:55,513
[SPEAKER_07]: G4A2006 is going on and their theme is Fake News Show.

863
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:56,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that's very original.

864
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,232
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you mean their theme is fake news show?

865
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:24,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fake news show.

866
00:58:25,032 --> 00:58:29,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Like their G4A 2006, Unite, Vote, Award, Argue is their theme.

867
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,754
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, let's go to at least one more call here.

868
00:58:32,374 --> 00:58:33,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

869
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:33,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

870
00:58:34,895 --> 00:58:37,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon or good evening from Seattle.

871
00:58:37,136 --> 00:58:38,076
[SPEAKER_06]: This is DMN.

872
00:58:38,396 --> 00:58:39,757
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN, my friend.

873
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:40,377
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

874
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm upset with you.

875
00:58:42,078 --> 00:58:43,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you upset with me?

876
00:58:43,038 --> 00:58:43,498
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?

877
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:45,178
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura's pissed.

878
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:46,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to love me.

879
00:58:47,999 --> 00:58:48,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

880
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,740
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't return my calls anymore.

881
00:58:51,818 --> 00:58:54,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't help changing my number and you not going to the trouble of stalking me.

882
00:58:55,059 --> 00:58:56,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, it's the new hairdo.

883
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the boys won't leave her alone.

884
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:01,002
[SPEAKER_01]: My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.

885
00:59:03,103 --> 00:59:06,604
[SPEAKER_10]: And what leads you to be calling our lovely program tonight, Mr. DMN?

886
00:59:07,345 --> 00:59:10,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I call first off with terrible, terrible news.

887
00:59:10,606 --> 00:59:10,986
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

888
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:17,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo decided to make me work Sundays now until about 5.30, so I don't get home until 6 or 7.

889
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,630
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means ATH is on hiatus.

890
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:22,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.

891
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:27,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I'm going to give that Wii away one Wii or another.

892
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:28,514
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

893
00:59:30,255 --> 00:59:33,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Could we write a letter to Nintendo begging for clemency or something?

894
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:36,337
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, fine.

895
00:59:36,637 --> 00:59:39,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt it, but I'm calling for several reasons.

896
00:59:39,718 --> 00:59:42,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a laundry list, but I'll try to keep them as short as possible.

897
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:42,999
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

898
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:47,901
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, the $299 Wii, total, total garbage.

899
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:49,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is this garbage?

900
00:59:50,444 --> 00:59:56,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Reggie Philane, our company president, has made it quite clear that the Wii will not be priced over $249.

901
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

902
00:59:59,211 --> 00:59:59,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Well said.

903
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:02,834
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much all I can say on that.

904
01:00:02,854 --> 01:00:04,275
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much all that needs to be said.

905
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:06,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, you know something we don't know, huh?

906
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:07,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

907
01:00:07,858 --> 01:00:08,419
[SPEAKER_10]: You do!

908
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:09,119
[SPEAKER_10]: You do!

909
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, I'm so jealous that you work for Nintendo sometimes.

910
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:14,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

911
01:00:14,284 --> 01:00:17,566
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, I'd hate that, because, you know, on this radio program, I would...

912
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:21,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably get fired so fast by saying that crap.

913
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so anyway, change the subject.

914
01:00:23,564 --> 01:00:28,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the things that I share with you guys, I'm very, very selective about.

915
01:00:29,088 --> 01:00:29,588
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

916
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,391
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, you guys were talking about EA.

917
01:00:33,531 --> 01:00:40,777
[SPEAKER_06]: EA could make a lot more money if they decided to stop spamming everybody with Madden and actually not kill their franchises.

918
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh, I don't know, SSX?

919
01:00:43,775 --> 01:00:49,157
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time though, EA has Spore coming out and they have said that they are going to develop more for the Wii and DS.

920
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:51,058
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe they are changing their tone a little bit.

921
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:57,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would think that $50 as a price point for software is pretty much going to be the norm.

922
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:08,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what Loki said earlier, if it goes any higher than that, developers are going to have to take a second look at their price points.

923
01:01:10,027 --> 01:01:12,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anything else you want to say to our listeners tonight, DMN?

924
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Snakes on a Plane is in less than two weeks.

925
01:01:16,805 --> 01:01:17,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Go see it.

926
01:01:18,046 --> 01:01:20,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, except this is the day I'm going to Disneyland.

927
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I promised somebody weeks ago bacon, and yeah, that's it.

928
01:01:27,374 --> 01:01:27,795
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

929
01:01:28,215 --> 01:01:29,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, DMN.

930
01:01:29,116 --> 01:01:29,376
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

931
01:01:29,877 --> 01:01:30,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, guys.

932
01:01:30,517 --> 01:01:30,817
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

933
01:01:31,158 --> 01:01:32,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for your phone calls.

934
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:33,680
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

935
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,362
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you didn't get in tonight, go ahead and try it again next week.

936
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,765
[SPEAKER_10]: We really appreciate you guys trying to call in and participate with our program.

937
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,326
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

938
01:01:41,184 --> 01:01:42,785
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, any last minute stories?

939
01:01:42,805 --> 01:01:43,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody want to get out there?

940
01:01:44,345 --> 01:01:45,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we wrap up tonight's program?

941
01:01:46,846 --> 01:01:46,966
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

942
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:51,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to think.

943
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:53,809
[SPEAKER_10]: All things considered, it's been somewhat of a slow news week.

944
01:01:55,029 --> 01:02:00,931
[SPEAKER_10]: When the big news is all coming from Xbox Live Arcade, which I think we had like five stories on tonight, I think it's kind of a slow week.

945
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:01,972
[SPEAKER_10]: No offense to the arcade.

946
01:02:02,012 --> 01:02:04,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the Xbox Live Arcade, but that's not the center of gaming right now.

947
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:05,453
[SPEAKER_10]: GameTap

948
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:12,239
[SPEAKER_08]: partnered with Konami.

949
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:14,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I checked out GameTab.

950
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Castlevania, Frogger and Contra, Hard Corps.

951
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:20,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they have the Genesis Castlevania game on there now, which is cool.

952
01:02:20,344 --> 01:02:21,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of neat.

953
01:02:22,866 --> 01:02:23,726
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do they do?

954
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:31,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I was going to say, there was that new device, I guess you would call it a device, Exploder HD.

955
01:02:33,313 --> 01:02:39,997
[SPEAKER_08]: They're putting down the PlayStation 2 to upscale all their games to 720p or 1080i, which I thought was kind of neat.

956
01:02:40,794 --> 01:02:44,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how great they're going to look, but that is something that's coming.

957
01:02:44,977 --> 01:02:48,421
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess watch for reviews on that.

958
01:02:51,043 --> 01:02:52,164
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the other thing, too?

959
01:02:52,384 --> 01:02:58,510
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I think we mentioned last week that Test Drive Unlimited, that the price was dropping down to $35.99.

960
01:03:00,111 --> 01:03:05,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, apparently that only applies to the U.S., so if you're in the U.K., you're still paying full price for it, so that sucks.

961
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:13,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Funnydale in the chatroom wants me to point out, and I remember Extifer of all people showed me this earlier this week, World of Warcraft now has a MySpace page.

962
01:03:13,743 --> 01:03:19,987
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can add music from the game to your MySpace and I guess other little animations and things like that.

963
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:24,550
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can pimp your MySpace with World of Warcraft.

964
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And Rockstar canceled the Xbox version of Bully.

965
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:31,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is funny because I still haven't even seen the PlayStation 2 version of Bully yet.

966
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And waiting for that one to come out.

967
01:03:34,216 --> 01:03:34,536
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um.

968
01:03:37,283 --> 01:03:39,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope they do a 360 version, but they said they weren't.

969
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:40,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well.

970
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:42,688
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll have to wait.

971
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:43,910
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

972
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:48,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then I believe that is going to bring our show to a close.

973
01:03:48,414 --> 01:03:51,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

974
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,800
[SPEAKER_10]: It's that time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

975
01:03:55,721 --> 01:03:57,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew, thank you so much for being here tonight.

976
01:03:57,402 --> 01:03:57,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate it.

977
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:02,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, I can't call you Dr. Drew because that name is taken.

978
01:04:02,692 --> 01:04:04,193
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unfortunately taken.

979
01:04:04,313 --> 01:04:06,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Reverend Drew or something or Professor Drew.

980
01:04:06,774 --> 01:04:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I like Professor Drew.

981
01:04:08,455 --> 01:04:08,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, snap.

982
01:04:09,176 --> 01:04:10,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you kind of look, you know, the glasses.

983
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:12,498
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have that professor look to you.

984
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:13,498
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

985
01:04:13,538 --> 01:04:13,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Final thought.

986
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:14,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie.

987
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought.

988
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:22,303
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I got to ask a certain somebody for a certain something that I want.

989
01:04:23,824 --> 01:04:26,726
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is A, you're not going to get it.

990
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:30,422
[SPEAKER_10]: B, die monster, you don't belong in this world.

991
01:04:31,003 --> 01:04:32,546
[SPEAKER_10]: And DarkSakura, your final thought.

992
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:34,670
[SPEAKER_01]: A, reject false icons.

993
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,459
[SPEAKER_01]: B, it was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

994
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:46,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio and podcasting.
