Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 194 for this August the 6th of 2006.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,880
And we're going to get right back into the gaming news, but just a quick reminder, if

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,840
this is the first time you're downloading Orange Lounge Radio, don't forget that we

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,640
tape Sunday nights and then release the show in two parts.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,460
So this is the second part that you're hearing now.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,400
So if you want to hear part A, please go back into the podcast feed and find it, which you

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,600
can on our website at orangeloungeradio.com or the same place that you downloaded this

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,760
podcast undoubtedly.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
More gaming news now, Loki.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,840
this news is actually a little bit about the DS and how it might interact with

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,440
the Wii and stuff. One of the things that they're speculating is going to be

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,960
announced on the 23rd as well in their Nintendo press conference there is going

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,600
to be about motion sensing control coming to the DS and they're saying that

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,600
one of the first games is actually going to use it is Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,120
which you might remember is coming on the DS and on the Wii so that's going to

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,280
be interesting. It's going to basically be an accessory that slides into the Game Boy

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,740
Advance slot very similar to the rumble cart. And they're going to also be using it with

21
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,740
games like Excite Truck and Downhill Jam for the Wii will allow you to connect your DS

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,380
or DS Lite wirelessly to the Wii and use it as a controller. It says the size of the accessory

23
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,620
is going to be about the same as the Game Boy Advance rumble packs that they have right

24
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,860
out for the DS and DS Lite.

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,900
And like I said, they're going to be showing it off at the Leipzig Games Convention on

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,380
the 23rd.

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,820
So speculation for now, but sounds feasible, something.

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,660
I could see that, especially with the whole, you know, DS is going to download stuff from

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,920
the Wii.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,860
You know, well, I mean, not the exact same games you're playing on the Wii, but you know

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
what I mean?

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,600
Like there'll be certain things that you can download to your DS, so I could see that maybe

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,400
the motion sensing carries over into what they want to do on the DS, it makes sense.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,560
I mean, hell, think about, what was it, Game Boy Advance had the, uh,

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Warrior War Twisted and stuff?

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,140
Well, yeah, not just Warrior War Twisted, but I'm thinking the Kirby game, the Kirby

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,700
rolling game, Tilt and Tumble, thank you.

38
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,260
So it's nothing new, in a way.

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,860
But they're saying that I think this is going to be more than just one direction, more than

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,560
just tilting it back and forth, it's actually going to be, you know, kind of like the Playstation

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,240
controller is right now, how they're going to be doing it with that

42
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,120
more along that lines. Not quite what the Wii is, but

43
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,520
you know, more than just the Game Boy Advance cards.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Fair enough. So they're taking it to the next level. It is the next-gen after all.

45
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,800
Definitely. I'm still more excited about

46
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
the new item coming out for the DS.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,540
Basically, there's going to be a new Chocobo game

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:14,000
Coming out on the DS by Square Enix. It's chocobo to mahou no ehon, which means chocobo in the magic picture book

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,300
Basically it's about a

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,460
Chocobo farm and a chocobo lives there and the caretaker named Shiroma

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,380
Which I love puns in games because the bad guy in the game's name is Kuroma. Shiro means white Kuro means black

52
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,340
haha

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,100
and so

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,160
They have to go into the magical picture book world, which sort of makes me think of Winnie the Pooh now

55
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,680
But it's going to be 3d and

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Supposed to be

57
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,460
From what I'm seeing it's actually looks like it's gonna be a really cute game just from the no big surprise there

58
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,840
Yeah, choke a bow is fat chocobo gonna be the star because that goes chocobo is my favorite chocobo is not a star

59
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,760
However, I think that fat chocobo needs to be like a special character

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Absolutely, maybe too many greens you turn into fat chocobo. Maybe but um, maybe the DS can have a new special attachment

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,360
That'll actually make your DS smell like chocobo so we can actually know what a chocobo smells like if you like chicken, but

62
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
like chicken, but

63
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,680
But at any rate it will be released in winter in Japan. There is no

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
announcement yet for the US or anywhere else but we're going to get it I'm

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,920
pretty sure. You know what's kind of funny though is they're also coming out with

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,080
another game that kind of ties into the whole Chocobo and like Nintendogs thing.

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,280
Remember cats that came out on the Game Boy Advance how it was like that game

68
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,800
where they're making one for the DS. And Nintend cats? Not Nintend cats but just

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,320
cats. Well they need a Nintend cats. That'd be awesome. Now see our chat rooms totally

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,360
getting into the fat Chocobo thing over at orangelaunchradio.com click on

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,720
chat we have Blaze says fat chocobo equals fan service and he says fat

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,880
chocobo is to pwn Wonder Dog Harold says smells like teen chocobo get it and then

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,960
Bandit gets a little more morbid he wants some chocobo nuggets because you

74
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,320
know they're just they're just like chicken I guess choco nuggets choco

75
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,040
nuggets that sounds like chocolate dipped big nuggets which is disgusting

76
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,920
the fried moogle pom-poms cuz they're kuporific can I tell you a secret and it

77
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,360
has nothing to do with video games I apologize but you remember that time we

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
took I think you were with that we took the road trip with mikkel tov I want to

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,220
say it was when we were driving down for e3 or so you know exactly what you're

80
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,480
talking about dip the Wendy's chicken nuggets in the chocolate shake I thought

81
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,940
that was weird he is weird Drew's given the thumbs up over there what dude I

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,040
used to work at Wendy's I know I did that all the time that's great it is a

83
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,040
tradition it's gross I tried it it's great these are the chicken nuggets

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,120
real chicken that means they're like made of this product that makes shake

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,520
taste good or something sorry for the side note but you know when you say

86
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,280
choco nuggets it makes me think of that concoction putting the VG cats what's

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:13,200
that it was a kentucky ferrago chocobo it's an old VG cats of course I also

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,920
like the mug nuggets I want to say on our myspace which gives me an excellent

89
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,480
opportunity to plug the orange launch radio myspace over at myspace.com

90
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,480
I think there's an old, we have show clips on there, and I think one of them has Kentucky

91
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,360
Fried Chocobo in it from like a few episodes ago.

92
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Kentucky Farraga Chocobo.

93
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I have to keep it right.

94
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,340
Anyway, moving on to a completely different topic that has nothing to do with the rest

95
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
of this.

96
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,520
I guess cool contraptions, since we're talking about things that can be added on.

97
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,120
Of course the Xbox Live camera is coming out soon, and apparently one of our buddies, Godfrey

98
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,120
at Gamertag Radio. He actually got one of the cameras already. Man, we should make our

99
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,240
show exclusive to one of the consoles, then maybe they'll send us some stuff too. No,

100
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,260
I'm just teasing, that's awesome though. But actually they scored an interview with arcade

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,120
manager Aaron Greenberg, and it actually confirmed that some of the old Xbox Live arcade games

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,360
are going to be updated to make them more compatible with the vision camera. Spades,

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,320
Bankshop Billiards 2 and other classic titles. Of course, we all know Uno is ready to go

104
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,520
with the camera, but now if you don't want to play Strip Uno, you can play Strip Billiards

105
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
or Strip Spades.

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,880
Man, they're really trying to push that Bankshop Billiards 2. I mean, first they make it 3D,

107
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,040
now they're adding the camera.

108
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Yeah, they're trying.

109
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:37,900
Man, I don't know. It's kind of funny. But, unfortunately, Bankshop Billiards 2 will never

110
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,660
be as popular as Gears of War, and Emergence Day can't come any sooner, but it is coming

111
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,000
November 12th. That is a Sunday, folks.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,260
I hate to say it, but I think it's a big duh that this game is coming out in November.

113
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,540
I don't think it took a genius to figure that out, you know what I mean?

114
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,940
And so, yeah, emergency is coming out.

115
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,780
They also announced that they're going to be doing a special edition packaging of it

116
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,620
as well, so you can score that on November 12th, and of course this is going to be probably

117
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,180
the next biggest thing to Halo 3, so definitely worth checking out.

118
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,460
One thing that we do know, there will be no demo for it, so you're going to have to wait

119
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,600
a little bit longer to play the game.

120
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Interesting.

121
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,640
I just wanted to say real quick before we move on, our chat room is lighting up on the

122
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,240
whole webcam story.

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,720
Jeremy Todd 1 says, great, now we get to watch more dogs painting while we're panting, although

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,160
watching a dog paint might be kind of exciting on the camera.

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
That might be a good use of it.

126
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,040
Only if the dog is as good as Bob Ross and barks the commentary.

127
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Now we get to watch more dogs panting while we're playing arcade games, and I'm sure that's

128
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,360
a reference to the dude who was spotted on Uno that just had the cam on his dog.

129
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
You know what?

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,920
If I ever get a dog, I will put the camera on the dog.

131
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
I put it on Shermy.

132
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,160
I'm gonna send Godfrey a Uno challenge just so I can see the cam.

133
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
I'll be like, Godfrey, turn the cam on, I wanna see it!

134
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,880
And remember, teenage girls, you cannot get pregnant over webcam.

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
So keep that in mind when you're doing Xbox Live in the future.

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,720
Gorilla seems to think they should do strip Halo.

137
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,860
And DJ Cables and Bits wants them to add the camera to Street Fighter 2.

138
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,720
By the way, if you want to know what's up with all the strip gaming references, earlier

139
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,840
in the show we've debated the uses for the Xbox Live camera, and we seem to believe here

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,960
at Orange Launch Radio that the use that it probably will get, more than anything, is

141
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,160
turning your favorite Xbox Live arcade game into strip whatever the game is.

142
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,160
Strip Uno.

143
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
I hope they have poker with that camera.

144
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
And I know they do have the camera.

145
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
But the Texas Hold'em, right?

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Yeah.

147
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
That'll have the camera support.

148
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,120
I think they should use a drinking game.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
Speaking of the collector's edition of it, it's going to retail for $69.99.

150
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,260
It's going to feature an official art book called Destroyed Beauty, and a bonus DVD featuring

151
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,520
an inside look of the making of the game, probably some of that stuff that was on live

152
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,980
as well as the stuff on MTV, if you remember back when they had the Road to Emergence Day

153
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,920
or whatever they were calling that show.

154
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,540
So check it out, November 12th.

155
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,320
There's also something else to check out, of course we've all been pretty excited about

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Guitar Hero 2.

157
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Red Octane had a party in Australia, basically, showing that there were three more songs going

158
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,820
to be in the game.

159
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,300
That puts our track count around 11 now.

160
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,280
There's going to be Stone Temple Pilots, Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart, Anthrax's Madhouse,

161
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,620
Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil.

162
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,000
That's pretty cool.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,260
As far as the other eight that were previously announced, there's Reven Horton Heat's Psychobilly

164
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,000
Freakout, Kiss Strutter, Black Sabbath War Pigs, Butthole Surfers,

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,580
who was in my room last night.

166
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,240
Van Halen's really got me Rush's YYZ, which I've played,

167
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,520
and is fantastic.

168
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,280
The bass is so awesome in that game.

169
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,640
And also Primus, John the Fisherman,

170
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
and Arterial Black by Drizzt.

171
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,240
I'm waiting for Gwar.

172
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
They need Gwar in that.

173
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,400
I don't see my Gwar.

174
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,320
And you know what I don't see, which is a damn crying shame,

175
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:09,760
is there's no ACDC, that is a damn cryin' shame, and no Metallica, what's up with that?

176
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,920
I have to mention this, and they're still talking about the cam thing, but this is great

177
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,120
because this goes back to what they were talking about earlier in the program, you remember

178
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,480
how we got issued the challenge by Bobby Blackwell for ChromeHounds, that's going to be taking

179
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,160
place I guess some inner podcast war thing bandit decided to step it up and

180
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,400
says good then when the cam comes out we can all see black wolf sad face after we

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,440
all beat him in whatever game he chooses so wrong well done bandit not us well

182
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,920
done bandit okay how about taking a step further and challenging that we love we

183
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,720
love Bobby no no there's certain things podcasters don't do with each other and

184
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,440
that's one of them exactly when we talk about love the independent podcast we

185
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,840
We don't mean love the independent podcast, okay?

186
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
You lie.

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,840
You lie!

188
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
You liar.

189
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
Take his mic away, Loki.

190
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,840
Please.

191
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Use it for a better purpose.

192
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
Yeah, he doesn't need to have that mic.

193
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,160
Speaking of a better purpose, I think MTV's Music Awards needs a better purpose because

194
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,880
they're now honoring game music and sort of honoring game music.

195
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,320
They have two different categories now, best video game score and best video game soundtrack.

196
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,640
The nominees for best video game score include Hitman Blood Money, with Jesper Kidd doing

197
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:32,320
the music on that, so good luck to him because he was awesome, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,760
Tom Salta doing the music for that, Dreamfall The Longest Journey, Leon Willett and Evan

199
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Magnet Johansen, love that little nickname in there, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, thank

200
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,520
Thank you, that's what I was waiting for.

201
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,880
Uh, Jeremy Soule and Julian Soule.

202
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,840
As you were reading that off, I was going, where's Oblivion?

203
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Where's Oblivion?

204
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Where the hell's Oblivion?

205
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,420
And Electroplankton, which is user-generated.

206
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,200
I don't know how that has a soundtrack, you know.

207
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,920
You know how MTV and their weirdo award shows always throws in some kind of interesting

208
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,400
candidate in a lot of categories, like the movie awards always have something weird in

209
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
there?

210
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
That's what it is.

211
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Now, the best video-

212
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Ah, that's cool.

213
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,000
Oblivion would be my favorite, but that's-

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,480
game soundtrack. They have Fight Night Round 3, Burnout Revenge, which I like some of the

215
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:25,360
songs on there, NBA 2K6, Driver Parallel Lines, and Mark Echo's Getting Up. Which, you know,

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,680
I'm surprised. Didn't Dance Dance Revolution a couple of years ago get nominated in one

217
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,160
of those categories? Yeah. But not this year. No Love for the DDR. It was extreme too, best

218
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,240
soundtrack. What about Guitar Hero? That's very surprising with all the mainstream press

219
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,640
love for Guitar Hero. I'm very surprised that's not there.

220
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,600
Hmm, don't know. Conspiracy, MTV hates Guitar Hero,

221
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,640
News at 11. MTV also hates a lot of cool stuff. MTV hates you,

222
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,080
actually. That's why you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because we love you.

223
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,520
And Jamie loves you, and Jamie's going to surf the internet up and down.

224
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah, she doesn't love you, but she loves you. Oh baby.

225
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,180
And she surfs the internet up and down every week to find a website that you

226
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,500
ought to be looking at.

227
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:12,500
because she cares. She serves up, up, down, down, left, right, left.

228
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,720
What's the website of the week?

229
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,580
The website of the week as mentioned in part A of the podcast, which if you haven't

230
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,180
listened to, then you're a big dumbass. I'm sorry. Then you're special.

231
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,060
Thanks. Thank you for losing our new listeners for us.

232
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,900
No, no, no, no, no.

233
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,460
They just need to get a hard dose of my charming bubbly personality.

234
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,820
Or something like that.

235
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,740
The side of the week is the Castlemania dungeon, which is the place to go to for anything,

236
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:50,220
you know, Akuma, Dracula X, or sorry, I should just say Dracula's castle, or Castlemania,

237
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,220
anything having to do with it.

238
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:58,260
You have sprite rips, characters, history, sound clips, artwork, emulation, even fan

239
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
fiction.

240
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,540
Castlemania fan fiction.

241
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:12,220
This is a site I have been going to for at least 8 years.

242
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:21,380
The Castlevania Dungeons URL is castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com slash dungeon.html.

243
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,420
If you Google search Castlevania Dungeon it will be the first site that pulls up.

244
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,260
It's absolutely fabulous.

245
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:35,500
The site itself has had over 200,000 hits since it started in 1997.

246
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,100
So it's pure awesomeness.

247
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,900
Now one thing I have to say about that site though is I do believe I've been to the forums

248
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:48,660
on that site and it was back when, you remember when we had the exclusive news about the whole

249
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,160
new Castlevania DS game, why did I forget, Portrait of Ruin, was that the name of it?

250
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,200
We had the news about Portrait of Ruin before any of the big sites did, their users didn't

251
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
believe us.

252
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,680
At least on the forums, on the forums.

253
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
That's alright.

254
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,040
That's okay, they have to believe us now.

255
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,360
You can send those apology letters to mailbag at orangelongtrader.com, enclose cookies.

256
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
I have a runner-up.

257
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
What's that?

258
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Side of the week.

259
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,880
Okay, well it's not your side of the week.

260
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Whatever.

261
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,560
If I may mention one more thing though about this, I want to give public kudos to the folks

262
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,000
who run Castlevania Dungeon, for keeping it alive as long as you have.

263
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's beautiful.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Oh yeah, I'm only giving the forum users a hard time.

265
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,880
I would have been skeptical of us, too.

266
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
It's fine.

267
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,840
Well, anyways, this could also be the site of the week, like an actual site, go-to site.

268
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,320
In Las Vegas, they have the Pinball Hall of Fame, where you can go and visit it.

269
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,480
And if you're interested in checking out this place, you can go play all the games.

270
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,400
And they have games ranging from the 1950s and up to 1990s Pinball.

271
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
pinball museum org

272
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,160
So if you're in Vegas go check it out. Seriously. That was almost a consideration

273
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,520
Why have I not been to Vegas for like the past few years like there's all these things

274
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,920
I have to go see I have to see this we need to do a road trip

275
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,760
I have to see Celine Dion. I know I'm just kidding. I don't have to see her. I'm kidding

276
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,160
I'm kidding. The woman has only done one good song in English, and it was a meatloaf song

277
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
She sounds like crap in English

278
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,220
So late dear Celine Dion, if you listen to our podcast, please stick to French. Thank you

279
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,580
She she did the Cyndi Lauper song too, and that really upset me. But anyway, this isn't to talk about Celine Dion

280
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,740
It's to talk about

281
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,620
gaming companies

282
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,700
No, no god. No, never

283
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,360
Is it new is her cell phone game out? Has anyone downloaded it? Does anyone care? I'm gonna look and

284
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,240
And for you guys, the listeners, I will be brave, and I will pay the $5 to download it

285
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,000
so I can review it on the program for you folks.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,040
Just for you guys, because I love you.

287
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,760
Alright, look, we're here to talk about big gaming companies such as EA, and EA has announced

288
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:02,700
in their quarter one report that revenues were up 13% from last year, but net loss also

289
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,920
increased in the same period from 58 million to 81 million.

290
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,040
They actually did this whole earnings report and did a conference call.

291
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,520
They talked with Gama Sutra and Gama Sutra ran this report here, EA revealed, we have

292
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,940
ramped up game production for the Wii and DS Lite following significant excitement over

293
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,380
the Nintendo-created consoles at E3.

294
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,360
That's a broken sentence, but that's alright, I think you get what it's saying there.

295
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,160
party Wii titles won't be more than $49.99, suggesting that Electronic Arts Games may

296
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,640
debut for Wii at $49.99 at launch, but they haven't really committed to that. If you want

297
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,680
to read more details on the call, visit gamasutra.com.

298
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Wanna hear something poopy?

299
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,520
Ok. Activision titles, they just updated their prices in our system and they all jumped $10.

300
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,020
Now they're all $59.99 for the Wii. Boo! I'm sure they'll change once they see that everybody

301
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,760
else is $49.99.

302
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:13,180
see well speaking of losses I feel so bad for them sort of Sega Sammy loses a

303
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:20,100
their profit basically dropped down 93% at least from their pachinko machine

304
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,500
sales ouch yeah which is actually kind of surprising since pachinko is like

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,500
hardcore you know in Japan but still um yeah they had a profit of 779 million

306
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,500
yen about 6.8 million dollars which dropped from 10.7 billion yen so that's

307
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,940
quite a bit of loss and they're blaming upfront development costs for game

308
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:52,620
making and had a loss of 4.06 billion yen in the games division which was

309
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,860
twice as much as last year's losses um they're still saying however that

310
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:04,740
despite this setbacks they are going to the previous full year earnings would a

311
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:13,420
their commitment was stay on track so yeah all right let's see we'll see um a

312
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:18,180
very interesting story I'm related to gaming this is also another story

313
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,300
actually coming from Gama Sutra go figure full spectrum warrior is being

314
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:30,300
used to treat PTSD in war veterans and that would be short for post-traumatic

315
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:36,140
thank you everybody all right the idea this is a quote from the article the

316
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,660
idea being to be in the high stimulus environment for a long period of time

317
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,100
maintaining a low psycho psychological arousal commented Dennis would a doctor

318
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,820
at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego California where the treatment is

319
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,020
currently being tested on non-combat personnel.

320
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,280
The person can then take that learning in the therapeutic environment and transport

321
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,080
it out or generalize it to day-to-day life.

322
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,260
Very interesting, huh?

323
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,260
Very interesting.

324
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,660
So see, there's good news about video games too.

325
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Exactly.

326
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:11,460
It's not all murders and death and stuff, you know, beating hookers, unlike war.

327
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,700
But anyway, let's see what's in our mailbag.

328
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,380
Every week we let you guys email us.

329
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,040
It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura likes to put on her hazmat suit

330
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,180
and get geared up and jump on in there and read the mail.

331
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
But first...

332
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,500
I had to replace the hazmat suit.

333
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,180
But first, Dark Sakura has a special announcement she would like to give to our listeners.

334
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
Yes, I do.

335
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Yes, I do.

336
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Basically...

337
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,180
Now, this is...

338
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,460
As you might have heard in the first part of the show, I had my hair done at this really

339
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,100
cool place in the Castro in San Francisco called the John Brody Salon.

340
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,780
just wanted to make a mention on August 13th they're doing a grand opening

349
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,040
now let's get into the mailbag yes please

350
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,960
you know sometimes though i can't hear this music without thinking of uh the old version of our show

351
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,160
with you singing i know i'm sorry it's okay well our first email comes from jeremy todd one who's

352
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,880
hanging out in our chat room says uh since the dead rising demo came out this past week i found

353
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,840
an easter egg in it that's pretty cool if you look at the restaurant's banner you will see that it

354
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,440
says jill's sandwich could this be an easter egg pointing to resident evil when barry says to jill

355
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,640
you were almost a jill sandwich especially since they are both zombie games just a cool easter

356
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,560
egg i thought i'd share i think it is absolutely that's funny that is pretty cool krispy kreme um

357
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,400
actually asked a question has nothing to do with video games do any of you guys watch lost that

358
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,180
That show totally ruptures my boxers.

359
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,180
I have friends who do.

360
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
I don't watch TV at all.

361
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
Yeah, that's me too.

362
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,080
I have my two best friends watch it, but I don't.

363
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,800
It's weird.

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,520
It's not that I dislike the show, I just, you know, between the show and Quirk.

365
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,160
It takes away from your Survivor time.

366
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,720
No, I didn't even really watch Survivor last year.

367
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,280
You know what I have been watching, though, is Big Brother.

368
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,640
I can't get enough of that show.

369
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
I know, I know it's crap reality, but I just, it's...

370
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I love it.

371
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,560
I call them unreality shows.

372
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Go, Danielle.

373
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Go, Danielle.

374
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
But I don't watch TV, so no.

375
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Alright.

376
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Also, from our dear friend Rob, with two B's. Robway.

377
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,560
It links me to an article on GameSpy, and just to read his email, it says,

378
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
It's amazing to look at-

379
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Basically, three years ago, GameSpy did an article on top ten dying game genres.

380
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,560
It's amazing to look at now because Microsoft is single-handedly resurrecting the puzzle game,

381
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,560
and the old games on Live Arcade are from some of these.

382
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
The rest are being covered by Nintendo's Wii controller.

383
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,680
The one I think they got wrong was Mei's first person shooter still dominates.

384
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,780
The one I think they are right about is full motion video.

385
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,460
Full motion video will never be in game, will forever be in games, but not as a primary

386
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,460
gameplay element.

387
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,820
I think that inspiration for new games can come from these genres and feel fresh.

388
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,140
Basically the top ten that were listed was space shooters, like Asteroids, Xevious, Space

389
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:55,320
Invaders, R-Type, Radiant, Silver Gun, Ikaruga, um, Ikaruga though is trying I think to bring

390
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
it back.

391
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,720
games, Tetris, Bus to Move, Puyo Puyo, light gun games like Duck Hunt, House of the Dead,

392
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,320
Lethal Enforcers. Um, next up was, uh, Text Adventures. Hey, we still have Orange

393
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,140
Lounge Radio the game. Then Maze Games. And I love, though, they linked Mouse Trap,

394
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,720
which was like my favorite ColecoVision game ever. Mouse Trap was a great game.

395
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,680
Virtual Reality, which I think, you know, like the Virtual Boy Power Glove games.

396
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:30,040
yeah although I actually have a what was the one that was supposed to be for a

397
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,560
eternal champions hmm I have whatever that was it came with the journal

398
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,560
champions um the activator thank you I do own one and also educational games

399
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,880
were listed Oregon Trail was the example so many our forums posted a link to

400
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,080
where you can play Oregon Trail online I'd seen it before but it's a good good

401
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,160
thing to check out full motion video was number three with like night trap mad

402
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,200
dog McCree dragon's lair I'm sorry dragon's lair there's that HD one I

403
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,000
actually do I will be putting out a review of dragon's lair HD coming up in

404
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,080
the next week or so because it's freaking rad it's pretty um to the beat

405
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,880
them up like streets of rage double dragon River City ransom technically

406
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:27,040
there was one released which was that really awful final fight but no really

407
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,120
awful final fight I must have missed that game and the last one listed is

408
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,120
graphic adventure which includes space quest King's quest maniac mansion monkey

409
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,440
island salmon max oh hell I forgot to mention during housekeeping so I'll

410
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,480
mention it now the silver lining folks the King's quest 9 but not really the

411
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,360
fan project that changed his name to the Silver Lining, they released a patch for their demo

412
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,700
and it's available on our site. So if you downloaded the demo last week, please download

413
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,880
the patch. It's available on our site in the download section. Thank you for reminding

414
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
me.

415
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,880
You're welcome.

416
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,480
Yeah, actually the beat-em-up is not completely dead, but yeah, it is dying. I think the last

417
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,960
notable beat-em-up I saw was Guilty Gear Isuka.

418
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,560
Yeah. Well, I did the, like, you know, and they actually started putting those in as

419
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,360
little side games in the Tekken series.

420
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,280
Well, if you want to talk about beat-em-ups on the PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment, which is,

421
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,520
I think, Guilty Gear X2 Reload or something like that, but anyways, that is going to have

422
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,320
a beat-em-up in it, as well as a fighting game for the PSP, and the next beat-em-up

423
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,880
I can think of is Yakuza, which is coming out on the PS2, and that's actually done by

424
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,080
Sega Sammy, so, that's September, I think, if I remember correctly, so, it should be

425
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
good.

426
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,640
Well, JeremyTodd1 sends us another one that I did think was notable.

427
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Um, hello, O.L.R. Jeremy Todd1 here. I'm not going to say again for fear that Rob will freak out again.

428
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:54,640
He's certainly getting a lot of face time on the program, but hey, we let anybody email us or join the chat room, so...

429
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,640
Well, to continue with the email.

430
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
That's right.

431
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Um, would it be possible to listen to O.L.R. live on my 360? No? Yep, I expected that.

432
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,640
But a company named TV- Tversity, I guess, um, has made their program for the 360. Here's a quote from them.

433
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,220
With Tversity, the menus on the Xbox 360 are extended to include

434
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,080
internet content, making it possible to access radio stations, podcasts, and photo

435
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,580
feeds.

436
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,720
So would this allow 360 owners to be able to listen to OLR Live using their

437
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,780
Xbox 360?

438
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,780
And I can't test this out right now because my 360 isn't connected to the

439
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,800
internet right now and it is too much of a hassle to move it.

440
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,040
He said he tried it last week and he didn't get it to work. He's in our chat room right now.

441
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,120
Okay. I'll check it out. Forward the email to my personal account so I can check it out.

442
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,640
To me it sounds like it's something that you would use like the Windows Media

443
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
center type of thing or something like that. I'd be curious though.

444
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,840
We could listen to live over the 360, I'm all over that.

445
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,560
You actually can, because I mean, Dan listens to MP3s off my computer all the time.

446
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,920
Well that's just streaming MP3s from a PC. Yeah, all I'd have to do is somehow trick the computer

447
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,440
into thinking you're playing a regular MP3 when it's a streaming MP3.

448
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,040
That's the trick. So, there must be something. Or just download the podcast on your

449
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,280
computer and link it.

450
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,880
Yeah, you could do that too. Well, no, no, he wants to listen to it because you know we have the music,

451
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,620
the music and the live shows that we don't podcast so I can't think of how

452
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,780
to get that to work yeah well who knows maybe this program will work at some

453
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:20,420
point well the last one is from rye mm-hmm I'm just emailing to say it's

454
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,820
like this is the oler I love you email the one that made me go squeak I'm just

455
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,460
emailing to say how great you guys and girl are I have listened to Orange

456
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,940
Lounge for almost a year but recently registered online anyways I listened to

457
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,140
your podcast and several others but what ended up happening is all the other

458
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,640
podcast just gave up on podcasting with no warning just stopped and left me

459
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,220
really annoyed because they all stopped in a short period so thank you OLR for

460
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,520
being a reliable source for video game news um you know it's tough to do

461
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:53,600
podcasts every week and I think a lot of people they hear other podcasts and they

462
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,480
want to do their own podcast and you know I'm all for that you know people

463
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,220
want to have a voice but sometimes I think people don't realize how difficult

464
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,480
it is you know it is it does take a lot of dedication and work that you don't

465
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,480
necessarily see in the hours that we're doing the show you know putting it all

466
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,120
together and that's why I have a you know I have a great respect for other

467
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,560
independent podcasters that you know stick with it and nothing against the

468
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,160
ones who don't end up sticking with it you know when you don't have time for it

469
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,200
you don't have time for it but you know it's it's trickier than I think a lot of

470
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,360
people sometimes give it credit for I'm glad that we make time for you guys

471
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,840
heart heart well our love I thought of another TV show I have been watching and

472
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,660
it's a reality show but it's a good one even you'd like it what it's called who

473
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,360
wants to be a superhero yes I know I've been hearing about that and I adore

474
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,480
Stanley except I hate major victory on that I hate him I hate him he can go die

475
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,880

477
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,480
now is monkey woman at least major victory had some style to it yeah but

478
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,960
he's an ass he kind of went oh I like monkey woman and yeah I like that woman

479
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,640
is a very Marvel name because like right now that mama has a song on her

480
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,360
Myspace it's awesome well it's funny because I love their names because I did

481
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,840
check out some of the names because actually two of my favorite characters

482
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,520
right now in the Marvel Universe are Big Bertha and Squirrel Girl oh god I love

483
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,240
Squirrel Girl she beat Dr. Doom and now I'm a real dork so let's just close the

484
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,120
mailbag gaming gaming let's get back to gaming and close the mailbag mailbag at

485
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we look forward to getting your emails.

486
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,760
Yeah, speaking of really cool stuff, one of the things that was coming out of E3 was definitely

487
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,660
Crysis and basically Crytek's brand new game using their CryEngine 2.0, for those who don't

488
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,680
know that's the next gen Far Cry type of game.

489
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,520
Well what's interesting though is they're actually looking for people, well they had

490
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:01,920
a job posting for people to work on a console version of, you know, something for the Far

491
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:08,520
Cry series. So, you know, one would speculate that, well, it's coming out on the PC, probably

492
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,520
coming out on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. So, pretty interesting. That game looks pretty

493
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:22,300
sweet. I mean, just the level of detail is amazing. So, should be cool. Speculate away

494
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:30,940
boys and girls. Well speaking of as far as things being planned SNK is not

495
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,820
actually planning on doing anything for the PlayStation 3 until 2009 according to

496
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,100
Kotaku. That's a long ways away. What the hell are they waiting for? The price to drop?

497
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,540
I don't know. You mean they can't port over another king of fighters or metal

498
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:55,380
But the quote by Yoshihito Koyama that he told Kotaku was that, and I'll go ahead and

499
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,940
read this to quote, my first impression is that it's expensive.

500
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,580
The PlayStation 2 is good enough.

501
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
It's small and cheap.

502
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,740
For us, the manufacturers, we don't have to invest in a new system, and the PlayStation

503
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,300
3 is a risk.

504
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,020
There won't be enough consoles at launch.

505
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,420
Few consoles mean few software sales.

506
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,980
We need to wait three or four years, maybe 2009, 2010 is a good time to release a game

507
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
for the PS3.

508
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,440
bring up a very good point though and this is the same reason why, what was it,

509
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,260
the Splinter Cell double agent was delayed because they thought there's not

510
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,000
enough 360 consoles out there and so they delayed the game. You're gonna see a

511
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,680
lot of this with the PlayStation 3 games being delayed till like fall of next

512
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,480
year because of this. Interesting, that's much bigger the news than I initially

513
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,840
give that credit for when we were prepping the show. That's pretty big

514
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,720
because that's SNK kind of taking a stand saying, you know, we're just not

515
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,740
feeling it from Sony. But again, you know, to play Devil's Advocate though, SNK doesn't

516
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,080
exactly put out a lot of games that, you know, I think of SNK and I think about, you know,

517
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,840
games that still look kind of 16-bit. Not that that's a bad thing, because, you know,

518
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,120
playability is what's important, so they could, you know, continue to exist on the PlayStation

519
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:09,200
2, and there's going to be your, you know, the guy who doesn't consider himself a gamer

520
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,220
or herself a gamer but still has a PlayStation 2 in their house you know

521
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,200
there's still an audience to make games for. I think that they should go through

522
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,520
and actually port some of the games that were really cool on the Neo Geo over

523
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,280
like make an update to them like what about you know the ever ignored Magical

524
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
Lord I mean that game I love that game that when it was on you know the Neo Geo

525
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,840
played the arcade and stuff or even like you know I want to say they did

526
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:36,700
baseball stars or something like that. It makes me weep that magical drop I can

527
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,940
only get on my cell phone they need to like make that I mean I I know that they

528
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,500
like the port games and maybe do like slight graphical updates to them and

529
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,140
stuff like that that's fine because that's what's in right now is you know

530
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:50,860
people updating some of the retro games and stuff and they really need to pay

531
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,900
attention to some of these older games that were on I mean there there was more

532
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,540
on the Neo Geo than Metal Slug and King of Fighters so come on there was some I

533
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,380
should do a new Fatal Fury game or something like that I mean just put

534
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,800
something out that's different I mean and I know they're not doing it for the

535
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,740
PlayStation 3 that's fine because they're types of games that they release

536
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,260
right now unless they're doing something brand-new don't really need the power of

537
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,220
the PlayStation 3. Did SNK do Adventure Island? No, that was Hudson. Why do I remember an

538
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,340
Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx? Because there was an Adventure Island on the

539
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,580
TurboGrafx. Didn't Hudson work really closely? And Adventure Island 2. Didn't Hudson work

540
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,540
really closely with NEC or something? Because Bomberman 93 and Bomberman 94

541
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,220
were also mainstay, um, turbo graphics games.

542
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,500
Nevermind, Konami, didn't Konami buy them now?

543
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,060
Yeah, Konami's doing the Hudson stuff.

544
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,900
Well then, Konami needs to put out an Adventure Island game, which is, I just completely...

545
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,300
You know what Konami needs to do?

546
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,800
Huh?

547
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,020
Another Super Konami world.

548
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,020
Yes.

549
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
Good luck.

550
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,140
They're still doing Bomberman, uh, Bomberman X-Zero, which is coming out in a couple weeks.

551
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,260
There's also the Bomberman game on the Wii.

552
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,660
Oh, there's some love for Magical Drop in the chat room, that gives me warm fuzzies.

553
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:05,580
Rama says I heart magical drop and DMN professes his love for me when I named magical drop. That's very sweet

554
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,500
I'm just saying that you know, they really do have a larger library of games than those two and

555
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,600
You know metal slug was an awesome game and I did spend a lot of quarters on it

556
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:23,060
But goddamn stop really porting this game to every single console. I mean and to be honest, you know

557
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,940
Metal slug one through four or whatever. They're up to now. They're all the same

558
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:35,320
I mean they all look exactly the same with slightly different artwork in there. They haven't changed anything, but hey whatever

559
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,860
It's a fun game, so

560
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,580
Just need some new stuff

561
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,740
You know I think number one

562
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,820
This is probably going to be a slippery start of a slippery slope. I mean if SNK is taking a stand like this

563
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,820
What's to say that some more companies may decide to take similar stands and?

564
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,420
and the PS3 may not be as powerful at launch as we thought.

565
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,900
It's funny you mention that, Drew, because the next story I have is about

566
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,800
Atari.

567
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,740
And it's very interesting. There was an interview on gamesindustry.biz

568
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,260
with Bruno Bonnell, who's the CEO at Atari,

569
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,340
and Atari has said they have no plans to release any games for the PS3 until at

570
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,740
least 2007.

571
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:20,980
But they're citing a lack of information being the reason why

572
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,180
they are not going to develop for the console but then the weird thing is he

573
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,420
comes out and says that quote picking up the high end of the market the hardcore

574
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:36,300
passionate fans and describing the ps3 so they're taking a little more of a

575
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,780
soft approach to this like well you know the ps3 is definitely gunning for that

576
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,740
audience but since we don't know shit about it we're not developing for it

577
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:53,100
next year so very interesting and as far as also interesting is concerned well

578
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,460
honestly it's not really too much of a surprise but John was stranglehold is

579
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,740
actually delayed until first quarter 2007 and it was the very well received

580
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,720
83 is supposed to be one of the top ones to be released it's in development by

581
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,440
midway but it's still a little bit you know to be honest and I actually looked

582
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,320
at the dates on this in my system at work it's only delayed two weeks it just

583
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,720
happened to fall from December to January so it is first quarter now

584
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,520
everybody's like oh it's 2007 it's like two weeks I mean seriously folks games

585
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,240
get delayed first you know what though but that is it is still big news because

586
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,360
that means you miss Christmas they miss rice anyways it was it was I think well

587
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,460
well maybe not they were like a week away from Christmas but still though I

588
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,880
mean it's not a big deal by that time though I mean you're not gonna picking

589
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,840
up for Christmas so I guess that's true most people out there I mean no you're

590
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:03,160
not gonna have kids doing that so I don't know what if I don't get John

591
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,700
John Woo Stranglehold, I'm gonna cry, I love you, I want a hard rider BB gun and John Woo

592
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Stranglehold.

593
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,940
Anyways, speaking of things though that you might be able to pick up before Christmas

594
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,580
though, we mentioned it before and I think I said the 360 bundle not happening in the

595
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,140
United States.

596
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
That's a fact.

597
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,220
Well, one thing that we do know is going to be happening is it might be happening in other

598
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,660
countries in Canada and in Mexico.

599
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:38,220
For example, in Canada, Futureshop is taking pre-orders for this system now with Project

600
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:43,500
Gotham Racing 3 and 3 months of Xbox Live Gold and 1250 Marketplace Points.

601
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,600
So that's pretty good evidence there, but if that's not good enough for you, Mexico,

602
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
the official Xbox site, has it on their page.

603
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,760
So I would say that pretty much confirms that it's coming out.

604
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
So take a look at that.

605
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,200
Damn you Canada and damn you Mexico.

606
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Mexico.

607
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,620
But anyways, yeah, so it's it is coming out. They're saying though. That's supposed to retail. I think about

608
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:12,180
$3.99 so it's not bad and being that the game's dropped in price down to $29.99. So I

609
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
Don't know. Hell. Yeah, I've been to Mexico

610
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,500
so

611
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
Should be interesting

612
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,280
If you caught that reference you're you're pretty smart anyway

613
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,120
Anyway, you know how we had that story.

614
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,320
I think Loki just kind of shouted it out at the end of the last episode, but remember

615
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:37,720
how we had the top 20 gay characters from games or something?

616
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
And who took the cake?

617
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Tingle.

618
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:46,520
Well, isn't it strange that now Nintendo is sending out a survey all about Tingle?

619
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,120
A new survey is up at Nintendo's website and it's trying to gauge what people really think

620
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
about Tingle.

621
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,720
Here are some of the questions from the survey.

622
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,720
After reading about this game, how did you feel about Tingle when he showed up in a Zelda

623
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,100
game?

624
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,040
After reading the article on Nintendo Power, did your opinion of Tingle change?

625
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,520
Which of these best describes your view of Tingle?

626
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,480
I'll read the answers to this one.

627
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,720
Funny, interesting, boring, annoying, none of the above, and flamey.

628
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,440
No, I'm just kidding, the last one's not there.

629
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,960
Rupeeland incorporates a unique gameplay system in which everything costs rupees.

630
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,280
The trick is that you never know how you need to pay.

631
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,880
What do you think of this system?

632
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,000
Fun, crappy, whatever.

633
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,960
And do you feel that Tingle is an interesting enough character to deserve his own game?

634
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,580
But I thought this question is very interesting as well.

635
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,680
If Tingle made an appearance in the upcoming title The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess

636
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,260
for GameCube and Wii, how would you feel?

637
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:51,020
I would be excited, I'd be annoyed, and I'd hit that.

638
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,380
Just kidding about the third one.

639
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
That's so sad.

640
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,380
So sad.

641
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,660
But speaking about a game I would hit, that would be Spore.

642
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,740
And Spore, you know, is going to be coming out on consoles now, according to Will Wright.

643
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:11,020
And you know, one of the things that they were saying is that they were actually developing

644
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:15,720
it for consoles, and that's been one ongoing problem with consoles is that they don't have

645
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
a mouse.

646
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,320
a very good random access device for putting on the screen. A console controller really

647
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:29,480
makes you want the game avatar based so you don't move on the character. That's why RTS

648
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,840
games suck on the consoles. With Spore, about half of the game is avatar based already.

649
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,940
The creature game and the space game, it would be pretty easy for us to make intermediate

650
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:44,380
levels avatar based. So from the beginning we thought about how we could move Spore onto

651
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,140
platforms including consoles so I mean duh it's coming to consoles I mean come

652
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,340
on might not be right away you know like the PC game but it's coming I mean

653
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:58,780
that's just stupid if they don't so wow that's a really gay picture sorry

654
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,260
somebody somebody in chat just put a picture of the upcoming tingle game and

655
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:09,860
it's uh what do you call it like tingles flamboyant romp in like rupee land or

656
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,860
or something, I mean.

657
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,500
Tim, Tingle visits the Castro.

658
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,140
The fabulous romp of Tingle in Ruby Land.

659
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,620
Tingle goes to the bath house.

660
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,420
I mean, seriously, that's pretty gay.

661
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,620
Let me put it this way with Spore.

662
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,460
All Spore would have to do is buy me a drink

663
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,720
and I'd make sweet love to it.

664
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,860
I mean, it's a beautiful game.

665
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,620
I want to play it so bad, so bad.

666
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,500
I was so mad that we couldn't play it at E3.

667
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,460
We just had the demo.

668
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,540
You keep seeing on all these news sites and stuff

669
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,260
that 3D model feature where you create a creature

670
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:45,260
And you basically, you know, hit print, and it'll, you know, you pay like ten bucks or whatever to get it shipped to you,

671
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,260
and they will ship you a model of your character, a little statue.

672
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,260
That's cool.

673
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,260
That is awesome.

674
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,260
Are you gonna do that?

675
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,260
Oh hell yes, I'm doing that.

676
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,260
That sounds like something you'd do.

677
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,260
You'd get like five of them and have them declare war on each other, and...

678
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
It's like a little kid playing with you.

679
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,260
We can have contests and give them away to people.

680
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Yeah.

681
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,260
Alright.

682
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:17,900
Well, um, you know, I shake my head at this, just because poor, poor Sony, poor Sony trying

683
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:29,420
to be like Microsoft again, they are apparently now, um, wanting to, uh, call their, uh, rewards

684
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,140
system on their online service

685
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,660
they want to call it entitlements. Much like

686
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,460
achievement points.

687
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,740
The only problem though is that

688
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,820
the two words are

689
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,620
they can't really use anything against it though

690
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,460
because by definition they are

691
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:03,220
irreconcilable. I mean, I like what's pointed out here on this article

692
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,220
on, uh, it's on Joystick actually, that, um,

693
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:11,320
achievement is the act of accomplishing or finishing while entitlement is the

694
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,260
state of being

695
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,620
furnished with a right to claim something. So

696
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:21,300
by definition they can get away with it, however, it's still

697
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,340
really close. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So if you're entitled to it,

698
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,700
why do you have to earn it yeah

699
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,580
it's a weird title but at the same time you know what I don't think

700
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,380
II it it's not a big surprise that PlayStation is going this route and

701
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:42,600
I II you know it kinda works for the Xbox so why not do a similar system you

702
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,940
know if it works

703
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,100
I'm not surprised you're gonna pick it up and do it I mean if you think about

704
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,180
it okay didn't

705
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:52,580
Xbox kind of incorporate rumbling into their controller because Sony did it in

706
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,380
a work there

707
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,940
good I mean yeah I mean if it works one place why not

708
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,860
why not do it yeah I think we need it but it is a dumb name

709
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,540
Entitlements is not the right name there unless they're doing something

710
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,940
unless they have their own unique spin on this I don't know

711
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:11,700
latency you have to understand Microsoft totally copied Sony in this case

712
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,460
I mean the evidence is there I mean

713
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,980
Microsoft had a time traveling device and they went into the future to see

714
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,860
that Sony was going to come up with entitlements

715
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,860
They went back in time and created achievements. Why isn't anyone doing

716
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,740
anything about this? That's what I want to know.

717
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,620
Why are they letting Microsoft get away with this kind of crap?

718
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,300
This is really, really wrong.

719
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,060
Sony, I feel sorry for you.

720
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,140
Anyways, you're crazy. I'm not crazy.

721
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,540
I'm just thinking... Blaze in our chat room says you're awesome.

722
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,580
But the only person in there that says you're awesome, just for the record.

723
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,960
Don't worry, I only have Ridge Racer on my mind.

724
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,200
Anyways, so speaking of the PlayStation 3 and the 360,

725
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,160
during one of the Game Informer interviews with

726
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,120
the creators of The Darkness, they were asking, you know,

727
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,760
what do you like about working on the PS3 and how is it different from the 360?

728
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,760
Will there be any major differences between the two versions of the game?

729
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,020
And their response was, so far the two versions look pretty much the same,

730
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,180
quite unsurprisingly since we both use the same shader source code and content for both

731
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:29,540
platforms they will be identically gameplay-wise. There will only be a few minor cosmetic differences

732
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,660
such as in the Playstation 3 we'll have better quality video for in-game TVs and the Xbox

733
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,820
360 will have a bit more room for textures and memory. In other words, both of the games

734
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:45,820
are going to be almost exactly the same. Very much like how Playstation 2 and Xbox games

735
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,340
are almost exactly the same with slight minor differences

736
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,140
so why do i have to pay two hundred extra dollars for a system that'll have

737
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,160
games that are almost exactly the same as the three sixty because they'll have

738
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,100
exclusive games you can't get on three sixty

739
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,760
oh i'm sorry

740
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,180
i am still

741
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:07,100
the tekken horror and i have to final fantasy thirteen middle gear solid four

742
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,960
who gives a rat's ass about final fantasy thirteen it's twenty million versions

743
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,340
me hello me uh... tekken

744
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,580
Tekken Tekken. I'll buy Tekken 2. Don't get me wrong. Tekken 2 came out already.

745
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,100
Tekken also. Nerd.

746
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,020
Alright. That is a joke that has not been patented in your toilet paper

747
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,700
drink book.

757
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,180
on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

758
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,320
It's Ron Mazzaltoleme and I am dead tired from coming back from Otacon.

759
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,280
What went on at Otacon? Hey!

760
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:17,360
Oh, man, I just came back from the biggest anime convention in the country, believe it.

761
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,680
What was the coolest thing that happened at Otacon?

762
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:25,640
One of the coolest things to me was a friend of mine got hit by a car going to the convention

763
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,640
center.

764
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,640
He went to the hospital.

765
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,040
That doesn't sound cool.

766
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,320
No, what's cool about it was they let him go and we were all at Hooters the night having

767
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,560
dinner.

768
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,560
Were you in cosplay?

769
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:37,560
Yes.

770
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,560
Please say yes.

771
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,560
I

772
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:48,860
Didn't stop stop stop stop because I proud of it have gone around Disneyland just as shorty from best to move to

773
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:52,440
Oh, yeah

774
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,460
Degree of nerdiness, okay. Yeah the dirt and damn proud of the

775
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:05,380
Thousandth one time I'm going to violate your childhoods right now with this week. I'm posting in the chat room right now

776
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,380
Okay please explain this, explain this for the podcast listeners who won't know what the hell you're talking about.

777
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,380
AHHHHHHH!

778
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,380
Oh no. What is this?

779
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,380
I haven't even seen this.

780
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,380
That is so cool!

781
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,380
Is that a Waldo?

782
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,380
Yes that's right!

783
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
And a Carmen Sandiego!

784
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,380
My mic is Waldo!

785
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,380
Now if they had a wedding who could find it?

786
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,380
That's kind of funny.

787
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,380
Wow.

788
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,380
That's a Carmen Sandiego!

789
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,380
No I like the Carmen Sandiego better than the Waldo.

790
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,380
No offense.

791
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,380
That's just good for us.

792
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,380
Seriously, how did you find those two?

793
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,380
Where in the world was she?

794
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Wherever Waldo was, apparently.

795
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,380
Ooh, are they fucking?

796
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,380
Are they fucking?

797
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,380
What is Waldat going to think?

798
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,380
Ooh.

799
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,380
Or Wilmette, what was her name?

800
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,380
I can't even remember.

801
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,380
This is scandal.

802
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,380
Waldo and Carmen Sandiego were off doing it.

803
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,380
But check this out.

804
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,380
We have what's called anime parliament

805
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,380
where people can bring their grievances about anime to a panel.

806
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:12,380
Waldo pulled Carmen Sandiego out and accused her of using all the government's resources to find her while he was still missing for 15 years.

807
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:20,380
That is quite possibly the lamest thing I've heard in my entire life.

808
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,380
No way, that's awesome. That's awesome like a hot dog.

809
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:30,380
I mean, it's lame in a funny way, but you know, I'm just like, my god, anime conventions really are the capital of nerd country, aren't they?

810
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,820
today I want to go to other con next year because enemy expo is a piece of

811
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:39,940
crap Oh chat room book my room now because right now half the hotels are

812
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:45,060
already sold out dear God Waldo's friend was Wanda by the way according to DMN in

813
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:50,140
chat okay we'll talk about that run John okay here's that what else I want to

814
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,420
know what what types of video game content were there at the con and was

815
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,740
OLR horde I didn't know it oh well I was there represent all I knows there was a

816
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:03,380
couple of Tekken and Smash Brothers tournaments. I tried to get pictures but

817
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:09,620
you know my grief from the last con. The funk almost killed me. They put the

818
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,920
the gaming room in the big place of the center and still as I'm

819
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,900
coming down the escalator 30 feet away I can smell it.

820
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,900
Run Sean. I have a suggestion for you for cosplay next year to avoid fanboy

821
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:29,960
funk yes larva wear the mask um blaze in our chat room is trying to get into the

822
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,920
zing here by saying you know because I was talking about anime conventions

823
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,840
being the capital nerd country blaze says a sky remember that you are hosting a

824
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,480
podcast about video games touche touche burn well well done wait wait you're

825
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,580
supposed to make a point I was slightly that was do you say touche that was

826
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,300
haven't made a point that was two degrees okay my culture wants me to go

827
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,660
to Dragon Con which actually would be reasonable since that's actually near my

828
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,000
family. Dragon Con's in Bobby's neck of the woods he'd let us stay at his house

829
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,460
I bet. We can play ChromeHounds all night long. Yuri Lover says we should go to

830
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:09,560
Yuri Con but actually I'm going to Yali Con. Of course. And oh my god our

831
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:15,080
costumes arrived me and Chris and Megzi are cosplaying organization 13

832
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,220
characters and our trenches arrived I'm going to be scarred for life should I see

833
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:27,420
pictures drew I can scar you even worse than that anime next 2007 we're doing

834
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:33,560
original organization 13 cosplay it's Jesus Christ and the 12 disciples as

835
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:38,480

other calls in but thank you for calling okay all right and by the way for those

838
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,940
folks that say hey it's the same people that always call in why don't you call

839
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,340
in because I hate reading that about the show where it's the same people always

840
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:04,700
call in then you're obviously listening so why don't you call in I don't get it

841
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,660
so let's go to the speaking of so that being said hello you're on orange lounge

842
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,700
radio who's this it's one and only Legend of Zaku hello Zaku what's on your

843
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:20,420
mind my friend um basically the fact you know obviously the VMA is not having you

844
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:26,740
know any music games for that you know lame but yet somewhat important video

845
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,340
game soundtrack domination I'm sorry is it yeah could could the record be

846
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,060
starting right now actually if we could put this on record my next statement

847
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,740
Excuse me, one moment.

848
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,740
Fuck MTV!

849
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:38,740
Thank you.

850
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,740
Yeah, same exactly.

851
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:47,160
And you have to understand that MTV pretty much, you know, they suck the dick of hip

852
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,520
hop and rap just because it rates in more money.

853
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,140
And you know, this leads you to believe that MTV's that desperate for cash that they'll

854
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,900
pour themselves out for it.

855
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,320
Um, okay.

856
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,640
All those music channels nowadays anyways are just all reality TV anyway.

857
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:08,360
think that's worse uh g4 were for g4ia you know guitar heroes being nominated for game of the year

858
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:14,680
and so that leads me to believe that they're gonna you know they're gonna bow down to guitar

859
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:21,400
i thought g4 wasn't doing an award show anymore um they're doing g4ia and according to i thought

860
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:27,240
g4i got cancelled uh strange because i just uh whatever i'll believe you i'll believe you

861
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:35,460
But anyways, you know, you see how on one side they praise rap so much, but on the other,

862
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,320
they just, you know, they pretty much bow down to something that's, you know.

863
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
Back it up, though.

864
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Back it up, though, Zaku.

865
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:47,200
Now, without getting into an MTV discussion, because this is a game show, I think what

866
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,560
it is about, you kind of said it there, you said they do it because it brings in the money.

867
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
That's what it's about.

868
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,560
It's about money.

869
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,560
Exactly.

870
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:08,020
The whole thing is now based on the almighty dollar and they lost touch of who they were

871
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,020
for years now.

872
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:14,260
It used to be all about music and now it's just whoring themselves out, but that's besides

873
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,260
the point.

874
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:22,180
MTV lost touch about what 1994 1985 interesting comment in general interesting comment in chat room

875
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,940
MT a blade says MTV owns X fire. I like X fire. I use it. Okay. Okay, that's 1.2

876
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,900
MTV their suck actually started in 96

877
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:39,800
In 94 we still had him a head bangers ball in 120 minutes. Yeah

878
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,800
Yeah, and we still had really good shows.

879
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,300
We still had AMP in those years too, so...

880
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:44,800
Oh yeah.

881
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,800
The downhill trend began when remote control went off TV.

882
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Yeah, when remote control lost it.

883
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,300
Oh yeah, that was it.

884
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,800
Alright, I gotta take it back on video games.

885
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,800
So, Zaku, anything else? No, that's alright.

886
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:01,800
Um, not really, just, you know, the whole thing about, maybe, you know,

887
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,300
if you, for like anime conventions, shouldn't they just give out deodorant sticks at the door?

888
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,800
They have before!

889
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:18,800
I mean, antiperspirant, not even deodorant. Antiperspirant does a good job at absorbing sweat and thus killing odor before it even begins.

890
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:24,800
A wise person, a coworker of mine, who I really respect, once told me,

891
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,800
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make a drink.

892
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,800
That's true.

893
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,800
They can put baking soda in the sprinkler system.

894
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,800
And that's a good thing I'm not that hardcore about gaming.

895
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,800
You know that at least I bathe.

896
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Alright, this is going to be the geek analogy here, okay?

897
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,800
To keep hygiene before, you know, before anything else.

898
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Alright, last thought, Magus.

899
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,800
This is going to be the geek analogy.

900
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,800
Just as you cannot move the blob, you cannot get rid of confunk.

901
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
It cannot be.

902
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,800
Actually right now you can't move the blob because he's lost his mutant powers.

903
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,800
I'll just cosplay as a big can of Febreeze for the next month.

904
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,360
I'll probably expect that if I go to an anime convention, just the smell of B.O. throughout

905
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,360
the whole building.

906
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,920
Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go because we gotta take more calls, but thank you very

907
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,080
much for your input as always.

908
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,600
Just for the record, G482006 is going on and their theme is Fake News Show, I'm glad that's

909
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
very original.

910
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,920
What do you mean their theme is Fake News Show?

911
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,760
It's Fake News Show, like their G482006 Unite, Vote, Award, Argue is their theme.

912
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
Alright, let's get at least one more call here.

913
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,760
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

914
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,760
Good afternoon, or good evening from Seattle. This is DMN.

915
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,760
DMN, my friend! What's on your mind?

916
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,760
I'm upset with you.

917
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,760
Why are you upset with me?

918
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
DarkSakura's pissed.

919
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,760
You're supposed to love me.

920
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,760
I do. You don't return my calls anymore.

921
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Well, I can't help changing my number and you not going to the trouble of stalking me.

922
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,760
Look, it's the new hairdo. Now the boys won't leave her alone.

923
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,760
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.

924
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,760
And what leads you to be calling our lovely program tonight, Mr. DMN?

925
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,760
Well, I call first off with terrible, terrible news.

926
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
What's that?

927
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,760
Nintendo decided to make me work Sundays now until about 5.30, so I don't get home until 6 or 7.

928
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,760
So, that means ATH is on hiatus.

929
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,760
Awww, I'm sorry to hear that.

930
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Yeah, but I'm going to give that Wii away, one Wii or another.

931
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:34,760
Alright, could we write a letter to Nintendo begging for clemency or something?

932
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Alright, fine.

933
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:42,760
I'm calling for several reasons, I have a laundry list, but I'll try to keep them as short as possible.

934
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,760
Alright.

935
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,760
First of all, the $299 leave, total garbage.

936
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,760
Why is this garbage?

937
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:56,760
Reggie Filane, our company president, has made it quite clear that that 50 wii will not be priced over $249.

938
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,760
That's it. Well said.

939
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,760
That's pretty much all I can say on that. That's pretty much all that needs to be said.

940
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,760
Ooh, you know something we don't know, huh?

941
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,760
Yeah.

942
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:11,760
You do! You do! Oh, God, I'm so jealous that you work for Nintendo sometimes.

943
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Yeah.

944
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:20,760
At the same time, I'd hate that, because, you know, on this radio program, I would probably get fired so fast by saying that crap.

945
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Alright, so anyway, change of subject.

946
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:27,440
no the things the things that I the things that I share with you guys I'm

947
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:33,160
very very selective about that's fine um but also you guys are talking about EA

948
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,400
EA could make a lot more money if they decided to stop spamming everybody with

949
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,760
Madden and actually not kill their franchises like oh I don't know SSX at

950
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:47,080
the same time though EA has spore coming out and they have said that they are

951
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,640
gonna develop more for the Wii and DS so maybe they are changing their tone a

952
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:57,640
I would think that $50 as a price point for software is pretty much going to be the norm.

953
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:08,640
I think what Loki said earlier, if it goes any higher than that, developers are going to have to take a second look at their price points.

954
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,640
Well, anything else you want to say to our listeners tonight, D.M.N.?

955
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Stakes on a plane is in less than two weeks. Go see it.

956
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,480
Yeah, we'll be there the day. I'm going to Disneyland

957
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,280
Because I promised somebody

958
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,040
weeks ago

959
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:32,640
Bacon and yeah, that's it. All right. Bye DMN. All right. Bye guys. All right. Thank you guys so much for your phone calls

960
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,160
We appreciate it. And if you didn't get in tonight, go ahead and try it again next week

961
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,220
We really appreciate you guys trying to call in and participate with our program. It's great

962
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:46,880
Alright any last-minute stories anybody wanted to get out there before we wrap up tonight's program. Um, no

963
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,880
I'm trying to think. All things considered, it's been somewhat of a slow news week.

964
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,160
Yeah. When the big news is all coming from Xbox Live Arcade, which I think we had like

965
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,520
five stories on tonight, you know, I think it's a kind of a slow week. No offense to

966
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,640
the arcade, I love the Xbox Live Arcade, but that's not

967
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:08,480
the, you know, brain, or I should say the center of gaming right now.

968
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,360
GameTap partnered with Konami.

969
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,360
Well yeah, I checked out Gametab, Castlevania, Frogger and Contra, Hard Corps.

970
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:20,360
Yeah, they have the Genesis-Castlevania game on there now, which is cool.

971
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,360
So that's kind of neat.

972
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,360
What else did they do?

973
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:30,360
Oh yeah, I was going to say there was that new device, I guess you would call it a device,

974
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,360
Exploder HD.

975
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:38,360
They're putting down the PlayStation 2 to upscale all their games to 720p or 1080i,

976
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:40,360
which I thought was kind of neat.

977
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:45,060
I don't know how great they're going to look, but that is something that's coming.

978
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:49,080
So I guess watch for reviews on that.

979
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,200
What's the other thing too?

980
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:57,440
Oh, I think we mentioned last week that Test Drive Unlimited, that the price was dropping

981
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,960
down to $35.99 of, well apparently that only applies to the US.

982
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,600
So if you're in the UK, you're still paying full price for it.

983
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
So that sucks.

984
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,560
Funny Dale in the chat room wants me to point out, and I remember Ecstifer of all people

985
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,680
show me this earlier this week, World of Warcraft now has a Myspace page so you can add music

986
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:19,680
from the game to your Myspace and I guess other like little animations and things like

987
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,680
that so you can pimp your Myspace with World of Warcraft bling, if you're so inclined.

988
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,800
And Rockstar cancelled the Xbox version of Bully, which is funny because I still haven't

989
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,340
even seen the PlayStation 2 version of Bully yet and waiting for that one to come out,

990
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:39,620
someday. I hope they do a 360 version but they said they weren't, so...

991
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,740
Oh well. I won't wait.

992
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:48,620
Alright. Well, then I believe that is going to bring our show to a close. Thank you

993
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,660
guys so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

994
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,980
It's that time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

995
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,060
Drew, thank you so much for being here tonight. Appreciate it.

996
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:03,140
Unfortunately, I can't call you Dr. Drew because that name's taken, so you'll just have to be...

997
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:07,040
unfortunately taken reverend drew or something or professor drew well like

998
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:07,960

1000
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:14,800
professor look to you are a final thought pie

1001
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,740
low gear final thought my final thought is

1002
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,340
I gotta ask a certain somebody for certain something that I want

1003
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:26,820
my final thought is a you're not gonna get it

1004
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:30,540
be die monster you don't belong in this world

1005
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,540
And Dark Soccer, your final thought?

1006
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,540
A. Reject false icons.

1007
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:39,540
B. It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.
