WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:27.800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 195 for this August 13th of 2006, and

00:27.800 --> 00:31.440
If this is your very first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, I'm sorry, because

00:31.440 --> 00:35.900
it's a slow news week and we're getting a little crazy tonight, but that's part of what

00:35.900 --> 00:37.320
makes us us.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.240
Anybody can open up a game blog and read the latest news, what's going on, but we're here

00:41.240 --> 00:46.720
to talk about games and gaming culture and our thoughts and just celebrate all types

00:46.720 --> 00:50.280
of gamers and just people who want to have fun, and that's what we're doing here on Orange

00:50.280 --> 00:52.840
Lounge Radio tonight is having a whole lot of fun.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.520
We'd love for you guys to join us sometime live Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.200
Let's get back into the gaming news, though, so we have something to rant about.

01:00.200 --> 01:05.520
Alright, speaking of stuff to rant about, I hate to do this every week.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.800
You know, we play this game at work, it's what stupid thing is Sony gonna do this week?

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
And you know what?

01:10.800 --> 01:12.040
They never disappoint.

01:12.040 --> 01:19.360
But okay, so there was news reports, this isn't exactly PlayStation 3 related, but there's

01:19.360 --> 01:23.760
reports that the first Blu-ray drives that are gonna be available in the Sony Vios, yeah,

01:23.760 --> 01:25.480
they won't play Blu-ray movies.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.200
That's like a DVD player that does not play DVD movies.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.120
So what the hell is it going to do?

01:32.120 --> 01:39.120
Oh, but you can burn your own content and stuff.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.720
So it's like a Blu-ray data drive or something?

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
Yeah, pretty much.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
Weird.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.900
And because they said that the whole reason why that it can't is because there was actually

01:48.900 --> 01:55.560
some lagging software development and copy protection issues.

01:55.560 --> 02:03.900
So that's not good because, you know what, I mean, these Playstation 3s, they use PC

02:03.900 --> 02:10.300
drives more or less and yeah, I hope they get this crap together when the PS3 comes

02:10.300 --> 02:15.020
out or else, who knows, we may see some firmware updates.

02:15.020 --> 02:20.100
Now playing, you know, Blu-ray movies, because I don't know why else you would need a Blu-ray

02:20.100 --> 02:21.100
player.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.100
Wow.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.660
Well, we'll see what happens with that.

02:24.660 --> 02:32.020
Well, there is actually some interesting news in regards to the Halo movie.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.740
There is information on Ain't It Cool News.

02:34.740 --> 02:40.900
The director was basically saying that, first of all, he prefers Halo 1.

02:40.900 --> 02:42.700
I thought that was pretty funny.

02:42.700 --> 02:48.180
But that is talking about some of the material that's going to be in the movie, talking about

02:48.180 --> 02:54.880
how Master Chief is going to be a mix of the man in the suit and CG.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.140
To quote, the film has to have a feeling of reality so that it means I want to keep him

02:59.140 --> 03:01.500
as real as much as I can.

03:01.500 --> 03:06.020
They're talking about how it's hard to have someone who moves like an animation as opposed

03:06.020 --> 03:07.700
to someone who moves like a human.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.620
They're also working on having the covenant be along the same lines, making them as real

03:13.620 --> 03:16.760
as they can possibly make the movements.

03:16.760 --> 03:21.060
Another quote from him, from an organic standpoint, they have to be believable.

03:21.060 --> 03:23.820
They also need to be terrifying and alien.

03:23.820 --> 03:27.180
And the best way to start doing that is to break the human silhouette, although many

03:27.180 --> 03:31.740
of them are bipedal automatically, you can shift the overall body to something very alien.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.220
So I thought that was pretty cool.

03:33.220 --> 03:34.220
So what do you think?

03:34.220 --> 03:37.220
Do you think the Halo movie, hearing the director's perspective and all this, do you think the

03:37.220 --> 03:39.460
the Halo movie is going to be winner or loser?

03:39.460 --> 03:46.480
Winner because he's actually a huge Halo fan and a huge gamer.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.940
He's basically saying that he's doing his very best.

03:48.940 --> 03:51.420
He has been picking the things that

03:51.420 --> 03:54.620
are the most holy of holy things in Halo

03:54.620 --> 03:57.820
and keeping them as faithful as possible.

03:57.820 --> 04:02.020
Oh, Chris, one of our in-house lesbians tonight

04:02.020 --> 04:03.180
seems to disagree.

04:03.180 --> 04:04.060
What's going on?

04:04.060 --> 04:06.900
Well, I don't really have an idea about the Halo movie.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.300
it's just that I've heard other people who have done the same thing it's like

04:09.300 --> 04:13.260
oh I was this huge fan of this and I'm gonna make sure everything's fine and it

04:13.260 --> 04:16.900
just doesn't work yeah I think the guy who directed Street Fighter was a huge

04:16.900 --> 04:24.260
fan of Street Fighter if he was I feel very bad yeah or at least a huge fan of

04:24.260 --> 04:29.100
Jean-Claude Van Damme or Kylie Minogue yeah I don't know who eater seems a

04:29.100 --> 04:32.180
little upset in our chat room over orange laundry calm click on chat that

04:32.180 --> 04:35.440
I know we bowl for this movie

04:35.440 --> 04:38.820
any broken diet burning hell well I don't

04:38.820 --> 04:43.880
don't hold back please and zappy says all hail label Mac Matt maker of crappy

04:43.880 --> 04:44.720
game movies

04:44.720 --> 04:50.320
I see now I he may make crappy game movies but you know what

04:50.320 --> 04:53.720
I really think he's gonna nail postal you can't get that game

04:53.720 --> 04:57.640
postal is a crappy game doesn't matter that's all that is going to do justice

04:57.640 --> 05:01.360
he needs to realize that his movies are never going to be you know taken

05:01.360 --> 05:05.860
seriously, just make it campy. Maybe he should do the Dead Rising movie, if there's ever

05:05.860 --> 05:13.860
one. No. No, he shouldn't. No, Romero should. We'll see. Here we go, Dawn of the Dead Part

05:13.860 --> 05:18.680
2. Alright. Well, one place we could have heard more about the Halo movie would possibly

05:18.680 --> 05:22.960
be E3 next year, due to its game relation, but of course, as we all know, E3 is going

05:22.960 --> 05:26.720
to be changing a little bit. Where does that leave the folks in Kensha Hall? We speculated

05:26.720 --> 05:34.280
about this a little bit during Part A. Well, the Consumer Electronics Association or CEA

05:34.280 --> 05:39.360
might be checking into the fact that maybe they want to do a massive trade show specifically

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
about games.

05:40.360 --> 05:45.560
Now, they already do the Consumer Electronics Show and this was the nation's largest gaming

05:45.560 --> 05:49.960
show until about 1994 when E3 started.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.080
Only 11% of the attendees at Consumer Electronics Show 2006 had interest in games and gaming

05:55.080 --> 05:56.080
products.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.040
Since ESA decided to eliminate the E3 event in its known format, we have been deluged

06:01.040 --> 06:05.560
with inquiries on whether we could fill the trade show needs of smaller video entertainment

06:05.560 --> 06:10.600
companies, this coming from Gary Shapiro, President and CEO of the CEA.

06:10.600 --> 06:16.300
Our executive board met yesterday and unanimously asked staff to explore ways that we could

06:16.300 --> 06:18.580
help the gaming community.

06:18.580 --> 06:22.400
The Consumer Electronics Association believes that trade shows are the most viable means

06:22.400 --> 06:26.460
for reaching a market as they serve smaller companies and entrepreneurs who need access

06:26.460 --> 06:28.380
to media buyers and investors.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.060
Our board, association and events are committed to growing the industry.

06:32.060 --> 06:36.840
In fact, nearly 80% of our members are companies with annual sales under $10 million.

06:36.840 --> 06:42.100
So maybe here's where the smaller game companies can seek refuge is CES, whether it be in the

06:42.100 --> 06:46.460
form of next year's big show or a smaller separate show has been heard about.

06:46.460 --> 06:51.860
To be honest, in the past it was that way anyway, so why not?

06:51.860 --> 06:53.900
Why did they leave in the first place then?

06:53.900 --> 06:54.900
E3.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.500
I guess that makes sense, but you know, it's still a little sad.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.700
And CES is a lot better too because they have two shows, but still it comes down to the

07:01.700 --> 07:08.100
whole thing where they have to make these demos for these shows and it interrupts the

07:08.100 --> 07:13.100
development cycle and that kind of thing, so it might be the same whole problem all

07:13.100 --> 07:14.100
over again.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.740
Some of our chat room folks seem to think this is a good idea though.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.400
Nintendo Maniac 64 says Woot for CES.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.720
Ravens Dolphin says, yes, CES is Geek Central.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.280
Fireboma thinks a different expo should step up, though.

07:25.280 --> 07:31.240
They'll go to the open arms of Penny Arcade Expo, which a lot of folks have been saying.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.600
Are the lesbians digging Penny Arcade Expo?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.000
Maisie says, hell yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
What's up with that?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.680
I'm just a huge Penny Arcade fan.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.200
I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.200
It's good stuff.

07:40.200 --> 07:41.200
It's good stuff.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.200
Those guys know their stuff.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
Don't get me wrong.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.200
I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan as well.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.200
I met a dude in the line at E3 two years ago buying hamburgers.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.040
We randomly met them at E3 a couple of years ago.

07:51.040 --> 07:56.320
I was in line with, we were in line buying lunch and just talking about stuff.

07:56.320 --> 07:58.840
I think they write very good editorial pieces on the gaming industry.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.440
I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday, it's just a lack of fundage.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.440
But have you been, Megsy?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.960
No I haven't, I would kill to go.

08:05.960 --> 08:11.460
I heard they're giving away a new car this year, the big gaming cluster tournament they

08:11.460 --> 08:15.240
have there of all these old school games, that's pretty awesome.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.720
Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

08:17.720 --> 08:18.720
Pardon?

08:18.720 --> 08:20.680
Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
I'd love to.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.240
Maybe we could have an Orange Lawns Radio booth and staff it with lesbians.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.240
That'd be awesome.

08:25.240 --> 08:30.420
The new breed of booth babe!

08:30.420 --> 08:35.080
These booth babes don't want anything to do with you.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
Unless you're hot.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.080
And how's that different than any other year?

08:38.080 --> 08:39.080
That's very true.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.960
Very, very true.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.520
So yeah, that's kind of funny.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.560
Well anyways, another cool thing that's going to be happening pretty soon, and you've probably

08:46.560 --> 08:51.240
seen it with a lot of the games out there right now, like Xbox 360 games are pretty

08:51.240 --> 08:54.480
much the same with any other next-gen games, they're pretty expensive right now.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.880
$59.99 retail seems to be the going price for most games out there, however that's not

08:58.880 --> 09:01.520
going to be the case going forward because there are going to be a lot of games coming

09:01.520 --> 09:04.240
out at $39.99 and $49.99.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.880
And some of those games we're going to mention for you, including such wonderful classics

09:08.880 --> 09:14.900
as Bomberman Act Zero, which is going to be coming out on the 28th of August, Lego Star

09:14.900 --> 09:20.980
Wars the original trilogy, it's coming out early September, Samurai Warriors 2, Just

09:20.980 --> 09:27.540
Cause which is going to be pretty awesome, Blitz the League, Fusion Frenzy 2, Viva Pinata,

09:27.540 --> 09:32.020
Kars and Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

09:32.020 --> 09:37.820
And those are all going to be coming out $49.99, if that's still too much for ya, $39.99, we're

09:37.820 --> 09:43.940
We're going to be having Test Drive Unlimited coming out, Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume

09:43.940 --> 09:49.840
1, if you happen to not be on live, which is weird, but whatever.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.140
That's going to be coming out early September as well as Cabalas Alaskan Adventure.

09:53.140 --> 09:56.540
I'm just going to give you a hint, the game's probably going to be crap.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.400
That's probably why it's cheap.

09:58.400 --> 10:03.060
World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions is going to be coming out, Pimp My Ride in

10:03.060 --> 10:06.820
November, Cabalas African Safari.

10:06.820 --> 10:09.260
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

10:09.260 --> 10:15.660
Also to remind you, as we mentioned last week, the first party games from Microsoft, the

10:15.660 --> 10:22.460
Launch 1s, Cameo, Project Gotham Racing 3, and Perfect Dark Zero, all $29.99 right now,

10:22.460 --> 10:26.820
and as we mentioned in Part A, Ridge Racer 6, a whopping $19.99.

10:26.820 --> 10:27.820
Wow.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.460
I should invent a game.

10:29.460 --> 10:31.460
Now wait, hold on, what's this?

10:31.460 --> 10:32.460
Unpimp My Ride.

10:32.460 --> 10:37.580
And have a sponsor by Volkswagen where you get more points for you know

10:37.660 --> 10:40.660
like you get like 50,000 points for spinners and and

10:41.540 --> 10:47.060
If they have like if they have a vinyl applied to their paint, you know

10:47.060 --> 10:52.220
When you destroy that car you get extra extra points and if it's actually painted on then you get a lot of points

10:52.580 --> 10:54.580
So yeah, all right

10:54.620 --> 10:56.040
I want to say real quick though

10:56.040 --> 10:59.780
I heard magazine give a little cheer over viva pinata and I haven't heard a lot of people like

10:59.780 --> 11:03.460
like, really excited about this game. So what has you excited about Viva Pinata?

11:03.460 --> 11:09.620
Well, I just like those really obscure, quirky games, like Katamari, stuff like that, Cube

11:09.620 --> 11:12.460
of War for the GameCube. You're on the right show.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.980
You are. And when I actually heard about it from my

11:15.980 --> 11:21.020
manager at work, but when I heard about it, I just thought, okay, just another quirky,

11:21.020 --> 11:25.460
obscure game that I'm probably just going to adore. So, yeah.

11:25.460 --> 11:28.460
Even though, but Microsoft kind of sounds like they want to make it mainstream with

11:28.460 --> 11:31.100
the cartoon and everything like it sounds like they just they want an

11:31.100 --> 11:34.300
Animal Crossing competitor yeah good thing bad thing well I love Animal

11:34.300 --> 11:41.260
Crossing so I guess good thing all right sounds good fire resurrected in chat

11:41.260 --> 11:45.820
says I got my viva pinata pre-ordered and another game of course Rapala trophies

11:45.820 --> 11:50.180
coming out on the 360 also gonna be 35.99 but really how many fishing fans

11:50.180 --> 11:54.140
are out there on the 360 anyway hey you never know might be if it's easy

11:54.140 --> 12:00.940
achievement points you'll buy it no I won't I will get it for free well

12:00.940 --> 12:07.420
speaking of online related things and magazine should be interested in this

12:07.420 --> 12:15.220
dead rising already has download content it's actually going to be released in

12:15.220 --> 12:21.260
about a month in Europe they've already put out though some quick downloadable

12:21.260 --> 12:26.260
content. They're basically keys that are unlocking costumes that are hidden in the games. They're

12:26.260 --> 12:33.380
called Miami Nights, Casual, Weekender, Round Shades, Burgundy, Grandpa, Pink Paparazzi,

12:33.380 --> 12:36.780
and Man in Black. So what do you get, Johnny Cash? That's cool.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.220
No, he's just got a black jacket, black pants.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.140
Wait, so you've seen these costumes, Logie.

12:42.140 --> 12:47.820
Yeah, they're downloadable right now in live. They came out the same day as Dead Rising.

12:47.820 --> 12:50.260
basically in the very beginning of the game when you first get into the

12:50.260 --> 12:51.100
security room

12:51.100 --> 12:54.220
there's a bunch of lockers in there and you can walk up and change clothes.

12:54.220 --> 12:59.820
Like Resident Evil 2. They did that in Resident Evil 2. You get the keys and you get Jill's cowgirl outfit.

12:59.820 --> 13:03.700
When I was playing Dead Rising the other day, some of the folks that were watching me

13:03.700 --> 13:06.180
play were making Resident Evil comparisons

13:06.180 --> 13:09.140
to Dead Rising, which I guess is an easy thing to do. You know, both being zombie

13:09.140 --> 13:10.180
Capcom games.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.660
Zombies. So, then again, Ghost of the Ghost was the zombie Capcom game too. I'm gonna laugh my ass off there

13:14.660 --> 13:15.460
if I find the line

13:15.460 --> 13:20.260
itchy-tasty in this game apparently one of the malls is named jill's sandwich

13:20.260 --> 13:21.300
yeah

13:21.300 --> 13:24.740
which you know that's a great reference to uh... the old-school

13:24.740 --> 13:28.060
resident evil step where i

13:28.060 --> 13:30.280
critical is there a smoothie shop

13:30.280 --> 13:31.680
in the mall uh...

13:31.680 --> 13:32.980
there is i think

13:32.980 --> 13:36.540
uh... all right

13:36.540 --> 13:39.060
all i see what you're doing i got a little less

13:39.060 --> 13:42.460
go listen to part a if you haven't yet and you'll get that maybe

13:42.460 --> 13:43.700
remember

13:43.700 --> 13:45.500
smoothie

13:45.500 --> 13:47.320
pass it on

13:47.320 --> 13:51.180
well if you're excited about dead rising as i was uh... you'll be happy to know

13:51.180 --> 13:54.020
that dead rising 2 is already in the works in fact

13:54.020 --> 13:57.260
uh... one of the things you'll notice is when you get your copy of dead rising

13:57.260 --> 14:00.560
there's actually a link to a capcom survey where they're asking you

14:00.560 --> 14:04.240
questions about dead rising and what you might want in dead rising 2

14:04.240 --> 14:06.900
so that's always good and we knew that this is going to be a popular game

14:06.900 --> 14:08.480
anyways so uh...

14:08.480 --> 14:10.500
wonder what dead rising 2 is going to be

14:10.500 --> 14:14.820
seriously though my friends list on xbox live has been nothing but dead but dead

14:14.820 --> 14:17.220
rising like just tons of that street fighter

14:17.220 --> 14:20.100
just tons of people playing dead rising i won't be surprised

14:20.100 --> 14:25.620
uh... all if it uh... it ends up maybe pop possibly taking the crown from halo

14:25.620 --> 14:27.860
to its most played live game

14:27.860 --> 14:31.540
if not that okay missile ambitious lease being the number two game where oblivion

14:31.540 --> 14:32.620
was a little while ago

14:32.620 --> 14:35.060
that i'm looking at my list right now right this minute

14:35.060 --> 14:37.180
somebody is playing dead rising

14:37.180 --> 14:39.620
and this person on my friends list already got the infinite mode it looks

14:39.620 --> 14:44.020
like. So that's pretty cool. Lucky. You know what's great though? If you happen to read

14:44.020 --> 14:47.800
something awful.com, they have a little page on there talking about Dead Rising and how

14:47.800 --> 14:52.980
to spend the 72 hours in the game. It's hilarious because they basically never left the security

14:52.980 --> 14:58.980
room for the 72 hours. It's funny. They kept taking pictures of the one chick's boobs in

14:58.980 --> 15:07.480
there. Wow. Alright. Well, now another Dead Rising story and maybe this made you a little

15:07.480 --> 15:11.760
upset, especially if you donít have an HDTV, but itís that text in the game is so freaking

15:11.760 --> 15:12.760
small.

15:12.760 --> 15:17.560
Well, some folks decided to start a thread on a Capcom bulletin board, bitching about

15:17.560 --> 15:22.120
the small text in the game, and Wicked Kitty, one of the administrators of the forum, meaning

15:22.120 --> 15:27.280
obviously thereís got to be some ties to Capcom itself, responded, ìDear everyone,

15:27.280 --> 15:31.040
I have heard your concerns and passed them to every source within Capcom possible.

15:31.040 --> 15:36.300
I feel your pain as I myself have a large SDTV,î standard I suppose, ìand am having

15:36.300 --> 15:39.060
trouble reading the mission objectives, item names, etc.

15:39.060 --> 15:42.140
I'd like you all to know we have heard your concerns and take them seriously.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.860
I've been seeing campaigns on other forums to send hundreds of emails to our support

15:45.860 --> 15:46.860
email.

15:46.860 --> 15:50.500
Unfortunately, this doesn't expedite or increase the importance of the concern in any way,

15:50.500 --> 15:54.620
but it does take time and resources from other fans equally deserving concerns.

15:54.620 --> 15:58.860
All concerns are always important to us and we do what we can.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.740
We would like you to know we appreciate your feedback, blah, blah, blah."

16:01.740 --> 16:04.160
So basically they're saying, please stop emailing us.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.800
know there's a boo-boo in the game and what yeah my bad shut up what do you

16:09.800 --> 16:11.840
think they're gonna do you think they'll patch it or you think they're gonna go

16:11.840 --> 16:15.040
patch it you really think I don't that seems like an awfully big thing to patch

16:15.040 --> 16:23.000
just yeah font size now make see I have yet to play dead rising but it seems

16:23.000 --> 16:29.680
like like like you said a big thing to patch and kind of a minor problem I mean

16:29.680 --> 16:33.360
like I said I haven't played it but all right well that's my two cents it

16:33.360 --> 16:36.360
It depends how big your TV is. If you're playing on a little bitty TV, you're going to have a problem there.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.360
But then again, Xbox 360 wasn't really made for a little bitty TV. But I understand.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.360
Even on big TVs, it's still hard to read.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
Yeah, it's hard to read even on my TV. It's pretty bad.

16:44.360 --> 16:48.360
GS191 has an interesting thought here in our chatroom related to Dead Rising.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.360
I would love to see a Dead Rising MMO.

16:50.360 --> 16:56.360
I think a lot of folks would have just liked to see Dead Rising be multiplayer.

16:56.360 --> 17:01.360
But, you know, my thought is, if they'd done Dead Rising multiplayer, what's going to be the big catch for Dead Rising 2?

17:01.360 --> 17:13.540
I think the perfect MMO would be you have your everyday life and then you release your

17:13.540 --> 17:18.700
serum and if your character gets infected you lose your character you have to make a

17:18.700 --> 17:23.540
new one however your character never dies your character is undead then and can pass

17:23.540 --> 17:26.900
on or you can actually control the zombie and pass on your virus to other people they've

17:26.900 --> 17:28.280
I've already done this.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.600
Oh, was that infected?

17:29.600 --> 17:33.080
No, there was actually a Resident Evil game

17:33.080 --> 17:34.120
that was online.

17:34.120 --> 17:34.960
That's right.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.960
And then they did this.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.360
Oh, OK.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.440
I still think it's cool, because I want to infect people.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.740
All right, have you ever played that game, Infected, on PSP?

17:42.740 --> 17:43.240
No.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.800
All right, let's get into the mailbag

17:48.800 --> 17:50.520
and find some other great thoughts.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.040
We're going to put the hazmat suit.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.080
Over email.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.760
Yes, Jamie's going to suit up in the hazmat at best

17:55.760 --> 18:01.580
suit right now and get her hands wet and get there in the mail bag at mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com

18:01.580 --> 18:04.400
and pull out your e-mails right now.

18:04.400 --> 18:12.560
If they get wet that means my suit is broken.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.720
First e-mail comes from Nailhead, awesome name.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.320
I'll start by saying that I love the show, been listening to the podcast for a year.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.800
It makes traveling to work and back much faster.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
Thank you.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.800
Yes, thank you.

18:24.800 --> 18:28.560
The names that I buy are from recommendations from Orange Lounge Radio, so thank you for

18:28.560 --> 18:29.560
that.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.360
That's a scary thought, that we're influencing the general public like that, but no thank

18:32.360 --> 18:33.360
you, seriously.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.120
I have a story that you may want to know about.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.560
I'm part of a small film company in Huntsville, Alabama.

18:37.560 --> 18:38.560
Shout out to Jamie.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.560
I know she's from Alabama too.

18:39.560 --> 18:40.560
Hell yeah!

18:40.560 --> 18:43.760
And we are in production of a World of Warcraft documentary.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.820
I'll link you to this article because I love the way it's written much better than me trying

18:46.820 --> 18:47.820
to describe it.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.400
I'm going to read the URL.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.400
It's fairly long.

18:50.400 --> 19:01.360
at wowinsider.com slash 2006 slash 08 slash 08 slash bowling dash 4 dash gnomeregan g-n-o-m-e

19:01.360 --> 19:07.560
gnomeregan actually but that's alright sorry i don't whatever dash wow dash documentary

19:07.560 --> 19:11.960
dash in dash d dash works so it sounds like go to this wow insider look for an august

19:11.960 --> 19:17.880
eighth post yeah sounds like okay yeah okay the link to the film's webpage is a world

19:17.880 --> 19:24.380
of warcraftthemovie.com and the film company is deadworkers.com.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.860
Not as cool as zombie flesh eaters, but still pretty damn cool.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.860
I'd be curious to see what this documentary would turn out like.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.980
It'd be great if you mentioned it on the show.

19:33.980 --> 19:36.660
It would surely help get us more interviews.

19:36.660 --> 19:41.820
Also we would love to interview you all as well, that is if we can make it out west.

19:41.820 --> 19:45.740
In closing, I'll list three things about your show I love, FUs of the Week, PC vs Mac

19:45.740 --> 19:51.340
is hilarious i tend to side with loki on this one wow you are bruce campbell fans um here's

19:51.340 --> 19:56.460
here's something funny and speaking of penny arcade earlier they did a strip about dead rising

19:56.460 --> 20:04.060
and they had mac fans looking drooling over the uh that was great yeah that was great well the

20:04.060 --> 20:12.540
closing on this is thanks i love you all oh kisses smoochy smoochy got one from digi nova

20:12.540 --> 20:16.380
It says, hey crew, a big hello from DigiNova on the other side of the pond.

20:16.380 --> 20:21.340
It's been a while since I last called in but I wanted to raise the subject of the OLR

20:21.340 --> 20:22.340
Skype line.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.060
I totally find this part of the show one of the most interesting parts.

20:25.060 --> 20:29.620
Granted there are the regular callers but to myself they are part of the OLR formula

20:29.620 --> 20:33.980
that makes it so addictive that makes me so envious that I can't participate more often.

20:33.980 --> 20:37.140
The recent edition of the voicemail section gives the listeners who can't make those

20:37.140 --> 20:40.380
late night sessions a regular thing, a chance to put their views across.

20:40.380 --> 20:44.560
In short, OLR combines the great factors of anime, gaming, and humor that make me crack

20:44.560 --> 20:48.080
up on the train to work every Monday and Thursday.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.280
Please note I get odd looks from some fellow passengers when I get a dirty smirk about

20:51.280 --> 20:54.600
fanboy funk from Ron Masao Tomy.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.960
I can't wait to see the reaction to this week's show.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.740
At this point, I want to make my dedication to the OLR crew and have purchased the above

21:01.740 --> 21:08.240
domain which isn't a total ripoff, but hope this makes me an official trooper from Sky.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
Have a great show tonight.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.600
I'll be sure to listen to and pass the word of OLR to the masses

21:12.600 --> 21:16.880
and it's

21:16.880 --> 21:21.720
orangelounge.co.uk. So somebody bought orangelounge.co.uk for us

21:21.720 --> 21:25.320
in a way. Dude, seriously, maybe we should have a UK mirror.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.720
I'm down with that. Email us back if you want to help run a UK mirror for us.

21:28.720 --> 21:32.600
Two things. A, I'm very glad someone's saying something positive about the

21:32.600 --> 21:33.920
call-in segment because

21:33.920 --> 21:38.360
I think I want to say either the reviews in iTunes or somewhere was bashing on

21:38.360 --> 21:42.800
the collars and I, you know, they're just mad they don't listen Sunday nights and

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
can call in themselves.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.360
I don't know what their deal is, so I'm really glad something's said because we

21:46.360 --> 21:51.080
really want this to be everybody's show, not just, you know, Dark Sakura, Loki and

21:51.080 --> 21:53.560
Sky hog the airwaves for, you know, three hours.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.200
We like getting you guys involved, you know.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.880
Although my ego does like hogging the airwaves for three hours.

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
We are the stars.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.880
No, I'm kidding.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.880
Anyway.

22:00.880 --> 22:01.880
I'm the diva of the show.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.560
No, Rob's the diva of the show.

22:03.560 --> 22:09.360
One thing, I'm loving the increase it seems like we've been having in UK presence lately

22:09.360 --> 22:14.360
because I've noticed on MySpace, we've been getting a lot of ads from UK folks lately.

22:14.360 --> 22:18.760
So whoever's spreading our name out there in the UK, thanks and we're really glad that

22:18.760 --> 22:26.480
you guys are noticing that we want to be representative of gamers everywhere, not just silly America

22:26.480 --> 22:35.000
but you know UK Australia Canada anywhere so worldwide gaming news here

22:35.000 --> 22:39.480
at Orange Launch Radio so thank you I especially love our UK listeners though

22:39.480 --> 22:44.280
because I'm going to move into your country one day when I want to visit

22:44.280 --> 22:59.000
it when I'm in your country buying your stuff Oh Bobby hahaha Bob Bobby black

22:59.000 --> 23:05.360

3.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Mm-hmm.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.560
Dear Alala, all in caps, bye-bye.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.040
Which is how many kills he'll get in the Chromestowns tournament, by the way.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.040
Ooh.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
Less than 3.

23:19.040 --> 23:20.040
Like your mom.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.040
Listen.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.040

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
Ooh.

Stop talking trash.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
I know.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.040
I'm going playing.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.040
Everyone's...

23:27.040 --> 23:28.040
I'm sorry.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.920
Less than 3 is how many people we have signed up to participate in the Chromestowns tournament

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
right now.

23:31.920 --> 23:32.920
Exactly.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.000
This whole thing reminds me of that South Park episode where they're trying to get Tweak

23:35.000 --> 23:36.000
in...

23:36.000 --> 23:38.520
I forget the other guy, to fight.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.520
Oh, Craig.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
Craig, yeah.

23:40.520 --> 23:47.760

24:19.960 --> 24:27.840

24:27.840 --> 24:31.100
it's right you should have been doing this when we called for you guys last

24:31.100 --> 24:37.020
Last week where the fuck were you?

24:37.020 --> 24:41.980
This email comes from, scrolling down to the bottom of the really freaking long email,

24:41.980 --> 24:42.980
Johnny.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.860
I'm going to read this.

24:44.860 --> 24:45.860
It's really long.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.220
Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know I enjoy the show and wanted to share my thoughts

24:49.220 --> 24:52.100
about video games causing violence in teen pregnancy.

24:52.100 --> 24:58.260
The knee-jerk reaction from many in our age group, like Junami, is to blame the parents.

24:58.260 --> 25:03.180
However, the vast majority of us are not parents, or are not parents of adolescent-aged children,

25:03.180 --> 25:06.380
especially when you factor out the Pac-Man and Sudoku playing grandmothers that bump

25:06.380 --> 25:08.660
up the average age of the gamer statistic.

25:08.660 --> 25:12.580
It's easy for those of us who aren't parents to cast blame, but it's not so simple.

25:12.580 --> 25:16.940
Who among us growing up had parents who were successfully able to control all the influence

25:16.940 --> 25:17.940
that shaped our minds?

25:17.940 --> 25:22.100
There are many influences on a child, including the extended family, community, peers, and

25:22.100 --> 25:23.100
yes, media.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.700
Parents can only control so much.

25:24.700 --> 25:28.480
Full-time parents in the 60s couldn't keep Playboy and pot out of the hands of children.

25:28.760 --> 25:34.760
How can single parents and dual-wage parents today facing our new economic realities?

25:34.760 --> 25:36.420
I hope to attain that much supervision.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.420
That's not to say that I'm letting parents off the hook.

25:38.420 --> 25:41.080
Dysfunctional parents tend not to realize their dysfunction.

25:41.500 --> 25:45.700
But is it in reality their fault if they were raised with the same dysfunctional manner?

25:45.900 --> 25:49.860
And even if it is their fault, does simply screaming at these damaged people

25:49.860 --> 25:55.300
to raise their poor kids better contribute to a solution.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.260
Sorry, tongue tied.

25:56.820 --> 25:59.000
It's obviously not video games.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.920
People always blame new technology, trends, and music.

26:00.920 --> 26:04.700
The parents of yesterday were convinced that Elvis single-handedly deflowered a generation

26:04.700 --> 26:07.980
of virgins, equipment.

26:07.980 --> 26:08.800
That's not fiction.

26:09.060 --> 26:13.860
Yeah. But there are very few parents of today who grew up with that music agree.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.300
There have been studies done linking video games to physical agitation

26:17.300 --> 26:21.080
like increased heart rate and aggression, but also, after playing a game of football,

26:21.080 --> 26:25.620
doesn't feel that same agitation and aggression. Video games are new. They will be scapegoated

26:25.620 --> 26:29.660
until we, who have grown up with them, become the parents of adolescents ourselves. By then,

26:29.660 --> 26:35.780
I'm sure we'll be blaming VR. My God, that will play snuff films. We never had that.

26:35.780 --> 26:41.660
Satan. Defensively pointing to the First Amendment as a shield doesn't solve anything. The game

26:41.660 --> 26:45.320
industry in particular, and the gaming community in general, has to take a lead in tackling

26:45.320 --> 26:48.680
these problems. Without casting blame, we need to improve our society's respect for

26:48.680 --> 26:53.600
life and human dignity. Amen. These ideas have to be proactively taught. Simply censoring

26:53.600 --> 26:57.200
and removing media to the contrary doesn't work. Eliminating the video game where you

26:57.200 --> 27:03.220
can kill a prostitute does not, by itself, create respect for women. We have to directly

27:03.220 --> 27:10.220
teach respect for women, and a society that has respect for women will naturally not be

27:10.620 --> 27:14.320
entertained by a video game where you can kill a prostitute. That's the message that

27:14.320 --> 27:16.520
we need to communicate to the mainstream and to our government.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.740
Instead of fighting over whose fault it is, let's work on fixing the problem."

27:19.740 --> 27:20.740
I agree with that.

27:20.740 --> 27:25.120
As a side note, Camden, Ohio is a socially and religiously conservative city that teaches

27:25.120 --> 27:26.620
abstinence only.

27:26.620 --> 27:29.880
Conservative parents seem to generally believe that kids, if never told about sex, will never

27:29.880 --> 27:34.720
figure out how to perform sex or even if there are certain bodily parts that can be stimulated.

27:34.720 --> 27:39.040
This is even though one of these conservative parents themselves conceived their current

27:39.040 --> 27:42.300
crop of children in the back of a four pinto, but I digress.

27:42.300 --> 27:44.620
So why do these parents think that it must be music or video games?

27:44.620 --> 27:48.700
After all, children are never exposed to sex in their God-fearing homes and communities,

27:48.700 --> 27:49.700
right?

27:49.700 --> 27:51.340
It must be an outside influence, right?

27:51.340 --> 27:54.120
Fighting the conservatives will always be an exercise in frustration.

27:54.120 --> 27:57.740
They think they're angels, but an all-demonic influence must come from the outside.

27:57.740 --> 27:58.740
Sad.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.940
Sorry for the long-winded email, just wanted you to know that I enjoy the show.

28:00.940 --> 28:01.940
Thanks, Johnny.

28:01.940 --> 28:05.540
I agree with every damn thing that you've said there.

28:05.540 --> 28:11.220
I'd like to say I have plenty of respect for women, but I enjoy games where you can kill

28:11.220 --> 28:12.220
prostitutes.

28:12.220 --> 28:16.060
that was but they have no they have little respect for themselves though

28:16.060 --> 28:19.700
okay well I had fun with with the I actually

28:19.700 --> 28:24.420
I I have to say I do I do love having my

28:24.420 --> 28:28.580
my random about a fake non-reality

28:28.580 --> 28:33.700
destruction it's it's a release of aggression and on top of that there's all those

28:33.700 --> 28:35.340
you know added studies too about

28:35.340 --> 28:39.740
how solving even the puzzles in some of these more violent games

28:39.740 --> 28:43.020
how they raise your cognitive function. I'll have you know.

28:43.020 --> 28:46.140
I'm actually going to be putting Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

28:46.140 --> 28:50.740
on my laptop so that during our segments or during our breaks between

28:50.740 --> 28:51.900
part A and part B

28:51.900 --> 28:55.700
I can play the hot coffee mod at whim.

28:55.700 --> 28:59.580
You know what? I give props to that listener for being well-educated.

28:59.580 --> 29:02.820
That's all. Well-educated.

29:02.820 --> 29:06.740
Individual. You don't agree with them? No, no, no.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.740
No, I do.

29:07.740 --> 29:12.740
Not often you see well-educated internet rants, so I'm very pleased with the other one.

29:12.740 --> 29:16.100
Well, honestly, I think that that type of attitude should be applied toward all sorts

29:16.100 --> 29:19.160
of things within society that's going on.

29:19.160 --> 29:24.660
I honestly think that, and I actually am not going to go into detail about this, I recently

29:24.660 --> 29:26.720
had a conversation with my mother.

29:26.720 --> 29:32.500
You know what I'm talking about.

29:32.500 --> 29:36.780
I had a discussion with my mother and she started to preach at me and try to bring Bible

29:36.780 --> 29:38.340
quotes into it.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.900
And I was like, excuse me?

29:39.900 --> 29:41.780
She's like, do you believe in Jesus?

29:41.780 --> 29:51.980
I was like, what does me believing in Jesus have to do with you respecting who I am?

29:51.980 --> 29:56.860
There's nothing wrong with being religious, nothing at all.

29:56.860 --> 29:57.860
It's just, you know.

29:57.860 --> 29:58.860
It's so inflected on everybody else.

29:58.860 --> 30:03.400
But the whole thing about that is that I think that that's an attitude that we keep running into.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.800
If the fundamentalists really want to support their position, they're going to,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.300
they should actually go from a more valid standpoint.

30:10.580 --> 30:13.660
Not everybody is going to believe in what you believe.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.760
You need to, if you're really trying to convince people, you know, to not act a certain way

30:18.760 --> 30:23.220
or that, you know, not to play these violent games or to not, you know, do something,

30:23.220 --> 30:26.000
you need to actually have something substantial to support your claim with.

30:26.220 --> 30:27.240
That's what I have to say.

30:27.240 --> 30:32.820
I actually have to defend I'm not I'm not conservative or anything but to defend the conservatives

30:32.820 --> 30:37.580
There are a few people out there that are just that dumb that they will go out and do stupid things from games

30:37.580 --> 30:42.840
But I would have more respect for them if they actually research the subject they were talking about

30:42.840 --> 30:48.240
You should see some of those anti Harry Potter, but Harry Potter promotes witchcraft. There's actually Christians

30:48.240 --> 30:54.140
Hello, there actually is a book though that one of my friends who is she's a very she's a liberal Christian

30:54.720 --> 30:56.480
She is called

30:56.480 --> 31:03.440
What Harry Potter teaches us about Jesus or something like that and how they're actually using it as a relation for how it teaches good values

31:04.800 --> 31:11.440
It does teach some good values, but listen if you want witchcraft you watch Harry Potter if you want, you know

31:12.080 --> 31:14.080
Jesus and all that stuff

31:14.440 --> 31:16.440
You watch this

31:17.280 --> 31:20.900
So, you know, there's movies out there for that are both

31:20.900 --> 31:27.680
parallel to different religions. I'm waiting for my goddamn pagan series, or better yet,

31:27.680 --> 31:33.320
Scientology. Oh, I'm sorry, Battlefield Earth was already out there, so...

31:33.320 --> 31:36.760
Moving on. Tom Cruise saving the world with Scientology.

31:36.760 --> 31:41.000
Religion Wars 101 here on this program, please. No, but my whole point was, is just that,

31:41.000 --> 31:45.000
you know, fucking think for yourself, people. Don't be a fucking sheep.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.360
Okay, Jeremy Todd won!

31:48.360 --> 31:51.360
First of all, RIDRASHER.

31:51.360 --> 31:54.480
R-I-D-R-A-Y-S-H-E-R.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.140
Okay, I found this on YouTube. Jack Thompson was interviewed, well not really an

31:59.140 --> 32:01.800
interview, but more of a discussion about video game violence.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.280
The main discussion was about the game Bully and how it could affect children in

32:05.280 --> 32:07.040
schools. Here's a link to the video.

32:07.040 --> 32:11.800
Look on YouTube and look under Jack Thompson. Yeah, do a search if you really want.

32:11.800 --> 32:12.480
I'm not gonna...

32:12.480 --> 32:17.100
Honestly, there's a reason why we've relegated this sort of to the mailbag segment and didn't

32:17.100 --> 32:21.740
talk about it a whole lot in depth tonight, and that is, unlike G4, we don't feel like

32:21.740 --> 32:23.740
giving this guy more attention.

32:23.740 --> 32:27.780
With all due respect to the emailer, I realize it's in the blogs and everything, and people

32:27.780 --> 32:28.780
are talking about it.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.780
I'm going to finish reading his email.

32:30.780 --> 32:31.780
Sure.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.220
They bring up some interesting points, and I thought that OLR and possibly some of the

32:34.220 --> 32:36.080
listeners would want to see this video.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.500
My opinion is also, by the way, on game politics.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.440
They kept bringing some of the stuff up.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.020
My opinion on this video is that Jack Thompson believes that when a kid starts playing a

32:44.020 --> 32:47.780
violent video game, that the kid will instantly turn into an angry, violent kid and that that's

32:47.780 --> 32:48.960
just not true.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.300
One thing I found interesting is that when they asked Jack if he had seen the game being

32:52.300 --> 32:56.620
played by someone, and he replies by saying no.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.900
So basically he is saying that the game Bully will make kids violent even though he hasn't

32:59.900 --> 33:03.060
actually seen the video being played and he doesn't know what the game runs.

33:03.060 --> 33:09.020
To be fair, none of them have seen the game yet, and also to be fair, his whole assumption

33:09.020 --> 33:13.420
on the game was based off of the press release about the game, the pictures they've seen

33:13.420 --> 33:18.980
so far of the game, and that kind of stuff. So he's in the wrong for assuming that this

33:18.980 --> 33:24.520
game is a certain way because of just a press release and some pictures and he hasn't played

33:24.520 --> 33:27.920
the game. But they're also wrong in defending the game because they haven't played it yet

33:27.920 --> 33:32.720
either. So the whole thing is it's an argument over something completely retarded. That's

33:32.720 --> 33:37.260
just like saying, you know, the passion of the Christ. And Mel Gibson is making a movie

33:37.260 --> 33:40.060
pretending that the movie hasn't come out yet or something like that and

33:40.060 --> 33:43.580
debating you know that whole movie without having seen anything on it

33:43.580 --> 33:45.780
it's just it the whole argument

33:45.780 --> 33:48.940
you know the whole interview was retarded. The whole thing was an

33:48.940 --> 33:50.180
ego

33:50.180 --> 33:54.740
cock stroking thing seriously Jack Thompson wanted to be on cable TV

33:54.740 --> 33:58.780
G4 wanted to be able to interview the big bad guy behind video games

33:58.780 --> 34:02.720
there was nothing redeeming about that whole thing. They covered nothing.

34:02.720 --> 34:06.720
and I wish to not waste any more time talking about it next email.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.920
Moving on, Chris emails us saying,

34:09.920 --> 34:13.420
Hey, OLR, I recently received a DS Lite for my birthday and I was wondering,

34:13.420 --> 34:17.120
this is my favorite game for PSP and PS2 as SOCOM,

34:17.120 --> 34:21.520
if there are any games that are similar to SOCOM for DS because please let me know.

34:21.520 --> 34:26.620
Thanks, love the show. I don't know, because those type of games don't really interest me,

34:26.620 --> 34:29.820
personally. Point blank, maybe?

34:29.820 --> 34:36.400
Now stuff I wouldn't say point-blank if anything I mean there's not a lot out right now

34:36.400 --> 34:40.300
I think that they might be porting over Medal of Honor or Call of Duty to the

34:40.840 --> 34:45.920
DS didn't know about that, but there might be you know something like that coming out

34:45.920 --> 34:51.460
I would say probably right now Metroid Prime Hunters. You know the first you know first-person shooter

34:51.460 --> 34:56.820
There's not a whole lot first-person shooters on the Wii just because it's difficult set up on it. Yes

34:56.820 --> 35:03.120
DS, Wii, whatever. Well, I would say though, if you really, if you have these games that

35:03.120 --> 35:07.220
you like, check the publisher's websites and see if they have any release dates listed

35:07.220 --> 35:13.480
for any games along those lines. I was just going to throw out, as the Nintendo fangirl,

35:13.480 --> 35:19.840
that Metroid Prime for DS is really very, very good. And I'm not a big fan of first

35:19.840 --> 35:23.420
person shooters in general, but that was very, very good. I liked Metroid and the DS better

35:23.420 --> 35:26.220
than I did on the consoles, to be honest, perfectly honest.

35:26.220 --> 35:28.500
I like the first Metroid on the Nintendo.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.500
A little wireless multiplayer goes a long way.

35:30.500 --> 35:32.100
Super Metroid, Super Metroid.

35:32.100 --> 35:34.300
Yes, that game was the shit.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.500
That's all for email though.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.000
All right, you should email us too.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.060
You, there, sitting at your computer,

35:39.060 --> 35:40.740
or sitting on the bus, or in the car,

35:40.740 --> 35:42.460
listening to our show right now.

35:42.460 --> 35:44.460
I mean, if you're driving, don't email us right now.

35:44.460 --> 35:46.020
But send us an email at some point.

35:46.020 --> 35:49.820
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

35:49.820 --> 35:53.060
Meanwhile, back to the gaming news.

35:53.060 --> 36:01.020
Yes, and speaking of G4, they actually just did G4 yet, 2006, and that kind of snuck by

36:01.020 --> 36:06.100
because I didn't see anything about it, but we have their results so that you don't have

36:06.100 --> 36:08.860
to see the reruns. Anyways, don't get...

36:08.860 --> 36:12.620
I just want to say this isn't news, but I understand why we're covering it. That's fine.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.120
I just want to get that out there. This isn't news.

36:14.120 --> 36:20.460
Okay. Best game of the year, Elder Scrolls IV. Duh. Okay. Best voiceover, Kingdom Hearts

36:20.460 --> 36:28.480
Best 2. Best alternative sport game, Mario Baseball. Best action game, Shadow of the

36:28.480 --> 36:36.720
Colossus. Okay. Best graphics, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion. Best handheld game, Mario Kart

36:36.720 --> 36:44.080
DS. Best multiplayer game, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter on the 360. This one I have trouble

36:44.080 --> 36:47.080
with right here. Most original game, Guitar Hero.

36:47.080 --> 36:50.080
Uh, Guitar Freaks anyone?

36:50.080 --> 36:51.080
I don't know.

36:51.080 --> 36:56.080
Um, best role playing game, Elder Scrolls IV, Oblivion, best shooter, Call of Duty 2,

36:56.080 --> 37:02.080
best soundtrack, Kingdom Hearts 2, best strategy game, Star Wars Empire at War, and best traditional

37:02.080 --> 37:04.080
sports game, Fight Night Round 3.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.080
Can I rant for a minute?

37:05.080 --> 37:07.080
Actually that game was really good looking.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.080
Yeah, yeah, Fight Night is a beautiful looking game.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.080
Um, can I rant for a minute though?

37:10.080 --> 37:16.080
I am sick of G4 farting and it turning up on all these game blogs.

37:16.080 --> 37:22.040
I mean seriously, what has G4 done for the gaming industry in the past year?

37:22.040 --> 37:25.000
Not a god damn thing but let downs and disappointment.

37:25.000 --> 37:30.600
Why is the gaming community continuing to give a shit about anything G4 does?

37:30.600 --> 37:33.520
Seriously, don't look at it and maybe it will go away.

37:33.520 --> 37:39.200
We should be focusing our attention on more promising gaming representation such as independent

37:39.200 --> 37:40.200
radio.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.360
Game politics?

37:41.360 --> 37:46.240
politics.com, which is an impressive website, I love that place, Gameplay HD, that whole

37:46.240 --> 37:51.600
channel which is run by people who actually know things about video games, shock and awe.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.280
I've actually seen good stuff come out of Eurogamer TV too.

37:54.280 --> 37:55.280
You know what?

37:55.280 --> 37:57.740
And YouTube, and you don't want to know something funny though?

37:57.740 --> 37:58.740
Certain vodcast out there.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.040
This year's G4 was X-Play presents G4.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.040
Because you know what?

38:02.040 --> 38:04.240
X-Play is the only gaming show on that network anymore.

38:04.240 --> 38:10.700
So seriously, gaming community, I challenge you, stop giving a shit about G4 for like

38:10.700 --> 38:15.900
six months, and maybe something better will rise up, and you might find something better

38:15.900 --> 38:19.820
that is more deserving of your attention than anything that joke of a network producer.

38:19.820 --> 38:23.540
And investors, remember, Orange Lounge Radio TV can happen.

38:23.540 --> 38:24.540
And you know what?

38:24.540 --> 38:29.140
It won't happen on G4 after my little rant, sorry, but look, that's how I feel, and how

38:29.140 --> 38:31.740
most of the gaming folks feel, I'm sure.

38:31.740 --> 38:39.620
I'm just saying, ever since the first G4 that I saw, which was retarded anyways, I was amazed

38:39.620 --> 38:44.580
that Spike and their, you know, award show was actually better than G4, yeah, when it

38:44.580 --> 38:47.920
first came out, I'm like, and this is a network that doesn't even, you know, this isn't a

38:47.920 --> 38:52.560
gaming network and they're doing a better show? I mean, come on. Well, G4's not a gaming

38:52.560 --> 38:57.100
network anymore, and that is a fact. They've come out and said it. It is a guy TV network

38:57.100 --> 39:03.420
like Spike, so. I'm just fucking sick of seeing all these, you know, G4 does this and it ends

39:03.420 --> 39:10.420
up on Digg. I'm like, G4 can suck my dick. Will that end up on Digg? Probably.

39:10.420 --> 39:16.060
G4 comes to Orange John's radio studio and begins to get down on their knees and...

39:16.060 --> 39:19.260
Black Wolf brings up an interesting point. You know Black Wolf has something to say about

39:19.260 --> 39:25.140
this. He says All Games was born from G4. Well, not really born from G4, but All Games

39:25.140 --> 39:28.340
as it is today. All Games has been around for 10 years, but of course we all know Scott,

39:28.340 --> 39:33.020
who started all games, started G4 with Comcast.

39:33.020 --> 39:36.100
And G4, everything negative I'm saying about G4

39:36.100 --> 39:37.700
is in the past couple years,

39:37.700 --> 39:38.940
pretty much every decision they made

39:38.940 --> 39:41.780
since the tech TV merger, I think we can all agree,

39:41.780 --> 39:44.460
G4, when it first started, had a lot of promise.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.300
It was pretty cool.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.940
And sure, even myself, maybe on this program in the past,

39:48.940 --> 39:51.260
I gave Scott and some of the other G4 personalities

39:51.260 --> 39:54.500
a hard time, but no more than some of the internet

39:54.500 --> 39:57.380
gives us a hard time being a podcaster, whatever.

39:57.380 --> 40:02.060
I have nothing but respect for him, for the fact especially that he knew when to jump

40:02.060 --> 40:03.060
ship.

40:03.060 --> 40:07.660
I mean, that speaks a lot of points to Scott's gamer cred and everything, and what All Games

40:07.660 --> 40:16.140
is all about, is that he was able to jump from that cable TV guy position and do something

40:16.140 --> 40:21.340
that he believed in, and something that is so much more beneficial for the gaming community,

40:21.340 --> 40:27.260
And it makes me so frustrated that All Games does things, you know, Orange Launch Radio,

40:27.260 --> 40:32.820
Gamer Andy, Chatterbox, Bobby, everybody does things and nobody seems to care.

40:32.820 --> 40:33.820
Exactly.

40:33.820 --> 40:37.340
It's like, you know, if I report a street date or something of something, it doesn't

40:37.340 --> 40:38.340
matter.

40:38.340 --> 40:41.820
But if G4 just says, oh, by the way, this is coming out, it will get posted on every

40:41.820 --> 40:42.820
single...

40:42.820 --> 40:46.740
If All Games did an award show like G4ia did that, nobody would care.

40:46.740 --> 40:51.060
And it's sad because that award show would be brought to you by real gamers.

40:51.060 --> 40:58.060
gamers not not game for pay anyway that was my little rant that was my little

40:58.060 --> 41:04.320
rant sorry I do want to you know give Scott massive kudos oh I absolutely give

41:04.320 --> 41:07.860
Scott massive kudos because the reason the whole reason why we're on board with

41:07.860 --> 41:15.060
all games is that you know we believe in his vision you know and just next story

41:15.060 --> 41:17.700
please I'm sorry Scott is full of awesome and

41:17.700 --> 41:22.100
Yeah, I know. I know. He's a good guy. Everybody at all games... Lawrence, I couldn't say enough

41:22.100 --> 41:27.780
great things about him. If we could afford to pay him to be our producer, we would. And,

41:27.780 --> 41:30.660
you know, of course Bobby, even though we give him a hard time about the whole, you

41:30.660 --> 41:32.580
know, ChromeHounds and everything thing, he's just, he's...

41:32.580 --> 41:34.860
Bobby is full of loss and can win too.

41:34.860 --> 41:35.540
They're great.

41:35.540 --> 41:42.540
I think, I think I would rather, you know, kind of lump G4 in with the Jacky-poo thing

41:43.540 --> 41:47.060
and just basically treat it like that. Let's just not talk about him anymore.

41:47.060 --> 41:50.300
You know what? I'm taking a stand right now.

41:50.300 --> 41:55.460
G4, those words are banned from this program from here on out.

41:55.460 --> 41:59.340
Unless they're mentioned in other words and not together.

41:59.340 --> 42:01.820
Yeah, you know what I mean.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.580
Like, for example, we could talk about a G4 Mac.

42:04.580 --> 42:08.340
Okay, that'll be fine, but unless they talk about something really big,

42:08.340 --> 42:12.260
with the exception of one segment that's coming up tonight, because I just

42:12.260 --> 42:14.180
realized there's something coming up in a segment tonight.

42:14.180 --> 42:18.260
after tonight's episode seriously no more G4 news stories

42:18.260 --> 42:22.380
seriously. Gee I wish I had four arms.

42:22.380 --> 42:27.260
By the way, poo eater, slink to the chat room, dig story about G4

42:27.260 --> 42:31.060
Did it seriously get dug?

42:31.060 --> 42:34.420
I am, oh god you guys are crazy. Anyway

42:34.420 --> 42:38.780
in news, yes please thank you, there is a

42:38.780 --> 42:43.460
full length feature made especially for Xbox Live that will be coming out on the

42:43.460 --> 42:50.460
a marketplace. It's basically a recap of the, so far, Battlestar Galactica series. So if

42:51.180 --> 42:55.940
any of you missed it, go get it. Battlestar Galactica is awesome sauce.

42:55.940 --> 43:00.700
I'm glad we could talk about good cable TV now, because Battlestar Galactica is pretty

43:00.700 --> 43:02.420
frackin' awesome. I mean, it's...

43:02.420 --> 43:04.620
I used to watch the old Battlestar Galactica.

43:04.620 --> 43:06.740
The new one just...

43:06.740 --> 43:07.220
You know what they need to do?

43:07.220 --> 43:09.220
...takes the old one and makes it, like, great.

43:09.220 --> 43:10.460
You know what they need to do for me, though?

43:10.460 --> 43:10.740
Huh.

43:10.740 --> 43:14.180
need to freak and put the new Doctor Who episodes up there for me because the new

43:14.180 --> 43:19.860
doctor is cute and I was because I made the mistake of watching Doctor Who on

43:19.860 --> 43:30.820
YouTube and I found out what happens to Rose I'm sorry I love my British sci-fi

43:30.820 --> 43:35.740
y'all I think it's a really good idea to put this on Xbox Live you know just it's

43:35.740 --> 43:38.060
It's a marriage of geekdom, it's great.

43:38.060 --> 43:45.060
Dear Microsoft, Dr. Who, please, for the win.

43:45.060 --> 43:49.700
All right, well, I know we have some GameStop pride here in studio tonight.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.580
We have Meg Z who works at GameStop, and I know Jamie's Husby.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.220
I know stuff about this too.

43:54.220 --> 43:57.780
Yes, well here it is, I have to mention this, and of course I want to know what you guys

43:57.780 --> 44:03.780
think about this, Louisiana employees of GameStop are suing the retailer for unfair labor practices.

44:03.780 --> 44:05.260
Happened in California too.

44:05.260 --> 44:09.900
Six managers claimed they were forced to work 60 or more hours a week without being paid

44:09.900 --> 44:13.220
overtime and were told they were not eligible for overtime.

44:13.220 --> 44:17.980
EA, by the way, and other major developers lost a court case of something similar.

44:17.980 --> 44:19.780
So what do you guys think of this?

44:19.780 --> 44:24.860
It happened in California actually and they changed because this affected my husband's

44:24.860 --> 44:26.540
salary.

44:26.540 --> 44:34.300
They actually had to change, I think, something from salary to pay as part of a class action

44:34.300 --> 44:35.300
lawsuit.

44:35.300 --> 44:39.940
They had to rework because it was violating some California pay and labor law.

44:39.940 --> 44:45.020
In fact, the company I work for has actually had to redo that because they were paying

44:45.020 --> 44:49.540
us by something that's legal in North Carolina and not what's legal in California.

44:49.540 --> 44:52.660
But yeah, that happened out here too.

44:52.660 --> 45:00.200
I think it's already up to seven digs on dig.com, but it doesn't link to anything because the

45:00.200 --> 45:01.200
podcast isn't up yet.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.660
They should have waited until the podcast was up and then they could link it.

45:03.660 --> 45:07.180
We'll see. I don't know. We'll see what happens. That's cute. You guys are so great.

45:07.180 --> 45:11.380
I love, I love O.L. Army.

45:11.380 --> 45:15.580
Oh, I'm sorry. Megsy was going to have a comment for us. Megsy, what would you want to say on the GameStop thing?

45:15.580 --> 45:19.580
Uh, I like GameStop.

45:19.580 --> 45:24.540
I go there. Hi, this is Eris from GameStop. Hi, this is Eris from GameStop. She called me like five times.

45:24.540 --> 45:27.700
Uh, since I'm not a manager, it doesn't really affect me.

45:27.700 --> 45:30.860
Um, so I guess I don't really have anything to say about it.

45:30.860 --> 45:36.040
Well, I don't want you to endanger your job. I was going to say, from your perception,

45:36.040 --> 45:38.720
does it seem unfair? You don't have to answer.

45:38.720 --> 45:44.780
I guess. If you're working 60 more hours a week in any job, you should be paid fairly

45:44.780 --> 45:45.780
for it.

45:45.780 --> 45:46.780
True.

45:46.780 --> 45:52.180
In California, basically, and honestly, this is why I will never move out of state, because

45:52.180 --> 46:00.100
I've worked in the South, and it sucks. In California, you're required to have, for every

46:00.100 --> 46:03.620
Every six hours you work, you're required to have two 15-minute breaks.

46:03.620 --> 46:08.380
If you work over six hours, you get a 30-minute lunch that you're not paid for, of course.

46:08.380 --> 46:11.980
If you work over eight hours in a day, unless there are other prior arrangements made, you

46:11.980 --> 46:13.260
get paid overtime.

46:13.260 --> 46:17.220
If you go over ten hours, you get time and a half.

46:17.220 --> 46:18.700
Not time and a half, you get double time.

46:18.700 --> 46:19.860
Yeah, that's law.

46:19.860 --> 46:22.100
Yeah, that's law in California.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.220
And if you work over 40 hours a week, you get overtime pay.

46:25.220 --> 46:29.060
Now, did they specify whether these were, these were, this is probably just a small

46:29.060 --> 46:32.760
detail if these were store managers or assistant managers or just managers.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
You just said six managers.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
Oh, all right.

46:34.760 --> 46:35.760
Then I really don't know.

46:35.760 --> 46:39.380
But I think that there's actually something similar in regards at least for the weekly

46:39.380 --> 46:45.620
over time, but as far as I was aware, I think that most of the GameStop managers are on

46:45.620 --> 46:46.620
salary.

46:46.620 --> 46:47.620
Yeah, they are.

46:47.620 --> 46:48.620
And they actually...

46:48.620 --> 46:49.620
That's how I understand it.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.540
They eliminated that in California because it was violating labor law.

46:52.540 --> 46:53.540
I see.

46:53.540 --> 46:54.540
But...

46:54.540 --> 46:57.020
GameStop managers in Wisconsin are on salary as far as I can tell.

46:57.020 --> 46:58.840
But if they're working 60 hours a week,

46:58.840 --> 47:00.420
there should be some sort of provision.

47:00.420 --> 47:07.460
Because I believe that standard salary pay is on a 45 hour

47:07.460 --> 47:09.460
a week.

47:09.460 --> 47:10.980
Well, in California, it's 40.

47:10.980 --> 47:14.180
But I think that their old way that they did it

47:14.180 --> 47:17.780
is that 45 hours of pay each paycheck.

47:17.780 --> 47:22.340
And if you're working 60 hours, then no, that doesn't fly.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.020
I'm not sure how it is in Wisconsin.

47:24.020 --> 47:25.180
I'm just a part-time worker.

47:25.180 --> 47:31.340
I'm just glad when I get hours, but yeah, I guess that if you are working 60 hours you

47:31.340 --> 47:34.220
should get some sort of compensation because that's just insane.

47:34.220 --> 47:35.220
Yeah.

47:35.220 --> 47:39.260
Alright, let's keep it moving.

47:39.260 --> 47:44.180
Anyways, speaking of disappointments, PlayStation 3.

47:44.180 --> 47:47.460
Not going to be playable at Lipzig.

47:47.460 --> 47:52.500
So all you German fans of the PlayStation 3 out there, sorry.

47:52.500 --> 47:58.740
Sony wants to save all their surprises for the Tokyo Game Show. No word if other developers

47:58.740 --> 48:04.380
are showing off any playable Playstation 3 games. It says, but if Sony decides that they

48:04.380 --> 48:07.620
are not going to show the unit, you can bet that a decent amount of the companies will

48:07.620 --> 48:13.580
follow suit. So what's this mean? This means that they're going to have to pull out some

48:13.580 --> 48:18.900
like serious leprechaun magic to get this thing to be impressive by the time Tokyo Game

48:18.900 --> 48:24.620
show comes around, that's all I gotta say. So, I don't know. Not too surprised that they're

48:24.620 --> 48:30.140
not having stuff playable, because they only need a more negative press. But I am surprised

48:30.140 --> 48:35.140
that they're not gonna, well, who knows. Maybe they will detail some more stuff about their,

48:35.140 --> 48:42.140
you know, online service and that kind of thing. But no game sucks.

48:42.140 --> 48:51.420
Well, speaking of that particular little convention, there actually is an Ubisoft lineup that was

48:51.420 --> 48:52.420
posted.

48:52.420 --> 48:58.380
If anybody cares about Ubisoft, which I do, because I think Ubisoft does, they do some

48:58.380 --> 48:59.380
happy.

48:59.380 --> 49:00.380
Ubisoft FTW.

49:00.380 --> 49:01.380
They're cool.

49:01.380 --> 49:02.380
Yeah.

49:02.380 --> 49:07.500
Dark Messiah of Might and Magic will be out Fall 2006.

49:07.500 --> 49:13.520
There's also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent that has single player multiplayer mode

49:13.520 --> 49:23.960
on Xbox 360, PC, and this is Xbox 360, I'm sorry, Call of Juarez Western Shooter playable

49:23.960 --> 49:26.260
on PC September 2006.

49:26.260 --> 49:31.160
The Settlers 2 The Next Generation, I haven't heard of The Settlers 1 to be honest, it's

49:31.160 --> 49:33.560
on PC, it's a strategy game, no wonder.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.580
Settlers construction construction based strategy game playable on the DS

49:38.300 --> 49:41.160
horses with a Z riding adventure playable on PC

49:41.720 --> 49:45.980
open season action adventure playable on PlayStation 2 and

49:47.480 --> 49:49.480
Also

49:49.560 --> 49:51.560
There were

49:51.560 --> 49:58.040
numbers of the international development team available there who are giving some of the background into how games are created created and

49:58.560 --> 50:01.840
Speaking out on new projects showing playable games

50:01.840 --> 50:08.840
games. They also have a playable of Dark Messiah available there.

50:08.880 --> 50:14.920
That's pretty cool. Some interesting things coming from Sony again, talking about their

50:14.920 --> 50:20.040
online service for the PS3. Well, there's also an online service that's supposed to

50:20.040 --> 50:27.040
be coming to the PSP in the form of an iTunes-like service to download movies and video, and

50:27.040 --> 50:30.360
and of course some music and stuff. So anyways,

50:30.360 --> 50:33.760
it's kind of interesting though,

50:33.760 --> 50:37.840
right now they've got a total of 120 games coming out

50:37.840 --> 50:43.000
by the end of the year for the PSP, so that's pretty good.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.240
It is, you know, that service right now is being held up,

50:47.240 --> 50:50.400
the download service for the videos and the music

50:50.400 --> 50:54.440
is being held up by the digital rights management that they haven't

50:54.440 --> 50:58.440
quite figure out how to implement yet. What's kind of cool though is

50:58.440 --> 51:02.200
they're talking about the GPS system as well. They're going to be adding

51:02.200 --> 51:05.800
use for both mapping,

51:05.800 --> 51:08.920
you know, your standard GPS mapping, and also gameplay elements.

51:08.920 --> 51:13.200
So some games will support GPS. I think actually Hot Shots Golf, the new ones

51:13.200 --> 51:13.760
coming out,

51:13.760 --> 51:17.520
will support that. They're also talking about the camera add-on

51:17.520 --> 51:21.440
is going to have a microphone built in. It'll be able to take still pictures and video.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.820
and the future iterations of the PSP likely

51:24.820 --> 51:30.220
are likely but Sony is believing that the device will have a 10-year lifespan. This is all

51:30.220 --> 51:32.140
coming from Kotaku. They actually had an

51:32.140 --> 51:35.660
interview that they did with John Kohler,

51:35.660 --> 51:38.680
the senior marketing manager for the PSP.

51:38.680 --> 51:44.360
So, it's kinda interesting. I want to know when their download service for the games is

51:44.360 --> 51:46.540
coming out because if they're having trouble with the movies

51:46.540 --> 51:50.620
and the music, games is gonna be another thing too.

51:50.620 --> 51:53.980
And, and do you really think this is gonna take off? I don't know.

51:53.980 --> 51:58.820
Ehh, ehh.

51:58.820 --> 52:02.020
What, Maisie? Like I said, I've got, I've got a

52:02.020 --> 52:06.300
vendetta against Sony and the PSP is one of the things I hate most about Sony.

52:06.300 --> 52:09.540
Why? Um, because, let's see,

52:09.540 --> 52:12.660
let's see, um, well looking at it from,

52:12.660 --> 52:16.060
if you just look at it hypothetically, it's a great system, you know, it does all this stuff,

52:16.060 --> 52:19.540
but it seems like it almost does too much and everything is kind of half done,

52:19.540 --> 52:22.540
and it seems like they're just it's just all this other stuff is just overkill

52:22.540 --> 52:25.500
and it's gonna all be half done just kinda like the movies and the music and

52:25.500 --> 52:26.060
the games

52:26.060 --> 52:30.140
it's like uh... pick something and do it well? yeah it's it's the business world has it

52:30.140 --> 52:31.500
saying that if you do one thing

52:31.500 --> 52:34.860
well then you've succeeded if you do three things like halfway then

52:34.860 --> 52:36.420
you've failed and that's the PSP

52:36.420 --> 52:39.460
you know it's almost like the same mistake the N-Gage made because

52:39.460 --> 52:43.420
and I hate to compare the PSP to the N-Gage because I give PSP a lot more credit than that

52:43.420 --> 52:47.660
yeah but the N-Gage was kinda you know it it tried to be was it a phone was it a

52:47.660 --> 52:48.740
gaming system and

52:48.740 --> 52:54.860
But it just was a hockey puck. Yeah. Well and the other thing too about it is and I mean having oh

52:54.860 --> 52:56.860
I have two PSPs, so

52:57.500 --> 53:03.300
They're really to be honest isn't a game that you gotta have for the PSP

53:03.300 --> 53:09.740
I mean, I play Grand Theft Auto religiously and that's pretty much it. That's my one game. I buy each year

53:09.740 --> 53:10.740
I mean

53:10.740 --> 53:16.780
but you know what that's pretty sad because I don't even play the DS that much and I've bought more than one game for this

53:16.780 --> 53:23.320
year and I plan on buying a lot more coming soon but there just isn't any games out there

53:23.320 --> 53:28.700
that come out that are really great and it's just why would I waste my money on this stuff

53:28.700 --> 53:34.120
and that's the other thing too the games are more expensive than the DS so great that you

53:34.120 --> 53:38.460
know it's a more powerful system but it's just I don't know they're not making good

53:38.460 --> 53:40.000
software for it.

53:40.000 --> 53:45.880
I actually have to, though, give mad props to DJ Geni, the Wonder Swan.

53:45.880 --> 53:48.360
The swan kicks all your portable asses.

53:48.360 --> 53:52.380
As much as I love the Wonder Swan, I still prefer PSP, even then.

53:52.380 --> 53:53.380
Even then.

53:53.380 --> 53:54.380
I love my Wonder Swan.

53:54.380 --> 53:55.380
I like the PSP.

53:55.380 --> 53:56.380
It just...

53:56.380 --> 53:57.380
It's...

53:57.380 --> 53:58.380
Neo Geo Pocket Color!

53:58.380 --> 54:03.720
I like the PSP, but I agree it spreads itself a little too thin to try to do too much, then

54:03.720 --> 54:04.720
focus on the games.

54:04.720 --> 54:05.880
But for some people, that's what they need.

54:05.880 --> 54:09.400
As far as the N-Gage reference, I played the Game.com more than I played our N-Gage, and

54:09.400 --> 54:11.560
We gave it away.

54:11.560 --> 54:16.200
The analogy I use a lot with the PSP when trying to explain to someone is it's like

54:16.200 --> 54:19.580
when you go to Thanksgiving dinner and you load up your plate with all sorts of stuff

54:19.580 --> 54:23.040
like everything, way too much of anything, and then you sit down and you try to eat it

54:23.040 --> 54:24.480
and you just can't finish it.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.480
And you get sick.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.480
Well, that too.

54:26.480 --> 54:28.080
But it's like, it's all just half done.

54:28.080 --> 54:31.720
Whereas the DS, you got a bunch of turkey and you can finish all your turkey and it's

54:31.720 --> 54:32.860
really good.

54:32.860 --> 54:34.360
And then you have a nice nap when you're done.

54:34.360 --> 54:36.360
Yeah, then you fall asleep.

54:36.360 --> 54:40.960
All right, I'm sure we'll get some emails on that.

54:40.960 --> 54:43.640
So we look forward to reading those.

54:43.640 --> 54:47.080
In the meantime, we're gonna shift gears here a little bit on Orange Lounge Radio.

54:47.080 --> 54:51.720
We're gonna do something we have not done in a long time, at least six months.

54:51.720 --> 54:54.120
But you know what, kids, it's a slow news week.

54:54.120 --> 54:57.080
And all things considered, it's a pretty slow news week.

54:57.080 --> 55:01.320
And it's time for us here on Orange Lounge Radio to bring back

55:01.320 --> 55:05.280
an old segment that we used to do back in the day when we did a three hour live show

55:05.280 --> 55:07.040
and a podcast and all that stuff.

55:07.040 --> 55:07.720
Quite.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.480
All right.

55:08.480 --> 55:09.780
So are we ready?

55:09.780 --> 55:12.520
Because I think, Loki, are you filming this?

55:12.520 --> 55:13.040
I don't know.

55:13.040 --> 55:16.000
I think so, because they wanted more film for the station.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.080
All right, well, here we go.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.760
Here we go, whenever you guys are ready.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.880

59:28.120 --> 59:30.120

59:30.120 --> 59:32.120
Oh, you're not looking at chat room answers, doing it all by yourself?

59:40.120 --> 59:42.120
Let me read the question one more time.

59:42.120 --> 59:45.120
Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.

59:45.120 --> 59:48.120
It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house Nelly screaming,

59:48.120 --> 59:51.120
Matt, put down the blank so we can have Whoopi!

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
Magus, what's your answer?

59:52.120 --> 59:55.120
Matt, put down the res trans vibrator.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.120
Res trans vibrator so we can have Whoopi!

59:58.120 --> 01:00:03.560
We can have Whoopi, and let's see what contestant number two in chat DMN said, said, Matt, put

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.920
down the Wii so we can have Whoopi.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920
The Wii.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
All right, Dark Soccer.

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920
I said Transvibrator.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
Transvibrator!

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.920
One point for Magus.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920
Good job.

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
That's crazy.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:19.440
And yes, we're writing it down in studio and she does have that written down on her little

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
piece of paper.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.600
I had that written down ten minutes ago.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.720
All right, let's see.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.520
Loki, what did you have?

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:35.520
Well, seeing as the Wii isn't out yet, and also the Res Transfiberator, I don't own that.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.520
That's what you say.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.520
I said the Xbox 360 controller.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.520
Xbox 360 controller, what a boring answer.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.520
What a boring, boring answer.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:50.520
Okay, my answer was put down the Wii so we can make Whoopi.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.520
So I matched with DMN so it's all tied up one to one.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
Let's see.

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.260
Megzi, what did you put? Put down the...

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:57.760
Corn.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760
Corn?!

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.560
The corn?!

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.760
I don't want to know.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.920
You're only going to get that if you've seen Sensitive Pornograph.

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.800
No, no, no, it was in my sexual harassment.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.000
Nerds! Nerds!

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.640
Alright, Chris, Matt, put down the...

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640
Third hand.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.120
Third hand, not a match.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120
I didn't know.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.580
Alright, that's alright. You're still hot, so we'll give it to you.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.700
Alright, but it doesn't help out our chat room DMN or it doesn't help out

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.920
Magus any. It's still one to one though, which is a higher score than usual for a

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.080
match game. So here we go.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.480
We're ready for question number two. You ready Magus?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.200
Any choice words for DMN?

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.640
Oh, you're going down. Alright, here it is. Question number two.

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.840
Oops, no music yet. Dark Sakura

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.920
is planning a road trip with her girlfriends very soon.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:56.280

01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:00.560
they drive a magical car capable of playing

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.880
any video game to entertain themselves on the trip there

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.960

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.600

Alright, our folks are thinking about their answers there. We have our celebrities. Hey,

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.440

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.960
No we're not, but we all think the same thing anyway.

Not a match though, not a match. Good answer from myself, but not a match, sad to say.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.340
Magsy, what did you say?

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:08.340
Animal Crossing.

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.340
Animal Crossing! Chris!

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:11.340
Animal Crossing!

01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:13.340
Oh, wow!

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:14.340
That was a...

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.340
It's a massive intro.

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.340
There are too many giggling girls on tonight's program. Way too many.

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.340
I remember those emails we got back in the day about the giggling co-host.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.340
Oh, this is revenge.

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.640
All right, here it is.

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640
Question number three, boys and girls.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640
You ready for question number three?

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.120
It's still tied up one to one, all right?

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.260
Here it is.

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.740
Question numero tres.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:42.320
Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:49.980
Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.980
I have my answer.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:53.980
Ding.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.980
Ding.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.980
Ding.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.980
Megsy, is that a ding?

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.980
Oh, she's writing right now. Okay, let's see if we got something from her chat.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.980
No, we're waiting on our chat room.

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.980
Person. Come on, step it up, DMN.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.980
There's a little bit of a delay. He's trying to think of a good answer.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:15.980
Here's that question one more time. We are playing video game match game tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.980
Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:24.380
hill. Because of this, he has to remember to, when playing scary games, to bring some

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:33.540
blank. Still waiting. Okay, there we go, we have an answer. Alright, so let's go over

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:40.320
to Magus. Rob gets scared when playing games. He has to remember when playing scary games

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:47.760
to bring some clean underwear clean underwear clean underwear okay and DMN

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:55.440
says has to remember to bring some depends depends yeah a little bit a

01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:01.640
little bit but oops I cried my pants all right let's let's see if we get a match

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.640
we have clean underwear and depends those are different things they are

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.560
distinctly different because you don't poop and clean underwear okay but you

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.940
You can poop in Depends all you want.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:11.180
I said Depends adult diapers.

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.180
You did?

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:13.180
Yes, I did.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180
Alright!

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.180
That's a point for DMN.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.180
I specifically said Depends.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.180
Alright.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:18.180
Point for DMN.

01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:19.180
Oops, I cracked my pants.

01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:20.180
Alright, here we go.

01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.180
Loki, what did you say?

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:28.180
I actually said basically a baby bottle in a blanket because only babies would be scared

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.780
of Silent Hill yet, jackass.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780
Boo!

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780
Ouch.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.780
Burn!

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780
Ouch.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:35.780
Ouch.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.780
You guys are very cruel.

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:42.420
that's not a match. My answer was Rob better bring some Guinness because if I'm

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:47.760
drinking it's okay. It calms me down. Guinness goes well with everything. Meg Z

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.780
we're looking for Depends or adult or Depends or clean underwear. What'd you

01:06:50.780 --> 01:07:00.460
say? Pyramid head plushies. That's cute. I like the way you think Meg Z. Chris we

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:03.380
have another do we have another match what'd you say bring some? I said a

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.860
blanket a

01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:08.980
Blanket I get really really scared by those things. I'm a big pussy, too

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:18.300
Here I don't know if I want the lesbian on the show to be talking about what a big

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:25.020
Yes, you did um let's go back to the scoreboard where DMN has two points and

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:31.660
23rd Magus has one point so Magus you're black and behind you got two more questions to catch up you ready

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:32.660
Ready?

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.660
Sure.

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:34.660
Alright, here we go.

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:36.060
Here comes question number four.

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:38.180
Question number four.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.940
And I apologize for this after the earlier rant, but these match game questions were

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:42.940
written in advance.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:48.340
Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently, yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.660
What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled

01:07:52.660 --> 01:08:01.260
he said about Adam Sessler, man, does that guy need blank.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.180
jack thompson said about adam sesler after that interview man that guy meets

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.820
blank

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:13.820

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.620

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:47.080
here it is we got our answer alright

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.880
Jack Thompson was on attack at the show recently yelling back and forth with

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.860
Adam Sessler we didn't see though is after the interview jacks feathers were

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.680
so ruffled

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:58.200
he said about Adam Sessler, man does that guy need what?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.280
Magus? Yowie. Yowie!

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.280
Wow, Chris Amazy gasped at that answer

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.240
I think that might be a bad sign though because that usually means they

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:09.960
didn't think of it

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:12.960
DMN says that guy needs

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:17.840
to get laid, says DMN. Let's see if there's any matches here in studio

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.960
DarkSakura, what was your answer? A good ass-hammering

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:24.600
A good ass-hammering. Is that a match with to get laid?

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:29.320
yeah to match with to get laid do you think it's book it do you think it's no

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.000
cuz actually honestly it's a half point on the yaoi side because he would be the

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.640
recipient instead of watching it let's give a half point to each we'll give a

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:40.960
half point to each how's that sound why only point to either one yeah let's do

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.560
that is actually getting laid that is technically getting late all right well

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:50.800
this is getting laid none well we'll have to give it to DMN sorry maggots but

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.360
we'll give you a half point unless they've got a mirror up or something

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:54.360
Alright.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.360
But I didn't specify.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360
That's the ruling of the judges.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.360
So be it.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.360
Loki.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.360
Um.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.680
He needs to get shot in the face because, wow!

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680
Shot in the face.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:05.680
Don't hold back, Loki.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.840
Well, that's because, you know, Jack Thompson says all gamers need...

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840
Oh!

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:10.840
Okay.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.840
Okay.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.840
Okay.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:13.840
Good.

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.840
That'd be irony right there.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.840
Good justification.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:16.840
Alright.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.840
Um.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.840
Not a match, though.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840
My answer was man.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.840
Does Adam Sessler need...personality was my answer.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:22.840
Personality.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.480
unfortunately not a match

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:31.280
state enough period was he talked with the big c

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.640
it's adam sessler man does he need to sit on a tack to sit on a tack

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.640

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.260
this year we

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.040
maybe

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.880

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:51.080
all right i think that i i'm sorry kevin i didn't mean it

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:53.680
You're still cute. Alright, Chris.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.520
I actually said butt sex, which is...

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.160
Butt sex would yow with to get laid, so...

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:02.000
Come on, come on, come on. That would be yow. Yes, yes.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.880
I was thinking of yow, but...

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.840
Okay, okay. So we'll give 23 Magus another half point. So Magus has two points...

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.000
It doesn't involve a paddle, does it?

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.160
Magus has two points and DMN has four.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.160
What?

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:15.160
DMN is on it tonight.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.120
DMN is on it tonight. Alright, you have one...

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120
Surprise is butt sex!

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.500
You have one more chance

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:24.940
Magus, you ready? Here it is, the last question.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.400
Did you hear about yet another

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.760
new flap on the Wii? When asked for comment our dear pal Reggie told us

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.760
Oh, that last compartment. That's where you can store the blank.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.760
Celebrities are thinking. Ding! Jinks.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:12:01.760
Uh, Loki? Was that a ding? Ding. Alright, a ding. I'm just waiting on our, uh, chatroom

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.160
player there. Magus, don't give us your answer, but do you have one?

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:12.680
Yep.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.560
You gonna get two points with it? Because that's what you need.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.760
I don't know, can I?

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get smart with me, asshole, or you're gonna lose this game.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.200
Hey, someone has to be smarter around here.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:37.740
Oh, here we go, here it is, fifth question.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.440
Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.760
When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, oh that last compartment, that's

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.400
where you can store the trans vibrator.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.400
Okay, let's see

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:58.900
DMN says that's where you can store the saved money get it because the we see ah

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:06.880
Good answer good answer, but may not match because we're idiots apparently Dark Sakura. What'd you say lube?

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.760
You need some loop for your we

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:17.440
I don't know what you got planned for your we Dark Sakura. Okay, uh Loki

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.840
Where would a match game be without this answer?

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:24.440
That last compartment is the story of the Iraqi suicide babies.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:28.440
I was in on that joke when it started.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.640
Oh my god, that joke is like a hundred episodes old, literally.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:35.640
Wow, like nobody listening tonight is going to get that because all our old listeners are coming up.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.840
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on a second.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840
Yeah, we have our grandpa in our contest right now, Magus.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.140
Young whippersnappers?

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:43.640
Alright.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.840
Bite my ass.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.920
Here we go. My answer was

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.200
that's where you can store the weed.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.520
You put your weed in there.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.840
You put your weed in there. Get it?

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.040
Weed.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.120
Meganzie. Lesbian porn. Lesbian porn. Not a match.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:09.760
Chris. Drugs. Drugs!

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:14.680
Unfortunately, no points scored there, so let's look at the scoreboard and tally it

01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:15.680
up.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.280
Magus, you have two points, which is very good for Orange Lawn's Radio Match Game to

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.400
even get on the damn scoreboard.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:29.520
So you should be very proud of your effort, but unfortunately, DMN kicked your butt by

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.520
scoring four points.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520
He broke the record.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520
Yeah, he broke the record.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.520
The record was two and a half.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:38.640
All right, congratulations DMN, you're a winner and you get a space in our top eight

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640
on Myspace.

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.720
Bump Freeze Pop for you, because they have like 11 billion friends, they don't need

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:43.720
anymore.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:48.880
Magus, you get a clump of dirt as the runner-up prize, and we'll give that to you at the

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.880
next show, okay?

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.880
We've dusted in your backyard.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.840
Well, fine, no special gifts for you guys.

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840
Alright.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.640
Magus, anything you want to say while we have you on the line?

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.060
It's on, DMN.

01:15:01.060 --> 01:15:02.800
Another time, another place, it's on.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.120
Did you have fun on tonight's program?

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.240
Oh yeah, even though I did get served.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.720
You did get served, I'm sorry to say.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.720
I have fun and enjoy the dirt

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:15.200
Yes, dirt is good. All right. I hear it's it. I hear it's a growing investment

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.400
Hey dirt gator. Yeah, it's gay dirt because we all touched it. Oh, all right. Bye

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.760
No, no, all right

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.080
He gets a good old-fashioned orange lounge hanging up on at the end there for playing there

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.800
All right, so DMN is gonna earn a space in our top eight. What did you guys think?

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.480
Okay, I'm curious because we haven't done the game in a long time and our podcast audience hasn't really gotten to see the game

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.160
So I'm curious what what'd you guys think of the game? Was that fun? Was it stupid?

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.000
Was it a waste of your time? Give us feedback in chat and in mailbag. That's old-school ORR for you

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.720
It was a fun stupid waste of time

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.640
But anyway, we do still have a little more gaming news before we finish up the show

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.760
And of course, we're gonna open up the skype line very soon for your general calls. Loki. Yes

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.760
speaking of games and

01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.840
Anyways, we got to talk about Sony again

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.960
Why because we have to and we got to talk about the PSP and we got to talk about firmware updates

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:12.080
Because with PSP's firmware 2.8, there are some more problems.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:19.520
Not only is it Sony's latest attempt to stop Homebrew on the PSP, but guess what?

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.040
You may not be able to browse certain websites because now the brand new web browser not

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.240
only allows the developer to use the site to obtain specific information on how you

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:36.860
got to their website. More importantly, they can check what firmware you have and deny

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.440
you access based on that.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:44.680
I have a suggestion for the homebrew websites then. Put a keyword on your site that says

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:51.600
porcupine. Whenever anyone puts in porcupine, it brings up homebrew games.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:54.720
And all the information on porcupine she ever wanted to know.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.720
Put in porcupine in video game and there you go.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:02.740
So, but I mean

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:06.760
I assume that this is only for like manufacturer

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:10.780
websites or something like that. You know stuff that's pertaining to games.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.800
You know official sites and that kind of thing. Probably not gonna be if you're running

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:18.820
Flash games or something like that. Probably not gonna run into a problem with this. But

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:22.840
still I mean come on. What more do they really need to do

01:17:22.840 --> 01:17:28.240
to block stuff, I mean the web browser sucks as it is, and do we really need to deny people

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:33.760
more browsing on there? I don't know. More than likely anyways we wouldn't be able to

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.760
pull up the page you're trying to block anyways, so whatever.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:44.940
Alright, well I have one more story there, are you going to upgrade Loki? Or screw it,

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:50.200
I've got two, so yeah I can, okay. Alright we've got one more story for you guys, and

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:54.180
then we're gonna open up the skype line for general feedback so you can start

01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.040
hammering away there the username is orange lounge radio or you can always

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.040
call us on the landline nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven but please

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.400
keep in mind that's a toll call it's not an 800 call so if you're not paying the

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:11.920
bill mom is gonna get very angry with you says Meg Z and like less last night

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:18.960
all right sorry let's uh I want to do a story real quick here on dead or alive

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.960
There are some new details, and of course our in-house lesbians would love to hear some more details on Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, right?

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:36.960
It sounds like it will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show, and Japan's Famichu Magazine got a quick look at the game, and of course, you know, the trailer's online.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.960
Excluding Beach Volleyball, the game engine is mostly complete.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:43.960
For Beach Volleyball, we had the previous title, so we left it until the end.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:47.160
left it until the end but since we're at last finishing up the other areas we're

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.560
at the point where it's about time we start making the new beach volleyball and

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.280
that comes from Itagaki. Let's see, the real mode of playing DOAX2 is the

01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.800
vacation mode and this will string a bunch of games together. You start off

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:07.600
with a jet ski and an old camera. The camera takes pictures of the girls and

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.560
of course as you can imagine the jet skis uses jet skis so it's not going to be much

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:16.200
more than just volleyball, which is why they've dropped the name, Dead or Alive, and it looks

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.720
like Jamie is showing screenshots to our in-house lesbians.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.960
What do you think of Dead or Alive Xtreme 2?

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:27.640
I just got a boner.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:38.480
Even though I'm the gay guy and I'm fascinated with this game, I think it's great.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.240
You're also talking to lesbians who happen to be in graphic arts and are taking art classes

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:48.120
and just the colors and the skin tones.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:49.120
That's pretty...

01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.120
Yeah, I got a bone.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:59.000
All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what they have to say.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.720
We love interacting with our listeners and we're going to take some phone calls right

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720
now.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720
Who's this?

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720
Hello, can you hear me?

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720
Yes, who is this?

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.000
This is NintendoManiac64, I haven't called in a while.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.280
Hi NintendoManiac64, what's on your mind buddy?

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.720
A couple things. First off, Megsy

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:20.320
actually has a lot of similar interests to me, like she likes Nintendo games, and her opinion on

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.160
Sony is pretty much the same as mine. Sony, die.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:27.680
So a NintendoManiac agrees with you, it loves the Nintendo and Sony can go die.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.960
Yeah, Sony can suck my dick. Are you just trying to get points with the

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:32.640
lesbians?

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:41.840
What else is on your mind, buddy?

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.960
One thing I've been dying to ask you this, please don't hang up on me.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:51.760
Hey, guy, what do you think about straight sex?

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.900
Try a joke that's not like 30 years old on this program.

01:20:56.900 --> 01:21:00.880
I'm not going to hang up on you, but seriously, we have plenty of new jokes.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:04.960
to tonight's match game there's a lot there for those that have no idea what

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:09.520
we're talking about you've got to go back to like an old to go episode back

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.120

I just thought of that.

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:33.760
All right.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.760
I'm going to let you go, NintendoManiac64, but thanks for the call.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760
Okay.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.760
All right.

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.760
Good job failing.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.760
Boom!

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:41.760
Failed.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:49.840
He's a nice kid, but seriously, leave the inside jokes.

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.840
Hello.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.840
It's Raven's Dolphin.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.840
Well, hi, Raven's Dolphin.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840
I hadn't even said hello yet, but hi.

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840
How you doing?

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:55.840
What's on your mind?

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.640
more lesbians

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.640
you know what the lesbian gamers can have their own podcast as far as I'm

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.000
concerned

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.720
this reminds me of an episode of Raw, I'm sorry to bring up wrestling but

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.860
it just reminds me of like hot lesbian action just kissing and all kinds of

01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.600
craziness

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.940
look I want this on the record we're not doing that we're making the

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:18.560
lesbian thing kind of a joke tonight because you know

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:23.680
if we did really have like a hot lesbian podcast people would be like oh my god

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.880
I've got a boner da da da

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.360
but the reality is is that what we're really trying to do here is that you

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.680
know we're just gamers

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:34.600
of all types shapes sizes sexualities colors religions

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.600
it's just about the games and we just let you know we poke fun at each other

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.760
for you know some of those

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:42.200
other stereotypes but I I love how this show can show

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.360
that there's all different types of gamers and we all get along

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.520
you know our chat room is very diverse so

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.160
that being said are you guys ever gonna make out tonight?

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.560
No, I'm kidding. Make out! It's radio. Alright, seriously, do you have anything gaming related you want to share?

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.360
Yeah, they were talking about the PSP being like a big paperweight.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.360
Ah, what do you think? I think different. I love my PSP.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.320
Why do you love your PSP? Well, I don't own an iPod

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.480
and the Apple Store didn't open up yet, so I'm still stuck with it

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.320
for a while. Yeah, like Chris is all, where do you live? I live in New Jersey.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:22.600
they just don't understand. There's no

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:26.000
Apple Store in New Jersey? There is but it's like

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.840
two hours away and they're opening one on the boardwalk where I live

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:33.600
so it's like heaven finally. Oh okay.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.240
So but you're not using it sounds like you don't really use your PSP as a

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.260
gaming device you use it as an MP3 player primarily.

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:43.880
Yeah I use it for everything mostly. Hmm interesting okay.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:47.740
I'd like to kind of try to redeem myself about my

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:59.740
you know, comments about Sony, don't get me wrong, I hate them, but, uh, the, the PSP, uh, it's, it's a, it's a good system if you're looking for it to do all that stuff, but, since, but like...

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.740
But you, you're, you're straight up games. You want games.

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:07.740
Yeah, I want, if I'm gonna buy, if I'm gonna drop $250 on a gaming system, I want it to play games.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:11.740
Alright, are you gonna buy Star Fox Command for the DS?

01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:12.740
Maybe.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:13.740
Are you a Star Fox fan?

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.740
Um, not so much.

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740
Oh, okay.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:21.340
But I can't wait to get my hands on that thing, I love it.

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:24.260
So you have a little love for DS and PSP then?

01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:28.700
I do, I own two DS's and I own two DSP's.

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.660
Now you're just a hardcore nerd.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.460
I like you!

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.460
Chris likes you.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:35.460
I like you.

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:40.660
Oh yay, yay, love from lesbians, I'm not going to die happy.

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.580
By the way Raven's Dolphin, no offense, but that's the only time in your entire life you're

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.540
going to get a lesbian to say that to you, just so you know.

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:52.420

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:59.100

with a really witty retort there about me bashing on nerds blaze sky again you

01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:18.780
You are hosting a podcast about gaming.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780
Good point.

01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780
Good point.

01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.780
I am pretty hardcore in my nerd-im.

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.860
Orensons Radio, who's this?

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.540
This is Black Boy, James.

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.900
Hi, Black Boy James.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:27.900
What's on your mind?

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:30.580
I had a question about the PSP.

01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:33.740
Okay, what did you want to know?

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:38.540
Their firmware updates, they include something else, like something to enhance the functionality

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:42.380
of the PSP, and I was just curious, was there anything like that with this update?

01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:44.680
Loki, you're my man for the PSP updates.

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.680
What do you think?

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:51.320
Well 2.8 was video podcast RSS oh this is that one.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:57.840
So you can watch the one up show on your PSP yippity yay hooray or you can watch hope is

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.440
Okay maybe maybe I'll do that or maybe me and Gregor will go find a pizza box to live

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.440
in.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.240
All right, so does that sound worth it to you, black boy?

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.720
Not really.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.720
I didn't think so.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.680
Just use iTunes for your podcasting needs.

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680
Yes, seriously.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.520
I use my iPod for my podcasts.

01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:29.300
Oh, you're fancy enough to own a color video iPod.

01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:30.300
I'm too broke, unfortunately.

01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.300
I have the old school one.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:32.300
Yeah, I have an old school iPod.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:33.300
It was like a smooth gift to myself.

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:34.300
I have Kristin's.

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:39.440
Anything else you wanted to share with our listeners?

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.760
I do, actually.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:46.020
I wanted to say to your guests tonight that they get major love and win for being lesbians

01:26:46.020 --> 01:26:49.460
and not frightening me.

01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:52.180
You don't mind me saying, you're a gay gamer, correct?

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.180
I am.

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.460
I know that because you're on All Games Interactive all the time and they pick on you so horribly

01:26:56.460 --> 01:26:57.460
for that.

01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:58.460
I'm so sorry.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:02.540
Every time I listen to freaking Ron, I cringe.

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.520
Anyway, no, I love Ron, but seriously, he needs to stop all the gay jokes.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.520
I don't love Ron.

01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.520
I know, we all do.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:12.800
I can't wait to come back to Arena and have more Ron love.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:13.800
Not like that!

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:14.800
Not like that!

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:18.040
I'd pay money for that.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.160
Are you loving our friend Black Boy here?

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160
I do.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:26.280
Keep in mind, most of the extreme lesbian jokes that we've been doing have been just

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280
that.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.280
Just jokes.

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:29.480
We're fully clothed.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:36.720
I know that's disappointing, but we are cuddling if you want to keep it.

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.720
But I like you.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.880
Thank you. Alright. I like you too.

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.680
See, it's like that old rumor is being proven wrong tonight.

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.240
Lesbians and gays can get along. Who the hell started that?

01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:53.240
My first boyfriend was gay and I loved him.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.520
No, I think some of my boyfriends are probably gay too.

01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:01.400
We gotta take some more calls here, try to get it back to games.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:03.680
Thank you Black Boy for your call. We really appreciate it, okay?

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:07.240
Thank you. Tell the folks at Arena we said hi. I will.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.860
later. Alright, let's go to one more call here on the Skype line.

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:15.120
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Good evening, this is DMN.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:18.160
DMN, congratulations on your match game win earlier this evening.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.800
Yeah, apparently the 23rd Meg is once my neck now.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.800
Well, he'll get over it. What did you all want to say tonight?

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:29.240
I am bitching about World of Warcraft.

01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.880
Why? You're not a big fan of this new news?

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:36.200
Well, I've never been a fan of World of Warcraft.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:41.840
Mainly more so because I've got a roommate who's very hardcore into it and I don't understand

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:47.880
why it takes them almost two years to release an update to the damn game when, you know,

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.280
pretty much everybody and their mom's at the highest level.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:54.000
World of Warcraft though, it patches all the frickin' time.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.520
Yeah, but there's a difference between a patch and an expansion, I mean patches just adjust

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:02.400
certain things and piss certain people off, you have an expansion it's a whole new way

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.180
of opening things up, if you just do a patch it's the same map.

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.180
There's nothing new.

01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:11.140
But they're not changing anything with this DMN, they're only, I mean they're adding new

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:15.100
stuff that's going to have a slightly different spin to it.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:21.140
True, but I don't see anything about it, they're saying, oh you can go up to level what, 70

01:29:21.140 --> 01:29:22.140
now?

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:24.300
I'm like, I don't care, it's 10 more levels.

01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:29.500
Druunami in our chat room, your good pal after tonight's match game battle says, WoW doesn't

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:32.300
end at 60, patches add content.

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:36.900
Okay, well like I said, I don't play it, so I don't know.

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.620
I just know the basics, I know 60's the highest, blah blah blah.

01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:42.740
Is there any MMO you do enjoy?

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:49.040
Uh, Gunbound, but that's not really an MMO anymore.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.860
But no, I'm not a huge fan of MMOs.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:57.360
I'm intrigued by the, I guess, the society within them, but not a fan of playing them

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.360
now.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360
Alright.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:02.200
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.840
I am I was born in Wisconsin today so to hear somebody else from Wisconsin on the

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.280

internet are about to write us the hate mail

Thank you.

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:16.780
Rob. Rob. Rob.

01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:17.780
Yes. What? What? What? What?

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:18.780
Rob. Rob. Rob.

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.780
What?

01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:20.780
What?

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:21.780
Rob.

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.780
I'm gonna cut you.

01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:23.780
Promise?

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:24.780
Oh, baby.

01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:25.780
With that pyramid head plushie of love.

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.780
Ooh!

01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.780
Any last minute stories tonight?

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:29.780
Loki.

01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:30.780
Oh, I got one.

01:31:30.780 --> 01:31:32.780
And then Darkstalker, you have one too?

01:31:32.780 --> 01:31:33.780
Um, no.

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:34.780
Okay, well Loki then.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:35.780
Okie dokie.

01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:40.780
Of course, would it be without a show where we talk about what's coming out in Xbox Live's

01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:43.780
arcade or demos?

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:52.460
Viva La Revolution, or better just cause, the demo's coming out on the 24th of August,

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:56.100
and actually the game looks pretty sweet, it's kind of Grand Theft Auto meets Far Cry

01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:01.420
Another thing though is we know that the F.E.A.R. demo is coming soon and the rumor is it's

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:06.700
going to be in the next official Xbox magazine. The reason we know this is because somebody

01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:12.340
who posted this on Xboxic.com noticed that their friend is playing the demo and showed

01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:18.720
him on live playing the demo. So it is coming soon. Other news, of course, Atari has finally

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.460
picked up Bullet Witch to distribute it in the US. So that's always good because that

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:29.300
looked awesome. And then, of course, SHINee has announced that they're doing a free MMO

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:34.700
called Two Moons, which is supposed to be the most violent MMO to date, which is gonna

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:41.700
be awesome. And then, finally, the best part about this, you're gonna love this, um, according

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:48.480
to Game Daily Biz, uh, production company Project 51 has snatched up the rights to do

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:52.760
an anime version of Castlevania.

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:56.940
My god! I think three sets of panties just got wet.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:00.640
All in that succession here.

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.320
Gross!

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.800
I don't know, did that get picked up by the mics? Could you folks hear that at home?

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:10.920
That just collective gas

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:15.920
of pure fanboy orgasm, or fangirl?

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.480
What is it? We also got one from Sauce. Wow.

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.840
Also, real quickly, I just want to cover this too.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.720
There is a, this was actually reported on Kotaku.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:32.000
There is a guy, a fanboy here, who's doing

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.360
a short film adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:40.080
Yes! That person just wins the internet. You win your own slice of the internet

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:40.800
just for you.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:45.520
And the adoration of lesbians everywhere. So that's pretty awesome. It says

01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:56.440
It's basically part of this Project TV short film contest, and the competition is going

01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.560
to be taking place, I guess, until September 1st, and there's going to be three rounds

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:02.560
of voting.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.720
So, if you're interested in checking it out, you can actually find more information on

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.760
website Game First, who it looks like ran this story originally.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:14.200
So it's gamefirst.com slash, um,

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:17.520
well, you can just find it on gamesfirst.com. It wasn't

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.480
posted too long ago. And check that out. The other thing... Wait, wait. A couple comments from

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:24.480
chat I want to share real quick before we get into too many topics. Tigerclaw says,

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.600
anime version of Castlevania. I read that Paul W.S. Anderson will direct the

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:28.960
live-action movie though. So,

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.200
like, Castlevania going to these different, these different franchises.

01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.320
Wow.

01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:38.760
Hey, there went the explicit guy.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:41.640
Oh, anyway, one other quick thing. SSJ100Matt would like to say,

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:45.680
I haven't heard a gamergasm like that since Snake being in Smash Brothers.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.440
A gamergasm, I love it.

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:53.280
Snakes on the game? Shit.

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:59.080

we're coining tonight.

01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:03.320
Alright, anyway. Sorry, Logie. The last one I had,

01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:07.240
I actually saw this last week and I'm trying to find the exact link I had

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:10.320
basically what it was is they were also doing

01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.120
a live-action version this was also fan done of Devil May Cry

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.680
and it's being done by some Japanese guy so it was kind of neat

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.120
alright lots of fan service out there

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:24.080

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.320

Our chat room wants us to mention the Grand Theft Auto Coca Cola ad.

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.560
If you haven't seen this on YouTube, it's kind of interesting.

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:35.540
We were watching this just before the show tonight.

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:41.500
There's this CGI ad, it's like a coke ad with the Grand Theft Auto characters.

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:42.500
It's kind of interesting.

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.020

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:05.260
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.380

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.820
