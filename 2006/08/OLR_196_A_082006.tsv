14323	16326	Tonight, August 20th, 2006.
16607	18971	Is 1080p really the future?
19331	20653	Microsoft fakes to differ.
21114	23899	What do Wii preview parties have in common with raves?
24420	26143	Whatever happened to the Phantom anyway?
32722	33603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
52082	52783	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
73032	73532	Really?
73672	81375	Oh, that's right, you built, now long time listeners of Orange Lounge Radio remember back in the day you built your own cabinet to play, like what, a main cabinet basically, right?
81415	81955	Basically, yeah.
82356	83416	And why did you destroy it?
83556	84056	It's too big.
84536	85017	Too big?
85697	88598	Need the room for the 37 inch LCD TV.
88778	91159	So about how much money would you say ended up getting burned?
92539	94760	Only a couple hundred, most of it was in the buttons.
95200	95461	I see.
96141	101523	Alright, well also joining us tonight, say hello to an old friend of our show, say hello to Miklatov.
102540	102900	Hi.
103000	103741	How you doing, Miklatov?
104402	104942	Oh, I'm good.
105202	105502	Good.
106223	110867	Miklatov happens to work for Konami, but he's not here as an employee of Konami.
110907	111687	He's here as a gamer.
112508	113669	I don't play video games.
113729	114650	Which is kind of the issue.
114690	116451	I just saw you playing one like two minutes ago.
116471	117492	But that doesn't count.
117712	118033	I see.
118593	123217	I have to say that because we actually have Konami-related news tonight that's pretty big, so I have to remember to distinguish that.
123237	126479	I know, but I know everything about Konami, so... Oh, really?
127000	127260	Yes.
127340	128481	You can't share any of it on here?
129721	130161	I'm just kidding.
130241	130402	No.
130642	131082	I'm teasing.
131583	131823	I know.
132123	135746	Alright, also say hello to an old favorite of our program.
135786	137647	Say hello to Drew Nami.
138348	139169	Hey, what's up?
140910	141531	Not a whole lot.
141571	142171	How are you doing?
143432	144113	Uh, fair good.
144133	144573	Hey.
145334	146114	Give me a mic, dammit.
146134	147535	Give me that mic.
147776	148056	Sheesh.
148956	149237	Alright.
149617	150718	A little mic confusion.
151278	151719	There we go.
151999	152259	Alright.
152599	153100	How are you doing?
153500	154021	Uh, fair.
154641	159485	A little bit of gaming to speak of, but I think we'll save that to gaming weeks.
159778	161019	Alright, well let's get to it.
161399	162320	Let's start with Loki.
162360	163481	How was your gaming week?
164242	164942	My week was good.
165483	172648	I played Dead Rising, which is still fun, but it gets progressively harder later in the game.
175130	177412	Then, what else did I play?
177993	181536	I just got done playing the Bad Day LA demo on PC.
182236	186059	That's really cool looking, except I don't like the fact that I have to save a lot of people.
186319	187821	I'm not a fan of saving people.
187841	189442	I'm more a fan of beating them to death.
191798	194785	That's going to take a little bit of getting used to, but I am looking forward to the game.
194865	197591	It's supposed to be coming, I guess, later this week or next week or something.
197711	197992	I don't know.
198519	199319	So, should be cool.
199739	205280	That's also part of my problem with Dead Rising, really, is that I don't like saving people, I like to kill them in game.
205300	207021	Well, they're fucking stupid, okay?
207061	208841	They are fucking stupid in Dead Rising.
208881	219684	I tried saving these people, they were trapped in a store, and they wanted, like, to get to safety, so I'm like, you know, follow me, and they're sitting there, like, beating up a zombie, then all of a sudden, like, five zombies jump on them and eat them.
219704	221504	I'm like, you're a dumb idiot.
222024	223884	Well, fucking listen to me, or die.
224205	226045	Apparently, you chose death, so...
227099	227699	Fuck you!
228120	232883	So the next time I ran past that section when I reloaded the game again, I said, Fuck them!
232923	233524	They can die!
234184	234804	And that's what they did.
235425	241249	Or of course, I'll come by and break down the door so the zombies have an easier chance of getting them.
243110	244111	Alright, anything else that you played?
244912	248154	I want to say I played Chromehounds, but I don't think I did.
249378	249798	Okay.
251479	252659	I'll talk about my gaming week.
252799	256500	I played Dead Rising a little more because, you know, killing zombies is a lot of fun.
257541	258361	I got a little bit further.
258381	262022	I finally figured out the secret to kill that very first boss that kept slicing me.
262462	264163	Or actually, I should say shooting me because he has a gun.
264443	267264	And I sliced him because Loki showed me where to find the katana.
267284	270465	So that made me very happy because it made fighting that first boss a hell of a lot easier.
270865	273386	So now I'm having more fun just running around doing random things.
273888	274728	The game reminds me of Golden Axe.
302563	303263	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
321872	322973	Thank you for watching!
345306	348609	Fireboma says Sky Kingdom Hearts 2 was a button masher too, but it had a story.
370117	372519	Yeah, 99 Nights has a story too, though.
372559	378503	I mean, granted, Kingdom Hearts 2 has a really great in-depth story, and 99 Nights is a little bit, you know, kind of generic.
378543	381485	But it looks really pretty, and the story's not bad.
381545	383226	I can think of games that had worse stories.
383726	390851	So, I mean, I would call 99 Nights a slightly above average game.
390951	396194	And the only kind of genre, well, I guess there's Dynasty Warriors, but considering that's just like a straight-up port,
396553	402716	I'd say it's really the only kind of game of its genre really, truly available for next-gen right now.
403056	404556	And I think it's worth a look.
405217	408658	I think there's an audience of people that this game is really for.
409118	410299	An audience of people.
410699	410979	What?
412039	413780	An audience of people, not a audience of people.
413800	414180	Whatever.
414660	417081	Thank you, Grammar Miklatov, Professor Guy.
417281	418042	You're welcome.
418442	421143	Well, then how was your gaming week, so I can criticize the way you talk about it?
421742	427184	Um, well, I've been playing a couple things I'm not allowed to talk about, and one's really frustrating and I hate it.
427604	434427	But other than that, the only game I really play at all anymore is Suikoden II, and I play it at work on my breaks.
434827	438768	And I leave it on, so I've amassed about 700 hours on the game now.
439729	440089	So...
440854	441735	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
459571	460392	and that's all I play.
460712	464015	Now do you watch me play some of those games on 360 like Prey and Dead Rising?
464035	465316	What do you think of some of those ones you've been watching?
465416	466477	Prey's pretty cool.
467758	468718	It's kind of creepy.
469559	476965	I think I could enjoy it on a computer because I don't like using console controllers for FPSs.
478026	487053	99 Nights I was really excited about and then I saw it and I was really disappointed because it looks like a really bland Samurai Warriors or Dynasty Warriors game
488028	491349	and... That's pretty bad seeing as Dynasty Warriors is pretty bland as it is.
491369	492829	I like Dynasty Warriors.
492870	497391	I like 99 Nights and then I look at Dynasty Warriors and I go, I like 99 Nights.
497411	505073	The environments in 99 Nights just are so bland and you're always fighting the same enemy and you can't even tell half the time if...
505871	511654	There's still an enemy on screen because your stupid comrades are all grouped around it.
511694	516317	It's like a hundred of your friends around one enemy, so you have to wade your way through them just to find it.
516337	519759	You magically swing your sword and it only hits the bad guys.
520940	522480	I'll forgive that, though.
522801	525762	Again, look at games like Golden Axe, Ninja Turtles.
525802	527823	You never hit your friends magically.
527923	529784	That's what this game is to me.
529845	532246	It's a souped-up, old-school beat-em-up.
532706	534447	There were games where you could hit your friends.
534727	536368	There were, like Double Dragon, right?
536849	538830	Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could do that in one of the Double Dragon games.
538850	540571	Double Dragon was fun to throw people in the pits.
540711	541252	That's what we need.
541272	545594	We need a Simpsons next-gen arcade game that looks like 99 Nights, but it's the Simpsons.
546675	547496	That would be pretty awesome.
547516	549317	That would be...score.
549717	551118	Maybe that'll be on Wii's virtual console.
551138	552098	You know what would be awesome?
552138	555861	Cardboard Tube Samurai done 99 Nights style.
555901	557542	That would be fucking sweet.
558986	567350	I guess the other game you had was Dead Rising, and zombie games actually frightened me, but it was funny at times, but I don't think I could bring myself to play it.
567370	570491	Did you like the part where I wore the little kid's outfit and the big teddy bear mask?
572293	575034	If you mean creeped out by it, then yes.
575234	576634	I liked it a whole lot.
576774	582555	My favorite was going to the women's store and getting the dress with the big bright pink flowers on it and then putting on sunglasses.
582675	583095	That was awesome.
583115	584075	That was pretty funny.
584155	587176	Or when you changed your hair gray in the cosmetic store.
587456	591096	But the greatest is that whatever costume you're wearing carries on into the cut scenes.
591416	595817	So it's really funny to be wearing the flowery dress in the cut scenes where he's trying to act all badass.
595837	599018	Yeah, when he was leaning up against the wall like he was some sort of prostitute.
599078	600358	That was pretty awesome.
601229	603411	And that part had no zombies, so I was okay with it.
603671	603951	Alright.
604391	605232	Are you afraid of zombies?
605512	606052	Yes, I am.
606252	608314	You need someone to hold your hand when you play zombie games?
608554	610755	I can't think of someone who works at Taco Bell.
610835	612156	Alright, anyway, moving on.
613257	615378	Going over to Drew Nami.
615659	617340	Drew, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
617480	619401	Oh, I haven't exactly been on the cutting edge lately.
620022	626106	I've been playing... I finished Fable as a little goody two-shoes, now I'm replaying it...
627245	632710	as some big, badass, evil, bisexual, screwing around, fucking around, whatever.
632750	634291	Which was the best part of Fable, really?
634511	636493	Otherwise, it was just pretty much your standard, you know.
637634	651707	Uh, I'd have to say the different kind of weapons that you can use, uh, and different kind of, uh, I don't know, relationship you can have with, uh, the townsfolk, which, admittedly, is not much, but, uh, it's still kind of cool.
653048	653148	Uh,
653880	656361	I've been brushing on my beat mania lately.
656941	658582	I haven't been doing too much of that.
658602	661983	I actually took the time to put my scores in on rankings.
662823	663964	Again, not very impressive.
665144	666664	Playing a little bit more Atelier Iris.
666784	667445	Almost beat it.
669045	669946	Been going back to Prey.
670086	670846	Finally beat it.
671426	672907	Ending was very cool.
673067	673347	You know what?
673407	675507	All things considered, though, Prey doesn't take that long to beat.
675608	676668	It's a pretty short game.
676708	682130	I mean, if I was a little more hardcore about it and could play games for a long time in one setting, I could have beat it in a day.
682470	682630	Yeah.
682650	682730	Yeah.
683018	685640	Yeah, it's pretty easy too, you can't die.
685660	686942	Yeah, you don't ever really die.
688563	698071	And for some reason I picked up Mega Man X Command Mission after like two months of not playing it, and I've just been blowing through it just like five hours straight.
698752	699453	No reason at all.
700253	700574	Alright.
700674	703136	But it's a fairly good RPG.
704077	704157	Okay.
704177	704277	Okay.
705546	712032	Alright, well, that's it for everybody's gaming week, and I noticed some folks in chat are kind of talking a little bit about their gaming weeks there.
712112	713413	But we don't care about them.
713613	716075	No, I'm curious what folks are there playing.
716776	718818	DJ Dark Knight is playing SOCOM 3, I think.
719078	719538	See?
719638	720099	Don't care.
722340	723901	Well, we don't have time to play everything.
723961	725301	We're just, what, four people?
725341	726061	There's too many games.
726262	728122	How many new games do they release every week?
728182	729943	But how many of them are worth playing?
730083	730863	That's true.
731243	734104	There's like maybe one a month.
734124	735484	But everybody's into something different, right?
735524	738105	You know, if I didn't have a job, I'd be playing tons of games.
740166	740486	I wouldn't.
740546	741486	I hate video games.
743427	744747	Isn't that what you do all day now?
745327	745907	For now.
746588	747468	All right, anyway.
748496	751237	Let's go to some housekeeping stuff really quick.
751657	753577	We wanted to mention the Chromehounds tourney.
754877	759659	Remember how we were going back and forth with Bobby Blackwolf about we're going to kick your ass, you're going to kick our ass, or whatever?
760739	763279	We couldn't get enough people to participate in the Chromehounds thing.
763399	768040	I don't know if folks just, like, our listener base isn't really into this game or what, but we couldn't get enough people.
768421	774422	And I guess, I don't know, I wasn't really following, but I guess maybe there was shenanigans going on somewhere else in the tournament, so...
775282	777083	It got cancelled, so it never really happened.
777123	780605	So we never got to put OL Army versus Bobby to the test.
780965	791009	So maybe another time, I think what we'll do right now, focus on building up the presence of Orange Lounge Radio listeners in different games on the OL Army, and then we'll take people on in tournaments.
791029	796052	Personally, I would like to see something more along the lines of, say, Saints Row when that comes out.
796432	798833	Not necessarily a team deathmatch type thing, but just...
799860	808364	Last Man Standing, just get a bunch of people from All Games, get some of us, get some other people, and just have everyone kill each other.
809144	810325	I like that kind of stuff.
810345	818229	So it would answer the age-old classic OLR question of, if all the members of Orange Launch Radio got into a battle royale, who would survive?
818509	823871	You guys are just fucking lucky that they haven't put out a Grand Theft Auto yet that's online, because I would fucking kill everybody.
824051	825172	That sounds like the throwdown to me.
825512	826493	That is the throwdown.
826694	833282	I know that because I've been owning my peeps at work for, what, almost a year now?
833963	835645	Yeah, I think we could do that.
836328	836648	Bring it.
837409	838769	I've got a year on everybody.
839149	842251	Doesn't Rumble Roses XX have a mode like that?
842291	844592	The four chicks beating each other up?
844832	846213	Yeah, it does.
846373	847413	See, we can do that.
847974	848794	We should all get Rumble.
849154	851515	Rumble Roses XX will be $20 any day now.
851555	851876	Come on.
852576	853596	How many people actually bought that game?
853636	855277	Do you really want to waste $20, though?
856298	857478	I bought... Oh, no, wait.
857518	858139	I didn't buy the game.
858259	858959	I got it for free.
858999	859659	Thank you, Konami.
859679	861060	That's not worth it either.
863501	865082	I want to borrow that if you never play it.
865754	866354	I don't play it.
866414	868276	I want to spend some time with chick wrestlers.
868336	869136	Come on, it's fun.
869416	874699	I basically popped it in, played with the boob adjustment little dial on there and got bored of it.
874739	875320	That's about it.
875980	881163	Blackwolf's in chat right now, our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who also does a show Sunday nights over at allgames.com.
881964	883585	Loki does not play well with others.
883705	885025	He can't handle a team game.
885646	886746	That's probably about right.
888127	888908	Yep.
889168	890329	Okay, at least he admits it.
892814	894415	Like Zim from Invader Zim.
894475	897457	We need to do like a... We started destroying when we were on our own planet.
898077	898358	So?
898458	902320	I wish we could do like a World of Warcraft, like I wish we could have like a private battlegrounds.
902380	903121	Wouldn't that be fun?
904161	915509	Actually, they're going to have, they had a little meet World of Warcraft Insider that they posted up saying that in the expansion they're going to have an arena and you can field your own teams.
915909	916069	Hmm.
916784	918105	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
937068	937969	DDR Power Previews Xbox DDR Games
956289	965138	We're going to announce a partnership with Konami to promote upcoming Dance Dance Revolution titles on the Xbox and Xbox 360 platforms with exclusive song premieres.

983790	991473	These new Power Courses not only feature a stream of non-stop dancing arrows, but seamlessly mixed non-stop music.
992054	999417	Longtime fans of the DDR series will recognize this feature as something similar to a non-stop mode featured in the Japanese-only arcade release
999773	1015622	Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000 Dance Dance Revolution Universe, the first game in the DDR series for the Xbox 360 also scheduled for the fourth quarter of 06 will also contain this new power mode with a completely different lineup of courses for initially available
1016138	1021802	Speed, Sync, and Quad Modes are some of the other additional features both games will contain in the Party Mode.
1022262	1041014	Beginning Sunday, September 3rd, Orange Lounge Radio will be offering exclusive first listens of the new Power Courses each week on Sunday nights, along with bonus V-Rare track previews from the Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 V-Rare and the Dance Dance Revolution Universe V-Rare.
1041414	1047136	The music will be debuted during our live broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio Live right here, 6 o'clock Pacific Time.
1047696	1055780	These preview listens will be rebroadcast on the syndicated run of Orange Lounge Radio Live airing on All Games Radio the following Monday at 5 p.m.
1055820	1057760	Pacific Time and Tuesday at 9 a.m.
1057800	1058421	Pacific Time.
1058801	1061882	Now these preview listens are exclusive to the live broadcast.
1062262	1067944	As you can imagine, due to copyright reasons, they will not be available as the podcast or on the podcast.
1067964	1069364	So you have to listen live to hear it.
1069624	1070905	But we're really excited about this.
1070985	1074966	I mean, we've been covering DDR news for a long, long time.
1075386	1081588	So being able to kind of play a part in rolling out new songs for all you guys to hear is really exciting.
1081728	1083449	So we're going to be starting that in two weeks.
1084389	1085809	I've already heard them all.
1086249	1087270	Well, you're special.
1087310	1087770	That's why.
1088740	1092865	So have I, ha ha ha, but we'll be playing them for you guys pretty soon.
1092925	1093706	Very excited about it.
1093726	1096509	You guys can almost be as cool as us, that means.
1097250	1099593	I'll be blasting them in my car, ha ha ha.
1099993	1102156	Who says I already don't if I had a car?
1102556	1103317	Doesn't matter, no.
1103357	1108043	Alright, anyway, before we do this thing here, are you guys anything...
1108775	1110076	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1134284	1135445	That's a lie.
1135505	1143449	Because I'm like, okay, usually in a 75 song list, there's got to be at least, you know, a few that you don't like, but there's a few that you love.
1146470	1147571	Somebody's muting me.
1147791	1148711	I don't even understand that.
1148871	1149431	Ah, forget it.
1149451	1150032	Yeah, I know.
1150112	1150412	All right.
1151232	1151753	So anyway.
1152013	1152793	You go, DMN.
1153593	1158516	All right, we'll be starting that on Sunday, September 3rd, right here live on Orange Lounge Radio.
1158556	1159476	We're excited about that.
1159776	1162758	Yeah, Cutters points out that they were also in solo bass mix.
1163072	1163712	Oh, that's right, true.
1163732	1166754	SoloBase had like half as many as Solo 2000.
1166894	1168914	Solo 2000 added like four more.
1168954	1170395	I keep forgetting about SoloBase.
1170515	1172416	I had only ever played Solo 2000.
1172476	1176778	I think they still have a SoloBase machine down at the Folsom bowling alley over here.
1176878	1177118	Really?
1177138	1177538	That's pretty cool.
1177558	1178318	It was awful.
1179619	1183100	Yeah, I think they had one at, what, the local Walmart for a little while.
1183680	1184641	That got taken away a long time ago.
1184661	1185621	Yeah, that got taken out.
1186181	1189303	I think it moved to the Folsom bowling alley.
1189863	1190903	That's where they got theirs from.
1191704	1191984	Anyways...
1193908	1200670	So yeah, I think we'll start off the show with some wonderful exclusive stuff that you're not going to hear anywhere else, at least not yet.
1202371	1204531	Starting off with some price drops.
1205271	1211253	Far Cry and Six Predator, yet another game on the 360s, dropped down to $39.99, so that's always good.
1212094	1223037	And also now we have a date for Dead or Alive Extreme 2, which is going to be hitting this holiday season right before Black Friday on November 22nd.
1224019	1225140	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1247771	1256857	Now one thing that was mentioned on GameStop this week, they pointed out a Devil May Cry 5th Anniversary Collection coming out on the PlayStation 2.
1256917	1265803	That is going to be coming out for $39.99 retail on October 25th and it features Devil May Cry 1 through 3.
1266603	1269365	However, they missed a little bit of information on that.
1269830	1283134	There's also a Resident Evil 10th Anniversary Collection coming out on the GameCube, which will be featuring Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 4, also for $39.99, also coming out on the 25th of October.
1284255	1294538	And now for you fans of new colors for systems, you'll be happy to know that the PlayStation 2 Slim is getting a new color.
1295018	1297299	It's coming out in silver now.
1299408	1304091	I guess that way you can coordinate your PlayStation 2 Slim with your upcoming PlayStation 3.
1305052	1308694	And that will also be hitting stores October 25th.
1310015	1315699	Also coming out on the 31st, Xbox 360 is going to be getting a peripheral bundle.
1316339	1318681	No news yet on what exactly is in that.
1319501	1325385	Speaking of bundles, PSP is also getting a new bundle called the Digital Entertainment Pack.
1325405	1326386	It's coming out September 20th.
1328207	1329128	for $249.99.
1329588	1341534	It'll include the core system, a 1GB memory stick, the Lords of Dogtown UMD movie, and ATV Offroad Fury Pro Blazing Trails.
1342175	1348418	So apparently this is, you know, a great deal or something, but that's going to be coming out September 20th.
1349098	1353961	And then finally, I've got some news that'll make any DDR fan a little bit sad.
1353981	1354021	Um,
1355219	1359841	And that is information about the brand new Saturday Morning series called Dance Revolution.
1360522	1364684	And it will feature this group called the Slumber Party Girls.
1365744	1371707	Anyways, this is actually coming from an industry magazine called Home Media Retailing.
1372268	1381372	It says Dick Entertainment and Geffen Records have partnered to create Slumber Party Girls, a five-member... Is it just wrong to me that Dick Entertainment is producing this?
1381753	1383674	I mean, about Slumber Party Girls?
1384134	1384474	Yeah, exactly.
1384918	1385778	It's slightly wrong.
1386399	1386779	Anyway.
1387159	1394963	From the geniuses you brought us, Captain M. A five-member singing and dance act aimed at the tween demographic.
1395864	1410972	The group whose multi-ethnic members were chosen from more than 1,000 applicants will be the cornerstone to, and this apparently is brought to you by Kohl's, Kohl's Secret Slumber Party on CBS, which premieres September 16th.
1412276	1422778	The Slumber Party Girls will also appear on 26 half-hour episodes of Dance Revolution and of course my notes on that will be The Unholy Love Child
1423588	1434074	of DDR and Saturday Morning TV, a live-action TV series within the secret Slumber Party TV block inspired by Konami's video game franchise, Dance Dance Revolution.
1434474	1445981	A Slumber Party Girls original music signal is slated to debut on iTunes and AOL this month with a music DVD from Geffen, a division of Universal Music thereafter.
1447908	1449209	Is this the end of DDR?
1449269	1450690	Has DDR jumped the shark?
1450850	1454513	Now, I wonder if we're going to see any of their music on one of the DDR games.
1454693	1455794	Please, God.
1455894	1458136	Oh, God, this is not the American B for you, is it?
1459937	1460678	Oh, God.
1460998	1461519	Oh, God.
1463504	1464405	It just struck me.
1464465	1466386	This might be the American B for you.
1466446	1467847	I'm going to have to pour acid in my eyes.
1468948	1475252	I would have loved to just walked into the boardroom that was planning this shit dogma style and stopped it from happening.
1475412	1476372	Please, no.
1476392	1479775	Don't defile our DDR anymore.
1479895	1481015	It is promotion.
1482376	1483677	Of what type?
1485014	1491537	Now, in studio, I have a picture of the Slumber Party Girls, which I will hope to get on the website at some point.
1492517	1495819	Now, Rob and Shane, you guys have seen the Slumber Party Girls.
1496759	1497920	Drew, take a look.
1500101	1500581	What do you think?
1501401	1503102	It's the fucking Mickey Mouse Club.
1503442	1505203	Yeah, pretty much the Mickey Mouse Club of DDR.
1505463	1508685	I don't know what the fuck they're going to do with this show, but it's pretty scary.
1509025	1509445	Yeah.
1509844	1510844	Cutters has a good point.
1510884	1511624	Look at it this way.
1511685	1513445	Last year it was Go West and YMCA.
1513485	1514745	This year it's Slumber Party Girls.
1516326	1518046	Do you know what I was going to say to Miklatov earlier?
1518066	1519687	There's one song in DDR you always skip.
1520687	1521327	You know what, though?
1521887	1522487	Think about this.
1522848	1524488	What has the Mickey Mouse Club done for us?
1524688	1525528	Given us a bunch of whores.
1525768	1526349	So you know what?
1527029	1527869	More power to them.
1527889	1530330	Brittany, Christina, Justin Timberlake.
1531530	1533330	That Sexy Back song is pretty hot.
1533650	1534011	I know.
1534051	1535731	It was stuck in my head the other day.
1535871	1537191	I was very sad.
1537251	1537732	Oh, anyway, yeah.
1537752	1537932	Sorry.
1537972	1538392	Thank you.
1539462	1540763	I'm thinking about Justin Timberlake.
1540783	1542483	We should get back to video games, however.
1545445	1547025	What do you think?
1547105	1548006	Is this good promotion?
1548066	1550467	Mikotov, I'm especially curious what you might think on this.
1550527	1552788	Is this good promotion or no comment?
1553308	1554389	I can have a comment.
1554989	1555909	I don't like it.
1556369	1557710	I think it's really stupid.
1558870	1561832	But that's me not speaking as a Konami employee.
1561872	1566814	That's me speaking as a normal person that can look at that article and be like,
1567885	1569306	That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
1569426	1571126	I wonder if we'll see more about this in a few days.
1572907	1573387	Maybe.
1573607	1574127	I don't know why.
1575007	1576528	Maybe they'll do a performance.
1577228	1577628	We'll see.
1578188	1580129	Alright, let's move on to another story.
1580949	1588952	Now, maybe if you're into that thing, maybe you'll be lucky and they'll release a Slumber Party Girls HD DVD so you can see them in all their full high definition glory.
1589092	1590632	With a free coupon for therapy.
1590772	1595494	Which hopefully you'll be able to play on your Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.
1595954	1597435	There are rumors going around out there.
1597455	1603558	According to DigiTimes, this HD DVD add-on will be retailing for $200 US.
1604799	1610202	Now, originally, I think the rumors were $100, but I think we all realized that seemed a little low.
1610542	1613003	So $200 is now the price of the add-on, they're saying.
1613603	1615324	This is only a rumor, keep in mind.
1615604	1617806	But sounds like it could be pretty legit.
1617826	1618466	What do you think, Loki?
1619487	1621047	Well, we haven't heard the official price yet.
1621087	1623088	I keep checking daily, twice daily.
1623869	1624029	But
1624733	1627895	I'm sure Microsoft, I know, is coming into our work in a few weeks.
1628416	1630617	And, well, I'm sure we'll get the information out of them then.
1631018	1631938	But that's something about right.
1631978	1634040	I mean, HD DVD players are pretty expensive.
1635261	1638463	And it's not really something that you necessarily have to buy.
1639103	1642766	So, yeah, $200 seems pretty reasonable for an HD DVD player.
1643727	1647049	But, I mean, when you think about it, all it is is really kind of just a drive anyways.
1647809	1649891	But, you know, one thing, though.
1650478	1651559	That's not what Sony says!
1651579	1654842	So pretty much, you know, we have one of the former Microsoft employees, I guess, Andre...
1681309	1682689	I can't even pronounce his last name.
1683069	1687870	Anyways, he had a blog entry entitled 1080p Meaningless This Generation.
1688651	1694392	And he discussed why the PlayStation 3 can output 1080p for both games and movies, but apparently it doesn't mean much.
1695532	1701133	And you won't see any 1080p games for the PlayStation 3 this year.
1702293	1703534	And that kind of makes sense.
1703974	1709755	I mean, it can output that high, but a lot of the games are being co-developed for both the, you know,
1710540	1712081	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1730956	1733618	But I think what they're saying is, does it matter?
1733839	1736701	Does the eye really distinguish the difference that much?
1737041	1742206	They're just saying that there's not much of a difference between the interlaced and the progressive scan on it.
1742226	1748331	Okay, so granted, I think what you'll see... I sure noticed the difference between 480i and 480p.
1748912	1757259	I would say what the main difference would probably be is it would be sharper and less blurry, especially with a lot of movement on screen, stuff like that, because it's updating faster.
1757740	1757940	But...
1759557	1760698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1783496	1793781	Possibly, but the thing is, though, is it something really... I mean, like, for example, the difference between 720 and 1080i on your TV, do you really notice a huge difference?
1794041	1794481	Not much.
1794621	1795181	I really don't.
1795701	1800463	So, I mean, you're probably not going to really notice the difference on it.
1800904	1811888	Anyways, he points out there's an analysis done by the video editor of Home Theater Magazine, who basically said there's no noticeable difference between 1080i and 1080p.
1814080	1826069	and so, I don't know, take it as you will, but remember, Sony is the one, they are trying to sell those TVs, they are trying to sell Blu-ray, and making it a big selling point because, I don't know, the games aren't that great.
1826209	1830872	Well, remember also that the next generation doesn't start until Sony says it does, remember?
1830892	1831873	Oh, yeah.
1832013	1833814	Somebody in chat reminded me of that a minute ago.
1833834	1834635	Right.
1834955	1842781	That's right, somebody else was saying, because I called 99 Nights a next-gen game, and somebody said, well, now that 360's out, isn't it current-gen?
1842821	1842921	Right.
1843385	1848026	And, you know, well, unfortunately, Sony hasn't said yet that next-gen can start.
1848126	1849807	So, you know, 360, I guess.
1851187	1851648	I don't know.
1851988	1852708	It's a little silly.
1853488	1854008	It is silly.
1854528	1860810	I really want to see, like, Reggie and Peter Moore and... What's the guy from Sony?
1860870	1861290	Kaz?
1862671	1862851	Kaz.
1863211	1863691	Yeah, that guy.
1863911	1868533	I want to see them all, like, in a Rumble Roses-style mud-wrestling match.
1868553	1868853	With bikinis?
1868873	1869513	With bikinis.
1870154	1870954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1898433	1898613	ESRB
1927103	1933945	and of course the Entertainment Software Ratings Board is going to be launching a new public service announcement campaign.
1934625	1940827	The PSAs will explain video game ratings to parents and encourage them to check the rating every time they purchase a video game for their kids.
1941347	1947289	This campaign will be using TV, radio, throughout the state of Georgia and it's going to be running in the coming weeks.
1948536	1960040	Now, recent studies paid for by the ESRB show that 83% of parents with children who play video games are aware of the ESRB ratings, and three-quarters reference them when buying games for their family.
1960600	1966482	You know, I couldn't help but think when I read this, haven't there already been many PSAs and campaigns for this?
1966802	1976225	Because, like, when I went into Target, there's this whole, like, who wants to be a millionaire play, which I think is really funny because that whole thing is, like, you know, years old now.
1976265	1978126	Like, I think America is so over-millionaire.
1978442	1983144	But they have this whole, you know, thing with Regis, you know, selling the ratings, basically.
1983244	1987205	That's annoying sounding, but when I worked at EB... There's a baseball one, too.
1987425	1991447	Yeah, on our EB TV we had every month, they had, like,
1991872	1997916	Tiger Woods promoting the ESRB ratings, and I think Derek Jeter was on one time too.
1998457	2008103	It was, you know, I guess informative, but I think they don't give the parents enough credit, because when I worked in EB, the parents would always check the ESRB ratings.
2008163	2009464	It's like, oh, this game's T?
2009924	2014848	They would ask my opinion, they'd be like, yeah, if you're getting it for your four-year-old, that's probably not a good thing.
2015339	2018442	There's always one retard that slips through the cracks, though.
2018462	2019483	And that's the one they pay attention to.
2019503	2019803	And I mean that.
2019823	2021345	I don't mean, like, literally, okay?
2021385	2028311	I'm not totally insensitive, but I mean, like, you know, somebody who really just, something is just, you know, wrong with the parents and the kid.
2028511	2035177	There's just one, you know, parent out there that's always, you know, their kids are screaming, I want Grand Theft Auto!
2035337	2037720	I'm not gonna stop screaming and tell you Grand Theft Auto!
2037880	2040222	And, you know, fine, I gotta buy Grand Theft Auto for them.
2040595	2048182	and then, you know, kids see something on there and being a retard and his parents don't watch him, he goes and punches his sister or something.
2048202	2050385	Oh my god, he learned it from the game!
2050585	2054028	He didn't learn it because I'm not paying attention to him or anything, it's because of the game!
2054328	2056030	You bought him the damn game!
2056150	2064058	So then she goes and sues, you know, somebody over the game and then, you know, the whole thing comes down to, you know, then Jack
2064574	2066437	Jacky Pook comes in and goes, see?
2066757	2067839	See, this is what I'm talking about.
2067859	2079475	But the whole thing comes down to the parents, you know, you can put it out there, you can put it in their face, you can, you know, sell them the game and go, this is rated teen for this reason and, you know, let them know or whatever.
2080693	2082974	As you're selling them the game, and it won't matter.
2083294	2091016	It won't matter because they're stupid, and they're just hell-bent on doing something stupid and killing themselves.
2091316	2092236	Lead a horse to water.
2092396	2092656	All right.
2092956	2103239	Now, BlackWolf, since he lives in Georgia, his show's based out of Atlanta area, he says the difference here is that it is done with the assistance of the Georgia Attorney General instead of just the ESRB.
2103579	2105339	People listen to the Attorney General more.
2107079	2108980	I actually doubt the truth behind that statement.
2109020	2109480	No offense, BlackWolf.
2109847	2113710	Bobby, but I don't think the Attorney General having a hand in it is going to change things that much.
2113750	2117993	But maybe it's just a California, I don't know, because, you know, whatever.
2118674	2118994	I don't know.
2119515	2126420	Actually, don't you remember years ago the California Attorney General was like really upset about Mortal Kombat and all that stuff and got involved with that stuff?
2127040	2129662	Weren't the rating systems established in part because of him?
2130303	2130923	I want to say.
2131023	2132505	Yeah, I want to say, yeah.
2133045	2133926	Well, maybe I'm wrong then.
2133946	2134226	Who knows?
2134795	2136897	Anyways, moving on here.
2137658	2147587	There's a Spanish magazine, Nintendo Action, that is reporting that the next issue will reveal the official price, the launch date, and the game lineup for the Wii.
2148007	2150950	It says the issue is due to hit on September 15th.
2151410	2155213	So people are saying they're going to announce the official date on September 15th.
2156792	2159974	Wow, okay, I've read this on numerous sites.
2159994	2162776	Hooray, another Wii speculation story.
2162896	2163237	Hold on, hold on.
2163317	2167440	I've read this on numerous sites, and there's a whole big hole in their logic here.
2168140	2178167	For example, do you realize that, I don't know, they have to work on the magazine for a few months and go through all the editorial process and then print the magazine?
2178207	2180369	It doesn't just magically poof right there.
2180729	2182810	So they're not going to announce the date on the 15th.
2183351	2186313	I bet you anything they're announcing it next Wednesday.
2186786	2187527	They're in Let's Big.
2188407	2191550	And that's where you're going to find all your damn information.
2191630	2194652	That's where you're going to get this information that's going to be posted in the magazine.
2195233	2198836	So just wait a few more days and all the info will be there.
2199016	2200557	I don't understand, okay?
2200777	2203940	All these gaming blogs are running this speculation thing.
2203980	2205761	You know, like it's everywhere on the internet.
2205821	2210005	And I fucking told you guys last week exactly what day the Wii would be out.
2210345	2215309	And not a damn person picked up the story and said Orange Lounge Radio knows that the Wii will be out
2216099	2216639	Soon.
2219521	2221623	I'm very upset with the gaming community right now.
2221703	2225005	I've still got all my chips on the 18th of October.
2225685	2225965	Really?
2226005	2228307	Well, I think it's a risky bet at this point.
2228367	2229748	I'm starting to place my bet on soon.
2230028	2231629	I think he's in the right vicinity.
2232469	2233210	What the hell am I doing?
2233390	2234631	I'm done with speculating.
2235051	2235931	We'll know when we know.
2236212	2239854	We will know when Reggie comes out and says, Bam, here it is.
2240614	2242175	He'll just be like, Wham!
2243056	2243876	There's my junk.
2244157	2244777	This is the date.
2245698	2246439	Real credits.
2247661	2253547	By the way, earlier when we were talking about the mud wrestling fight, our chat room did seem to agree with us here.
2253768	2255970	Ari Mawson said Reggie is cool.
2256070	2258873	Zero Cool says, yeah, Reggie would kick ass and take names.
2259514	2261136	DMN says he's a big guy.
2261517	2262938	Ranma says Reggie is half black.
2262958	2264019	He will fuck everyone up.
2264059	2265301	He will get ghetto in a heartbeat.
2267196	2271459	FireResurrected says, I love how Sky calls himself a Sony fanboy and Nintendo fanboy.
2272179	2273280	I'm just a games fanboy.
2273300	2274681	I'm also a Microsoft fanboy.
2274721	2275401	I didn't used to be.
2275982	2278923	A long time ago, I used to hate Microsoft's game thing.
2279044	2280444	But, you know, things change.
2280805	2281465	People change.
2281625	2282366	Opinions change.
2282766	2285127	The Xbox was like my green kryptonite.
2285147	2286068	I just couldn't touch it.
2286548	2287629	That's the way a lot of us felt.
2287649	2289210	I refused to buy an Xbox.
2289830	2290391	But you know what?
2290571	2291271	I got tired of waiting.
2292232	2292332	And
2292958	2293739	It was a good purchase.
2293939	2296240	They finally started coming out with really good games.
2296260	2296920	PlayStation 3?
2297441	2298321	It might be a good purchase.
2299042	2299562	Later on.
2299702	2300262	I'm not going to buy it.
2300282	2300903	I think that's it too.
2301863	2302203	You know what?
2302243	2303144	You bring up a very good point.
2303164	2306086	I think the PS3 is going to suffer the same fate of the Xbox in my mind.
2306126	2309107	I think later on, the PS3 is going to be like a must-have system.
2309187	2313510	But to start... I'm just waiting for some of their great first party titles.
2313550	2315511	I mean, I want a new Twisted Metal.
2316011	2316572	God damn it.
2316672	2319093	It's going to look fucking amazing on the PlayStation 3.
2319613	2321575	That'll probably sell the system for me right there.
2321995	2322115	But...
2323278	2324639	There is no Twisted Metal at launch.
2325220	2327922	People said the Virtual Boy would be off to a slow start.
2327962	2328702	Look what happened to it.
2329143	2335808	Granted, I didn't really buy any of the Ratchet & Clank games, nor do I like the Ratchet & Clank games, but that would be a cool game to have on there.
2335868	2338330	Maybe... I don't know.
2338630	2339771	I want Jumping Flash.
2340011	2342633	Screw everything else if I could get a Jumping Flash game.
2342753	2343594	An actual...
2345936	2369667	Grand Turismo sequel You would be fucking happy with a Fantavision sequel I would really be happy Your taste in games is fucked And I think anyone who's listened to this show long enough knows that by now Your taste in games is absolutely fucked Whatever, Fantavision was really fun And Jumping Flash, yeah, best That and Mega Man 8 were the reasons I got a PS1 Because Jumping Flash was the best Never mind Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy 7 Slide, slide, slide
2370805	2372647	Never mind, you know, any of that stuff.
2372687	2374828	It was all about fucking Jumping Flash.
2374848	2377531	The little robot bunny guy was so cool.
2380894	2381074	Well.
2381767	2388414	And somebody in the chat room said that they want an online jumping flash, GS68 or whatever.
2388454	2389535	Alright, well hooray for them.
2389836	2392699	I would play it with you because that's a great sounding game.
2392739	2393960	Can we get to the next story please?
2394000	2394180	No.
2394381	2402109	Alright, now one place that you might be able to get your hands on the Wii are these secret parties that are supposedly starting in September.
2402469	2405931	Now this is kind of interesting because Nintendo is going to be having these private parties.
2406351	2408953	What they're going to do is they're going to seek out people.
2409073	2411574	I don't know, like on the internet, MySpace, or what they're doing.
2411874	2415216	And they're going to invite 30 friends to this private party.
2415256	2416637	So it's like an underground campaign.
2416677	2419038	It's a random selection of Nintendo ambassadors.
2419078	2420559	You basically sign in.
2420659	2421599	There's like some website.
2421699	2422400	Sign me up!
2422480	2424581	Shit, I want to have an Orange Lounge Radio Wii party.
2424621	2425181	Wouldn't that be fun?
2425201	2426222	Well, technically since we're...
2426602	2429043	I've said such nice things about Reggie on this program.
2429323	2430744	I think that entitles us to a wee party.
2430764	2432665	You said you wouldn't have sex with him, though.
2432705	2433685	That's not very nice.
2434145	2435346	That's respectful.
2435406	2436306	That's not being rude.
2436326	2437467	That's being respectful.
2439744	2441425	Well, you know what?
2441765	2443046	We played it at E3.
2443106	2445027	We'll get to play it soon enough.
2445047	2445527	Hopefully.
2445587	2447389	I mean, it's just the whole thing is buzzed.
2447589	2450190	They really need to start some really serious advertising.
2450210	2451111	I've got to tell you this, though.
2451171	2452932	I mean, this is how underground it is, okay?
2453032	2456314	They know that Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver are all going to have these parties.
2456934	2468401	Supposedly, some of the news is leaking through, and a Chicago person actually emailed Kotaku and said that his friends are going to be buzzed rave style to a secret location to play games and have fun.
2468721	2475103	So they're going to have to go to this random parking lot in the ghetto side of town and get in the bus and then be shipped to the Wii.
2475403	2477863	And it's like, you know, hey man, want some X?
2478043	2478503	Want a hit?
2479844	2481644	How about that sleeping gas?
2481664	2482404	Battle Royale.
2482845	2485105	That's how the Wii's graphics are going to be 3D.
2485365	2486245	Drug influenced.
2486906	2487646	I figured it out.
2488366	2488866	Yes, indeed.
2489446	2490886	Exactly, that's awesome.
2491187	2491767	I'm a genius.
2492427	2496848	Well, speaking of L.A., American McGee.
2497503	2500445	Who has a wonderful game called Bad Day LA coming out in a couple weeks here.
2501706	2505528	He's basically on the record saying the only real next-gen is the Wii.
2506469	2513594	And his reasons for that, basically, that the only true next-gen console out there is the Wii.
2513634	2519838	Everything else is just a video card and processor upgrade, I guess, because the controls are a lot different.
2520739	2526723	He believes that, you know, I don't know, they're really not innovating, just kind of upgrading.
2527831	2531233	Better graphics and really where the games are is just better gameplay.
2533575	2535916	You need to fucking release some more games, American McGee.
2536116	2537397	That's all I got to say about that.
2537657	2542961	I don't think the Wii is next gen so much as it is I'll do what I want, gen.
2544102	2546783	That's what Nintendo's doing, essentially.
2546863	2547644	We'll do what we want.
2548317	2554579	We're just going to, you, Nintendo, Microsoft, I mean, Sony, Microsoft, you have fun over there fighting.
2554940	2558161	We'll be off on this side doing our wee thing.
2558841	2559321	Seriously.
2559862	2571066	The whole thing was, you know, pretty much, he knows, well, I wouldn't really say that he knows what gaming is, but, you know,
2571846	2576548	I think he's trying to point out, it's just like what we say on the show all the time, you know, a system is only as good as the games.
2577208	2583590	And I think just by looking at the Wii, I mean, playing some of these games using that control setup is going to be a lot of fun.
2583930	2586271	And you don't need to have, you know, superb graphics to do it.
2586351	2595334	And to be honest, a lot of the games that come out for the Nintendo system, especially a lot of the first party stuff, you don't need to render cartoons and super duper graphics.
2595514	2598035	I mean, they're just animated characters.
2598095	2599235	They're not realistic.
2600196	2600536	So...
2601618	2605340	Yeah, they can do it with that kind of technology and that kind of power.
2606681	2607582	I don't know, just play the game.
2607742	2608502	Goddamn wait.
2608562	2610704	Stop trying to guess.
2611464	2614326	We'll see who's going to be at the top pretty soon.
2614386	2620690	I mean, only a few months before these systems come out, so why do we got to speculate?
2621030	2623071	Really, is it that slow of a news week?
2624512	2625993	In a way, sadly enough.
2626053	2628114	I mean, we're all waiting for these systems to come out.
2628134	2629655	What else are we supposed to do in the meantime?
2630960	2631260	I don't know.
2631280	2634122	Nobody wants to play 99 Nights but me, so I don't know.
2634342	2637224	Yeah, so we can just point and laugh at all the hype wars.
2638785	2639065	All right.
2640145	2641866	JeremyTodd1, interesting point in chat.
2641926	2644188	Who says next-gen has to have awesome graphics?
2644268	2648890	Next-gen is really just a change of the gen before it, and the Wii certainly falls into that category.
2649391	2649571	True.
2649851	2650071	True.
2651372	2651652	Agreed.
2652970	2655751	Alright, well, this could be another random direction the Wii is going in.
2656471	2659652	You know how the DS was kind of the brain training system?
2659932	2662833	Well, the Wii may be the body training system.
2663133	2668055	There was a report published by Bloomberg that made mention of a new form of game in development at Nintendo.
2668135	2670496	It's a Wii-based diet software.
2671216	2672997	This Bloomberg report issued...
2674237	2681778	I'm sorry, this Bloomberg report showed that there was the recent strong performance of Nintendo's Japanese stock, and it made mention of the new software in passing.
2682079	2685959	Nintendo is developing diet-related and other forms of software for the Wii.
2686559	2694221	The report noted that such titles, specifically Brain Age for the DS, have been able to target new users who aren't used to standard game controllers.
2694581	2696181	Details were not given beyond this.
2696861	2701222	Well, that would kind of coincide with the registering of the domain Wii Health, so...
2701823	2702803	That would make sense.
2703344	2707085	That's what I was thinking, too, is all those Wii things we read about previously.
2707205	2709526	So, not too surprised there.
2710646	2720510	What is kind of funny and surprising, I guess, is that the Wii is going to have, or speculated to have, a voice-to-text chat.
2721410	2727272	I guess you would call this an advanced voice-to-text chat because it will actually detect, I guess, the...
2729933	2730653	DarkSakura.com
2758027	2760771	I don't even know why you would do voice-to-text chat anyways if you could just do voice chat.
2760791	2762193	I mean, what would be the point?
2762233	2762553	I don't know.
2772967	2773948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2802793	2804194	You're playing Marble Blast.
2805456	2813704	Not to knock Marble Blast, it's a great game, but it doesn't exactly strike me as the macho, you know, stereotypical
2814784	2816565	Macho Man type of game.
2816605	2818405	My marbles are made of seal, bitch.
2818465	2819285	Exactly.
2819585	2822166	You're bound to hear that sort of stuff also in Uno.
2822706	2825007	I got fucking Uno, bitch.
2825027	2826387	Suck it.
2826587	2828608	I've never heard smack talking in Uno.
2828748	2829108	Really?
2829248	2829728	Yes, never.
2829748	2830428	We need to start it.
2830448	2831108	Play more Uno.
2832489	2833929	I don't want to get bad ratings.
2834309	2837050	I'm going to totally talk crap in like, I don't know.
2838342	2839864	Totem Ball or something.
2840344	2842346	If that's multiplayer, I'm going to fucking talk shit.
2842366	2844668	Too bad Bejeweled 2 isn't multiplayer.
2844768	2845909	That would be sweet.
2846630	2849353	FireResurrected in chat says, that's why you need to play with your listeners.
2849453	2849933	I mean, that's true.
2849973	2851375	I want to play games with listeners.
2851415	2856199	We'll set up a time or something like a, you know, hey, play games with us on Xbox Live type of night.
2856720	2857761	We'll do something like that.
2857801	2859843	Rini says, marbles are serious shit, Skye.
2860515	2861876	I can't wait to get Saints Row.
2862456	2864058	I just can't wait to get that game.
2864618	2866660	I'm going to talk so much crap.
2866960	2868981	BlackWolf says, draw four, biatch!
2871183	2871743	Exactly.
2871823	2874505	See, he's got the right... I want to have... You know what?
2874545	2876387	Didn't all games do an Uno tournament recently?
2877448	2883631	I want to have a shit-talking Uno tournament that's graded not only on how well you play, but how well you talk shit.
2883851	2887233	Remember that movie with the South Park guys years ago, Basketball?
2888434	2890415	They had the psych-outs, right?
2890535	2892656	That's what we need, is a psych-out Uno tournament.
2892676	2896578	I have no idea how we can pull that off, but we need a shit-talking Uno tournament.
2896638	2897578	Here's what we need to do.
2897678	2898178	Oh yeah?
2898218	2899339	Think you're going to win this game?
2899379	2900720	Well, suck on this reverse.
2901240	2902120	Here's what we need to do.
2902160	2903421	Your mom sucked on that reverse.
2904167	2907828	We need to film it, and we need to wait until they come out with the vision cameras.
2908328	2910348	And that will be the shit right there.
2912508	2918990	Because you'll have, you know, yelling, and it'll just be like, you know, it'll be awesome.
2920430	2922150	Alright, maybe we'll have to plan something like that.
2922190	2923530	I'll talk to Scott offline.
2923550	2924551	I'm sure he'll love that idea.
2925291	2926671	I've got a story about Reggie.
2926811	2929171	Tonight is like Reggie night on Orange Lounge Radio.
2930152	2931652	I mean, seriously, this man... Ugh.
2933442	2935405	Well this man is kicking ass.
2935806	2937328	He's like the Chuck Norris of gaming.
2937649	2938310	That's what it is.
2938991	2940772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2968667	2976233	Anyway, I got sick of Chuck Norris after all my co-workers were obsessed with him and bought books about him and then it happened in WoW and I just wanted to die.
2978815	2979135	Anyway.
2980595	2989401	Reggie has said, you know, remember that way back when Peter Moore said about the Sony, tell me why you would buy a $600 PlayStation 3.
2989961	2991682	People are going to buy two machines.
2991942	2995384	They're going to buy an Xbox and they're going to buy a Wii for the price of one PlayStation 3.
2995584	2999527	Remember that was said back at E3 and everybody's eyebrows went up like, oh.
3000492	3002394	Microsoft and Nintendo might be in bed together.
3002995	3007099	Well, they are not in bed together because you know what Reggie came back and said?
3007259	3019391	There was an article in USA Today about the Wii and he said, quote, I'd much rather have the consumer buy a Wii, some accessories, and a ton of games versus buying any of my competitors' products.
3020092	3024236	See, you don't get in bed with Microsoft, you just might catch something.
3026457	3027097	It's like, yeah.
3027117	3027738	Like Windows.
3028538	3030319	Other interesting comments made in the interview.
3030399	3035642	Quote, we will offer online enabled games that the consumers will not have to pay a subscription fee for.
3035962	3038003	They'll be able to enjoy that right out of the box.
3038403	3043586	The Wii console is going to be Wi-Fi enabled, so essentially you'll be able to plug it in and go.
3043906	3045567	It won't have hidden fees or costs.
3045887	3046307	P.S.
3046607	3047208	Suck it more.
3047988	3051510	Actually, that wasn't said, but that's kind of what he was implying.
3052799	3056740	I mean, why didn't he just say, you know, suck it, Microsoft, ours thing's gonna be free.
3059021	3073585	And that, and you know what, that is a big point, I mean, I, even though I, I don't understand why you would need, you know, Wi-Fi adapter for the 360, I mean, I just run fucking Ethernet cable and go to my router, but, like, if you really want to spend $99 for fucking Wi-Fi...
3076169	3078950	I mean, that's ridiculous, but at least the Wii's going to have it out of the box.
3079451	3087254	However, it doesn't have an Ethernet cable port on there, so you actually have to have some sort of Wi-Fi connection, whether it be some USB thing or Wi-Fi router.
3087274	3088394	So that kind of sucks.
3088494	3094397	Now, FireResurrected brings up this excellent point that kind of says, you know, he's trying to put Reggie in his place a little bit here.
3094437	3095337	This is an interesting comment.
3095897	3098678	But we have to endure the fucking friend codes.
3099879	3100159	Ouch.
3100379	3102380	It's not that much of a gripe.
3102520	3102840	Damn.
3104363	3105284	It does suck.
3105324	3106124	It's a password.
3106164	3108986	You guys don't remember entering in passwords?
3109026	3111047	Yeah, I do, and I remember not liking it.
3111207	3112167	We're beyond that now.
3112187	3114108	I remember Justin Bailey, dash, dash, dash.
3114148	3115409	But no, seriously?
3116850	3122933	But put it side by side with Microsoft's system where you can add people on the web and everything.
3122993	3126014	I mean, okay, you've got to give that one to Microsoft.
3126354	3129476	They've got the more ease of communicating with your friends in a way.
3129836	3129896	Huh?
3131077	3131557	I think so.
3132549	3135232	I bet that doesn't, that's not to say, I mean, the Wii could change things, obviously.
3135352	3152871	Just trying to do the stupid friend code stuff for, like, Animal Crossing when I had that game for two weeks, that was really obnoxious, and I wished I could have just, you know, been able to maybe even go to some hub town and, like, hang out with people and be like, oh, you're really cool, well, here, I'm gonna add you as my friend or something.
3153671	3154312	Much easier.
3155272	3160155	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Friend codes, good on theory, but Nintendo didn't do it the right way.
3160575	3162156	JeremyTodd1 seems to add to that.
3162397	3164918	But they have a different password for each and every different game.
3164958	3168300	They only need one friend code for the system, and that would work fine.
3169901	3170642	Interesting comments.
3171742	3182909	Another place we always get interesting comments is our mailbag, and even though DarkSakura is not here tonight to read the mail for us, I've borrowed her hazmat suit, and I'm going to jump on into the mailbag and read some e-mails.
3185066	3186408	Do you want to read an email, Shane?
3186569	3187049	Yeah.
3187069	3187811	All right, come over here.
3187831	3188271	Read an email.
3188552	3189053	All right.
3189073	3191116	Why don't you read this email?
3191156	3195423	This one comes to us from StevenNZ, and Shane's going to read us this email here.
3195563	3195804	Okay.
3196516	3198958	Hi, I absolutely love your show.
3199258	3204542	I have been listening for about one and a half years now, but just recently registered on your site.
3205083	3217652	I heard in episode 193 that you guys may not be getting the Xbox 360 PGR3 bundle, so I would just like to tell you that over here in New Zealand, there's a... an, not a...
3218814	3226649	An Xbox 360 bundle with Project Gotham 3 in cameo, which is weird because us New Zealanders normally get things late or don't get anything at all.
3227096	3230217	Thanks for the great show, Steve in New Zealand.
3230457	3238259	Alright, well, by the way, it has since come out, I mean, the 193 was a little bit ago, so it has since come out, we are not getting that Project Gotham Racing bundle here.
3238279	3239939	No, we're not getting any bundles of any sort.
3240119	3249721	Now, my only thing, though, is that, is this an official Microsoft sanctioned bundle, or is this something like the local gaming store in New Zealand is doing, like how GameStop does here?
3249781	3250722	I think it is official.
3250882	3251242	Oh, that's cool.
3251262	3256103	Because in other countries, they're getting official bundles to help sell the system a bit more, because, you know, they're having a little trouble.
3256743	3278539	Um, so, I mean, you see some bundles here, like, I know they bundle, I've seen at, like, Fry's, our local electronics chain over here, they've got, um, a bundle with Ridge Racer 6, which, you know, as we mentioned last week, Ridge Racer 6 is only $19.99, so it's not a great deal, but still, but still though, it is pretty decent, I mean, that they're doing that, so, I don't know.
3279780	3280040	All right.
3280356	3282978	Hi, I'm a relatively new listener and I really love your show.
3282998	3289665	The format works well and the interaction between the three of you and any guests you have on definitely make the experience...
3306584	3307605	Well, because it doesn't exist.
3307625	3308025	I'm just kidding.
3308405	3310827	Make the experience all that much more enjoyable.
3311347	3313209	My question concerns Kid Icarus.
3313549	3328099	When it came out for the original NES, I truly loved the game and thought it ranked right up there with Metroid as far as playability and... I can't read it standing up like this because I'm at an angle.
3328259	3329319	An interesting concept.
3329339	3330300	Interesting concept.
3330680	3331441	Why then...
3331843	3334926	Has there never been a sequel to this potentially fun franchise?
3335366	3348179	Is there some sort of inside information, blah blah blah, that have kept this from happening, or am I one of a small minority of people who like the original game?
3348539	3350962	So there's just not enough interest to produce.
3351362	3355126	Thanks for your time, and keep up the great work, Boston Aller fan.
3356281	3357582	And, wait, I want to respond.
3357642	3358322	Okay, respond.
3358863	3360564	There was one on the GBA.
3360944	3363906	I don't remember if it's a sequel, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the same game.
3364286	3365707	Oh, not GBA, sorry, Game Boy.
3366007	3367748	Whatever, nobody cares about the GBA.
3367828	3371270	Is it just because the Game Boy version didn't sell as well, comparatively?
3371310	3372771	Did it kill off the franchise, or what?
3372991	3380115	I honestly don't think a lot of people bought it, because, I mean, Metroid got a sequel on Game Boy, and we ended up getting Super Metroid.
3380135	3381656	Yeah, Metroid 2 really did suck.
3382404	3387266	But all the future Metroids have been pretty darn good, and Super Metroid's probably one of the best video games ever made, period.
3387286	3387826	Oh yeah, definitely.
3387866	3388946	That's an amazing game.
3389387	3394108	But I guess Kid Icarus on Game Boy just really must have been horrible.
3394388	3397369	It must have suffered from Metroid 2 syndrome, where that game was really terrible too.
3397449	3407393	It just makes me cry inside, because if Super Metroid was seriously the great, great, great, great, great, great video game it was, imagine what Super Kid Icarus could have been.
3407633	3410694	I mean, it just makes me kind of sad.
3412443	3412683	I know.
3413004	3414466	I love Kid Icarus, actually.
3414546	3418051	And when I had a PSP for two weeks, I played it on that.
3418292	3420876	And that game is freaking hard, but it's awesome.
3421096	3426604	I suppose it's possible that maybe with the Wii, especially with Pit being one of the new Smash Bros.
3426644	3427045	characters...
3427432	3430414	Maybe now is the time for Kid Icarus to return finally.
3430674	3433395	Because, you know, Metroid kind of made a big return on the GameCube.
3433755	3437557	Maybe it'll make the same return and Kid Icarus will become a first-person shooter.
3438218	3440279	See, that's the problem.
3440319	3445262	I don't want them to, like, if they make a new Kid Icarus, I don't want it to be that different.
3445462	3448223	Like, I don't want them to fuck with it like they did Metroid.
3448283	3451345	I know a lot of you like the first-person Metroid, but I don't care for it.
3451365	3453426	You don't want to use the Wii controller to draw back the bowstrings?
3453891	3457513	Okay, now that might be kind of cool, depending on... But I don't want it to be first person!
3457853	3465898	If I had to, like, run around and fight an eggplant wizard in first person, I think I would cry, because that was the scariest part of that game for me when I was younger.
3466118	3468460	Because I did not want to be an eggplant with legs.
3470921	3471742	See, the eggplant... See...
3472699	3475101	Kid Icarus had so many memorable characters like that.
3475121	3477582	You know the scary Medusa looking thing and the dragon that flew.
3477622	3479623	The Grim Reaper that would yell at you if it saw you.
3479783	3481705	That was so scary.
3481805	3482565	Yeah, seriously.
3482985	3483706	I loved it though.
3484226	3485067	How can you not love Kid Icarus?
3485087	3489930	And the things that looked like noses with eyes that had a lot of nose hair coming out.
3489950	3491931	I don't remember what they were called, but they were scary too.
3491971	3495813	Legend of Zaku thinks he knows another game that ought to be making a return on the Wii.
3496314	3496814	Punch-Out! !
3498357	3499618	Super Punch Out was pretty good.
3499678	3500438	It was a little bit overlooked.
3500458	3501098	I never played that one.
3501138	3504080	It was a little bit overlooked because I think it came out late in the Super Nintendo's run.
3504280	3506381	Mike Tyson basically ruined it for everybody.
3506421	3509502	Mike Tyson doesn't... You don't need Mike Tyson.
3510963	3511984	How about George Foreman?
3512044	3514785	I realize he's long gone, but I mean, he makes the grills.
3515185	3516446	I think he's promoting the PlayStation 3.
3516906	3518247	All right, I've got to read this email.
3518707	3520088	This is a great email.
3520128	3522650	It's kind of long, but since it's well-written, I'm going to read the whole thing.
3522670	3524931	So everybody get the water and the snacks.
3524951	3525592	All right, just shut up.
3525612	3526392	No, this is a good email.
3526452	3526873	Listen to this.
3526953	3527833	This is about Sony.
3528033	3529795	This is a really good, interesting point on the whole Sony debate.
3530335	3536299	Hello, GS191 here, and just wanted to put in my two cents on one of the reoccurring topics on this show, Sony.
3536739	3538341	It's hard trying to like Sony these days.
3538421	3549013	With their failing formats, overpriced and underperforming Blu-ray format, the underwhelming PlayStation 3, the whole rootkit fiasco, and let's not forget, they're the makers of the exploding Dell and Apple laptop batteries.
3549313	3551135	Is there any redeeming quality left in Sony?
3551496	3552437	To me, I think not.
3552817	3557981	First off, why do they insist on trying to push dead formats such as the Betamax, Minidisc, UMD, etc.?
3558281	3559241	The list goes on and on.
3559402	3560442	And now comes Blu-ray.
3560863	3565926	Sure, Blu-ray has the support of over 180 companies, but the thing that gets me is where is the consumer in all of this?
3566386	3574852	I don't see the demand for Blu-ray or HD DVD now since we basically don't have the majority of the population owning HD TVs, let alone 1080p HD TVs.
3575372	3578935	This all leads up to the PlayStation 3 and Sony Computer Entertainment in general.
3579435	3582317	I think that $600 of my hard-earned money is not worth it.
3582717	3595867	Even if it was bundled with a Blu-ray disc showing 6 million ways how Aerith can die for all I care, they have in no way ever explained to me why is this plastic box full of fans, transistors, chips, silicon is worth that price tag.
3596267	3600010	They try to push how this is the next generation of gaming and it's proven in the games.
3600891	3605054	Yeah, I see some screen and game footage from the launch titles for PlayStation 3 and I was very underwhelmed.
3605512	3608053	A lot of them look like Xbox 360 and PC games.
3608273	3609493	I cannot tell the difference.
3609973	3617575	That right there says why spend $600 when I can shell out $400 or even $250 for a much better gaming experience and have enough money for the games.
3618115	3620876	Also, 8 of the games are already going to be on other consoles.
3621296	3623477	That also really doesn't give me much incentive.
3624017	3632099	I think they are really going for the action-oriented audience with this launch, but with many people not seeing that grade A title like Halo or Metal Gear at launch, why should I even bother?
3633035	3635116	My real problem is the whole PC notation.
3635336	3636456	It's not a computer, people.
3636777	3641038	If it's a computer, does this mean that I can upgrade the PS3 to a faster processor or add more RAM?
3641318	3641959	Probably not.
3646821	3648801	Even if it did, why would anybody want to upgrade?
3648841	3650542	It's like the 32X for the Genesis.
3650862	3652823	The games were there, but nobody wanted to upgrade.
3653063	3654044	The same would apply here.
3654364	3659786	Besides, you're going to need a lot of fine-tuning to text from a PC perfectly scaled on a regular SDTV.
3660595	3664618	This is what I think should have been done and can be done for SCE to turn things around.
3665179	3664618	1.
3665559	3668402	Kill off the flash card reader and leave the memory stick in.
3668702	3670624	Isn't that what you do with your Sony VAIO laptops?
3670944	3673186	If I want to look at my photos, I will put them on the computer.
3673606	3678310	It's just added costs that could, not could, definitely have dropped the price down from $600.
3678510	3686838	Hell, replace it with, I don't know, regular legacy PS2 controller ports for people who use PS2 controllers for DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, etc.
3687738	3694882	2.
3688219	3694882	Instead of getting rid of the HDMI port for the $500 version, why not disable the ability of commercially made Blu-ray movies from playing?
3695322	3698584	Sony can always release a downloadable upgrade that will enable the playback function.
3698904	3705528	This is a lot better than watching downscale Blu-ray movies because the movie has copy protection in it and you don't even have the port for full resolution playback.
3706008	3711131	If this happened, I think the $500 would be useful and great for my needs instead of being the joke that it is.
3711711	3711131	3.
3711872	3716254	Sony, it's time for Kaz, Ken, and David to make a nice long nap until November.
3716755	3719916	These three people make the PlayStation 3 more overblown than it already is.
3720336	3722977	At least get them some decent PR people to limit what they say.
3723397	3726598	Four, convince people why they should buy the PlayStation 3.
3726638	3730259	This is the most important and the hardest thing their marketing department has to do.
3730659	3736241	I would love to see Sony do an all-out blitz of great ads on why you should be even considering a PlayStation 3 for the holiday season.
3736661	3743503	All they need to do is showcase the games, do some comparisons, and especially convince people how the hell $600 is justifiable on a gaming device.
3743923	3745725	If they can do the last part, that would be great for them.
3746005	3747266	I'm doubtful if they can do that, though.
3747526	3748647	Well, that's what I think, anyway.
3748927	3752670	Keep up the great work, screw the haters, practice what you preach, and don't be a dick.
3752870	3754751	Sincerely, GS191.
3755692	3756373	Now you may speak.
3757253	3760956	Okay, so he wanted to do actual upgrades later on.
3760996	3767201	That was one of the things Kaz said, that they're looking forward to doing PC-type upgrades with more RAM, more stuff.
3767580	3772345	Then it comes down to the problem, well now you don't have a standardized system to work for, so how do you develop games?
3772826	3780314	That's not good for the consumer, or for the publishers of these games, or anybody even thinking about the system, because what the fuck do you develop for?
3780414	3783878	Now you just have to kind of figure out, okay, well what do people have?
3783938	3785460	You're always going to develop for the lowest end.
3786670	3788051	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3809944	3812225	I was excited about the PlayStation 3 when I went in the E3.
3812245	3814346	I was like, holy shit, this is gonna be awesome.
3814366	3816606	There was games I saw, you know, trailers for.
3817026	3818487	I'm like, I gotta play these things.
3818867	3821288	I played them as like, so what?
3821588	3822328	This is stupid.
3822828	3827410	The games were big letdown, and I know they're not finished, but you know what?
3827510	3828891	I'm not talking about graphics either.
3828931	3834973	I'm just really saying gameplay for these games sucked, and the graphics were just like, well, I can see this on the 360, and
3836559	3837080	Big deal.
3837340	3849570	So, yeah, they are going to have a problem because basically Xbox is lining up their system and the game's coming out right now, especially all their first party stuff, to trump everything that they're going to release on the PS3.
3849930	3853574	I mean, you've got Gran Turismo HD or whatever they're calling it now.
3853934	3855895	Well, Forza 2 kicks the crap out of that.
3856836	3861200	Then they've got, you know, an actual, I guess you would kind of say almost like a Halo game.
3862097	3865479	Game coming out, Gears of War, which is going to be just fucking ginormous.
3866039	3869581	And that's coming out a week before the PlayStation 3 launch.
3870241	3872002	And to be honest, Blu-ray kind of sucks.
3872102	3879106	You don't really need the HDMI right now because you can still be able to pump out the same stuff component-wise.
3879734	3881676	Until at least, I think, like 2009.
3881757	3889245	But once they go all digital, then you will need the HDMI and you're going to be fucked because all your Blu-ray discs are only going to be able to output at 540.
3890767	3891988	So half the resolution.
3892148	3892469	Yay.
3892709	3893430	That's really worth $600.
3895339	3896100	And I agree.
3896760	3901845	One good thing, though, about HD DVD right now, though, is they're releasing all the discs with their hybrid discs.
3902045	3904187	One side DVD, one side HD DVD.
3904607	3912134	So, say, for example, that you are planning on buying an HD DVD player down the line, you can buy these hybrid discs, and you can still watch them now.
3912234	3916418	Then later on, when you get your new system, you don't have to go repurchase the actual movie.
3916778	3919881	You can just flip the disc over and watch it in a higher resolution.
3920041	3920241	So...
3921946	3922266	I don't know.
3922807	3930312	Whatever the case, they haven't done their advertising campaign yet and they're going to need one hell of an advertising campaign to get the system sold.
3930572	3934014	Alright, I'm looking in chat and lots of feedback, of course, to this email in chat.
3934034	3936496	And what's kind of funny is that the author of the email is in chat right now.
3937236	3940218	Kind of responding to comments there, or just at least kind of looking at what people are saying.
3941238	3942979	Gosh, there's a lot of stuff here.
3942999	3943299	Let's see.
3943339	3945080	I like the one that Funnydale said.
3945501	3950283	Also, let's remember the PlayStation 2 launched with Fantavision, and look at how well the PS2 did.
3950303	3952745	That's because Fantavision is a brilliant game.
3952785	3953585	Well, you know what, though?
3953605	3954886	I don't know about that.
3955526	3957887	Fantavision, I did play Fantavision when it came out.
3957907	3960849	It was one of the first games I rented because I didn't really have any games for it.
3961289	3961869	and you know what?
3962089	3965350	It was a game that had a different style of gameplay that was fun to play.
3965650	3967071	It was simple, but it was fun.
3967191	3971192	It comes down to the Geometry Wars kind of scenario there.
3971372	3972453	It's still a fun game.
3972513	3974333	It may be simple, but it was fun to play.
3974473	3977834	Granted that I got bored with it after a while, but it doesn't matter.
3977954	3978554	It's different.
3978635	3981675	I never got bored with it because of those cutscenes with the live actors.
3981896	3982916	Those were great.
3982956	3987037	Blackwolf says the PlayStation 3 would sell out in my area even if there were no games for it.
3987117	3987657	They don't care.
3987697	3989638	They want the Sony system and that's final.
3989994	3991095	That's what... You know what?
3991216	3992317	And that's what Kaz said.
3992337	3996122	He's all... People would buy this system even if we sold it with no games.
3996642	3997143	Well, good.
3997303	3998945	I hope that you're happy with your purchase.
3999306	4003471	I mean, no one's saying... No one... I'm not going to talk anyone out buying a PlayStation 3.
4004052	4005493	Go ahead and buy one if you want to, but...
4007345	4011668	I hope some good games come out for you, because so far, I'm not impressed.
4012128	4013769	Maybe down the line, it might be great.
4014169	4018171	One of those Final Fantasy XIII's and one Metal Gear Solid 4 and all that stuff.
4018572	4020613	But the way I look at it, that's about a year off.
4021573	4023434	I may look at the system in a year.
4023674	4026716	I didn't jump on board with PlayStation 1 until Final Fantasy VII.
4026896	4027717	Exactly, I didn't either.
4028217	4028537	I don't know.
4028958	4031800	Anyway, well, this is always a controversial topic.
4031840	4032840	We'd love to hear your thoughts.
4033161	4036203	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send those emails.
4036583	4042948	Just on one final note, Sony is saying that something big is coming with the announcement.
4043088	4044489	They're going to blow the roof off with something.
4044769	4047952	Can Sony dig themselves out of this hole with a big enough announcement?
4048672	4053936	Possibly, but I think we have stories later on that will just kind of, I don't know, make the hole deeper.
4054961	4056062	Hmm, alright.
4056722	4068070	Anyways, Game Fest 2006 took place recently, and some news came out of that, including some of the plans for the live Marketplace.
4068191	4070572	And of course, the Marketplace has been doing great so far.
4070712	4073534	Everybody has been downloading tons of stuff.
4073554	4080279	They're saying that 38% of all Marketplace downloads are game demos, trailers, and account for 25% of downloads.
4082018	4082739	XBOX Live
4111716	4114477	and on the marketplace, there's Gil for sale.
4114937	4123581	I can go buy Gil in like 100 pieces or whatever at a certain price and I can keep buying the same item over and over for the game.
4124221	4129443	So you're basically able to buy almost like items for a game.
4131184	4138607	And of course, beyond these consumable items, because they're trying to make tons of money off of this stuff, they're actually going to have more community stuff.
4139502	4144185	including more community videos and hopefully user-made content and stuff like that.
4145746	4150630	Especially also with the XNA thing that's going to be happening where you can actually program for live.
4150650	4152711	I think we have more information on that in the next half.
4152951	4153912	It should be interesting.
4155693	4157194	I don't know how I feel about that.
4157474	4157814	I don't know.
4159376	4164159	I don't know how I feel about the whole buying in-game currency and all that stuff.
4164299	4164619	I don't know.
4165180	4166300	When you think about it,
4167779	4178264	If you actually look, like say for example, Oblivion, and you look at all those add-ons that they have for it, because I mean, when you're buying the add-ons at like $1.25 a pop, it's not that bad.
4178804	4182946	I mean, it doesn't seem like much, but when you look back at all that you've spent on this game,
4184019	4184339	Exactly.
4184399	4184759	I don't know.
4212233	4213354	Also, look at Oblivion.
4213394	4216717	They got taunted the hell out of them for that whole horse armor thing.
4217978	4220600	And it seems to me like that's the kind of thing you're talking about.
4220640	4223823	Like, you can get this little item that you can use in your game.
4223883	4227566	Well, it didn't seem to me like the horse armor had a very big reception to it.
4227866	4231329	Yeah, no one picked up the horse armor, but everything else people picked up.
4231589	4233270	Oh, and see, Chatham agrees with me in there.
4233431	4235172	FireResurrected said, except horse armor.
4235873	4236933	Yeah, horse armor is lame.
4237974	4240076	It was an experiment, though, I guess.
4241120	4244341	That's not really the item I would... Horse armor?
4244361	4246482	Who the fuck cares about pimping out their horse?
4246922	4247723	That's stupid.
4247963	4258787	Alright, well, I'll be getting a 23rd Xbox Live Arcade game next week, and I'm sure a lot of you will too, but you better get it next week, because it's going to be free for a certain period of time here.
4259307	4269031	You will be able to log on to Xbox Live within the first 48 hours of release, and that would be August 23rd at 8am like the standard time.
4269051	4269291	What is it?
4269331	4269671	GMT.
4270430	4272991	So that translates to 1am Pacific Time.
4273291	4280955	So Wednesday, August 23rd at 1am Pacific Time for 48 hours only, you will be able to download Texas Hold'em for free.
4281595	4284737	After that, 800 Microsoft Points or 10 bucks.
4285257	4290879	So prepare for those servers to be hammered like hell on Wednesday and Thursday to get that free game.
4290899	4292560	At least those live arcade games are tiny.
4292700	4295622	I mean, it's not like trying to download a Saints Row demo.
4295642	4298583	I don't think it'll be so bad, especially now that you do the background downloadings.
4299293	4300574	I think it'll be pretty nice.
4300795	4302856	I mean, you've got 48 hours.
4302916	4308561	I mean, sure, it'll be hammered, but it's Texas Hold'em, and the downloads are going to finish pretty quick, so... Oh, well.
4308761	4309662	That's pretty awesome, though.
4309922	4311843	Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see how this game turns out.
4311863	4313545	I'm sure we will have a review next week.
4313585	4320891	And, hey, if it's free, I expect our listeners to all be grabbing this on Wednesday or Thursday, and we could have, like, a really big poker tournament.
4320911	4323753	There's no excuse that you can't grab this game, so... Exactly.
4323773	4324073	Go get it.
4324233	4324894	And you know what?
4325655	4328217	It is supporting the camera, I think, so...
4329284	4330465	Yeah, great, great.
4330525	4331746	Strip poker for reals.
4331886	4333167	Not with the listeners, please.
4333227	4335168	K, thanks.
4335248	4340492	I will send a frowny face feedback for you if I see any skin.
4340972	4346056	Anyways, this week we've got a lot more things coming out other than just that Xbox Live Arcade game.
4347036	4348217	Lots of stuff in the U.S.
4348237	4355142	Well, maybe not a whole lot in the U.S., but starting off on the Game Boy Advance, you can get a wonderful Yu-Gi-Oh!
4355182	4356723	Double Pack, number two.
4357725	4387451	whoopee um Madden NFL of course coming out on every single system and um yeah you can have a merry Madden holiday um on Playstation 2 and the GameCube you can get Pac-Man World Rally which also features the king or not the king but the prince from Katamari so uh check that out on PC um some wonderful stuff also uh Pac-Man World Rally and Madden and hopefully Bad Day LA but I hear that it might actually be delayed a week so um
4388114	4388694	That's pretty cool.
4388774	4396777	And then one that I thought was kind of funny, and I didn't even realize there was a first to this, but Prison Tycoon 2 Maximum Security.
4397117	4398958	That sounds like an awesome game.
4400019	4400759	That's pretty funny.
4402580	4407121	On PlayStation 2 and the PSP, you can actually get World Championship Poker all in.
4408722	4412303	And then, of course, on the 360, just Madden.
4412523	4413864	So it's a very Madden week.
4414704	4416905	Next week is the week after that.
4418342	4422327	Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, and Bomberman.
4422347	4424850	Are you going to pick up that new Bomberman?
4424890	4427093	I wasn't too giddy about it when I saw it.
4428445	4431706	I'll wait and see because Konami is just sending me free stuff.
4431746	4437489	Jamie's not here tonight, so allow me to help out those of you folks over in the UK with what is coming out on your neck of the woods.
4437829	4442071	You guys, of course, also can download Texas Hold'em on the 23rd, so look out for that.
4442671	4451575	On the 25th, you're going to get Dig Dug Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, 99 Nights, which isn't as bad as they all say it is if you like the slashing games.
4452075	4465817	Reservoir Dogs, World War I, Aces of the Sky, and World War II Battle Over Europe And I like this one, it's a game called Let's Make a Soccer Team Coming from Sega of Europe That should be exciting Shouldn't it be Let's Make a Football Team?
4466438	4480280	Looking forward, that's what it's called Looking forward a little further to the week of September 1st You're going to have games such as Dance Factory Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover for PSP Dungeon Siege 2 you guys are finally getting
4480735	4483176	and Saints Row is also coming out for you guys.
4483256	4484596	It's about the same time we're getting it.
4484916	4497620	Star Fox Command on the DS, Test Drive Unlimited on the Xbox 360 and for those of you folks in the UK, a game that's near and dear to our hearts, Guitar-O-Man finally makes its way to the PSP and Guitar-O-Man lives September 1st.
4497700	4497980	Enjoy.
4499081	4499461	Pretty cool.
4500221	4509124	One thing coming out probably this fall from MadCatz is an Xbox Live Arcade Stick and it looks like an old kind of Atari controller.
4510225	4514186	And people are, I guess, jumping on this saying that it's going to be pretty cool.
4514446	4527191	It's supposed to also come with 100 Microsoft Points, one month free to Xbox Live Gold, and three Xbox Live Arcade games.
4527651	4529371	It's supposed to retail for $49.99.
4529431	4533853	They said it's supposed to be releasing in October.
4535053	4537534	And one thing, though, I got to mention, though, but just looking at this,
4538663	4539303	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4562628	4566951	You're not going to be able to play Street Fighter on this controller either, if you've taken a look at it.
4567432	4570574	I mean, it's looking like an old Atari controller.
4571455	4578780	And it basically has, you know, instead of a left analog stick, it's got a giant, just kind of like Atari joystick.
4579260	4581482	And then right next to that, the four buttons.
4581902	4583724	And below that, the right analog stick.
4584004	4587406	And to the left of that, the directional pad.
4587607	4592090	So it's like a big clusterfuck of stuff with a stick on there.
4592889	4600751	SSJ100Matt says, it looks like a crappy Photoshop and DJ Janai must have something against MadCatz because he calls them mad craps.
4601231	4604092	MadCatz is really terrible at making anything.
4604752	4608713	Didn't they make Pump It Up?
4608733	4608773	No.
4609254	4614155	They distributed the dance pad and I think they had a little part in it, but you know what?
4614495	4619977	That's okay because Pump, the greatness of Pump can outweigh the crappiness of MadCatz.
4621397	4621657	But
4622031	4623112	Oh, sorry, it was Mastiff.
4623132	4627555	Well, Mastiff had brought the game over here, but Mad Catz had to do with the past.
4627595	4629036	I knew Mad Catz did something with it.
4629857	4630457	I'm not crazy.
4631177	4632358	Well, it's not a Photoshop.
4632398	4639764	It is actually a sales sheet, and it was spotted on EB Games' website, and I'm sure we'll know more about this in a few weeks or so.
4640064	4640324	All right.
4640902	4647128	Well, something I'm sure you can lay down a pre-order for now, along with this joystick if you want it, is Prey 2.
4647949	4653074	Apparently in a recent interview with 3D Realms' Scott Miller, their team is already working on a Prey 2.
4654315	4665966	There's really not a lot else to say about it, but there is a quote I have for you guys, a quote from Scott Miller, quote, Prey 2, of course, we are addressing concerns about combat as well as adding in more gameplay innovations.
4667520	4669922	Very early, not a lot of hell else to say.
4670422	4671923	I hope they speed up multiplayer.
4671943	4675666	I did try multiplayer for the first time this week, and I was really disappointed.
4675766	4678008	Even after that... Well, go ahead.
4678448	4679069	Sorry, Loki.
4679454	4684437	Well, anyways, speaking of your bad multiplayer, they are going to be putting out a patch.
4684797	4688119	As far as I remember, I think it is already available for download.
4688520	4689580	A patch came out.
4690161	4692742	I can tell you, when I put in Prey the other day, it did patch.
4693223	4696064	But I'm hearing it didn't fix a damn thing with multiplayer, and it was supposed to.
4696585	4696805	Right?
4697805	4698446	Probably, yeah.
4698466	4708312	It was supposed to be fixing... Well, the one for the PC is supposed to be fixing multiplayer weapons, exploit, crash, I guess, on some of the machines when they're reading save games, and crash...
4709056	4710517	The startup of some machines.
4711038	4721626	And I know that they were talking about later on adding content as far as new characters, including some of the females that were actually in the game.
4721646	4722587	Like Jen and stuff?
4722827	4724328	Yeah, where you had to play as them.
4725289	4726490	I don't know if that's any cool.
4726910	4737559	But yeah, the Prey version 1.1 patch, it's basically just updating multiplayer browsers to fix servers and just a lot of server stuff.
4738527	4742191	The new content though, they are going to be charging for it.
4742631	4750679	They're adding six new playable characters, including Jen, Mother, and Becky, I guess a blonde victim.
4751437	4752858	and, uh, two hunter characters.
4752878	4754660	They're putting a victim as a playable character.
4754680	4763027	There's just... Okay, Becky, unless I'm just not far enough in the story yet, Becky is just somebody that gets, like, killed in the very beginning and you never learn her name.
4763107	4768771	She just... You just watch her get... A blonde victim that you occasionally see on Slab in a single-player parade.
4768831	4771393	Are they gonna have the guy, too, that always goes, Oh, God!
4771694	4772034	Oh, God!
4772054	4774276	There's always this random guy, like, when you see the little victim.
4774356	4776357	It's about alien abduction and the aliens are killing her.
4776377	4779420	Hunter and Elite Hunter are two hunter characters that they're adding.
4779560	4779960	Interesting.
4780140	4780821	So, uh...
4781581	4782342	That's interesting.
4782642	4782982	I don't know.
4783383	4788646	Now, our chat room is making all the mandatory Prey 2 jokes, and you can guess where this is going.
4788967	4792469	RavensDolphin says, Gee, I have to wait 11 years for the next Prey.
4793130	4796272	Funnydale says, I'll be waiting for Prey 2 when it's released in 2015.
4796372	4799054	Obviously making jokes about how long Prey was in development.
4799694	4801095	DJ Janai says, No Prey 2.
4801455	4803317	They need to finish Duke Nukem forever.
4803897	4804538	Exactly.
4805358	4806379	Stop getting distracted.
4806399	4806679	Stop it.
4806999	4808220	Make Duke Nukem forever.
4809021	4810662	They're getting way too distracted with that game.
4811480	4830594	Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to a break here Dragon Quest IX, it looks like it's happening, of course, this really shouldn't be much of a surprise Dragon Quest VIII kind of revived the series in a way here in the US I mean, sure we had VII, but it kind of didn't make the waves that VIII did
4831167	4834030	8 was truly like a return to... Poor Blimey.
4835471	4836412	Did you play Dragon Quest VIII, Drew?
4836532	4837694	Yeah, it was awesome.
4837714	4840076	Wasn't it like a Super Nintendo with next-gen graphics?
4840176	4842098	Yeah, it reminded me of Dragon Quest VI.
4842594	4844355	The World of Dragon Quest The Famicom Era
4865248	4868390	and how flattered he is with the orchestra's members' appreciation of the games.
4868830	4874333	He also happened to say, It should be pointed out that Sugiyama is 75 years old, so he may have forgot about any NDAs he was under.
4874353	4875574	But at the same time, come on.
4890429	4892950	Obviously they're making a Dragon Quest IX at some point.
