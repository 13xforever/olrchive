00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:26,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, August 27th, 2006, Rob and Loki report on the Konami BBQ, how was that Nintendo press conference this week anyway, and how many Xbox Live points will you need to spend to play a full game of Luminous?

2
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:36,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:42,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that independent podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

4
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:43,759
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:46,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky and I'm here on this journey with you every single week.

6
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us in our party, say hello to our resident black mage, DarkSakura.

7
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuego.

8
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:55,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Also known as Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:55,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuego.

10
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:55,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuego 3.

11
00:00:56,043 --> 00:00:56,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Fern.

12
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:56,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Fern.

13
00:00:56,943 --> 00:00:57,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Fern.

14
00:00:58,323 --> 00:00:59,384
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,253
[SPEAKER_03]: We had this all scheduled out like months in advance before we even realized.

16
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:35,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So the baby bats came out in full force on Sunday, so we avoided Haunted Mansion.

17
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:41,604
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just imagine what Haunted Mansion looks like on goth day.

18
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:42,545
[SPEAKER_03]: They converged.

19
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:49,311
[SPEAKER_03]: While all the baby bats, there were a few legitimate old bats, but there were a lot of baby bats, you know, Hot Topic, Wannabe...

20
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:56,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the old days when we used to have to shop in fetish stores and thrift shops and make our own clothes.

21
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I read Pirates a bunch of times, and the second time we decided to sing through it.

22
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:08,027
[SPEAKER_03]: And we called Barbossa Dreamboat Barbie, because he was up on his boat.

23
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,028
[SPEAKER_03]: The changes they made to Pirates were cool.

24
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:11,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

25
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:13,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought most people have been saying they kind of suck.

26
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:18,067
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the PC changes, and then they changed a few things back and added in the movie characters.

27
00:02:18,327 --> 00:02:18,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's good.

28
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:20,789
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the Jack stuff was like, oh, Jack.

29
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:23,390
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Haunted Mansion, they actually changed part of it.

30
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:38,219
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've ever been in Haunted Mansion, the attic with the bride, where she's all tragic and sad, instead now they've made her a bit more sinister, where you go by different paintings of her and her various husbands and their heads all disappear.

31
00:02:39,048 --> 00:02:40,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

32
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:57,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it was fun.

33
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see anything.

34
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,820
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Space Mountain is cool.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,640
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to be careful not to become the amusement park podcast because we do want to get to games here.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:04,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I do play games.

38
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, tell us about what your gaming week was.

39
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you play this week?

40
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Dead Rising, which was freaking rad.

41
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not any good at it.

42
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, I died so many times.

43
00:03:15,923 --> 00:03:19,464
[SPEAKER_03]: But I figured out that I like the scythe because it decapitates the undead.

44
00:03:20,746 --> 00:03:22,448
[SPEAKER_03]: and played Super Mario Bros.

45
00:03:22,488 --> 00:03:22,828
[SPEAKER_03]: finally.

46
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:23,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a free copy.

47
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, technically GameStop got a free copy and it became mine.

48
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:33,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a bunch of that in the waiting room at the doctor's office the other day.

49
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Gameboys are great to have in a doctor's office.

50
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some DDA and I'm kind of still okay at it.

51
00:03:43,553 --> 00:03:50,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of avoided the arcade though at Disneyland because it's like the spawn of people are hanging around.

52
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And my quote from Disneyland though, best quote ever, this just totally makes me decide never to have children.

53
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:00,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wear the teacups!

54
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the eh part was a lot longer.

55
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:07,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

56
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ride the teacups?

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.

59
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:13,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sang a merry birthday while riding the teacups.

60
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the lollipops, by the way, from Disneyland.

61
00:04:15,023 --> 00:04:15,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

62
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they fabulous?

63
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:16,684
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great.

64
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:19,405
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is shaped very phallically.

65
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:20,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just leave it at that.

66
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:22,147
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that one's for Rob.

67
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:22,627
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long.

68
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:24,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, any other games?

69
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I had lots of smoothies.

70
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:27,590
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

71
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I played games this week.

72
00:04:32,312 --> 00:04:33,433
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I played...

73
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:39,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing a lot of Xbox Live's demos, including Just Cause, which is awesome.

74
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:44,649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, I don't know, it's kind of like, not really Grand Theft Auto-ish.

75
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can steal cars and stuff.

76
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: But it reminds me of, like, you were to take Lara Croft Tomb Raider, replace Lara Croft with Antonio Banderas, and then stick her in, like, a Grand Theft Auto game, and then...

77
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, just add a bunch of stunts to it.

78
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much the game.

79
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:05,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can do a lot of really cool stuff like jumping from car to car.

80
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:06,946
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it really simple.

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:12,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can steal a car, jump onto the roof, and then hit your parachute and just parasail around.

82
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:14,574
[SPEAKER_04]: and just really crazy stuff.

83
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:22,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a whole lot of Mexican music blaring and lots of Viva La Revolucion and stuff like that.

84
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:26,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty cool and definitely worth picking up when it comes out.

85
00:05:26,898 --> 00:05:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And the demo is also pretty cool.

86
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,080
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you about four different people to kill.

87
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to the point where there were helicopters chasing after me and I blew up one of the helicopters and it exploded very fiery.

88
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:41,600
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was awesome, so definitely recommend that.

89
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:42,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course,

90
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried a little bit of Texas Hold'em and played like a game and just said eh.

91
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:51,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll play it later when it's not so buggy.

92
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what else did I play?

93
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I got a retail copy of Saints Row four days early.

94
00:05:58,321 --> 00:06:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to play a little bit of that and then I'll probably play more this weekend.

95
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:12,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think that... Oh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories because that's still fucking awesome and we're still going to be playing it until...

96
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:20,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice City Stories comes out and then we're going to have the official switching of the game and you'll play that for a year until San Andreas Stories comes out.

97
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:24,235
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was kind of not that eventful.

98
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't actually play a whole lot.

99
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:32,421
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as new stuff goes, I checked out Texas Hold'em, which was free on Xbox Live, so I downloaded that and played it.

100
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:38,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of funny, I just was randomly up really late on Tuesday, so at 1am when the game was released, I actually downloaded it.

101
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:45,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, in not even like 10 minutes, I get an invite into an Xbox Live game, and it was actually being run by another podcaster, Godfrey.

102
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:54,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Over at Gamertag So it was kind of cool that we were getting together and playing on the Xbox Live As far as Texas Hold'em goes How I like the game itself

103
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:56,716
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

104
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Even $10 than anything else that's out there on the market.

105
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that they put the game out now.

106
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being that there's also two more poker games coming out, all in poker.

107
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:35,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And, what was it?

108
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:38,816
[SPEAKER_04]: No, World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions are both coming out.

109
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, they're both going to be like $39.99, but still, I mean, you have this free game for Texas Hold'em.

110
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I going to go buy a $40 game now?

111
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and granted, it might be more polished, but

112
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:51,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a free game.

113
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:52,605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Texas Hold'em.

114
00:07:52,645 --> 00:07:55,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't really jazz up Texas Hold'em too much.

115
00:07:55,428 --> 00:08:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the nicest thing about it is that most of my friends online have it, so there's always at least one game we can play together, but I don't know.

116
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:06,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish the pacing of the game could be sped up, especially in single player.

117
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:09,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I've already folded, I just want them to run through it.

118
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to watch bad...

119
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:12,272
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

120
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't know, that was kind of neat.

121
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do like the concept of having one bankroll that you build and build through.

122
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,142
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, when you make bets, you can't just restart with a brand new bank.

123
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:38,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you make a bet that will impact your entire history on Xbox Live, you could bet it all away.

124
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I like that concept.

125
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

126
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll give the game credit for that.

127
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:44,965
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess it looks good for an Xbox Live game.

128
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:49,026
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, why does it always pan up on the table, deal, and then pan back down?

129
00:08:49,066 --> 00:08:51,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, every time, I didn't get that at all.

130
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the weird things.

131
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it was supposed to support the camera.

132
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:57,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Godfrey had a camera, and he said it wasn't doing anything.

133
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

134
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:00,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

135
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free.

136
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:02,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't complain about free things.

137
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So what can I say?

138
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was worth checking out.

139
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:09,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you haven't already downloaded it, I don't think it's worth the $10.

140
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:11,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe download the demo, see if you like it.

141
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

142
00:09:12,876 --> 00:09:15,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're really into poker, maybe you'll like it.

143
00:09:15,357 --> 00:09:17,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But you probably already got it if you're really into poker.

144
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking something.

145
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:24,356
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that game that's coming out or the collection of the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged that's coming out.

146
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:28,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that Texas Hold'em is going to be probably patched later on.

147
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:33,899
[SPEAKER_04]: But Live Arcade Unplugged is for people that don't have live or don't have an internet connection.

148
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be buying this game and getting a really buggy copy.

149
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're only playing single player anyway.

150
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but still though, it's still buggy.

151
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:43,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

152
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: DeathJr2 on the PSP

153
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:14,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked a lot better.

154
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely rebuilt from the ground up and looks like the graphics are a lot better.

155
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:24,248
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I mean, I've kind of outgrown the platform games like that, so it's not really appealing to me.

156
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anybody, you know, really is into that stuff, I think it's definitely a game that would be worth picking up.

157
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:33,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the game definitely looked more polished to me than the first game in the series that they released.

158
00:10:34,173 --> 00:10:37,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I know fans of the series will be really happy that they can play as Pandora now.

159
00:10:38,676 --> 00:10:42,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they were talking about how they fixed a lot of the camera because of complaints in the first game.

160
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:46,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And the camera, you know, it felt like a typical platformer to me when I played it.

161
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did get to put hands on on it and it was kind of nice.

162
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,552
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do like strafing and all this other stuff too that felt really good.

163
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,675
[SPEAKER_05]: I also thought it was neat because you can play co-op through the entire game.

164
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:59,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just selected levels or modes, but you can play co-op with a friend through the whole game.

165
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill Origins PSP Silent Evil 4

166
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like what they did with it.

167
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost seems like they're going to be going more of an action route, more Resident Evil type.

168
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:44,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself looks really good, even though it wasn't hardly done at all.

169
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like 30% or something.

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of placeholder stuff, but it looked really good.

171
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:52,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very impressed by what they were showing us on the PSP.

172
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Fans of Silent Hill are actually going to be really pleased.

173
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though we're joking a little bit about the whole over-the-shoulder camera switch,

174
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:01,755
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely has that Silent Hill feel that you guys are used to.

175
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:08,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourteen new Akira Yamaoka songs, four of which have the vocals from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, so that's going to be awesome.

176
00:12:09,302 --> 00:12:15,147
[SPEAKER_05]: One third of the town comes from the original game, and then they added a new two thirds to the town, so that's pretty cool.

177
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looked pretty cool just as far as, like, I like the weapons that you can select and stuff.

178
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:25,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And how they have the automatic cameras for when you're going in different spots.

179
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:30,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It will actually, you know, do the Silent Hill cameras, you know, where really high shot or low shot.

180
00:12:30,838 --> 00:12:32,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was kind of cool how, like, you could do the...

181
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:34,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

182
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Sledgehammer, Tire Iron, Shovel

183
00:13:24,824 --> 00:13:36,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean bludgeoning the crap out of creatures with a sledgehammer instead of maybe just a weak woman or something trying to beat up something with whatever.

184
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:38,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Trading Card Game coming to DS, PSP, and the PC

185
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:58,818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

186
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:21,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007

187
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:44,923
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007?

188
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:07,821
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

189
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I love how when you paused it, you know, I'm not really super into sports games, but I do love me some soccer.

190
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great sport.

191
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to play it when I was a kid.

192
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:24,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Little known fact.

193
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:28,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love the fact when you pause the game, it's almost like, remember when you paused the game in Super Smash Bros.

194
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:29,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Melee?

195
00:15:29,557 --> 00:15:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: You could spin the camera around, like, anywhere you want and zoom in.

196
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it does that with the soccer.

197
00:15:35,581 --> 00:15:38,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can slowly move it forward and slowly move it back.

198
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:41,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, it's so detailed that you see the eyes on the people's faces.

199
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:41,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

200
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:42,867
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

201
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,134
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gateway Soccer Game Shallon's Showdown

202
00:16:35,513 --> 00:16:38,994
[SPEAKER_04]: The animations are good, and it's kind of fun to play, but I don't get it.

203
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get the point to it, because the way the game is set up, I mean, it's almost like Power Stone, where you're kind of fighting stuff, but I don't know if it was just a demo I was playing, but I kept killing robots, and they just kept respawning, and I did that for about 15 minutes, and nothing happened.

204
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it maybe just because it was supposed to be a tech demo, or it wasn't really the game?

205
00:16:58,621 --> 00:16:59,402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.

206
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:02,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I hope this is the case, but by reading most of the descriptions of it,

207
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:07,964
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like that's not really the case, and, I mean, it's really good looking.

208
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's supposed to be out November 14th.

209
00:17:09,864 --> 00:17:12,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's really good looking, I just, I don't get it.

210
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:21,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe if, maybe this is just part of the game, and I'm not seeing, you know, I'm thinking that's probably what it was, you know, but it looks very good.

211
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and fans of the show will definitely like it.

212
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:32,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you're a fan of the show, the head writers from the show wrote all the dialogue, and there's six playable characters in the game, the four main characters to start, and you get two bad guys that are unlockable later on.

213
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:33,001
[SPEAKER_05]: D.S.

214
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:33,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Gameplay

215
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:56,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Coated Arms Contingent.

216
00:17:57,414 --> 00:18:11,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the original Coated Arms, didn't care for it at all, and I'm liking how they're going to be actually... A couple things, they're doing more of a variety of environments, and they're actually set stages, so it's not all this random generated stuff.

217
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:22,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, the random generated stuff is kind of cool, and maybe they have a mode like that or something separate from the game, but the actual game, it's not so good.

218
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:24,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do like...

219
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,430
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

220
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of the new details that they added to it.

221
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot more polished in how you can map all your keys and stuff to your own configurations.

222
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

223
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Coated Arms, not my cup of tea either, but if you're a fan of the series, multiplayer is going to be up to eight players from four players.

224
00:18:40,594 --> 00:18:46,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game is scheduled for March 2007, which is supposedly the time the PlayStation 3 version is coming out as well.

225
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:47,455
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is separate stories.

226
00:18:47,495 --> 00:18:50,956
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP and the PS3 versions are separate stories in the series.

227
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:51,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

228
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Lunar Nights from Kojima Productions

229
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you have some first-person modes in there as well.

230
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely heavily use the elements in the game.

231
00:19:21,971 --> 00:19:29,417
[SPEAKER_05]: You draw on the screen, like when you're using an air element, you kind of twirl the stylus on the screen to create a tornado, which was kind of cute.

232
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:34,781
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played through the first level of the demo, and it was pretty cool.

233
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:36,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

234
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:38,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.

235
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:42,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very awesome to see, especially since, you know,

236
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:51,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about a lot of people out there, but I didn't like Metal Gear Acid, didn't care for it at all, and kind of, you know, hoping that they'd put out an actual Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.

237
00:19:51,646 --> 00:20:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one looks really cool, they're doing a lot of elements, or adding a lot of things that they didn't have in the other games, like the, where you actually have a squad now of three members, that was pretty cool.

238
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:04,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is the Metal Gear game that fans wanted a year ago, so...

239
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,721
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes place six years after the Snake Eater story.

240
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:15,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like... Did you notice that in the little trailer, it looks like the cutscenes are borrowed from that comic book game they put out?

241
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:16,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the comic book Metal Gear?

242
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:18,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I thought that was really cool.

243
00:20:18,447 --> 00:20:21,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I love that look that the Metal Gear comic thing had.

244
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:25,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then you have the whole comrade thing where you build your own team.

245
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,912
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to be kind of the niche of this game.

246
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,514
[SPEAKER_05]: You build your own team of people, and then you use people together.

247
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You switch from one character to another.

248
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:40,344
[SPEAKER_05]: and go back and forth and that's how you can take out other guys in the area that might be hard to get to.

249
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:44,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Sniper who's got you in his sights, maybe use somebody else to take out the sniper.

250
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of cool.

251
00:20:45,988 --> 00:20:47,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Full voiceovers in the cinematics.

252
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,172
[SPEAKER_05]: The original voice actors are all back for this game.

253
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:58,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And just an FYI, there's supposedly a ninja character that I don't know if we're supposed to mention because they wouldn't say much about it there.

254
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,143
[SPEAKER_05]: But a whole lot of more information is supposed to be released on this Tokyo Game Show.

255
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:03,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And supposedly some sort of box...

256
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:06,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydeen Systems.

257
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:20,892
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

258
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's one I have a ton of things to say about.

259
00:21:23,874 --> 00:21:25,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

260
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:25,975
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of this?

261
00:21:26,315 --> 00:21:27,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

262
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:28,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the game a lot.

263
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:29,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played it quite a bit.

264
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:33,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, typical Castlevania game, but it looks very good.

265
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very impressed with what they've done with the DS.

266
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was incredibly impressed that they had an anime cut...

267
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:44,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Intro, you know, it's like... What is up with Konami Love for the handhelds this year?

268
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,484
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much all we saw.

269
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:53,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, seriously, almost every game we saw had at least one version being made for the PSP or the DS.

270
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, every single game we saw, except for Elebits, the Karaoke Revolution game, and the DDRs.

271
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, everything else had a handheld.

272
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:05,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they even bother with the PSP since the sales are kind of crap in Japan?

273
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:18,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, what it comes down to is, I think there was even some study out there that said that handhelds are actually more popular than console games, which, you know, the facts don't really show that, but I don't know.

274
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just... A game like Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is going to sell PSPs.

275
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, maybe that's part of it.

276
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:27,042
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe because it's got the muscle there.

277
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:29,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the other thing about Portable Ops?

278
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,182
[SPEAKER_04]: It utilizes the GPS, supposedly.

279
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:34,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hot.

280
00:22:34,343 --> 00:22:35,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

281
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:37,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.

282
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:42,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love, you can use, okay, first off, you have to understand, they've made some big changes to the basic formula.

283
00:22:42,854 --> 00:22:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you swap between two characters at the touch of a button.

284
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:53,418
[SPEAKER_05]: You swap between Jonathan, who's kind of a traditional Belmont-style character, and then Charlotte, who's like magic and intellect-based.

285
00:22:53,718 --> 00:23:01,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I thought it was kind of cool, because you hold down the button to charge your magic, and the longer you're able to hold it down, the more powerful the attack is, and the graphics match that.

286
00:23:01,242 --> 00:23:02,082
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of neat.

287
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:05,346
[SPEAKER_05]: She can stop time, heal, boost stats, all that stuff.

288
00:23:05,787 --> 00:23:12,614
[SPEAKER_05]: But by a touch of another button, you bring them both on the screen at the same time to solve simple puzzles, which I thought was pretty cool.

289
00:23:12,914 --> 00:23:14,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here's the greatest thing.

290
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:17,499
[SPEAKER_05]: You finally get to go outside the damn castle.

291
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,103
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the portraits are all about, is that the bad guy paints these portraits and

292
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:23,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's somehow how he's cast control over the castle.

293
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario did it!

294
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

295
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:30,609
[SPEAKER_05]: You go into these portraits and they take you to levels that are not inside a castle.

296
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to go to an Egyptian level that's called Sandy Grave.

297
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,973
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to a town level that's called the City of Haze.

298
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:37,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Boss Rush Mode

299
00:23:56,673 --> 00:24:00,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, something they weren't saying a lot of details about was the shop mode.

300
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:05,880
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a shop mode that's going to be Wi-Fi as well, that you're going to be able to trade items across the internet.

301
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,942
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like really sketchy details.

302
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:16,108
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I was piecing together, it sounded like you'd be able to buy things from other people's shops that you didn't want, but kind of make trades like that.

303
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have items or something, you can sell them almost like an auction market type thing.

304
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: More details to come at Tokyo Game Show.

305
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:25,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Paris, by the way, seemed to be a recurring theme in this game.

306
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:27,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice there were the vampire bad guys?

307
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:32,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Stella and Loretta were some of these female vampire antagonist characters.

308
00:24:32,163 --> 00:24:33,283
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of interesting.

309
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:36,404
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you enjoyed last year's Castlevania, this one's going to up the ante.

310
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:37,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're going to be very, very impressed.

311
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

312
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:41,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

313
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this game is going to be huge.

314
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:53,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's necessarily going to be the hardcore gamer crowd that gets into this game, but I just think this is going to be a very accessible game for mainstream America, especially the fact that it's based off American Idol.

315
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:12,934
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 Only

316
00:25:42,185 --> 00:25:45,946
[SPEAKER_05]: and I thought the Xbox with the downloadable expansions and stuff was a great idea.

317
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess if the game does well, they'll probably port it to other platforms.

318
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:56,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the Xbox right now, they're kind of considering not doing that because the Xbox is pretty much at the end of its cycle.

319
00:25:56,949 --> 00:26:02,731
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS2 is going to be going on for a while, but you don't want to put out a game that's pretty much, you know, who's going to really buy it?

320
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:08,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's transitioning over to the Xbox 360 and they're not ready to put out a next-gen version of it, so...

321
00:26:09,457 --> 00:26:10,377
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

322
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:37,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice how wild and crazy a lot of people at that party were, especially during that American Idol contest and things of that nature?

323
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:44,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you notice the journalist from... I'm not 100% positive where he's from, so I shouldn't name it unless I have my facts proof.

324
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:49,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But he walks in and holds up this bottle of like 40 or something and everybody's cheering.

325
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:50,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just thinking to myself...

326
00:26:51,816 --> 00:26:53,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I didn't know what to think.

327
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:55,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, one part of me thinks it's funny.

328
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,000
[SPEAKER_03]: How about hypocrite?

329
00:26:56,241 --> 00:27:02,967
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the other part of me thinks this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever... Wasn't it weird being there, Loki?

330
00:27:03,327 --> 00:27:05,269
[SPEAKER_04]: It was weird, and here's why it's weird.

331
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:11,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Because on the show, it's fine to fuck around every once in a while because you make it a disclaimer.

332
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:15,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I wouldn't do that if I was on TV, maybe, because that might be a little...

333
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:17,385
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

334
00:27:32,034 --> 00:27:33,034
[SPEAKER_04]: A company barbecue.

335
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:35,415
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that at your company barbecue, but you know what?

336
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:36,835
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do business here.

337
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:37,936
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a business thing.

338
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:39,376
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing interviews.

339
00:27:39,816 --> 00:27:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting information, the report to the press and stuff.

340
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:47,598
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to be... Look, I got 40s!

341
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:49,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get wasted, man!

342
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I was like, that is so... I just was in awe.

343
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what to think.

344
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:01,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, I can't believe that's... That would be funny if I was not at a professional gaming event.

345
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:02,223
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

346
00:28:18,562 --> 00:28:21,345
[SPEAKER_05]: in the whole freaking building that was taking notes on a laptop.

347
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, some of the other journalists were doing the old-fashioned pen and paper thing, but I'm thinking to myself, you all work for dot-coms, and you're all on the tech edge of things, and I just thought it was really surprising, because I don't know, I personally, maybe it's a thing they teach you in journalist school, I don't know, but I type fast, so if I want to be able to make a ton of notes, I'm going to type them out of my laptop, I'm not going to try and write everything.

348
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: because my handwriting is god-awful.

349
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was kind of surprised that I was like the only one that had a laptop there.

350
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Something is really wrong with the mainstreaming gaming press, you guys, and I'm not afraid to say it, so whatever.

351
00:28:54,492 --> 00:28:54,812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

352
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:58,474
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a ton of people there from like IGN and 1UP and stuff.

353
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:00,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they had like stacks of like 10 people.

354
00:29:00,736 --> 00:29:04,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Ziff Davis IGN Bay Area dot-commer club.

355
00:29:05,418 --> 00:29:07,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, and you know, I do feel bad.

356
00:29:07,339 --> 00:29:12,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how many small press were there, but I'm sure that, you know, I don't know if they were in the same, but we were, but we were like

357
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:13,666
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:41,316
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

359
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:12,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have some stealth stuff in there, which was pretty cool.

360
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,448
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

361
00:30:13,608 --> 00:30:24,275
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I appreciated this game a lot more, being able to see it a little closer and hands-on than I did at E3, and it was kind of cool to be next to a Wii again without having to wait in a five-hour line, I have to admit.

362
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:33,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, like if this game came out for the same price as like Zelda, Metroid, Mario, there's no way I could justify buying it.

363
00:30:33,513 --> 00:30:38,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I mean the game looked kind of fun, but it didn't look $39.99 fun to me.

364
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:46,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe it's just because we were only seeing one aspect of the game, but seriously, I hope that this game is a little bit lower of a price point.

365
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will be much more successful if they aim that way.

366
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um...

367
00:30:53,262 --> 00:30:57,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you exactly what the price is going to be on this.

368
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,489
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly, I think it was $49.99.

369
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:03,773
[SPEAKER_04]: No, see, that's too much.

370
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it changes.

371
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:05,875
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

372
00:31:06,636 --> 00:31:08,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick housekeeping thing as well.

373
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:10,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to say about the press event?

374
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

375
00:31:11,962 --> 00:31:15,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I like it.

376
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank them first off for inviting us down there.

377
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:22,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks guys for taking a chance and inviting some of the independent press.

378
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:23,585
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

379
00:31:24,105 --> 00:31:26,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool to check it out and stuff.

380
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I love going to those things.

381
00:31:28,766 --> 00:31:31,266
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I don't know.

382
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:33,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Gamer's Day better, I think.

383
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:34,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Gamer's Day was a little more.

384
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sad that DDR wasn't there.

385
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go to work.

386
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:40,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, because you had the time off for Disneyland.

387
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have really enjoyed Disneyland.

388
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:46,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I did enjoy Disneyland very much.

389
00:31:46,716 --> 00:31:49,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say some real quick housekeeping things.

390
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is a mini episode.

391
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have said that at the top of the episode.

392
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,580
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not going to be a Part B tonight.

393
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And the DDR Power Previews will start next week.

394
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is only on the live stream.

395
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:06,487
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be listening live and you'll get to hear some brand new DDR songs from the Ultramix 4 VRare and Universe VRare

396
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:35,594
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can't say anything about it you know we're not supposed to talk about you know what we're playing and all that stuff yet but you know I can't help but say something because I got to hear some of the tracks and everything one of the songs we're playing next week like take a really dark DDR song and make it even darker like the remix so it's like oh it's so cool it's so cool so you'll hear it next week that's all I have to say I'm sorry they haven't set a price yet for Elements okay thank you for the clarification

397
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,062
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let's get into other gaming news from around the world.

398
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:42,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is definitely other news.

399
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:51,524
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one up, actually, well, you realize that Nintendo has been hanging out in Germany with their fun little press conference, right?

400
00:32:51,904 --> 00:32:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their game conference, I should say.

401
00:32:53,844 --> 00:33:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even though they are still not giving a definite price on the Wii, there has been a slight leak.

402
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:12,867
[SPEAKER_03]: from the head of German operations, saying they expect a price below 250 euros, which would be $321.50.

403
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:19,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's still more of the same.

404
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's still saying that they expect it to be as far as 25,000 yen in Japan, which is $223 here.

405
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And no more than 250 in the U.S., so it's basically more of the same.

406
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:34,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing specific.

407
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:36,159
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

408
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts on that?

409
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of surprises there.

410
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,421
[SPEAKER_05]: $250 is kind of the price we're all thinking anyway.

411
00:33:42,601 --> 00:33:49,244
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically, if I think, come out and said the same thing, like no less than $250, at least in the U.S., no less than $249 or whatever.

412
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:52,388
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was not the only news that they announced.

413
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:55,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, or I should say that came from Let's Big.

414
00:33:56,511 --> 00:34:00,855
[SPEAKER_04]: They did announce two new games, Mario Strikers Charged and Battalion Wars 2.

415
00:34:01,796 --> 00:34:06,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Mario Strikers Charged is a follow-up to the GameCube game and looks pretty awesome.

416
00:34:06,701 --> 00:34:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a little edgy soccer game for them, I guess.

417
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:11,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Battalion Wars 2 is just awesome.

418
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:17,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, actually, they have some video footage on game trailers that I was

419
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:46,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Saw on Link 2 on Kotaku And it looks pretty sweet I mean, I never really got into the first Battalion Wars But a very cool little game And definitely showing off some pretty good graphics for the Wii So, I'm looking forward to that stuff Of course, I like this It's kind of referring to Battalion Wars 2 as B-Wii You know, because, you know, too funny But, yeah, it's supposed to be pretty cool

420
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,421
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii is coming out soon.

421
00:35:12,253 --> 00:35:12,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

422
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:16,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, soon will be answered on September 14th.

423
00:35:16,435 --> 00:35:26,059
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty sure this is the real deal because Nintendo has sent out special invites for a celebration of video games.

424
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:37,264
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo of America president, our dear buddy Reggie, Phil's aim, will be there in person and he's going to be promoting, quote unquote, the upcoming lineup.

425
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie?

426
00:35:38,424 --> 00:35:38,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

427
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our invite?

428
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

429
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we don't get 3 million unique page views a month, so we have to stay home.

430
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:57,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how formal or informal this event is going to be, but seriously, since this is going to be a really big deal, IGN, I'd leave your 40s at home.

431
00:35:58,928 --> 00:35:59,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I went there.

432
00:35:59,909 --> 00:36:00,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there.

433
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care anymore, we're just going to do our thing.

434
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:30,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

435
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:41,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've looked in the forums lately, but we did start a brand new thread, thank you very much, Rob, about stuff that we report on the show that's kind of under the radar, as we like to put it.

436
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:55,892
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, for example, they announced officially about the Xbox Live Unplugged Volume 1, as we reported weeks ago, and other things of that nature and stuff, and we're going to be continuing to add to that each week with new stuff.

437
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,394
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I want to point out, this is not an ego thing.

438
00:37:00,214 --> 00:37:01,575
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very humble people.

439
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:04,156
[SPEAKER_05]: We love the fact that we're independent.

440
00:37:04,196 --> 00:37:07,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We have such great listeners and folks that listen to us.

441
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:10,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We just are keeping this list for ourselves.

442
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:17,623
[SPEAKER_05]: When people call us liars and that we're full of shit over here, I just want it on the record somewhere.

443
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're doing.

444
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:21,353
[SPEAKER_05]: So join in the fun.

445
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:21,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the thread.

446
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:22,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

447
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:35,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And personally, my personal thing here is I don't like reporting something and then having another press outlet report the same thing and then it spreads like wildfire and everyone takes it as gospel as they were the first ones to have the story.

448
00:37:35,652 --> 00:37:37,574
[SPEAKER_04]: That's never happened to us ever.

449
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:39,555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of an ego-boosting thing, but it never happened.

450
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:44,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, anywho, okay, so that never happened when 1UP picked the Konami release date story.

451
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care tonight.

452
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't care tonight.

453
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

454
00:37:47,502 --> 00:37:47,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

455
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:49,123
[SPEAKER_02]: We're independent.

456
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:50,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care tonight.

457
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:50,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously don't.

458
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:51,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Not after Wednesday.

459
00:37:51,925 --> 00:37:53,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to report a couple things.

460
00:37:53,226 --> 00:37:58,911
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, you remember there's the news of Bullet Witch being put out in the United States by Atari.

461
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:00,492
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a date for you.

462
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:04,398
[SPEAKER_04]: February 21st is when you can expect that game, assuming there's no date changes.

463
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, a new Wii launch title, or in the launch window, I guess, as you would put it.

464
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:12,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Shrek Smash and Crash for the Wii.

465
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a Mario Kart-style game featuring Shrek characters.

466
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopty shit.

467
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:24,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopty shit, yes, but it is coming out on the Wii December 15th for $39.99, so look forward to that.

468
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,792
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you're here first, so.

469
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:31,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other US release dates that we should be aware of coming up?

470
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:32,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

471
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,482
[SPEAKER_04]: This week is actually going to be pretty awesome.

472
00:38:35,244 --> 00:38:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of 360 stuff.

473
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:39,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman, Act Zero is going to be coming out.

474
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,974
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got Enchanted Arms coming out on the 360.

475
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:43,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's this week?

476
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:44,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's this week.

477
00:38:44,857 --> 00:38:45,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I'm gonna get that.

478
00:38:45,918 --> 00:38:53,300
[SPEAKER_04]: But Enchanted Arms got... It said Enchanted Arms is good if you like RPG cliches, because the game is... I love RPG cliches!

479
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then it's for you!

480
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Great!

481
00:38:55,341 --> 00:39:00,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, my personal favorite, which I already got because I'm special, of course, Saints Row.

482
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

483
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:04,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight?

484
00:39:04,403 --> 00:39:04,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

485
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, whatever.

486
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:07,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Our egos need a lashing tonight.

487
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:08,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

488
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:09,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, make fun of us, please.

489
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,206
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gay.

490
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

491
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:15,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki, you're gay.

492
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not gay.

493
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But we won't hold that against you.

494
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:22,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is another one for you, Rob.

495
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:27,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Fox Command comes out this coming week, which is going to be pretty awesome.

496
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:29,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be honest?

497
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:32,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of stopped caring about Star Fox a long time ago.

498
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:34,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.

499
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly right.

500
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:38,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.

501
00:39:38,694 --> 00:39:42,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you play that abortion of a GameCube Star Fox game?

502
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:45,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, Star Fox 64.

503
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:51,234
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to play Star Fox 64 during lunches in high school.

504
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer, four-player deathmatches.

505
00:39:53,614 --> 00:39:54,475
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the shit.

506
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:57,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out, but I'm not going to spend... I want a demo.

507
00:39:57,616 --> 00:40:00,716
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the Wi-Fi multiplayer deathmatches.

508
00:40:01,216 --> 00:40:09,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, then again, you know Wi-Fi... You know what, Loki, why don't you buy it, and then you can let me play it, and then I'll let you borrow Enchanted Arms or something, and you can have fun with your RPG cliches.

509
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:10,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

510
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:10,719
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

511
00:40:11,851 --> 00:40:13,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, there's other places in the world.

512
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,893
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Eddie, are you aware there's other countries?

513
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:17,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

514
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:18,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still got some more.

515
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost done.

516
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:20,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

517
00:40:21,094 --> 00:40:23,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenosaga 3 is also coming out on PlayStation 2.

518
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Disgaea 2 is coming out this week, which is going to be pretty cool.

519
00:40:29,237 --> 00:40:33,359
[SPEAKER_04]: One Piece, Grand Adventure, if you like anime fighting games, pretty cool.

520
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:40,381
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not into that kind of stuff, on the PSP, there's going to be Def Jam Fight for New York, the take

521
00:40:41,107 --> 00:40:43,048
[SPEAKER_04]: TakeOver, TakeDown, I can't remember which it was.

522
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:45,170
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we also coming out?

523
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:46,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look for those.

524
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,173
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed to do a game called Thingy.

525
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,436
[SPEAKER_05]: You could author the game, I don't know.

526
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:55,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a game.

527
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone should hire me to design a game.

528
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be awesome.

529
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be called Jamie's Awesome Game.

530
00:41:02,882 --> 00:41:07,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, speaking of awesome, we have the release dates over in the UK.

531
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:07,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

532
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I already went over them the week before, but actually today.

533
00:41:14,304 --> 00:41:15,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I touched on some last week too.

534
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:18,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I guess would be yesterday now in the UK.

535
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:20,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we're pre-taping this week, so it's actually Friday night.

536
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:21,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Friday night.

537
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,293
[SPEAKER_03]: The Reservoir Dogs Madden 2007, which was a big whoopty shit in my book.

538
00:41:26,054 --> 00:41:28,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dan had to be there for the Madden sale.

539
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny.

540
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:34,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Make a Soccer Team and Dig Dug Digging Strike.

541
00:41:35,041 --> 00:41:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

542
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:39,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Also now coming out on the 1st, which is ironically my wedding anniversary.

543
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:49,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Age of Pirates, Caribbean Tales, AND1 Streetball, Birth of America.

544
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that little snort at the end there?

545
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:55,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

546
00:41:56,086 --> 00:41:59,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it funny because that game's coming out in the UK?

547
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:01,369
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of funny.

548
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, hey, Revolutionary War, the game.

549
00:42:04,332 --> 00:42:04,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee!

550
00:42:06,155 --> 00:42:08,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's kick some Yankee ass!

551
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:30,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New York The Takeover on PSP, Dungeon Siege 2 Broken World, Me Sneezing the Game, Guitar Man Lives, Saints Row, Star Fox Command, Test Drive Unlimited, Gangs of London.

552
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the 6th, The Scramble.

553
00:42:35,164 --> 00:42:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

554
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:41,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very sorry for everybody over there because they don't get Dead Rising until the 8th and that makes me cry because Dead Rising is awesome.

555
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,091
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're getting it pretty soon.

556
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:45,313
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're getting Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the 8th as well.

557
00:42:45,493 --> 00:42:47,794
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're not getting it 28 days later.

558
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:51,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so funny.

559
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:52,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's a gun?

560
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can whack them over the head with a Guitar Hero controller.

561
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things are pretty heavy.

562
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:58,061
[SPEAKER_05]: G-H-O-U-L

563
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they kind of took that, like local DDR tournaments, right?

564
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,350
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of took that idea and applied it to Guitar Hero.

565
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:34,053
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a set of sponsored tournaments where you will do the organizing and promoting, and then Red Octane gives you banners and prizes.

566
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:37,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like the Guitar Hero tournament in a box.

567
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

568
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:41,055
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me think of the Xbox Live Pizza Party thing as well.

569
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:41,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

570
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,776
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

571
00:43:43,296 --> 00:43:47,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Red Octane, by the way, is only going to do a limited amount of sponsorships.

572
00:43:48,198 --> 00:43:49,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

573
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:53,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Pax is going on right now, and one of the big announcements at Pax was the Penny Arcade game.

574
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,467
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks pretty awesome.

575
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Just they have a little teaser image that came out for it.

576
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:29,736
[SPEAKER_04]: And the name of the game is actually... It's quite interesting because it looks like it's going to be episodic content and stuff.

577
00:44:29,896 --> 00:44:35,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyways, the name is Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.

578
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:37,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be a comic adventure game.

579
00:44:37,863 --> 00:44:41,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.

580
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:45,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the teaser image, it shows...

581
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:47,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant Glowing Eyes I'm Coming

582
00:45:07,369 --> 00:45:09,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking fruit fucker in a game.

583
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade.

584
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:11,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I gotta get this.

585
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I am looking for this game like crazy.

586
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't we go to Penny Arcade Expo?

587
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:16,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

588
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:18,433
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

589
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:21,474
[SPEAKER_05]: My respect for Penny Arcade goes like higher and higher.

590
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:23,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every time we do some type of report that involves that.

591
00:45:23,235 --> 00:45:24,975
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I do want to go next year.

592
00:45:25,416 --> 00:45:27,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do have a lot of respect for them.

593
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:33,559
[SPEAKER_04]: They also announced what was that $10,000 scholarship for students that are looking to go into a...

594
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Video Game Field in school and stuff.

595
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:41,258
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty, I mean, that's kind of giving back to the community.

596
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot.

597
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:46,242
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've definitely kind of got a really good vibe going on with everything.

598
00:45:46,282 --> 00:45:52,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a fun E3 where actually people are, I don't know, this is the right kind of attitude to have in the industry.

599
00:45:54,189 --> 00:45:55,230
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very cool.

600
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:58,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of cool...

601
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:05,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now, I don't know if this is cool, cool, or sort of, huh?

602
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just more Xbox 360 drama, in my opinion.

603
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:18,249
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they have their premium pricing for a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade.

604
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:27,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're also giving Luminous the same treatment, where to play it, it's 1,200 marketplace points, which is about $14.99.

605
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:39,270
[SPEAKER_03]: However, is that once you reach a certain number of points in mission or versus CPU modes of the game, you will be actually asked to pay another 700 points.

606
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:53,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that is a gross misinterpretation somehow of what is really intended, because it would not be a surprise if they're charging additional points for new themes and skins, but to prevent you from going further in the game in points, having to spend more money?

607
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:55,195
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

608
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:56,936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a demo I'm paying for.

609
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping there's just a gross misinterpretation of what they're charging for.

610
00:47:02,535 --> 00:47:06,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then, if they're charging for extra levels and skins and things, that's not a big surprise.

611
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,867
[SPEAKER_04]: What it might be is that the game has downloadable songpacks or whatever in that case.

612
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:40,614
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the single player game goes so far say you start off with like 20 songs or something when you download the game and then later on when you buy that sound pack it will go to level 20 and then continue on say with the 5 other songs that are in your song pack that would make more sense but I don't see how you would I would think it's just like the one rumor that came out and I hope it's not true where you'd have to purchase like multiplayer for the game I mean it's kind of dumb

613
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:41,552
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

614
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:42,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be... You know what?

615
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:49,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize Luminous is this very popular, in-demand thing, but don't shoot yourself in the foot, kids, over at Xbox Live.

616
00:47:50,137 --> 00:47:51,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I still wouldn't put it past them.

617
00:47:52,118 --> 00:47:56,061
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good... This is a prime way to make money, and you know people will pay for it.

618
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:59,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I will probably be one of them, and I will punch myself in the face for doing it.

619
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:09,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one thing to be pointed out is that they're doing all of their pricing in terms of points instead of putting the dollar point, they're putting the actual Xbox Live points to sort of...

620
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:20,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think that it's a way, and I agree with this article because I got the information from Wired.com.

621
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that actually it's a way to subvert the overall price value of the game by giving it in terms of something abstract like points.

622
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:36,275
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a handful of people in our chat room right now that are listening live to us taping a little early on Friday night.

623
00:48:36,635 --> 00:48:38,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And Drew Nami's in there and makes kind of a good point.

624
00:48:38,817 --> 00:48:44,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd like to purchase World 2-1 episodic content to the extreme.

625
00:48:45,962 --> 00:48:46,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comparison.

626
00:48:47,263 --> 00:48:48,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Mario Brothers style game.

627
00:48:48,685 --> 00:48:51,086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a point where people are just not going to pay for it anymore.

628
00:48:51,607 --> 00:48:56,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think I've kind of got to that point, you know, with Elder Scrolls 4.

629
00:48:56,431 --> 00:49:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not going to go buy all the content and everything, so...

630
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:03,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

631
00:49:26,006 --> 00:49:34,388
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that more than 1 billion Microsoft points have been activated, which in the current exchange rate comes to $12.5 million in revenue.

632
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:44,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Including, they said that the average Xbox Live user has downloaded about 25 pieces of content with about 45 million overall downloads.

633
00:49:45,209 --> 00:49:54,491
[SPEAKER_04]: They were also pointing out that some of the first games to use the Xbox Live anywhere are actually going to be some of the Vista games, including Shadowrun and Halo 2.

634
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:58,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's very cool.

635
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:06,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really specify on how it's going to use live anywhere, but it should be very interesting.

636
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't wait for the live vision camera, which they mentioned, of course, is coming out.

637
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:12,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

638
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:13,747
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do with your live camera?

639
00:50:14,808 --> 00:50:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I not going to do with my live camera?

640
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:17,231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

641
00:50:18,628 --> 00:50:20,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink Nintendo DS Lite

642
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:32,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so excited.

643
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:33,857
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being released.

644
00:50:33,957 --> 00:50:35,718
[SPEAKER_05]: A pink Nintendo DS Lite.

645
00:50:36,098 --> 00:50:37,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and a black one too.

646
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:37,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Black one.

647
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Are being released on September 13th in the U.S.

648
00:50:41,683 --> 00:50:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding, I believe I read somewhere the U.K.

649
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:44,985
[SPEAKER_05]: is getting the pink one as well.

650
00:50:45,025 --> 00:50:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are getting the pink one.

651
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddies over there will get that as well.

652
00:50:48,067 --> 00:50:48,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But we get a black one.

653
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:50,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they already have the black one over there.

654
00:50:50,529 --> 00:50:51,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

655
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're going to match up finally.

656
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:52,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have all the colors.

657
00:50:53,371 --> 00:51:00,357
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of those instances where I'm very glad I did not splurge and get the white DS because I would much prefer a black one or...

658
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:03,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a pink one, depending on how I'm feeling on September 13th.

659
00:51:03,885 --> 00:51:25,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was not the only systems that were getting some pink makeovers, including in the UK, they are getting a PlayStation 2, the slim model, that's also going to be in pink, including they're going to have some bundles that are going to be discounted, including two pink controllers and a pink memory card and, you know,

660
00:51:26,198 --> 00:51:34,542
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStarPop is going to be bundled in there as well for the most flamboyant PlayStation 2 bundle that's out there.

661
00:51:35,103 --> 00:51:38,945
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be noted, as we mentioned last week, that the U.S.

662
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:45,508
[SPEAKER_04]: is getting a different colored PlayStation 2 Slim model, a silver one actually, which I believe has been available in the U.K.

663
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: already.

664
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:49,871
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also getting a pink PSP as well.

665
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:50,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Goody, goody.

666
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:59,973
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that's going to appeal to women gamers because the only thing stopping women gamers out there from actually purchasing consoles was the color.

667
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:03,699
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, please explain the expression on your face because this is radio.

668
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most retarded thing I think I've ever heard.

669
00:52:08,086 --> 00:52:14,028
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, speaking of colorful, we certainly get e-mails every week, and hopefully they've kept the language to a minimum in the e-mails.

670
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:17,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, DarkSakura, did you have to suit up the asbestos this week for the e-mail bag?

671
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:19,669
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't bad enough for the asbestos.

672
00:52:19,729 --> 00:52:23,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went in with a gas mask and some hand sanitizer.

673
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:31,693
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you can e-mail us with your colorful thoughts at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura will dip in there and pull out some e-mails like she's going to do right now.

674
00:52:38,206 --> 00:52:45,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, given the sort of short week for right now, and by the way, thank you for taking care of mail for me while I was at Disneyland.

675
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:46,253
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

676
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

677
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:48,675
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually let Miklatov read.

678
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:49,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun.

679
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun.

680
00:52:50,676 --> 00:52:54,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to give him the illusion of that he was an actual full-fledged co-host for a night.

681
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:54,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

682
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we downgrade him to dwarf host?

683
00:52:57,322 --> 00:52:59,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because he might bite you in the ankle.

684
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:00,404
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

685
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:02,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Pluto was downgraded.

686
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:05,168
[SPEAKER_03]: She made a sci-fi joke.

687
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:05,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

688
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:07,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So Miklatov's our dwarf host.

689
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's cool.

690
00:53:08,592 --> 00:53:09,553
[SPEAKER_03]: We can call him Xena.

691
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We can call him Mini DarkSakura.

692
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:13,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pissed off about that.

693
00:53:13,834 --> 00:53:15,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll get into that during the FUs.

694
00:53:15,575 --> 00:53:15,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

695
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:17,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wanted a planet named Xena.

696
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:17,895
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, that's fine.

697
00:53:17,935 --> 00:53:22,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, first one is from GrinWithoutACat, who I think is uber cool.

698
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:27,058
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that name because it makes me think of Alice in Wonderland.

699
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:28,359
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

700
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started on the whole Alice Mad Hatter thing.

701
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:31,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

702
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Orange Challenge Crew, you probably already heard of this one, but I've just discovered Rhythm Tengoku on the GBA from Nintendo.

703
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,596
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's the same people who did WarioWare and it shows.

704
00:53:42,056 --> 00:53:43,496
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard of it, there's some videos.

705
00:53:43,576 --> 00:53:48,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually on Nintendo.co.jp, so search for it there.

706
00:53:48,998 --> 00:53:58,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great fun to me, and I'm thinking of importing it, but wanted to check on what you guys thought about the game and the possibility of it getting an English language release before I did, since you were the expert on music games.

707
00:54:00,223 --> 00:54:00,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um...

708
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:04,069
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard of it getting an English release at all.

709
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:05,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's coming out here.

710
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,014
[SPEAKER_05]: But I bet you it will if another certain Japanese import game does very well over here.

711
00:54:10,461 --> 00:54:19,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that if Owendon, or Elite Beat Agents, I should say, does well over here, then... I think it's going to open the floodgates for music games on the handhelds.

712
00:54:20,606 --> 00:54:24,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So support Elite Beat Agents, and I'll bet you anything you're going to see a ton.

713
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:27,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not cheap knockoff clones, but some good stuff.

714
00:54:28,491 --> 00:54:33,393
[SPEAKER_05]: One music title that's kind of often overlooked is Electroplankton, because it was kind of a harder one to get.

715
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:34,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to get it on Nintendo Store and everything.

716
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:37,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroplankton was cool from the demo.

717
00:54:37,295 --> 00:54:37,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

718
00:54:37,535 --> 00:54:39,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a rhythm game per se.

719
00:54:39,415 --> 00:54:40,496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a music creation game.

720
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:46,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think a lot of people that are into music and rhythm games are into it because of the fact that it feels like you're making music.

721
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:51,760
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's why I love Beatmania and 2DX and all that stuff is I feel like I'm actually making music.

722
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely check out Electroplankton.

723
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you'll get a kick out of it.

724
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:56,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit more to this email.

725
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:57,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

726
00:54:57,802 --> 00:54:58,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

727
00:54:59,122 --> 00:54:59,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

728
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:00,403
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

729
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Just read the damn email.

730
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:02,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

731
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:04,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed you, but my aim's improving.

732
00:55:07,062 --> 00:55:15,409
[SPEAKER_03]: This would probably make a boring question for the show, as I expect many of the listeners to be pretty knowledgeable on the whole music genre, but I was wondering if you could help me out.

733
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:21,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over in the UK, and we don't get the choice in rhythm action genre that you guys in North America get.

734
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:32,144
[SPEAKER_03]: We do get quite a few of these games, Space Channel 5, Guitar Man, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Hero, for example, but we still miss out on things such as Beatmania and Drum Master.

735
00:55:32,164 --> 00:55:33,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that would be Taiko...

736
00:55:34,826 --> 00:55:41,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, both the DS and PSP are region-free, so I've been able to import great games such as Daigaso, Band Brothers, Osu!

737
00:55:41,352 --> 00:55:43,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Tatakai Oendan, and Drum Master Portable.

738
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:51,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you could recommend any music games that are available on either the GBA, DS, or PSP.

739
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:55,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know any Japanese, but I haven't had any problems working my way around the ones already mentioned.

740
00:55:56,245 --> 00:55:56,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the great work.

741
00:55:57,046 --> 00:55:57,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's appreciated.

742
00:55:57,786 --> 00:55:58,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Grin without a cap.

743
00:55:58,715 --> 00:55:59,695
[SPEAKER_05]: What a very humble email.

744
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:00,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate that.

745
00:56:00,696 --> 00:56:01,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Very humble attitude, that email.

746
00:56:03,836 --> 00:56:05,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just kind of recommended one there.

747
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:09,898
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the Electroplankton was my suggestion there.

748
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:12,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you kind of named most of the big ones.

749
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:15,060
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot that we get that you guys don't get.

750
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, most of the ones you named, we also have.

751
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Handhelds, there's not a lot of music games on handhelds.

752
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:23,162
[SPEAKER_05]: The DDR games on handheld were poopy.

753
00:56:23,262 --> 00:56:23,962
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want those.

754
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:27,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would say the only one I can think of that he didn't mention...

755
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:28,224
[SPEAKER_04]: and DJ Maxx.

756
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:58,295
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that if you're, honestly, there's not a good Beatmania for a handheld, except for the WonderSwan one, which actually, I mean, I don't know if you have a WonderSwan, but it actually has a little scratch pad that you attach to it, and all the sound effects were digitized.

757
00:56:59,164 --> 00:56:59,544
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerToyGames

758
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:31,478
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Beatmania and DDR Portable.

759
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:32,659
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even a Hello Kitty one.

760
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:35,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like the size of a Pokemon Pikachu.

761
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:35,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Cute.

762
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:42,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not actually saying this to actually plug a site, but it is the one site I know that you can order them.

763
00:57:42,548 --> 00:57:47,734
[SPEAKER_03]: NCSX has them, and Toys and Joys, if you're interested in that type of thing.

764
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:51,217
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say look through any of the importers list except for Buy Right, because they suck.

765
00:57:51,932 --> 00:57:53,392
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's do any of the importers lists.

766
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:54,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Byright go out of business?

767
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:58,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Byright got shut down by the Better Business Bureau.

768
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, next email.

769
00:57:59,754 --> 00:58:01,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha, I was so happy.

770
00:58:01,435 --> 00:58:02,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's actually the last one.

771
00:58:03,556 --> 00:58:11,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from SurunojiSama91 from our chat.

772
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:14,499
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the phantom caller that didn't pick up for the music because his phone battery died.

773
00:58:15,001 --> 00:58:17,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, I got to miss out on a fun contest last week.

774
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:20,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, we will do again because I got a really good reception.

775
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:23,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, we had Jamie play tonight the game from last week.

776
00:58:23,488 --> 00:58:26,150
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not sure what we're talking about, download Part B of last week's show.

777
00:58:26,491 --> 00:58:27,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie got six.

778
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:29,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not too shabby.

779
00:58:29,833 --> 00:58:31,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll write more down next time.

780
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:32,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write anything down.

781
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:34,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she just named them off the top of her head.

782
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:35,578
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty good.

783
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,098
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty good.

784
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:37,159
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm hardcore.

785
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Dear OLR, I'm afraid.

786
00:58:40,762 --> 00:58:42,704
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid for a lot of consumers.

787
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:47,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Afraid that they're going to be screwed over by Sony during this next-gen console war.

788
00:58:48,314 --> 00:58:51,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a loyal Sony fan over the years, maybe a little too loyal.

789
00:58:52,077 --> 00:58:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I own both an import PS2 and an American PS2.

790
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I also happen to own a Japanese PSP, which I ordered at launch.

791
00:58:57,923 --> 00:59:03,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid of the future of Sony with their release of the PS3 because of the possible slip in sales due to the price tag.

792
00:59:04,069 --> 00:59:08,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people are going to buy the PS3, and it's obvious that they're going to sell out at launch.

793
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:23,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But with their questionable market strategy, releasing the PS3 under two SKUs at sky-high prices, charges for useless game content, and the loss of sales with the UMD, Sony may be in deep doo-doo this go-round.

794
00:59:24,124 --> 00:59:30,829
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know what your thoughts are about purchasing the PS3, and also if it will be a good investment, or a possible quote, dreamcast.

795
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, loyal fan.

796
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Ricky.

797
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:33,458
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

798
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:35,019
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a very similar email last week.

799
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,122
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of Sony questioning going on lately, which isn't much of a surprise.

800
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:47,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stick by something I said kind of similar last week, is that, you know what, I don't think it's something that I want to get on launch day.

801
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:51,499
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, the PlayStation 2 wasn't really something I needed on launch day either.

802
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:57,224
[SPEAKER_05]: So give it time, see where it goes, but for right now, I don't see any need to run out and buy it.

803
00:59:57,284 --> 01:00:04,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize there's been a lot of hype recently, you know, because the Xbox 360 had this huge launch thing, and that's been like the big thing lately is launch day, launch day.

804
01:00:05,232 --> 01:00:07,234
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't have to buy into that hype.

805
01:00:07,595 --> 01:00:07,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

806
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:08,596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

807
01:00:09,116 --> 01:00:11,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait for the game you want to come out, and then make a decision.

808
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:16,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Like me, I'm waiting for Final Fantasy XIII or something else that will grab my attention in that same style.

809
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I will make a decision.

810
01:00:18,363 --> 01:00:21,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I still stand by what I have always said since day one.

811
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:23,746
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

812
01:00:24,186 --> 01:00:25,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I played, it's crap.

813
01:00:26,788 --> 01:00:27,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Sonic Avenger.

814
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:35,793
[SPEAKER_03]: As for comparing it to the Dreamcast, I don't think that nothing is ever going to be... Yeah, because the Dreamcast is kind of the other way around where it's just horribly underrated.

815
01:00:36,694 --> 01:00:39,576
[SPEAKER_03]: But the system itself was so versatile.

816
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:41,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hello, Bleemcast.

817
01:00:42,466 --> 01:00:44,567
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a system that could run Playstation games.

818
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:48,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice the news that was this week that they were talking about?

819
01:00:48,848 --> 01:00:53,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Gran Turismo HD as a work, it was basically a tech demo?

820
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:54,930
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually it's the full game.

821
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually going to be coming out.

822
01:00:56,631 --> 01:01:03,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, they have said it, it is a port of Gran Turismo 4.

823
01:01:04,053 --> 01:01:06,134
[SPEAKER_04]: All they did was upscale the graphics.

824
01:01:06,674 --> 01:01:07,254
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

825
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:10,195
[SPEAKER_04]: So yay, you can pay $59.99 for a

826
01:01:12,642 --> 01:01:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: HD, DVD, Outnumbers, Blu-ray, 2 to 1

827
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand how can it fail?

828
01:01:59,364 --> 01:01:59,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Beta.

829
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

830
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Betamax.

831
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:06,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was also Sony's format, too.

832
01:02:06,651 --> 01:02:12,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the Betamax was technologically a superior format, it still failed against VHS.

833
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:23,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see Ken going, you know, if the PlayStation 3 does not sell, I'll go door-to-door and punch people in the face and make them buy it at gunpoint or whatever.

834
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:26,188
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Junami, inconceivable!

835
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:27,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep using that word.

836
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:29,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think it means what you think it does.

837
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:33,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We need some good males that hate on Nintendo and Microsoft, to be fair.

838
01:02:34,293 --> 01:02:34,573
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

839
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:37,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So send some Microsoft and Nintendo hate, if you're feeling it.

840
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:38,775
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be obvious.

841
01:02:38,875 --> 01:02:40,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Over to Mailbag and OrangeHunter.com.

842
01:02:40,376 --> 01:02:49,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners, I hope I'm not assuming for all of you, mind you, but our listeners in general, I've seen more support for Nintendo followed by Microsoft.

843
01:02:50,293 --> 01:02:54,255
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly am seeing... Truthfully, I do feel the same way, but I want to hear from the other side.

844
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:58,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually am having that same warm feeling in my heart for the Wii that the Dreamcast gave me.

845
01:02:58,996 --> 01:02:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

846
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:01,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you some hate news right here.

847
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:07,420
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii is not going to have... The third-party Wii titles will not be online at launch.

848
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:16,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because Nintendo is not giving out the actual libraries to build online for the third-party titles until 2007.

849
01:03:16,803 --> 01:03:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And the theory is that

850
01:03:19,164 --> 01:03:19,625
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

851
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:35,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

852
01:03:35,405 --> 01:03:37,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't make the same mistake you made with the GameCube, Nintendo.

853
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:38,246
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

854
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:39,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not make the same mistake.

855
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:45,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they are, but I just kind of wish they would go online, but whatever.

856
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:46,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's their call.

857
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,632
[SPEAKER_05]: They're releasing 2007, so... At least it's on the horizon.

858
01:03:50,553 --> 01:03:54,174
[SPEAKER_05]: DS didn't start online, and it turned out okay, so I'm gonna give it to them.

859
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:54,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

860
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:59,137
[SPEAKER_04]: 99%... Most systems out there didn't start off online, the only exception would probably be in the 360.

861
01:03:59,197 --> 01:03:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

862
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:05,301
[SPEAKER_03]: To say so, though, the Dreamcast did actually come with a dial-up modem.

863
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:07,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

864
01:04:08,123 --> 01:04:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We paid for the broadband that only worked on Quake 3.

865
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:13,508
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

866
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:16,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's other people in this world who need oven mitts and a helmet.

867
01:04:18,011 --> 01:04:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would like to email us, send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

868
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:24,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Send DarkSakura your oven mitts and helmets.

869
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:25,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I do take worship, too.

870
01:04:25,697 --> 01:04:25,978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

871
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:27,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways...

872
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:29,985
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some interesting news coming out.

873
01:04:30,186 --> 01:04:40,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we talked about it, I think, a little bit last week about how some of the Toys R Us stores were actually selling the Xbox Live camera early.

874
01:04:41,213 --> 01:04:47,738
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, a few weeks early, because it's not supposed to come out until around the 19th or 20th of September.

875
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:51,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some interesting news about that, actually.

876
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,324
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the apparent readers of...

877
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:10,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox360.qj.net read the headline on their site and actually went down to a South Miami, Florida store and purchased one of the cameras.

878
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: He was speaking to the clerk there and asked them why they were selling it two weeks early.

879
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:22,333
[SPEAKER_04]: He was told by Microsoft that they're releasing a limited number for selective sales.

880
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:25,594
[SPEAKER_04]: His assumption was, I can only assume that

881
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: This was to start buzz.

882
01:05:28,097 --> 01:05:33,982
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, some sort of viral campaign to basically get the buzz out there about the brand new camera.

883
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:38,446
[SPEAKER_05]: For all those people that play UNO online, OMG, I'm starting to see people with cameras.

884
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:39,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, look, naked people.

885
01:05:40,874 --> 01:05:46,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways, if you are looking for some information about the camera, it is going to be coming out in two different SKUs.

886
01:05:47,237 --> 01:05:58,702
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a cheaper one for $39.99, which is the camera, a live headset, in case you don't have one, a free month of live gold, and Uno, a card for the full game of Uno.

887
01:05:59,022 --> 01:06:02,844
[SPEAKER_04]: And supposedly later on, they're going to allow a free download for Totem Ball, because not only is it

888
01:06:03,484 --> 01:06:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Playable through the camera Then there's one also for $79.99 And that also includes the camera, the headset, a full year of Xbox Live Gold And of course a free month Uno, the full game A to-be-announced third game for the camera and 200 Microsoft points So, very interesting Too bad I already bought Uno Yeah, same

889
01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:31,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Microsoft.

890
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:33,109
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have just given us Microsoft points.

891
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, give us Microsoft points instead.

892
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:35,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's buy something else.

893
01:06:36,302 --> 01:06:36,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerks.

894
01:06:37,557 --> 01:06:42,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, the one thing you could have bought would be these new Xbox Live Arcade games that are being developed.

895
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:48,599
[SPEAKER_05]: They're tabletop European game favorites that are being ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.

896
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:52,500
[SPEAKER_05]: The Settlers of Catan is one game that's coming over to Xbox Live.

897
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And forgive me if I'm horribly mispronouncing these.

898
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of these games before in my life.

899
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Carcassonne is another game that's coming over.

900
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alhambra are some games that are coming over to Xbox Live Arcade.

901
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:05,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they bottle water?

902
01:07:06,794 --> 01:07:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in this country, but over there it's a board game.

903
01:07:09,655 --> 01:07:11,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be interesting.

904
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:12,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Axis and Allies?

905
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:12,896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those.

906
01:07:12,956 --> 01:07:15,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And Risk.

907
01:07:15,717 --> 01:07:18,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine online multiplayer Risk.

908
01:07:18,957 --> 01:07:19,918
[SPEAKER_05]: You think Uno's bad.

909
01:07:20,018 --> 01:07:21,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Draw four, bitch!

910
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Monopoly.

911
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:25,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Monopoly would be ridiculous.

912
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they give us chess?

913
01:07:28,615 --> 01:07:31,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine how hardcore Risk would be online?

914
01:07:31,956 --> 01:07:33,477
[SPEAKER_05]: I just took Russia, bitch!

915
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:39,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just like some, just a board game collection, like Connect Four, or like Battleship.

916
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:41,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I suck your battleship, bitch!

917
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,121
[SPEAKER_04]: You have sunk my battleship!

918
01:07:46,022 --> 01:07:47,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to start, bitch!

919
01:07:49,303 --> 01:07:51,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not pass the show!

920
01:07:51,264 --> 01:07:52,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Go directly to go, bitch!

921
01:07:52,904 --> 01:07:54,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not collect $200, or I kick your ass!

922
01:07:56,026 --> 01:07:56,666
[SPEAKER_03]: For great justice.

923
01:07:57,478 --> 01:08:00,321
[SPEAKER_05]: or as Drunami says in chat, I call the thimble, bitch.

924
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:02,444
[SPEAKER_03]: He used the thimble?

925
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:05,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta fucking shoot, bitch.

926
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's the puppy.

927
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:11,193
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on with chutes and ladders, MF-er.

928
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:11,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom.

929
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:12,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

930
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:18,762
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the reason why we do that is if you've ever actually played on Xbox Live and listened to people, like, seriously.

931
01:08:19,758 --> 01:08:20,979
[SPEAKER_05]: They trash talk and everything.

932
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:21,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.

933
01:08:22,501 --> 01:08:23,923
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we play with the thing turned off.

934
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:26,065
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to put out like a strawberry shortcake happy game.

935
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:27,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave feedback on everyone.

936
01:08:27,526 --> 01:08:29,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you know, I don't care.

937
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,552
[SPEAKER_05]: This person is an ass.

938
01:08:32,952 --> 01:08:34,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you could type things in.

939
01:08:34,714 --> 01:08:35,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Like eBay.

940
01:08:36,256 --> 01:08:37,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Was fun to play with.

941
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:38,699
[SPEAKER_05]: A++++.

942
01:08:38,779 --> 01:08:39,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Would deathmatch again.

943
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:41,515
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want?

944
01:08:41,775 --> 01:08:44,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want some multiplayer in Viva Pinata.

945
01:08:45,058 --> 01:08:46,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I killed your pinata, bitch!

946
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Now give me candy, bitch!

947
01:08:50,882 --> 01:08:56,127
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutest fucking game they need to just have an online deathmatch for.

948
01:08:56,147 --> 01:08:57,688
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be hilarious.

949
01:08:57,768 --> 01:08:59,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Loco Broco deathmatch.

950
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:01,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, whatever.

951
01:09:01,431 --> 01:09:02,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's keep it moving.

952
01:09:03,363 --> 01:09:17,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as movements, and this sort of makes me think more of bowel movements, that Louisiana game law business that we've been hearing so much about, hence the results of bowel movements making me think of, actually, it got stopped.

953
01:09:18,058 --> 01:09:21,120
[SPEAKER_03]: The unstoppable law got stopped.

954
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:30,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically Jack Thompson was going around saying the law is constitutional as it addresses all of the complaints raised by federal courts which have struck down other state video game laws.

955
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:32,108
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he's quoted as saying.

956
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know you're still a dumbass, Jackie Poo.

957
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:43,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was basically shot down by a federal judge said it was unconstitutional and

958
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:45,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop wasting our tax money.

959
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:22,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, well, the bill's sponsor was basically saying that he hoped testosterone would, quote, have the additional adrenaline and testosterone needed in the upcoming cockfight over the constitutionality of this bill.

960
01:10:23,562 --> 01:10:37,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's going to attack our right to express ourselves, or even, it's still somebody's creative work, and you're trying to censor how they are expressing themselves.

961
01:10:38,394 --> 01:10:38,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Their work.

962
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:44,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still somebody sat and thought this idea up and you were suppressing this idea.

963
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Now tell me what's constitutional about that.

964
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:50,623
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura lay off the SmackDown.

965
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:52,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

966
01:10:53,325 --> 01:10:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought this was kind of funny.

967
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:58,610
[SPEAKER_04]: When I read this story, I know we joked about this on another show.

968
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:04,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, goddammit, I'm not buying that PlayStation 3 unless, you know, it cures cancer.

969
01:11:04,234 --> 01:11:04,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

970
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,061
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be helping to cure cancer at the PlayStation 3.

971
01:11:07,901 --> 01:11:22,546
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they're doing that is kind of been like a project that's been going on PCs right now with the Folding at Home project, basically using distributing power while your system is idle.

972
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:27,668
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download a program or whatever, and that will basically kind of compute.

973
01:11:27,728 --> 01:11:32,690
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is looking at some of the proteins or whatever make up

974
01:11:33,052 --> 01:11:33,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

975
01:11:33,832 --> 01:11:47,096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's computing something to basically help cure cancer and they're going to be supposedly expecting to get 100 gigaflops with 10,000 PS3s churning away with this project.

976
01:11:47,176 --> 01:11:51,057
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a lot of processing power towards a very good cause.

977
01:11:52,257 --> 01:11:56,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I don't actually have to run this no matter what.

978
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:59,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this how they justify the $600 price tag?

979
01:11:59,459 --> 01:12:01,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that if you buy one of these then you won't get cancer?

980
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that...

981
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:05,274
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

982
01:12:20,606 --> 01:12:21,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring, Spiral, and Loop.

983
01:12:21,807 --> 01:12:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes me think a lot of Loop, because the premise of that one is that they were building a society, but it got infected like a virus and they're trying to... Basically, yeah, they're crunching the math of folding proteins that hold the secret to curing cancer.

984
01:12:36,153 --> 01:12:38,414
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also like that old project study at home.

985
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:43,536
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I thought was really funny, it was kind of a comment in this article, it says, but mom, it cures cancer.

986
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:46,397
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't buy it for me, granny will die.

987
01:12:47,278 --> 01:12:48,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was kind of funny.

988
01:12:48,798 --> 01:12:49,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha.

989
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:58,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, DarkSakura mentioned earlier that the lineup E3 for the PlayStation 3 left a lot of people unimpressed.

990
01:12:58,562 --> 01:13:01,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's going to be a whole lot more shown at Tokyo Game Show.

991
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:02,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's going to up it.

992
01:13:02,764 --> 01:13:03,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they actually have systems?

993
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:07,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, they're going to have more stuff, and they're going to be showing a whole lot of games.

994
01:13:08,186 --> 01:13:09,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some stuff they're going to be showing.

995
01:13:09,507 --> 01:13:11,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Armored Core 4, Bladestorm...

996
01:13:12,368 --> 01:13:29,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Haikunen Sensu, Coated Arms Assault, Devil May Cry 4, The Eye of Judgment, Fatal Inertia, Formula One World Championship, Genji, Working Title, Gran Turismo, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Working Title, Mahjong Takai 4, which probably won't come out here.

997
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:31,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we ever gotten a Mahjong game actually come out in the U.S.?

998
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:32,861
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a couple of Mahjong games.

999
01:13:35,141 --> 01:13:48,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Minono Golf 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, Target in Sight, Motorstorm, Railfan, Resistance, Fall of Man, Ridge Racer 7, and Warhawk are all going to make appearances at the Tokyo Game Show.

1000
01:13:50,065 --> 01:13:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Minono Golf actually sounds very cute, so it means everybody's golf.

1001
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that just hot shots?

1002
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:56,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1003
01:13:56,711 --> 01:13:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Over there?

1004
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:57,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

1005
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavenly Sword reminds me of like a female, it's almost like crossing God of War with Blood Rain.

1006
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:05,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

1007
01:14:06,394 --> 01:14:07,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to Devil May Cry 4.

1008
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:09,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, see now, see?

1009
01:14:09,555 --> 01:14:10,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get my Dante on.

1010
01:14:10,755 --> 01:14:15,977
[SPEAKER_05]: If Devil May Cry 4 is made of awesome and win, will you maybe find some love for PlayStation 3 in your black heart?

1011
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:21,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1012
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:21,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.

1013
01:14:21,519 --> 01:14:23,840
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to fix Sonic Adventure, the bastards.

1014
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:24,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.

1015
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:25,274
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1016
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,531
[SPEAKER_05]: FUs of the week time, DarkSakura.

1017
01:15:02,512 --> 01:15:05,672
[SPEAKER_03]: A big FU goes toward the astrological community.

1018
01:15:06,933 --> 01:15:11,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And not really... I understand why Pluto was downgraded.

1019
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:16,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for anyone who doesn't know, I love my geek science so much.

1020
01:15:17,175 --> 01:15:21,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand the logic behind downgrading Pluto's status to a dwarf planet.

1021
01:15:23,677 --> 01:15:28,238
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a couple weeks ago that they were about to announce the 10th planet, planet Xena.

1022
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:30,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Planet Xena!

1023
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:31,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the moon be Planet Gabrielle?

1024
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:31,821
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be.

1025
01:15:52,938 --> 01:16:01,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Zena and Gabriella Leave it to the astronomy community to name planets after Zena Warrior Princess characters.

1026
01:16:01,568 --> 01:16:02,429
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

1027
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:06,875
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, there's people who are saying, oh, that's so stupid.

1028
01:16:07,055 --> 01:16:07,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1029
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:08,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Look,

1030
01:16:09,702 --> 01:16:20,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, you know, first of all, there was another planet before that that existed in the 1800s that was actually downgraded to, um, I believe it was actually figured out to be a comet instead of a planet.

1031
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:22,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It was downgraded in the 1800s.

1032
01:16:22,894 --> 01:16:26,037
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get Pluto until 1930 when it was just found.

1033
01:16:26,077 --> 01:16:27,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they argued about it then, too.

1034
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:32,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now that it's Pluto, they're saying, uh-oh, you know what, we changed our minds again, you know.

1035
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:34,641
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 years later.

1036
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:35,642
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 years later.

1037
01:16:35,682 --> 01:16:38,105
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this news makes Walt Disney roll in his grave.

1038
01:16:38,505 --> 01:16:39,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Some days I feel like Pluto.

1039
01:16:40,607 --> 01:16:42,289
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what's going to happen to Sailor Pluto.

1040
01:16:42,309 --> 01:16:45,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she going to shrink?

1041
01:16:45,953 --> 01:16:46,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she was really tall.

1042
01:16:47,555 --> 01:16:48,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Next FU, please.

1043
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:48,656
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

1044
01:16:48,676 --> 01:16:49,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more on this.

1045
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:50,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more on this.

1046
01:16:51,508 --> 01:16:59,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole reason being is that one of the primary things is that the orbit of Pluto is elliptical and not circular in general, like most of the other planets.

1047
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:05,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually intersects with Neptune, which even when I was a little kid, I was like, that's weird.

1048
01:17:06,071 --> 01:17:07,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with it.

1049
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:07,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

1050
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:19,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish people would just, you know, freaking understand that these new criteria that they have for judging celestial bodies is actually sort of good and smart and should have been enacted a long time ago.

1051
01:17:19,813 --> 01:17:19,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1052
01:17:21,687 --> 01:17:22,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1053
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:23,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1054
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:25,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what you all say.

1055
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:26,249
[SPEAKER_04]: The world's flat.

1056
01:17:26,829 --> 01:17:27,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1057
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,711
[SPEAKER_03]: As flat as your ass.

1058
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:31,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1059
01:17:31,892 --> 01:17:32,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that as a compliment.

1060
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,433
[SPEAKER_04]: No, anyways.

1061
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:46,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you to drivers, because as I was leaving here yesterday, see, we were supposed to be doing some important work, interviewing a certain somebody, and the somebody decided to quit his company.

1062
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:47,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways,

1063
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:58,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I was leaving here, freaking crazy Asians in a goddamn little Suzuki SUV thing, one of those mini SUVs, blew through a goddamn stop sign.

1064
01:17:58,952 --> 01:18:02,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I honked my horn and they're like, what happened?

1065
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:02,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1066
01:18:03,435 --> 01:18:06,817
[SPEAKER_04]: So stupid drivers, I swear to God, they're trying to kill me out there.

1067
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, you need to watch where you're going.

1068
01:18:09,721 --> 01:18:13,663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as I mentioned... Are you ever going to have a week when you have an FU for something other than drivers?

1069
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:19,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had plenty of weeks where I've had things, you know... I actually did have an email received that was an FU toward Loki's FUs.

1070
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are those people?

1071
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:22,987
[SPEAKER_04]: What is their problem?

1072
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:25,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they get to choose what I'm angry at?

1073
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:26,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

1074
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:28,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense whatever.

1075
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:28,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1076
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:31,850
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, FUs are the damn TV at work.

1077
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I took my TV to work, since I don't have a place to put my old TV.

1078
01:18:35,332 --> 01:18:35,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1079
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a sub-FU to male drivers.

1080
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:41,915
[SPEAKER_03]: As in, people with small penises that drive big trucks.

1081
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:48,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the ones that tried to go past me until me with my faster Lancer got in front of them and flipped them off hardcore.

1082
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:54,000
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week, I don't have a lot, I'm not very angsty this week, so I suppose my FU of the week would go to Jamie.

1083
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:55,621
[SPEAKER_05]: You bitch!

1084
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:57,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, well, because you went to Disneyland.

1085
01:18:58,162 --> 01:18:58,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1086
01:18:58,462 --> 01:18:59,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And you didn't take me.

1087
01:19:00,123 --> 01:19:01,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It was girl trip.

1088
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:02,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1089
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I will petition next time that Rob gets to come on our next big gay trip.

1090
01:19:09,963 --> 01:19:10,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1091
01:19:11,043 --> 01:19:12,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I want smoothies too some days, you know.

1092
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:14,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really?

1093
01:19:14,905 --> 01:19:15,045
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1094
01:19:16,706 --> 01:19:21,609
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Robway in the chatroom, yeah, you did give me a smoothie today, thank you.

1095
01:19:21,669 --> 01:19:28,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Robway in the chatroom says, on the astronomy, after declaring Pluto not a planet, they voted on Goofy not a dog.

1096
01:19:30,494 --> 01:19:31,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was funny.

1097
01:19:31,635 --> 01:19:32,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was funny.

1098
01:19:33,216 --> 01:19:34,697
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hug Goofy.

1099
01:19:34,757 --> 01:19:36,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant Goofy's not funny.

1100
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,439
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hug Goofy.

1101
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:43,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, what was funny was Goofy at Goofy's Kitchen, we went to a character breakfast, teasing Alice about having an affair with Mad Hatter.

1102
01:19:46,106 --> 01:19:46,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

1103
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:48,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever played Toontown?

1104
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:49,849
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

1105
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of seems like something you'd like.

1106
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I saw advertisements for that on TV.

1107
01:19:53,292 --> 01:19:55,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my picture with the princesses.

1108
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:57,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to gaming.

1109
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:04,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, back to gaming I know there's some really interesting news from SNK

1110
01:20:05,117 --> 01:20:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was if people would give me a chance to freaking pull up my thing.

1111
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:10,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you guys.

1112
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:11,400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1113
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:18,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's fake news is host of Orange Nails Radio, DarkSakura, goes crazy and kills her co-host with a tray.

1114
01:20:18,684 --> 01:20:19,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1115
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:21,986
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, she doesn't do that because she was distracted by the pretty princesses.

1116
01:20:22,186 --> 01:20:25,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get through tonight's show in like under two hours?

1117
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:26,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mini show tonight, right?

1118
01:20:26,968 --> 01:20:27,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure.

1119
01:20:27,609 --> 01:20:31,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to put the pictures up on our forums because the Ariel was so pretty.

1120
01:20:32,091 --> 01:20:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I wanted to follow her around.

1121
01:20:34,654 --> 01:20:35,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1122
01:20:36,676 --> 01:20:37,616
[SPEAKER_03]: SNK!

1123
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:41,059
[SPEAKER_05]: I could walk to Disneyland by the time she gets to our next fucking story.

1124
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:42,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1125
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:43,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

1126
01:20:43,401 --> 01:20:43,621
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1127
01:20:43,981 --> 01:20:44,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1128
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:50,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna take this lollipop that's shaped phallically and shove it up your ass if you don't get to the next story.

1129
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the next story is about one of my sleeper favorite games ever, so you really need to get to it.

1130
01:20:57,772 --> 01:20:59,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so shut up so I can.

1131
01:20:59,713 --> 01:21:00,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1132
01:21:00,714 --> 01:21:01,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shutting up.

1133
01:21:01,395 --> 01:21:03,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. He of Big Mouth.

1134
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:06,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk shit about everybody today.

1135
01:21:06,424 --> 01:21:06,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

1136
01:21:07,685 --> 01:21:08,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1137
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:15,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So SNK is coming to Live Arcade and everybody goes, Yay!

1138
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:23,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So guess what's going to be showing up on Xbox Live Arcade since Capcom decided to give a Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.

1139
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:27,901
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be getting Garou Densetsu Special, a.k.a.

1140
01:21:27,961 --> 01:21:28,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatal Fury Special.

1141
01:21:29,605 --> 01:21:36,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's badass because I can play, what was his name, Tung Fu Ru on Xbox Live.

1142
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:37,792
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me all kind of happy.

1143
01:21:37,812 --> 01:21:38,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Mai player.

1144
01:21:39,374 --> 01:21:40,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Mai is awesome.

1145
01:21:40,935 --> 01:21:45,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Mai is so... Mai freaking would kick Chun-Li's ass any day.

1146
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:46,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

1147
01:21:46,721 --> 01:21:50,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking take her out and beat her ass up and then go, me bouncy, when she wins.

1148
01:21:51,305 --> 01:21:52,706
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she says me bouncy.

1149
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:53,947
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she says me bouncy.

1150
01:21:54,107 --> 01:21:54,568
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what she says.

1151
01:21:54,588 --> 01:21:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: She just bounces.

1152
01:21:55,549 --> 01:21:55,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

1153
01:21:56,659 --> 01:22:01,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they're saying that on PS2 they had a non-playable demo of King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match.

1154
01:22:02,763 --> 01:22:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: with a playable demo of Garou Densetsu Battle Archives 2.

1155
01:22:07,185 --> 01:22:10,666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also talking about Metal Slug Complete for PSP.

1156
01:22:10,886 --> 01:22:18,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, even more than having Fatal Fury Special, I really want to see one of the old school KOF games.

1157
01:22:20,409 --> 01:22:22,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you how hardcore of a KOF fangirl I am.

1158
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:28,032
[SPEAKER_03]: We went out and bought King of Fighters 2000 for the Neo Geo.

1159
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:31,353
[SPEAKER_03]: As in the cartridge Neo Geo.

1160
01:22:33,015 --> 01:22:33,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.

1161
01:22:33,735 --> 01:22:33,976
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1162
01:22:34,296 --> 01:22:34,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Duck King.

1163
01:22:36,097 --> 01:22:36,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah!

1164
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:36,897
[SPEAKER_05]: So awesome.

1165
01:22:37,938 --> 01:22:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1166
01:22:39,419 --> 01:22:40,980
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your major KOF team?

1167
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:42,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters.

1168
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:44,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I pretty much quit at Fail Fury Special.

1169
01:22:45,683 --> 01:22:46,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, sad.

1170
01:22:46,423 --> 01:22:47,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it a couple times.

1171
01:22:47,644 --> 01:22:49,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure whatever team Mai was on.

1172
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:55,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Mai, Leona, and then my alternating ones of either Athena or Kim Kephwan.

1173
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:58,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, Kim Kephwan, actually, I would play more than Mai.

1174
01:22:58,711 --> 01:22:59,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I love his moves.

1175
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an awesome fighter.

1176
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Iori.

1177
01:23:02,073 --> 01:23:02,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1178
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,047
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1179
01:23:04,588 --> 01:23:05,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Typical fangirl.

1180
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Typical fangirl.

1181
01:23:07,252 --> 01:23:07,892
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1182
01:23:08,974 --> 01:23:13,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I also used the little boy with the big hat.

1183
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:14,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1184
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:17,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's pretty cool.

1185
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'm sorry, I'm getting... LokiFound sounds so enthusiastic!

1186
01:23:21,806 --> 01:23:25,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, little boy, sounds like fun!

1187
01:23:25,109 --> 01:23:29,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, okay, I wasn't really a huge fan of Fatal Fury.

1188
01:23:29,273 --> 01:23:34,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I may have played it once at like a supermarket when they had those, you know, the Neo Geo with the four games on there.

1189
01:23:35,194 --> 01:23:36,115
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1190
01:24:05,677 --> 01:24:06,397
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

1191
01:24:07,378 --> 01:24:15,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't know if these people were nominated, but it says Brain Age beat out cult hits like Guitar Hero and Oindun and Amp 3.

1192
01:24:17,883 --> 01:24:21,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII, Electroplankton, Indigo Prophecy, and Killer7.

1193
01:24:21,544 --> 01:24:23,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's my couple problems here.

1194
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:25,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Amp 3, first of all, is a sequel.

1195
01:24:26,047 --> 01:24:26,968
[SPEAKER_04]: To a snowboarding game.

1196
01:24:27,288 --> 01:24:30,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess cutscenes were kind of different, so I guess that would be something.

1197
01:24:31,512 --> 01:24:33,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a snowboarding game.

1198
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:33,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1199
01:24:34,094 --> 01:24:35,455
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dragon Quest, you know, 8?

1200
01:24:37,677 --> 01:24:37,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1201
01:24:37,977 --> 01:24:39,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the original of the game?

1202
01:24:39,458 --> 01:24:39,879
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

1203
01:24:40,119 --> 01:24:40,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so it won.

1204
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.

1205
01:24:42,781 --> 01:24:53,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the comment here made by Nintendo UK General Manager David Yarton is, Only Nintendo could make arithmetic fun.

1206
01:24:56,839 --> 01:25:06,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we all know Konami made Dancing Fun, and DDR Supernova had its track list revealed earlier this week, and some controversial songs showing up in the game.

1207
01:25:06,183 --> 01:25:11,565
[SPEAKER_05]: The fan community has their panties in a bunch that Fallout Boy is showing up with Dance Dance in the game.

1208
01:25:11,985 --> 01:25:14,546
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, some old fan favorites are coming to the game.

1209
01:25:14,786 --> 01:25:19,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Freckles, which you guys remember from DDR Max, and let's see, we also have some other songs.

1210
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:22,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Since You've Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson was already announced before.

1211
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:24,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this song.

1212
01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:26,191
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't heard this song yet, you really should.

1213
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:29,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called The Other Side by Paul Van Dyke featuring Wayne Johnson.

1214
01:25:29,591 --> 01:25:30,291
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good one.

1215
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Franz Ferdinand would do you want to.

1216
01:25:32,853 --> 01:25:35,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Full song list is available over at orangelaunchradio.com.

1217
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:36,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, get this.

1218
01:25:37,074 --> 01:25:38,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle without honor or humanity.

1219
01:25:39,795 --> 01:25:40,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Waka Laka Raining Men

1220
01:26:07,154 --> 01:26:08,997
[SPEAKER_05]: is in the game as well, some old fan favorites.

1221
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:13,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And some really good contemporary hits as well showing up in the game.

1222
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:17,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we had a Don't Ya by the Pussycat Dolls, a remix showing up there.

1223
01:26:17,668 --> 01:26:20,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Free by Blue October, the Liberation mix.

1224
01:26:21,193 --> 01:26:21,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

1225
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Juno Reactor with Masters of the Universe, Prodigy with No Good, Start the Dance, Oblivion by Never Rocka did that song.

1226
01:26:33,057 --> 01:26:34,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, no, no, Real Life did Oblivion.

1227
01:26:34,878 --> 01:26:35,838
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Never Rocka mix.

1228
01:26:36,038 --> 01:26:38,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Stray Cats with Rock This Town.

1229
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:39,319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

1230
01:26:39,339 --> 01:26:40,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very cool.

1231
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And get this.

1232
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,400
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so cool.

1233
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you can appreciate this too, DarkSakura.

1234
01:26:46,141 --> 01:26:48,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo.

1235
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1236
01:26:50,976 --> 01:26:51,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that cool?

1237
01:26:52,357 --> 01:26:52,877
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1238
01:26:53,718 --> 01:26:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1239
01:26:54,498 --> 01:26:56,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie has like her mouth wide, like jaw on floor.

1240
01:26:56,919 --> 01:26:57,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

1241
01:26:57,419 --> 01:26:57,900
[SPEAKER_05]: What a cool.

1242
01:26:58,200 --> 01:26:58,640
Rad.

1243
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:01,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultramix 4 is made of awesome and win.

1244
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:04,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be playing some of these tracks that perhaps you have not heard yet.

1245
01:27:04,703 --> 01:27:07,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you which ones because then I'd be telling you what's on the viewer.

1246
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:11,627
[SPEAKER_05]: But pretty soon we're going to be playing some of these tracks here on Orange Launch Radio live.

1247
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:13,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Not during the podcast though.

1248
01:27:13,308 --> 01:27:15,089
[SPEAKER_05]: See orangelaunchradio.com for the details.

1249
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,070
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty cool.

1250
01:27:17,264 --> 01:27:25,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of other things that are cool, the cast of Family Guy has signed up to do Voices for a Game.

1251
01:27:26,727 --> 01:27:31,188
[SPEAKER_03]: 2K actually said that the entire cast was signed to do a game that's based on the series.

1252
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:36,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be out in the fall, and of course, since it's Family Guy, it will be based on the series.

1253
01:27:39,091 --> 01:27:43,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still... Given how some of the Simpsons games have looked out, I'm not sure.

1254
01:27:44,656 --> 01:27:52,982
[SPEAKER_03]: But as it was described, you'll be able to switch back and forth between three characters, which is Peter Griffin, Stewie, and Brian.

1255
01:27:53,503 --> 01:27:53,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

1256
01:27:53,743 --> 01:28:00,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would have thought that you could have switched back and forth between the plot and really obscure pop culture references.

1257
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our show.

1258
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:05,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's actually more characters than that, because I remember seeing a screenshot with...

1259
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I'm drawing blanks now.

1260
01:28:10,132 --> 01:28:12,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Their fucking neighbor, the guy with sex craze.

1261
01:28:12,674 --> 01:28:13,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't remember.

1262
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Chasing after the nurses.

1263
01:28:15,657 --> 01:28:18,160
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're going to be characters you interact with.

1264
01:28:18,861 --> 01:28:21,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not sure, but it's freaking sweet.

1265
01:28:22,024 --> 01:28:24,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's coming out actually in October.

1266
01:28:25,307 --> 01:28:26,128
[SPEAKER_04]: October 18th.

1267
01:28:26,929 --> 01:28:28,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually pretty sweet.

1268
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:31,241
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, to be honest though, the game didn't look that good.

1269
01:28:31,562 --> 01:28:32,823
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, it didn't look that good.

1270
01:28:33,544 --> 01:28:43,454
[SPEAKER_04]: But, if that might not be the game for you, you may be a fan of, say, import games such like Disgaea, and I mentioned Disgaea 2 was actually coming out this coming week.

1271
01:28:44,135 --> 01:28:48,199
[SPEAKER_04]: However, though, if you may want something a little bit more portable, well, fear not.

1272
01:28:49,127 --> 01:28:57,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you live in Japan, at least, Disgaea 2, or Disgaea is actually heading to the PSP, so you can check that out.

1273
01:28:57,433 --> 01:29:15,345
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually set to release in Japan on November 30th, and they're going to be offering two packages, one for 4,800 yen, which will be the standard package, and 6,800 yen for a limited edition version, and they haven't really announced yet what's going to be coming out in the limited version, so...

1274
01:29:16,508 --> 01:29:20,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe an import, since the PSP is fully region-free.

1275
01:29:21,609 --> 01:29:24,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's not uncommon for games to be remade for other systems.

1276
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:32,592
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one other interesting quote that has people buzzing this week regards GameCube games possibly being remade for the Wii.

1277
01:29:33,132 --> 01:29:41,014
[SPEAKER_05]: A quote from Miyamoto in Nintendo Dream Magazine, quote, I'm also thinking I can remake some of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote.

1278
01:29:41,554 --> 01:29:48,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can wander into a second-hand shop and buy a lot of these games still, so I don't think we can release these Wii Makes at a full price.

1279
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:55,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Since a lot of the development cost has already been accounted for, we'd be able to release these at a much more affordable price.

1280
01:29:55,384 --> 01:30:01,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And if others also take advantage of this and release Wii Makes, there's a high possibility of a lot of software from third parties as well.

1281
01:30:01,888 --> 01:30:09,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if, say, for example, I don't know, maybe release Mario Kart Double Dash for the Wii...

1282
01:30:10,034 --> 01:30:11,055
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1283
01:30:25,134 --> 01:30:32,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, though, if they could release something, you know, say even just like some of the Luigi's Mansion or something would be perfect for the Wii.

1284
01:30:33,342 --> 01:30:37,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe something like that for like, you know, even 1999 would be pretty cool.

1285
01:30:38,027 --> 01:30:41,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think that game would be pretty cool with the Wii.

1286
01:30:42,191 --> 01:30:46,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think they would probably do a sequel to Luigi's Mansion, more like first person or something.

1287
01:30:47,115 --> 01:30:49,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Luigi's Mansion 2, the non-sucky version.

1288
01:30:49,117 --> 01:30:49,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1289
01:30:50,339 --> 01:30:51,900
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see what happens with that.

1290
01:30:53,080 --> 01:31:02,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that don't suck, DarkSakura likes to surf the web up and down and back and forth every single week and find a website that she loves and adores that she wants to share with you, the listener.

1291
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:05,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week, and here it is.

1292
01:31:09,848 --> 01:31:18,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's Website of the Week is... OtterPops.com Dude, Alexander the Grape!

1293
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:19,793
I know!

1294
01:31:21,056 --> 01:31:30,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, when I was in middle school in the 80s, we could go by Otter Pops on Friday after P.E.

1295
01:31:31,703 --> 01:31:37,586
[SPEAKER_05]: You realize that pretty much all Otter Pops are is like a double-strength Kool-Aid that's frozen?

1296
01:31:37,806 --> 01:31:39,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's so good.

1297
01:31:39,347 --> 01:31:42,249
[SPEAKER_05]: With those stupid little characters on them, like Alexander the Grape?

1298
01:31:42,269 --> 01:31:43,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love them.

1299
01:31:44,010 --> 01:31:44,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, who doesn't?

1300
01:31:44,710 --> 01:31:48,733
[SPEAKER_03]: But the site is pretty cool because it has music from the Otter Pop stars.

1301
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,493
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can meet the band and fun stuff.

1302
01:31:52,513 --> 01:31:54,114
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get Otter Pop t-shirts.

1303
01:31:55,075 --> 01:31:56,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go on an Otter Pop diet.

1304
01:31:57,876 --> 01:31:59,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think I'd lose weight on an Otter Pop diet?

1305
01:31:59,978 --> 01:32:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

1306
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:04,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Sir Isaac Lime help me lose weight?

1307
01:32:04,341 --> 01:32:07,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that I think an Otter Pop is, what, 100 calories?

1308
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:09,264
[SPEAKER_03]: For you to get...

1309
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:10,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1310
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:40,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have a flat ass like Loki, I need to go on the Otter Pop Diet

1311
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:21,705
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, I don't have a flat ass I know, that's why I said the earth is as flat as your ass alright, um but no, Otter Pops especially the blue raspberry I really don't know how to do a segment and Otter Pops is all about Pudding Pops Pudding Pops are back!

1312
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:23,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Pudding Pops.

1313
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:25,050
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss Pudding Pops.

1314
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:29,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I really don't know how to transition from Otter Pops to this, so I'm just going to say it.

1315
01:33:29,611 --> 01:33:37,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy III came out in Japan, and basically it was sold out within 30 minutes of when shops opened for business there.

1316
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:43,054
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lines early in the morning going around the block waiting for this game.

1317
01:33:43,094 --> 01:33:46,735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beloved game in the series, Final Fantasy III, so why are you smiling?

1318
01:33:47,035 --> 01:33:50,476
[SPEAKER_04]: It sold out faster than an Otter Pop melting in the summer heat.

1319
01:33:52,282 --> 01:33:53,823
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good connection!

1320
01:34:12,839 --> 01:34:17,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, people line up for all those movies and stuff, but you don't really have that same crate.

1321
01:34:17,404 --> 01:34:19,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess there was Xbox 360.

1322
01:34:19,325 --> 01:34:20,046
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty nutty.

1323
01:34:20,086 --> 01:34:21,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait for Halo 3.

1324
01:34:21,688 --> 01:34:22,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jesus.

1325
01:34:22,749 --> 01:34:26,593
[SPEAKER_03]: On September 9th, 1999, I was in line for a Dreamcast.

1326
01:34:26,713 --> 01:34:28,014
[SPEAKER_05]: With nine other people?

1327
01:34:28,394 --> 01:34:28,554
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1328
01:34:29,415 --> 01:34:30,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1329
01:34:50,987 --> 01:34:52,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Blizzard!

1330
01:35:18,623 --> 01:35:20,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Please put Pandarins in the next expansion.

1331
01:35:21,179 --> 01:35:22,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, Skye.

1332
01:35:22,523 --> 01:35:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1333
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:23,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and kisses.

1334
01:35:24,605 --> 01:35:27,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost quit World of Warcraft.

1335
01:35:49,687 --> 01:35:51,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jamie's going to quit World of Warcraft.

1336
01:35:51,408 --> 01:35:51,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what?

1337
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:54,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck Final Fantasy XI, Phantasy Star Universe for a little while for me.

1338
01:35:54,551 --> 01:35:59,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And Phantasy Star Universe, no cost to you as far as online goes because it's going to be over live.

1339
01:35:59,835 --> 01:36:01,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love you, Sega.

1340
01:36:01,876 --> 01:36:02,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

1341
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:04,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega is still our friend.

1342
01:36:04,698 --> 01:36:05,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sega.

1343
01:36:05,919 --> 01:36:07,180
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I assume it's no cost.

1344
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:09,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming because they have dedicated servers and stuff.

1345
01:36:10,142 --> 01:36:13,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, but I'm assuming it's no cost because it's over live and stuff like that.

1346
01:36:14,165 --> 01:36:15,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think I'm going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

1347
01:36:15,765 --> 01:36:16,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me to that.

1348
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:17,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

1349
01:36:17,886 --> 01:36:19,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the interim I am going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

1350
01:36:20,647 --> 01:36:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, I guess there is the PC version and they're not dedicated servers.

1351
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:31,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the, again, because now when Miklatov tries to pressure me to go back to Final Fantasy XI, I'm just going to say, look, Phantasy Star, look, I can't, I can't.

1352
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:32,750
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll quit too when Phantasy Star comes out.

1353
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:33,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to go back to PS Opium.

1354
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,631
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for a month.

1355
01:36:36,042 --> 01:36:39,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to start the OL Army Guild on Phantasy Star Universe.

1356
01:36:39,204 --> 01:36:40,785
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be tons of fun.

1357
01:36:40,925 --> 01:36:44,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to join the OL Army on any, a variety of games, it's growing and growing.

1358
01:36:44,828 --> 01:36:45,789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Saints Row.

1359
01:36:45,809 --> 01:36:47,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting a gang in Saints Row.

1360
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:48,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Saints Row is going to be fun as well.

1361
01:36:49,991 --> 01:36:53,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And Saints Row is a game that I fucking own at, so you know what?

1362
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:53,734
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1363
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:53,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

1364
01:36:53,994 --> 01:36:54,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Them's fighting.

1365
01:36:54,694 --> 01:36:58,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're going to throw down the challenge to Scott and actually play this time?

1366
01:36:58,977 --> 01:36:59,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

1367
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:04,601
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do death matches by myself because I can guarantee that I will be there, but I can't guarantee a team...

1368
01:37:05,021 --> 01:37:05,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1369
01:37:24,975 --> 01:37:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: RoboTron

1370
01:37:52,797 --> 01:37:53,998
[SPEAKER_04]: is the thought here.

1371
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:57,459
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes from actually Xbox 365.

1372
01:37:57,999 --> 01:38:00,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks.

1373
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:03,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's something very interesting.

1374
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:09,444
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pre-order Elebits, one of the fun little prizes that you're going to get is a stuffed Elebit.

1375
01:38:10,325 --> 01:38:12,025
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little plushy thing for you.

1376
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was pretty much my... Oh, I wanted to mention real quick, actually, I got a few more, I forgot.

1377
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackdown, that game's going to be coming out, actually, November 1st.

1378
01:38:25,405 --> 01:38:30,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got some pretty cool stuff that they're going to be offering as downloadable content.

1379
01:38:30,949 --> 01:38:36,234
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that they're talking about is an instant replay, kind of...

1380
01:38:37,765 --> 01:38:38,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1381
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:56,913
[SPEAKER_04]: and because they built the game with that kind of stuff in mind.

1382
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:16,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other things, if you aren't getting cracked down and happen to pick up a box of cereal, Kellogg's is packing some really crappy Xbox minigames that you can check out, including Spaceship Blaster, Motorcycle Madness, Disco Mania, Robo Blast, and Mystic Castle, which I'm sure...

1383
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:18,040
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1384
01:39:32,572 --> 01:39:52,807
[SPEAKER_04]: including, of course, Richard Lotax from Something Awful, and Cool News writer Jeff Snyder, Horror Magazine, Rue Morgue writer Chris Alexander, and a fifth opponent who, it says, and this is from GameSpot, has a reason to believe is a minor.

1385
01:39:53,328 --> 01:39:55,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Uwe Boll is beating up children.

1386
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1387
01:39:57,411 --> 01:39:58,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a loser.

1388
01:39:59,052 --> 01:39:59,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1389
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:02,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I actually have a couple of stories.

1390
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:11,121
[SPEAKER_03]: As they applied to our European listeners, Microsoft actually cut the Xbox 360 core unit to 199 pounds.

1391
01:40:13,283 --> 01:40:15,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

1392
01:40:15,444 --> 01:40:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

1393
01:40:17,246 --> 01:40:19,608
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually was effective as of today.

1394
01:40:20,108 --> 01:40:21,509
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say yesterday.

1395
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:22,610
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 pounds lighter.

1396
01:40:23,711 --> 01:40:24,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on a diet.

1397
01:40:24,571 --> 01:40:25,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1398
01:40:26,779 --> 01:40:31,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they've dropped the retail price so that it would sell a little bit better, I suppose.

1399
01:40:31,983 --> 01:40:36,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I believe that I read this right, is that Eurogamer.de has launched.

1400
01:40:39,049 --> 01:40:44,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our German friends, there's some good info there.

1401
01:40:44,333 --> 01:40:47,956
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have pictures of Silent Hill Origins up there as well.

1402
01:40:48,456 --> 01:40:51,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I can read German, but I do not understand it.

1403
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what an estet is, though.

1404
01:40:55,618 --> 01:41:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: The little B thing, it goes... But I took German for three weeks and then had to change classes.

1405
01:41:06,341 --> 01:41:09,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one last piece of news, and it's actually regarding Phantasy Star Universe.

1406
01:41:10,004 --> 01:41:10,865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming from the chat room.

1407
01:41:11,846 --> 01:41:15,168
[SPEAKER_05]: John F. is in chat right now, and he's like a guru on Phantasy Star Universe.

1408
01:41:15,849 --> 01:41:17,070
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying about the pricing.

1409
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:18,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unknown right now about the 360.

1410
01:41:19,152 --> 01:41:23,275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rumored that Sega's trying to work it out with Microsoft right now on the pricing.

1411
01:41:23,555 --> 01:41:29,721
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a monthly payment for the PS2 and Windows version, but if you just want to play story mode and extra mode, there's no fee there.

1412
01:41:30,301 --> 01:41:31,202
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just an FYI.

1413
01:41:31,222 --> 01:41:34,845
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually how PSO was, though, on Xbox.

1414
01:41:35,693 --> 01:41:39,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Until their billing messed up and a lot of people got their accounts for free.

1415
01:41:39,694 --> 01:41:40,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

1416
01:41:40,954 --> 01:41:45,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Kasumi19, Julie, she didn't pay for PSO for three years.

1417
01:41:46,216 --> 01:41:47,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

1418
01:41:48,756 --> 01:41:50,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1419
01:41:51,117 --> 01:41:51,957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it.

1420
01:41:51,997 --> 01:41:53,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, no Part B this week, folks.

1421
01:41:53,938 --> 01:41:55,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mini-episode because we're pre-taping.

1422
01:41:55,618 --> 01:41:58,099
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see you back here with a full episode next week, though.

1423
01:41:58,119 --> 01:41:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be a fun time.

1424
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:00,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Power previews start next week.

1425
01:42:00,139 --> 01:42:00,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be fun.

1426
01:42:01,099 --> 01:42:01,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, final thought.

1427
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to play lots of Saints Row this weekend.

1428
01:42:04,882 --> 01:42:07,863
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I need to hurry up and schedule my next Street Fighter 2 match.

1429
01:42:08,084 --> 01:42:11,245
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot I was in that tournament until like two seconds ago when Arcade came up.

1430
01:42:11,725 --> 01:42:12,686
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1431
01:42:12,926 --> 01:42:18,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been telling everybody give me money for Christmas so that I can buy a premium annual pass for Disneyland.

1432
01:42:19,128 --> 01:42:19,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1433
01:42:19,489 --> 01:42:20,889
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want for Christmas from everybody.

1434
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:21,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1435
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:22,930
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see if she gets it.

1436
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:24,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Till next time.

1437
01:42:24,331 --> 01:42:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And reject false icons.

1438
01:42:25,731 --> 01:42:26,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Till next time.

1439
01:42:26,512 --> 01:42:28,773
