00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How was that Nintendo press conference this week anyway?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And how many Xbox Live points will you need to spend to play a full game of Luminous?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

We are that independent podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
lifestyle.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,520
You might know me as Sky and I'm here on this journey with you every single week.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,320
Also joining us in our party, say hello to our resident Black Mage, Dark Sakura, also

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,920
known as Fuego. Jamie Summers. Fuego. Fuego3. Fern. Fern. Fern. See, that's why she's the

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Black Mage folks. And say hello to our resident treasure hunter, Loki. Hey. How you doing?

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,640
Good. All right. Everybody have a good week? Yes? Oh, I sure did. Did you have a good week

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
off, Dark Sakura? I went to Disneyland. Anything exciting going on Disneyland? Disneyland?

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,520
We went to Disneyland during Bats Day. Bats Day? When the goth community of Los Angeles

18
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,360
decides to take over Disneyland.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,200
You totally did that on purpose.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
No.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,960
She had had, we had this all scheduled out like months in advance before we even realized.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,860
So um, the baby bats came out in full force on uh, Sunday.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,560
So we avoided Haunted Mansion.

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
And um.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,720
I could just imagine what Haunted Mansion looks like on Goth Day.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
They converged.

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,180
While all the baby bats, there were a few legitimate old bats, but there were a lot

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,280
of baby bats, you know, Hot Topic, Wannabe.

29
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,000
I remember the old days when we used to have to shop in fetish stores and thrift shops

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,680
and make our own clothes.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,320
But yeah, I rode pirates a bunch of times and like the second time we decided to sing

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,600
through it and we called Barbossa Dreamboat Barbie because he was up on his boat.

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,080
The changes they made to pirates were cool.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Really because I thought most people have been saying they kind of suck because you

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
know.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,040
They did the PC changes and then they changed a few things back and added in the movie characters.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Oh that's good.

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,780
all the Jack stuff was like whoa Jack and then haunted mansion they actually

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,180
changed part of it you've ever been in haunted mansion the attic with the bride

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,760
where she's all tragic and sad instead now they've made her a bit more sinister

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,260
where you go by different paintings of her and her various husbands and their

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,020
heads all disappear and then you see a hologram of her holding an axe till

43
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:50,500
death do us part okay well let's uh and um and Kristen pointed out something fun

44
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,380
that the gardener before you go in the graveyard is wearing Walt Disney shoes

45
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,020
huh I went on big Thunder Mountain was it fun oh yeah it's fun I couldn't see

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,780
anything it's the new Space Mountain is cool oh we got to be careful not to

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,620
become the amusement park podcast because we do want to get to games here

48
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,820
so yeah all right tell us about it what's your gaming with was what you

49
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,420
played this week um I played Dead Rising which was freaking rad and I'm not any

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,480
good at it oops I died so many times and but I figured out that I like the size

51
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,400
because it decapitates the undead and played in the Super Mario Brothers

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,320
finally I got a free copy actually technically GameStop got a free copy and

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,360
it became mine so I I played a bunch of that in the waiting room at the

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,240
doctor's office good day because game boys are great to have in a doctor's

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,160
office and I played some DDR and I'm kind of still okay at it sort of avoided

56
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,120
the arcade though at Disneyland because it's like and the spawn of of people are

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,160
hanging around and my quote from Disneyland though best quote ever this

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,320
is totally makes me decide never to have children

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
I wanna ride the teacups!

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Only the EHHH part was like a lot longer.

61
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Wow. Did you ride the teacups?

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Yes I did.

63
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
That's my favorite.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,320
And I sang a merry end birthday while riding the teacups.

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Thank you for the lollipops by the way from Disneyland. I appreciate that.

66
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Aren't they fabulous?

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
They're great. One of them is shaped very phallic-ly. Let's just leave it at that.

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I was like that one's for Rob.

69
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
It's long. Anyway, any other games?

70
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
I had lots of smoothies.

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:34,900
Alright, Loki. Well, um, I played games this week. No, um, I was playing a lot of Xbox

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,920
Live's demos, um, including Just Cause, which is awesome. It's very, I don't know, it's

73
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,080
kind of like, not really Grand Theft Auto-ish, I mean, you can steal cars and stuff, but

74
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,420
it reminds me if, like, you were to take Lord Croft Tomb Raider, replace Lord Croft with

75
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,960
Antonio Banderas and then stick her in like a Grand Theft Auto game and then I don't know

76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,760
just add a bunch of stunts to it and that's pretty much the game because you can do a

77
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,120
lot of like really cool stuff like jumping from car to car and it makes it really simple

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,480
or you can steal a car jump onto the roof and then hit your parachute and just you know

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,760
parasail around and just really crazy stuff and then there's a whole lot of like Mexican

80
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:22,920
you know music blaring and like lots of VIVA LA REVOLUTION you know stuff like that so it's

81
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,600
pretty cool and definitely worth picking up when it comes out and the demo is also pretty cool

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,320
they've give you about you know four different people to kill and uh i got to the point where

83
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,240
there's helicopters chasing after me and i blew up on the helicopters and it exploded very fiery

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,560
and it was awesome so definitely recommend that and then of course um was it i tried a little bit

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,140
of Texas Hole and played like a game and just said eh, and I'll play it later when it's

86
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,600
not so buggy. And then, um, what else did I play? Oh yeah, I got a retail copy of Saints

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,800
Row four days early, so I decided to play a little bit of that and I'll probably play

88
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,080
more this weekend. And yeah, I think that, oh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

89
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,080
because that's still fucking awesome and we're still gonna be playing it until Vice City

90
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,440
these stories come out, and then we're going to have the official switching of the game

91
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,320
and play that for a year until San Andreas Stories comes out.

92
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,040
My gaming week was kind of not that eventful, I didn't actually play a whole lot.

93
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,360
As far as new stuff goes, I checked out Texas Hold'em, which was free on Xbox Live, so I

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,560
downloaded that and played it.

95
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,720
You know, it's kind of funny, I just was randomly up really late on Tuesday, so at 1 AM when

96
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
the game was released, I actually downloaded it, and of course, in not even like 10 minutes

97
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,200
I get an invite into an Xbox Live game and it was actually being run by another podcaster

98
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Godfrey over at Gamertag, so it was kind of cool that like, you know, we were getting

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,420
together and playing on the Xbox Live.

100
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,560
As far as Texas Hold'em goes, how I like the game itself, I don't think it's something

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
I would have spent ten bucks on.

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm kind of glad they had that free period because, you know, the game does seem to still

103
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,640
be a little bit buggy and, I don't know, I'm just not that excited by Texas Hold'em Poker.

104
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,840
I think the whole thing's a little bit saturated to me, you know, with all the specials they

105
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,920
they have on TV and all the other 5,000 poker clones they have out. I mean yeah

106
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,580
it's kind of nice to have it on Xbox Live and you know I suppose if you're a

107
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,120
poker fan you know this will be a really easy thing for you to pick up and it's

108
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,920
probably cheaper even ten dollars than anything else is out there on the market.

109
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm surprised that they put the game out now. It's being that there's also two

110
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,920
more poker games coming out all in poker and was it no World's in World Series of

111
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,040
Poker Tournament of Champions are both coming out. Granted they're both gonna be

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,200
$39.99, but still, I mean, you have this free game for Texas Hold'em, why am I gonna go

113
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,420
buy a $40 game now? I mean, yeah. And granted it might be more polished, but it's a free

114
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:55,360
game, it's Texas Hold'em, I mean, you can't really jazz up Texas Hold'em too much.

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,460
I guess the nicest thing about it is that most of my friends online have it, so there's

116
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,360
always at least one game we can play together, but I don't know, I just, I wish the pacing

117
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
of the game could be sped up, especially in single player. Like, if I've already folded,

118
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
I just want them to run through it. I don't really want to watch bet.

119
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
You know, maybe it's just because I don't really watch on ESPN. I don't get

120
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
the thrill of watching it.

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,960
I do like some of the little subtleties they put in. For instance, when everybody

122
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
does go all-in,

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,480
like it shows that percentage of like the odds that you have to win the hand.

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,040
So, you know, I don't know. That was kind of neat. And I do like the concept of having one

125
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,840
bankroll

126
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,040
that you build and build through. So like when you make bets, you can't just restart

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,360
with a

128
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,880
brand new bank. Like if you make a bet, that will impact your

129
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,280
entire history on xbox live you could bet it all away so I

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,880
I like that concept that's kinda neat so I'll give the game credit for that

131
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,040
and I guess it looks good for an xbox live game but yeah why does it always

132
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,880
why does it always pan up on the table deal and then pan back down like every time

133
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,640
I didn't get that at all this some of the weird things and I thought it was supposed to

134
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
support the camera

135
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,040
and I know Godfrey had a camera and he said it wasn't doing anything so I don't

136
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,520
I don't know whatever it's free

137
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,320
can't complain about free things so what can I say I mean it was worth checking out

138
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,820
But if you haven't already downloaded it, I don't think it's worth the $10.

139
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,320
Maybe download the demo, see if you like it, I don't know. Or if you're really into poker, maybe you'll like it.

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
But you probably already got it if you're really into poker.

141
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I was just thinking something. There's that game that's coming out, or the collection, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged that's coming out.

142
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
And we know that Texas Hold'em is going to be probably patched later on.

143
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,320
But Live Arcade Unplugged is for people that don't have Live or don't have an internet connection.

144
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
So they're going to be buying this game and getting a really buggy copy.

145
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
But they're only playing single-player anyway. Yeah, but still though,

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
it's still buggy. I don't know.

147
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Alright, well let's go ahead and get into some gaming news tonight.

148
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
And we're going to start it off with a little report on Konami's fourth annual Summer

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,920
Barbecue.

150
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,040
Loki and I were at the Konami Summer Barbecue this week. Yes.

151
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,480
And we saw a lot of new games. Yeah, that's cool. So let me just throw some games out there,

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,640
we'll talk about them a little bit.

153
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,520
Death Junior 2 on the PSP. It looked pretty good. I played the first Death Junior for

154
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,680
about maybe an

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,920
hour and I got bored of it pretty quick.

156
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,680
It looked a lot better. Definitely rebuilt from the ground up and looks

157
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,080
like the graphics are a lot better.

158
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,240
To be honest, I mean, I've kind of outgrown the platform games like that, so it's

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,560
not really appealing to me, but if anybody, you know,

160
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,760
really is into that stuff, I think it's definitely a game that will be worth picking up.

161
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
Yeah, the game definitely looked more polished to me than the first game in the

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,200
series that they released. I know fans of the series will be really happy that they

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,800
can play as Pandora now. I know that they were talking about how they fixed a lot of

164
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,820
the camera because of complaints in the first game, and the camera, you know, it felt like

165
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,040
a typical platformer to me when I played it. I actually did get to put hands-on on it,

166
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,400
and it was kind of nice. You could do, like, strafing and all this other stuff too that

167
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,600
felt really good. I also thought it was neat because you can play co-op through the entire

168
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
game. It's not just selected levels or modes, but you can play co-op with a friend through

169
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,560
the whole game, and by the way, they hinted that there might be a cheat mode where you

170
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,820
you can fight each other.

171
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,280
Oops, that was supposed to be off the record.

172
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,160
Sorry, I wasn't supposed to say anything about that.

173
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,920
Oh, and there's chickens that fire laser beams

174
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
from their eyes, that's cool.

175
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,640
That's the coolest thing I've ever heard of.

176
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,840
So if you have that Invader Zim style sense of humor,

177
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,240
you'd get a kick out of Death Junior 2, probably.

178
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,120
Yeah, especially since Pandora kind of reminds you

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,080
of Gaz a little bit, so.

180
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,000
Silent Hill Origins PSP, or should I say Silent Evil 4.

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,360
Because it's very similar in look and feel

182
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,940
to the Resident Evil 4, I thought.

183
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,140
But I mean, it works.

184
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,480
It works for Silent Hill.

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,400
what you think? I really like what they did with it and more kind of it almost

186
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,800
seems like they're going to be going more of an action route more Resident

187
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,240
Evil type but it the game itself looks really good even though I mean it wasn't

188
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,160
hardly done at all I think like 30% or something

189
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,240
yeah a lot of placeholder stuff but it looked really good and I was very

190
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,120
impressed by what they were showing us on the PSP. Fans of Silent Hill are

191
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,280
actually gonna be really pleased it definitely you know even though we're

192
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,080
joking a little bit about the whole over-the-shoulder camera switch it

193
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,360
It definitely has that Silent Hill feel that you guys are used to.

194
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,840
Fourteen new Akira Yamaoka songs, four of which have the vocals from Mary Elizabeth

195
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
McGlynn.

196
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,340
So that's going to be awesome.

197
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,500
One third of the town comes from the original game and then they added a new two thirds

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
to the town.

199
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,400
So that's pretty cool.

200
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,160
And it looked pretty cool just as far as I like the weapons that you can select and stuff.

201
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,160
And how they have the automatic cameras for when you're going to different spots.

202
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,760
will actually you know do the Silent Hill cameras you know where really high

203
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
shot or low shot yeah that was kind of cool I like you could do the the whole

204
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,480
camera switching a little bit it's not all over the shoulder they said that as

205
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,000
far as the story goes it incorporates elements of the film but that doesn't

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,480
disrupt the story of the other games so there will be elements of the film in it

207
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,640
Travis is the name of the main character you do come into contact with Dahlia in

208
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,960
the game and Alyssa is in the story but the connection of Silent Hill 1 not as

209
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,200
strong as you might think by hearing that so they also said the outdoor area

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,520
is kind of a sandbox type game with it leads into other interior areas which

211
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,960
you know was kind of the way most of the others you know at least silent 2 and

212
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,200
some of the other ones were anyway so that makes sense some of the melee

213
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,980
weapons you'll get to use sledgehammer tire iron and shovel can't wait to a

214
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,800
beat-up zombies with a shovel that should be fun I want to use a tire that's

215
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,320
the thing that's the kind of thing it sort of is a little bit different to me

216
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,800
from the other Silent Hills is where you've got this character, the lead is very strong.

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,360
I mean, bludgeoning the crap out of, you know, creatures with a sledgehammer instead of,

218
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,800
you know, maybe just, you know, a weak, you know, woman or something trying to beat up

219
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,240
something, you know, with whatever, a stick or something.

220
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,840
It's like, you know, this guy could kick ass, I mean, that's kind of cool.

221
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,840
He's a trucker.

222
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,840
Exactly.

223
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Marvel trading card game coming to DS, PSP, and the PC.

224
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,200
You know, to be honest, I don't play the trading card games and I don't like, you know, Yu-Gi-Oh

225
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
or anything like that.

226
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:00,240
I did like the fact how they're talking about being able to play on the PSP versus PC, which

227
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,680
is, you know, the first for that.

228
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,480
And I'd like to see more games utilize something like that, because that's pretty cool.

229
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,240
And the DS is going to use Wi-Fi, which is pretty cool too.

230
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
That's pretty awesome.

231
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,400
So, you know, if you're into those trading card games or you like the Marvel game, they

232
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,360
they did say all heroes and villains in the card game will be in there and all

233
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,400
the cutscenes were done by the Marvel artists and writers and they know it's

234
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,200
gonna be authentic and they were also talking about the PC version being

235
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,480
actually like a free almost like a handout at like comic cons and stuff

236
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,520
like that where they would give the game out and basically you would go download

237
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,620
a pack and it would be all kind of like e-content that you would download like

238
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,640
cards and stuff so that's pretty cool

239
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,240
all right try to say this next one three times fast you ready winning 11

240
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
pro evolution soccer 2007 yes what did you think of what did you think of

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,320
winning 11 pro evolution soccer 2007 um it looks pretty good actually for a

242
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,360
soccer game I haven't really played too much of FIFA so I can't really compare

243
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,120
it but just from like shots I've seen you have FIFA and kind of the way it's

244
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,640
playing I mean I you know it's number one soccer game in the world right for

245
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,520
a reason so you know I thought it was interesting because I guess the build we

246
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,320
were looking at was pretty early it looked to be running off the pro evo 6

247
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,400
engine so right wasn't that what it was yeah yeah so you know we were looking at

248
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,720
an early build but we did get to see it with the next-gen graphics they were

249
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,000
showing it on the 360 and so I loved how when you paused it you know I'm not

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,120
really super into sports games but I do love me some soccer don't get me wrong I

251
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,720
think it's a great sport I used to play when I was a kid little-known fact I do

252
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,440
love the fact when you pause the game it's almost like remember when you

253
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
pause the game in Super Smash Brothers Melee you could spin the camera around

254
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,100
like anywhere you want and zoom in is it like it does that with the the soccer

255
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,120
and you can slowly move it forward and slowly move it back and like it's so

256
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,040
detailed that you see the eyes on the people's faces now the only problem in

257
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
the build we saw was that all the background motions still kept going and

258
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,840
even it was paused but it's so early build I probably shouldn't even say that

259
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,680
it's really bill you know they're gonna fix that so not worried about that but

260
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,760
yeah I thought it was pretty cool and again cross cross-platform online

261
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,520
competition they said the PlayStation 2 and the PC they want them to be able to

262
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,760
play each other haven't guaranteed it yet but that's what they're working

263
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,600
towards thought that was very interesting yeah they also said the DS

264
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,320
version of the game is going to be a little more kid-friendly kind of a

265
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,520
throwback to the really old Pro Evo soccer soccer games where they want it

266
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,960
to be like the enabler for the series you know what I mean like kind of a

267
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,440
simplified version that gets people in the gateway soccer gateway soccer game I

268
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,200
think they called it. I thought that was kind of neat.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,640
Shallon Showdown coming to a variety of platforms.

270
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,640
You know the game looks very pretty and it's actually, you know, the animations are good

271
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,800
and it's kind of fun to play but I don't get it. I don't get the point to it because the

272
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,480
way the game is set up, I mean, it's almost like Power Stone where you're, you know, kind

273
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,560
of fighting stuff but I don't know if it was just a demo I was playing but I kept killing

274
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
robots and they just kept respawning and I did that for about 15 minutes and nothing

275
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
happened.

276
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,800
Was it maybe just because it was like supposed to be a tech demo or like it wasn't really

277
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
the game?

278
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,080
That's why I was thinking I'm like I hope this is the case but by reading most of the

279
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,200
descriptions of it, it sounds like that's not really the case and I mean it's really

280
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
good looking.

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
The game's supposed to be out November 14th.

282
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,840
Yeah I mean it's really good looking I just I don't get it I mean maybe if maybe this

283
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,640
is just part of the game and I'm not seeing you know I'm thinking that's probably what

284
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,080
it was, you know, but it looks very good, I mean, and fans of the show will definitely

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
like it.

286
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,560
Yeah, if you're a fan of the show, the head writers from the show wrote all the dialogue

287
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,320
and there's six playable characters in the game, the four main characters to start, and

288
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,520
you get two bad guys that are unlockable later on.

289
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,560
I thought what was interesting about the DS version, they have a bunch of mini-games that

290
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,840
use the stylus and the mic, kind of like Mario mini-games, but that's alright, it uses stylus

291
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,200
and air hockey and the microphone to, like, blow a ship across the sea and all that stuff.

292
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,000
They said the DS version of the game will have 30 hours of gameplay, which for a DS

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is pretty huge, so it sounds like it might have a lot of appeal there, especially for

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,260
fans of the show.

295
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,060
Coded Arms Contingent I played the original Coded Arms, didn't

296
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,280
care for it at all, and I'm liking how they're going to be actually, a couple things, they're

297
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,260
doing more variety of environments, and they're actually set stages, so it's not all this

298
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,920
random generated stuff, I mean, granted, the random generated stuff is kind of cool, and

299
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,740
Maybe they have a mode like that or something separate from the game, but the actual game

300
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,520
is not so good.

301
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,720
I do like the new details that they added to it.

302
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,680
It's a lot more polished in how you can map all your keys and stuff to your own configurations.

303
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
It's pretty cool.

304
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,700
Coded Arms is not my cup of tea either, but if you're a fan of the series, multiplayer

305
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,940
is going to be up to 8 players from 4 players.

306
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,180
The game is scheduled for March 2007, which is supposedly the time the PlayStation 3 version

307
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,540
is coming out as well, but it is separate stories.

308
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,560
The PSP and the PS3 versions are separate stories in the series.

309
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,460
Lunar Knights from Kojima Productions on the Nintendo DS.

310
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,220
Did you get a chance to look at that a little bit?

311
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,260
I didn't really get a chance to play it, but I saw them showing it off and stuff.

312
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,260
It looked pretty good.

313
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,620
It reminds me of Mega Man Battle Network a little bit.

314
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,620
It's Boktai.

315
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,580
Seriously, if you played that one with the sun and everything, it's almost just like

316
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,580
that.

317
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:16,060
Okay, yeah, that's kind of why they have the Sun and the moon and interesting green interesting

318
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,300
So yeah, you have some first-person modes in there as well

319
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,700
They definitely heavily use the elements in the game you draw on the screen like like when you're using like an air element you kind

320
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,300
Of twirl the stylus on the screen to create a tornado, which was kind of cute

321
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,700
So I I played through the first level of the demo and it was it was pretty cool

322
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
So awesome

323
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Metal Gear Solid portable ops

324
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,140
Very very awesome to see and especially since you know, I don't know about a lot of people out there

325
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,900
But I didn't like Metal Gear acid didn't care for it at all

326
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm kind of you know, hoping that they'd put out an actual metal your solid game on the PSP and this one looks really cool

327
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,560
They're doing a lot of elements or adding a lot of things that they didn't have any other games like the

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,260
Where you actually have a squad now three members. That was pretty cool

329
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:07,600
Yeah, this is the Metal Gear game that fans wanted a year ago. So it takes place six years after the snake eater story

330
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you notice that in the little trailer, it looks like the cutscenes are borrowed from

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,800
that comic book game they put out?

332
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Like the comic book Metal Gear?

333
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,840
Yeah, I thought that was really cool, because I love that look that the Metal Gear comic

334
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
thing had.

335
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,240
Yeah, and then you have the whole comrade thing where you build your own team.

336
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,840
That seems to be kind of the niche of this game, that you build your own team of people

337
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,400
and then you use people together, like you switch from one character to another and go

338
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,160
go back and forth, and that's how you can take out, you know, other guys in the area

339
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,800
that might be hard to get to, you know, a sniper who's got you in the sights, maybe

340
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,200
use somebody else to take out the sniper, I thought that was kind of cool.

341
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,520
Full voiceovers in the cinematics, the original voice actors are all back for this game, and

342
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,680
just an FYI, there's supposedly a ninja character that I don't know if we're supposed to mention

343
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,560
because they wouldn't say much about it there, but a whole lot more information is supposed

344
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,280
to be released on this Tokyo game show.

345
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,420
supposedly some sort of box hiding system yeah look if they said it I'm

346
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,080
reporting on it I'm sorry you know unless they specifically said don't

347
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,800
repeat this you know I if they let it slip out hey we got it we have a legal

348
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:23,360
obligation to report on it all right now here's one I have a ton of things to say

349
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,120
about Castlevania portrait or ruin what you think of this oh it's pretty good I

350
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,720
liked the game a lot actually played it in quite a bit and you know typical

351
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,240
Castlevania game, but it looks very good. I'm very impressed with what they've done

352
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,760
with the DS. I mean, I was incredibly impressed that they had an anime cut intro, you know,

353
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,680
it's like... What is up with Konami love for the handhelds

354
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,560
this year? That's pretty much all we saw. Like every, like seriously, almost every game

355
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,960
we saw had at least one version being made for the PSP or the DS. Yeah, every single

356
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,480
game we saw, except for Elibits, the Karaoke Revolution game, and the DDRs. But, I mean,

357
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,120
everything else had a handheld. Why would they even bother with the PSP since the sales

358
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,140
are kinda crap in Japan? Well, you know, what it comes down to is, I think there was even

359
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,600
some study out there that said that handhelds are actually more popular than console games,

360
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,040
which, you know, the facts don't really show that, but, I don't know, I think it's just...

361
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,440
A game like Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is going to sell PSPs. So, you know, maybe

362
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,580
that's part of it. So, maybe because it's got the muscle there. And, what was the other

363
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,740
thing about portable ops it utilizes the GPS supposedly yeah it's hot so

364
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,700
Castlevania portrait of ruin so cool I mean I love you can use y okay first off

365
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,540
you have to understand they've made some big changes to the basic formula now you

366
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,060
swap between two characters at the touch of a button you swap between Jonathan

367
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,540
who's kind of a traditional Belmont style character and then Charlotte who's

368
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,340
like magic and intellect based and like I thought was kind of cool because you

369
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,220
hold down the button to charge your magic and the longer you're able to hold

370
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,220
it down, the more powerful the attack is and the graphics match that.

371
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,900
I thought that was kind of neat.

372
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,620
She can stop time, heal, boost stats, all that stuff, but by a touch of another button

373
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,980
you bring them both on the screen at the same time to solve simple puzzles, which I thought

374
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
was pretty cool.

375
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,900
And then here's like the greatest thing, you finally get to go outside the damn castle.

376
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,300
That's what the portraits are all about, is that the bad guy paints these portraits and

377
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,420
I don't know, it's somehow how he has control over the castle.

378
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
Mario did it!

379
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,600
Whatever you go into these portraits and they take you to levels that are not inside a castle

380
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,660
So you get to go to an Egyptian level that's called sandy grave you go to a town level

381
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,260
That's called the city of Hays and it's all very Castlevania esque and it's it's quite cool

382
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:45,320
And this is cool because there's two characters. This game is gonna support Wi-Fi

383
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,580
local and internet Wi-Fi and get this

384
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,580
multiplayer co-op now sorry kids not in the one-player mode but you can do the

385
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,780
boss rush mode also something they weren't saying a lot of details about

386
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,860
was the shop mode there's a shop mode that's going to be Wi-Fi as well that

387
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,500
you're going to be able to trade items across the internet it sounds like they

388
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,980
would be really sketchy details the people from what I was piecing together

389
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,980
sounded like you'd be able to buy things from other people shops that you didn't

390
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,380
want and but kind of make trades like that I gave out items or something you

391
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,820
can sell them almost like an auction market type thing.

392
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
More details to come at Tokyo Game Show.

393
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,760
Pairs, by the way, seem to be a recurring theme in this game, because did you notice

394
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
there were the vampire bad guys, where Stella and Loretta were some of these female vampire

395
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
antagonist characters?

396
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,660
I thought that was kind of interesting.

397
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,460
So I think if you enjoyed last year's Castlevania, this one's going to up the ante.

398
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,620
I think you're going to be very, very impressed.

399
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

400
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,740
I think you're par for the Chorus Carry Revolution game with some added stuff.

401
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,260
I liked how they have all the different responses to how you did and will actually look at different

402
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,540
things including the costume of your character and your pitch and all that stuff.

403
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,900
I think this game is going to be huge.

404
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,980
And I don't think it's necessarily going to be the hardcore gamer crowd that gets into

405
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,700
this game, but I just think this is going to be a very accessible game for mainstream

406
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,000
especially the fact that it's you know based off American Idol and that they've

407
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,540
integrated the show so well into karaoke revolution I mean it's just a perfect

408
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,820
American and plus karaoke revolution was pretty much already that way though do

409
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,740
wasn't pour some sugar on me in the game or something like that yeah crazy

410
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,220
that's a crazy soul and also they've got it have a loan by heart which is like my

411
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,940
favorite and they're gonna be launching it at the same time as this almost the

412
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,660
start of the season so I think this game is going to begin him pin that thing on

413
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,520
the show like crazy. The only thing that didn't make sense to me, PS2 only. And I thought

414
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,260
the Xbox with the, you know, downloadable expansions and stuff was a great idea. So

415
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,300
I guess if the game does well, they'll probably port it to other platforms, but...

416
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,900
Well, I think the Xbox right now, they're kind of considering not doing that because

417
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,540
the Xbox is pretty much at the end of its cycle. The PS2 is going to be going on for

418
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,220
a while, but you don't want to put out a game that's pretty much, you know, who's going

419
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,620
really buy everyone's transitioning over to the Xbox 360 and they're not ready

420
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,920
to put out a next-gen version of it so you know that's kind of why that they're

421
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,740
not doing see with the GameCube you know they're not doing anything like that oh

422
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,280
by the way I have to say something about this because you know I can't keep my

423
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,640
damn mouth shut okay you remember how our podcast once got a negative review

424
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,140
because it was they were calling us a bunch of drunks or whatever and that

425
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,200
gaming journalists should you know be professional or whatever and not get

426
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,300
get drunk on air.

427
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,260
Did you notice how wild and crazy a lot of people at that party were, especially during

428
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,420
that American Idol contest and things of that nature?

429
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,540
Did you notice the journalist from...

430
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,660
I'm not 100% positive where he's from, so I shouldn't name it unless I have my facts

431
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,900
proved, but he walks in and holds up this bottle of like 40 or something and everybody's

432
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
cheering.

433
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,340
I'm just thinking to myself, I was like, I didn't know what to think.

434
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
One part of me thinks it's funny.

435
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
How about hypocrite?

436
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,500
But yeah, the other part of me thinks, this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever...

437
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Wasn't it weird?

438
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Okay, here's the...

439
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,300
Wasn't it weird being there, Loki?

440
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,820
It was weird, and here's why it's weird.

441
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,860
Because on the show, it's fine to fuck around every once in a while, because you make it

442
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
a disclaimer.

443
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,780
It's like, I wouldn't do that if I was on TV, maybe, because that might be a little

444
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,780
weird.

445
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,100
I mean, I don't know, getting drunk on live television probably wouldn't be good.

446
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:27,520
But going to a press event where you're going there to do business, you're not going there

447
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,560
to get drunk and fuck off.

448
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
This isn't like a company barbecue.

449
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,460
You can do that at your company barbecue, but you know what, you're going to do business

450
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
here.

451
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
This is a business thing.

452
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,720
You're doing interviews, you're getting information to report to the press and stuff, you're not

453
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
supposed to be look I got 40 let's get

454
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,320
wasted man I know I was like that maybe like

455
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,480
I just was in awe I didn't know what to think I was like I can't believe that's

456
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,680
like I thought it was a joke that would be funny if I was you know

457
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,880
not at a professional gaming event I thought it was a joke

458
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,320
I mean at first but you know they actually were out in the parking lot drinking

459
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,280
and I I kinda remember which outlet they're from but I

460
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,560
I don't wanna know did you know okay did you know did you notice this too

461
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,520
Now, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but I was the only person

462
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,640
in the whole freaking building that was taking notes on a laptop.

463
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,360
Now, granted, some of the other journalists were doing the old-fashioned pen and paper thing,

464
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
but I'm thinking to myself,

465
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,120
you all work for dot coms, and you're all like on the tech edge of things, and

466
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,200
you know, I just thought it was really surprising, because I don't know,

467
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,760
I personally, maybe it's a thing they teach you in journalist school, I don't know,

468
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,840
but I think, I type fast, so if I want to be able to make a ton of notes, I'm going to type them out on my laptop.

469
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,880
I'm not going to try and write everything, because my handwriting is god-awful.

470
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,220
So I was kind of surprised that I was the only one that had a laptop there.

471
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,880
Something is really wrong with the mainstreaming gaming press, you guys, and I'm not afraid

472
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
to say it.

473
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
So, whatever.

474
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,880
That's it.

475
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,280
There was a ton of people there from like IGN and 1UP and stuff, I mean, they have like

476
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
stacks of like 10 people.

477
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,720
Yeah, it was the Ziff Davis, IGN, Bay Area, Dotcomer Club.

478
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,280
Gosh, and you know, I do feel bad, I'm not sure how many small press were there, but

479
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm sure that, you know, I don't know if they were in the same boat we were, but we were

480
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,840
like, you know, basically strong-armed out of the way for like, you know, the Wii game,

481
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Elibits and stuff.

482
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Yeah.

483
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,980
I mean, whatever.

484
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,560
You know, I guess we don't have three million unique visitors a month or whatever that-

485
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,280
Elibits is pretty sweet, by the way, you know.

486
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Yeah, yeah, Elibits.

487
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
What'd you think of Elibits?

488
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Elibits is pretty awesome.

489
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,880
It reminds me of Katamari a little bit because basically you start off the game with this

490
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,160
gun and you're able to, like, levitate objects with it, but as you collect Elibits, you gain

491
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,880
wattage and you gain the ability to lift larger objects, kind of like, you know, katamari.

492
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,200
And eventually if, you know, you collect enough, because each level has, you know, basically,

493
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,640
you know, a checkpoint of you need to get so many elevates and so much wattage, and

494
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,080
then you can keep continuing and doing different things, like you can, you know, for example

495
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,320
they show us popping popcorn, you can grab popcorn and throw it in the microwave once

496
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,800
you've got enough wattage to run the microwave, and then elevates pop out of the popcorn and

497
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,660
you get more of them like that, but eventually you can lift the whole house or throw stuff

498
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,880
around and they have some stealth stuff in there which was pretty cool.

499
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
You know what though?

500
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,600
As much as I appreciated this game a lot more, being able to see it a little closer and hands

501
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,000
on than I did at E3, and it was kind of cool to be next to a Wii again without having to

502
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,920
wait in a five hour line I have to admit, I don't think, like if this game came out

503
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,320
for the same price as like Zelda, Metroid, Mario, there's no way I could justify buying

504
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,600
I mean, the game looked kind of fun, but it didn't look $39.99 fun to me.

506
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
I don't know.

507
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,720
Maybe it's just because we were only seeing one aspect of the game, but seriously, I hope

508
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,820
that this game is a little bit lower of a price point.

509
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,560
I think it will be much more successful if they aim that way.

510
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,800
Well, I can tell you...

511
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,520
Oh, you have it in your little database thingy?

512
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,340
I can tell you exactly what the price is going to be on the...

513
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
All right, cool.

514
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,040
If I remember correctly, I think it was $49.99.

515
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
If I remember...

516
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
No, see, it's too much.

517
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
It's too much.

518
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Hopefully it changes.

519
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I don't know.

520
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,720
Real quick housekeeping things while Loki looks that up.

521
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,040
Is there anything else you want to say about the press event?

522
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I'm sorry.

523
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,040
You know, I like it.

524
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,240
I want to thank them first off for inviting us down there and actually...

525
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,040
Yeah, thanks guys for taking a chance and inviting some of the independent press.

526
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
We appreciate it.

527
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,560
It was really cool to check it out and stuff.

528
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,920
I love going to those things.

529
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,280
But yeah, I don't know.

530
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,080
I like gamers day better. I think gamers day was a little more. I was sad that DDR wasn't there

531
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,480
I had to go to work. I know cuz well you have the time off for Disneyland

532
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,780
Yeah, I I would have really enjoyed Disneyland. So, you know, I did

533
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,320
Very much. I just want to say some real quick housekeeping things. Um, this tonight is a mini episode

534
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,840
I should have said that at the top of the episode. There's not gonna be a part B tonight

535
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,280
And the DDR power previews will start next week and that is only on the live stream

536
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,620
You have to be listening live and you'll get to hear some brand new

537
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,480
DDR songs from the ultra mix for v-rare and universe v-rare and I can't say anything about it

538
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,160
You know, we're not supposed to talk about you know, what we're playing and all that stuff yet

539
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,560
But you know, I can't help but say something cuz I got to hear some of the tracks and everything

540
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,560
One of the songs we're playing next week

541
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,560
like

542
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,720
Take a really dark DDR song and make it even darker like the remix

543
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,680
so it's like oh it's so cool it's so cool so you'll hear it next week that's

544
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,800
all I have to say I'm sorry they haven't set a price yet for elements okay thank

545
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,440
you for the clarification all right so let's get into other gaming news from

546
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,040
around the world well there is definitely other news first one up

547
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:49,760
actually well you realize that Nintendo has been hanging out in Germany with

548
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,180
their fun little press conference right no their game conference I should say

549
00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:00,520
yep well even though they are still not giving a definite price on the Wii there

550
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:09,860
has been a slight leak from the the head of German operations saying they expect

551
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,140
a price below 250 euros which would be three hundred and twenty one dollars and

552
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,020
fifty cents basically it's still more of the same Nintendo still saying that they

553
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:30,620
expect it to be, you know, as far as 25,000 yen in Japan, which is $223 here. So, no more

554
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:34,820
than 250 in the U.S., so it's basically more of the same. Nothing specific.

555
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,020
All right. Thoughts on that, anything? Not a lot of surprises there, you know. $250 is

556
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,620
kind of the price we're all thinking anyway, so.

557
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,700
They basically, if I think, come out and said the same thing, like, you know, no less than

558
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:50,760
you know, 250, at least in the US, no less than 249 or whatever.

559
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,660
But that was not the only news that they announced, well, or I should say that came from Let's

560
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,540
Pick.

561
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,800
They did announce two new games, Mario Strikers Charged and Battalion Wars 2.

562
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Of course, Mario Strikers Charged is a follow-up to the GameCube game and looks pretty awesome.

563
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,900
Kind of a little edgy soccer game for them, I guess.

564
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,940
And then Battalion Wars 2 is just awesome, and in fact, actually they have a kind of

565
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:23,060
video footage on game trailers that I saw linked to on Kotaku and it looks pretty sweet.

566
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,740
I mean, I never really got into the first Battalion Wars, but very cool little game

567
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:34,900
and definitely shown off some pretty good graphics for the Wii, so I'm looking forward

568
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,900
to that stuff.

569
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,260
Of course, I like this, it's kind of referring to Battalion Wars 2 as B-Wii, you know, because

570
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:50,660
you know too funny but um yeah it's supposed to be pretty cool very cool um

571
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,900
there's more Nintendo news coming one thing that wasn't announced that

572
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,100
everybody thought was going to be announced in Germany was the release date

573
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:02,860
and the official price point yeah launch details promising that was gonna happen

574
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:07,620
but your bad my bad your bad hey it made sense I mean hey look we already told

575
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:15,620
you guys the Wii is coming out soon soon well soon will be answered on September

576
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:21,980
14th we're pretty sure this is the real deal because Nintendo has sent out

577
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:28,060
special invites for a celebration of video games and Nintendo of America

578
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:33,860
president our dear buddy Reggie Phil's aim will be there in person and he's

579
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,740
going to be promoting quote-unquote the upcoming lineup. Reggie? Yep. Where's our

580
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,260
invite? I know, I don't know. No, I guess we don't get three million unique

581
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,860
page views a month so we we have to stay home but I don't know how formal or

582
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,540
informal this event's going to be but seriously you know since this is going

583
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,740
to be a really big deal IGN I'd leave your 40s at home. Oh yeah I went there I

584
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:07,100
I went there. You know what, I do believe, I can't remember what, there was one blog

585
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,900
that had, it wasn't a blog or some site that had, you know, that thing about the invite

586
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,680
and they were talking about drinking Reggie's beer. So, I don't know. Whatever, you know,

587
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,680
do what you want if you make an ass of yourself. Such hypocritical, next story, whatever. Anyways,

588
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,040
I don't care anymore, we're just going to do our thing.

589
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
Who cares?

590
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,280
Anyways, I don't know if you've looked in the forums lately, but we did start a brand

591
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,600
new thread, thank you very much Rob, about stuff that we reported on the show that's

592
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,120
kind of under the radar as we like to put it.

593
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,040
This week, for example, they announced officially about the Xbox Live Unplugged Volume 1, as

594
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:53,040
we reported weeks ago, and other things of that nature and stuff, and we're going to

595
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,360
be continuing to add to that each week with new stuff and this week I want to point out

596
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,720
this is not an ego thing.

597
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,040
We are very humble people.

598
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
We love the fact that we are independent.

599
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,840
We have such great listeners and folks that listen to us.

600
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,320
We just are keeping this list for ourselves.

601
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,400
When people call us liars and we are full of shit over here, I just want it on the record

602
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,480
somewhere.

603
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
So that is what we are doing, so join in the fun.

604
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
Go to the thread.

605
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,400
And personally, my personal thing here is I don't like reporting something and then

606
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,080
having another press outlet report the same thing and then it spreads like wildfire and

607
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,600
everyone takes it as gospel as they were the first ones to have the story.

608
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
That's never happened to us ever.

609
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
It's kind of an ego boosting thing.

610
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
It's never happened.

611
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,440
And anyhoo, anyhoo, okay, so that never happened when OneUp picked the Konami release date

612
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
story out.

613
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
I don't care tonight.

614
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
I just don't care tonight.

615
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Whatever.

616
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Anyways.

617
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
We're independent.

618
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I don't care tonight.

619
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I seriously don't.

620
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,720
a couple things. First off, you remember there's the news of Bullet Witch being put out in

621
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,760
the United States by Atari. We've got a date for you. February 21st is when you can expect

622
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,120
that game, assuming there's no date changes. And then of course a new Wii launch title,

623
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,000
or in the launch window I guess as you would put it. Shrek Smash and Crash for the Wii,

624
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,480
it's going to be a Mario Kart style game featuring Shrek characters. Whoopty shit. Whoopty shit

625
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:25,360
Yes, but it is coming out on the Wii December 15th for $39.99 so look forward to that.

626
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,600
But you know, you're here first.

627
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,720
Any other US release dates that we should be aware of coming up?

628
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Of course.

629
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,400
This week's is actually going to be pretty awesome.

630
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,400
Lots of 360 stuff.

631
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,560
Bomberman Act Zero is going to be coming out.

632
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,560
You've also got Enchanted Arms coming out on the 360.

633
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Ooh, that's this week?

634
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Yes, that's this week.

635
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
Ooh, I'm going to get that.

636
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,640
Enchanted Arms got it said Enchanted Arms is good if you like RPG cliches

637
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,440
because the game is I love RPG cliches then it's for you great and then my

638
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,440
personal favorite which I already got some special of course Saints Row

641
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:20,520
other things. Yeah, Loki, you're gay. You're not gay. But we won't hold that against you.

642
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,140
And this is another one for you, Rob. Star Fox Command comes out this coming week, which

643
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:30,520
is going to be pretty awesome. No? Can I be honest? I kind of stopped caring about Star

644
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,920
Fox a long time ago. Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox. Dude, yeah, exactly right.

645
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,600
Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox. Hell no. Star Fox, did you play that abortion

646
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,960
of a GameCube Star Fox game?

647
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,840
Yeah, listen. Thank you. Star Fox 64. Can you see my enthusiasm?

648
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,120
We used to play Star Fox 64 during lunches

649
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,360
in high school. Multiplayer four-player death matches.

650
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,400
That was the shit. I'll check it out but I'm not gonna spend... I want a demo.

651
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,840
It's all about the Wi-Fi multiplayer death matches.

652
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,080
Of course then again, you know Wi-Fi. You know what, Loki, why don't you buy it

653
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,880
and then you can let me play it and then I'll let you borrow enchanted arms or something

654
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,800
and you can have fun with your RPG cliches.

655
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Okay, fine. Alright, anyways.

656
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
Well hey, there's other places in the world.

657
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
To quote Eddie Izzard, are you aware there's other countries?

658
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
Hold on, I still got some more. I'm almost done. Sorry.

659
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Xenosaga 3 is also coming out on PlayStation 2.

660
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,800
Disgaea 2 is coming out this week, which is going to be pretty cool.

661
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,800
One Piece, Grand Adventure, if you like anime fighting games, pretty cool.

662
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:43,800
And if you're not into that kind of stuff, on the PSP there's going to be Def Jam Fight for New York, Take Over or Take Down. I can't remember which it was.

663
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
Will be all coming out.

664
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Let's look for those.

665
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Thank you.

666
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
They needed to do a game called Thingy.

667
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
You could author the game, I don't know.

668
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,800
I'll make a game. Someone should hire me to design a game.

669
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
It'll be awesome. It'll be called Jamie's Awesome Game.

670
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,680
Anyway, speaking of awesome, we have the release dates, uh, over in the UK, uh, I know I already

671
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,720
went over them the week before, but, uh, I'll actually, um, today, which I, I touched on

672
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,640
some last week too, so it's, which I guess would be yesterday now in the UK, oh yeah,

673
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,080
we're pre-taping this week, so it's actually Friday night, Friday night, sorry, the Reservoir

674
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,560
Dogs, Madden 2007, which was a big whoopty shit in my book, yeah, um, Dan had to be there

675
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,380

676
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,660
dug digging strike also now coming out on the first which is ironically my

677
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:47,820
wedding anniversary Oh age of pirates Caribbean tails and d1 street ball

678
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:56,840
birth of America damn snort at the end there I'm nothing is it funny because I

679
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:03,460
that game's coming out of the UK. So it's kind of funny, it's like, you know, hey, Revolutionary

680
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:09,720

Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover on PSP, Dungeon Siege 2, Broken

682
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:29,400
me snoozing the game, gatora man lives, woo, saints row, starfox command, test drive unlimited,

683
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,960
gangs of london, and on the 6th the scramble, but I feel very sorry for everybody over there

684
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,340
because they don't get dead rising until the 8th and that makes me cry because dead rising

685
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,280
is awesome, at least they are getting it pretty soon, but they are getting ultimate ghosts

686
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,280
Goblins on the 8th as well. At least they're not getting it 28 days later.

687
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,800
You're so funny!

688
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,880
Where's a gun? Alright, maybe we can whack him over the head with a Guitar Hero

689
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,720
controller. Those things are pretty heavy.

690
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,320
You may have remembered earlier in Orange Lounge Radio History we

691
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,640
talked to you guys about GHOUL and everybody was wondering what the hell

692
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:10,120
does GHOUL mean? Well guess what? We know now it's the Guitar Hero

693
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,040
Organized Underground League. You remember how Red Octane like

694
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,640
They kind of started before they were making Guitar Hero.

695
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,040
They were like a DDR pad maker company, right?

696
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,720
And they used to sponsor local tournaments.

697
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,840
Well, they kind of took that, like local DDR tournaments,

698
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,200
right, they kind of took that idea

699
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,580
and applied it to Guitar Hero.

700
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,640
This is a set of sponsored tournaments

701
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,680
where you will do the organizing and promoting

702
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,520
and then Red Octane gives you banners and prizes.

703
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,400
So it's like the Guitar Hero tournament in a box.

704
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,760
Kind of, or it's like the,

705
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,080
it makes me think of the Xbox Live Pizza Party thing as well.

706
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,920
Exactly.

707
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,200
So that's kind of neat.

708
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,160
Now Red Octane, by the way, is only going to do a limited amount of sponsorships, so

709
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,080
look into that if you are curious and want some sponsorship there for your tournament.

710
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,080
Awesome.

711
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,360
And I think it's on their MySpace, which I assume is MySpace.com slash guitar hero,

712
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
I think.

713
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,360
Probably.

714
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,320
Otherwise you can probably do MySpace.com slash Red Octane.

715
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,880
I think they don't have an official Red Octane one.

716
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Ah, whatever.

717
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,560
Anyways, speaking of really cool stuff, PAX is going on right now, and one of the big

718
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,180
announcements at PAX was the Penny Arcade game and it looks pretty awesome

719
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,700
just they have a little teaser image that came out for it and the name of the

720
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:27,300
game is actually it's quite interesting because it looks like it's gonna be

721
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,540
episodic content and stuff and anyways the name is Penny Arcade Adventures on

722
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,780
the rain slick precipice of darkness and it will be a comic adventure games

723
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:47,460
coming out on the PC, Mac OS X, and Linux and by the teaser image it shows giant glowing

724
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:52,820
looks like eyes in the sky and says I'm coming and if anyone follows the strip very closely

725
00:44:52,820 --> 00:45:00,500
you'll remember a certain parody of a certain console preview video, the Wii, which had

726
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:05,580
fruit fucker on there as the saying I'm coming in 2006

727
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,220
and well fucking fruit fucker in a game

728
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,840
penny arcade oh I gotta get this I am looking for this game

729
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,860
like crazy why don't we go to penny arcade expo seriously

730
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,140
I might you know what I at my respect for penny arcade goes like higher and

731
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,420
higher like every time we do some time I really want to be honest I do wanna go

732
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,180
next year

733
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,860
and I do have a lot of respect for him they also announced was a ten thousand

734
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,220
dollar scholarship for

735
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:37,520
You know, students that are looking to go into a video game field in school and stuff.

736
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,260
So that's pretty, I mean, that's kind of given back to the community.

737
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,140
I like that a lot.

738
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,340
And they've definitely kind of got a really good vibe going on with everything.

739
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,940
It's kind of like a fun E3 where actually people are, I don't know, it's just the right

740
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,300
kind of attitude to have in the industry.

741
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,860
All right.

742
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,860
Very cool.

743
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:05,460
speaking of cool actually now I don't know if this is cool cool or sort of huh

744
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:14,140
because it's just more Xbox 360 drama in my opinion you know they have their

745
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,620
premium pricing for a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade well they're also

746
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,740
giving luminous the same treatment where to play to play this 1200

747
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:32,240
marketplace points, which is about $14.99, however, is that once you reach a certain

748
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,840
number of points in mission or versus CPU modes of the game, you will be actually asked

749
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,620
to pay another 700 points.

750
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:45,720
I hope that is a gross misinterpretation somehow of what is really intended, because it would

751
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,960
not be a surprise if they're charging additional points for new themes and skins, but to prevent

752
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,460
you from going further in the game and points, having to spend more money, what is that?

753
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:59,860
like a demo I'm paying for I'm hoping there's just like a gross

754
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,300
misinterpretation of what they're charging for and even then you know if

755
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,260
they're charging for extra levels and skins and things well it's not a big

756
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,660
surprise what it might be is that the game you know has downloadable song packs

757
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,660
or whatever in that case and that the single-player game goes you know so far

758
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,500
say you start off with like 20 songs or something when you download the game and

759
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,540
then later on when you buy that sound pack it will go to level 20 and then

760
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,660
continue on like say with the five other songs that are in your song pack that

761
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:32,700
would make more sense but I don't see how you would I mean I would think it's

762
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,580
just like the one rumor that came out and I hope that's not true where you'd

763
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,780
have to purchase like multiplayer for the game I mean it's kind of dumb I

764
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,260
don't know just be you know what I realize luminous is this very popular

765
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,020
in-demand thing but don't shoot yourself in the foot kids over at Xbox Live I

766
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,180
I still wouldn't put it past them. This is a good...

767
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,700
this is a prime way to make money. You know, people will pay for it. Yeah, and I will

768
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,140
probably be one of them and I will

769
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,420
punch myself in the face for doing it. Now, one thing to be pointed

770
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,620
out is that they're doing all of their pricing in terms of points instead of

771
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,660
putting the dollar point.

772
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,900
They're putting the actual Xbox Live points to sort of...

773
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,260
I honestly

774
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,260
think that it's a way, and I agree with

775
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,780
With this article because I got the information from wire.com

776
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,140
I

777
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,500
Do think that actually it's a way to subvert

778
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,760
The overall price value of the game by giving it in terms of something abstract like points

779
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,980
We do have a handful of people in our chat room right now that are listening live to us taping a little early on Friday

780
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,480
Night and drew Nami's in there and makes kind of a good point. Yeah, I'd like to purchase world 2-1

781
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,660
episodic content to the extreme

782
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,620
Interesting comparison, like a Mario Brothers style game.

783
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,840
There's going to be a point where people are just not going to pay for it anymore and

784
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,340
you know that's I think I kind of got to that point you know with

785
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,580
Elder Scrolls IV like I'm not going to go buy

786
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,220
all the content and everything so I don't know.

787
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,460
Well if you like downloading stuff on live

788
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,660
Microsoft has a lot of plans coming for live

789
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:15,640
and live anywhere. In fact, at Let's Big, they were talking about some of the stats

790
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,260
including the attach rate, which right now is about 60%, which is a lot better than the

791
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:28,600
10% that they had on the original Xbox. They said that more than 1 billion Microsoft points

792
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:35,340
have been activated, which in the current exchange rate comes to $12.5 million in revenue,

793
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:41,420
they said that the average Xbox Live user has downloaded about 25 pieces of content

794
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,300
with about 45 million overall downloads. They were also pointing out that some of the first

795
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,360
games to use the Xbox Live anywhere are actually going to be some of the Vista games including

796
00:49:52,360 --> 00:50:02,940
Shadowrun and Halo 2. So that's very cool. They didn't really specify on how it's going

797
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:09,700
use live anywhere but um should be very interesting and um i can't wait for uh the live vision

798
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,300
camera which they mentioned of course is coming out why what are you gonna do with your live

799
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:21,300
camera what am i not gonna do with my life camera all right uh la la la la la uh yeah

800
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:26,500
anyway um one thing i have been dying for and i know you uh america and the rest of

801
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:31,940
the world that listen to this program i'm dying for is a pink nintendo ds light i am

802
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,960
so excited this is being released a pink Nintendo DS light and a black one too

803
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,380
are being released on September 13th in the US it's my understanding I

804
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,440
believe I read somewhere the UK is getting the pink one as well so they are

805
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,560
getting the pink one our buddies over there will get that as well but we get a

806
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,160
black one well they already have the black one over there so yes exactly so

807
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,900
now we're gonna match up finally we'll have all the colors and this is one of

808
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,160
those instances where I'm very glad I did not splurge and get the white DS

809
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,700
Because I would much prefer a black one or maybe a pink one depending on how I'm feeling on September 13th

810
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:10,580
Well, that was not the only systems that were getting some pink makeovers including in the UK

811
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:17,860
They are getting a PlayStation 2 the slim model. That's also gonna be in pink including they're gonna have some bundles

812
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,300
They're gonna be discounted including two pink

813
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,280
controllers

814
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,280
and a pink memory card and

815
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,840
And, you know, SingStarPop is going to be bundled in there as well.

816
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:36,360
For the most flamboyant PlayStation 2 bundle that's out there, it should be noted, as we

817
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:42,160
mentioned last week, that the US is getting a different colored PlayStation 2 slim model,

818
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,960
a silver one actually, which I believe has been available in the UK already.

819
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,200
They're also getting a pink PSP as well.

820
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,520
Goody goody.

821
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,960
So they think that that's going to appeal to women gamers because you know the only

822
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,720
thing stopping women gamers out there from actually purchasing consoles was the color.

823
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,800
Dark Sakura please explain the expression on your face because this is radio.

824
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,120
That's the most retarded thing I think I've ever heard.

825
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:12,080
Alright well speaking of colorful we certainly get emails every week and hopefully they've

826
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,080
kept the language to a minimum in the emails.

827
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,120
I don't know Dark Sakura did you have to suit up the asbestos this week for the email bag?

828
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,480
You know it wasn't bad enough for the asbestos, I just went in with a gas mask and some hand

829
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
sanitizer.

830
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,720
Alright, well you can email us with your colorful thoughts at mailbag at orangeslawnsradio.com

831
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,400
and DarkSakura will dip in there and pull out some emails like she's going to do right

832
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:38,320
now.

833
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:43,200
Well given the sort of short week for right now, and by the way, thank you for taking

834
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,440
care of mail for me while I was at Disneyland.

835
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
No problem.

836
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
It was fun.

837
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,380
actually let miklotov read oh fun oh we tried to give him the illusion of that

838
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,420
he was an actual full-fledged co-host for a night it was fun why don't we

839
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,980
downgrade him to dwarf host I don't know because he might he might bite you in

840
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,560
an ankle no Pluto was downgraded so now so miklotov made a sci-fi joke I get it

841
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,300
so miklotov is our dwarf host okay that's cool we could call him zena we

842
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,980
can call him mini dark soccer okay I'll get into that during the f-use okay I

843
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,620
wanted a planet named Xena. That's fine, that's fine. Anyway, um, first one is from

844
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:25,780
Grin without a Cat, who I think is uber cool. Um, hey, I like that name because it

845
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,980
makes me think of Alice in Wonderland. That's all. Don't get me started on the

846
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,620
whole Alice Mad Hatter thing. Okay, um, hey Orange Challenge crew, you probably

847
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:38,360
already heard of this one but I've just discovered Rhythm Tim Goku on the GBA

848
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,500
for Nintendo. In fact, it's the same people who did WarioWare and it shows.

849
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,980
If you haven't heard of it, there's some videos. It's actually on Nintendo.co.jp

850
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,980
It looks great fun to me and I'm thinking of importing it but wanted to check on what

851
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,380
you guys thought about the game and the possibility of it getting an English language release

852
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,380
before I did since you were the expert on music games.

853
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,760
Well I haven't heard of it getting an English release at all, I don't think it's coming

854
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,660
out here, but I bet you it will if another certain Japanese import game does very well

855
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,380
over here.

856
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,680
Yeah, I think that if Oh Endon or Elite Beat Agents, I should say, does well over here, then...

857
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:24,580
I think it's going to open the floodgates for music games on the handheld, so I think, you know, support Elite Beat Agents and I'll bet you anything, you're going to see a ton.

858
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,280
Hopefully not cheap knockoff clones, but some good stuff.

859
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,980
One music title that's kind of often overlooked is Electroplankton, because it was kind of a harder one to get. You had to get it on Nintendo Store and everything.

860
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,180
Electroplankton was cool, though, from the demo.

861
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:40,580
right it's not a rhythm game per se it's a music creation game

862
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,860
but I think a lot of people that are into music and rhythm games are into it

863
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,500
because

864
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,580
of the fact that it feels like you're making music at least that's why like I

865
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,260
love beatmania and you know

866
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,140
2DX and all that stuff is I feel like I'm actually making music so definitely

867
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,540
check out electroplankton I think you'll get a kick out of it. There's a little bit more to this email

868
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,940
Oh sorry. Rob. Hey Rob.

869
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,800
Just read the damn email. Hi. I missed you but my aim's improving

870
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:11,100
This would probably make a boring question for the show as I expect many of the listeners

871
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,960
to be pretty knowledgeable on the whole music genre, but I was wondering if you could help

872
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,960
me out.

873
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,580
I'm over in the UK and we don't get the choice in rhythm action genre that you guys in North

874
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,860
America get.

875
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,800
We do get quite a few of these games, Space Channel 5, Guitarman, Donkey Konga, and Guitar

876
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,120
Hero for example, but we still miss out on things such as Beatmania and Drum Master,

877
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:37,320
I guess that would be taiko. Thankfully both the DS and PSP are region-free, so I've been

878
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:43,160
able to import great games such as Daigasou Bandbrothers, Osutatakai Oendan, and Drum

879
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,280
Master Portable. I was wondering if you could recommend any music games that are available

880
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:54,040
on either the GBA, DS, or PSP. I don't really know any Japanese, but I haven't had any problems

881
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,880
working my way around the ones already mentioned. Keep up the great work, it's appreciated,

882
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,640
grid without a cap. What a very humble email, I really appreciate

883
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,160
Very humble attitude in that email.

884
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,800
I think I just kind of recommended one there.

885
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,480
We had the electroplankton was my suggestion there.

886
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,200
Actually, you kind of name most of the big ones.

887
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,080
There's not a whole lot that we get that you guys don't get.

888
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,040
I mean, honestly, most of the ones you named, we also have.

889
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,840
Handhelds, there's not a lot of music games on handhelds.

890
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,240
The DDR games on handheld were poopy.

891
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,080
You don't want those.

892
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,940
Well, I would say the only one I can think of that he didn't

893
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,200
mention, and it's not even out over here,

894
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,840
and I don't know how well it would play on a PSP,

895
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,760
DJ Maxx.

896
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,680
Yeah, DJ Maxx has a big cult following.

897
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,960
I know there's a couple folks on our forums.

898
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:40,600
I want to say there's an OL Army that's being formed for DJ Maxx

899
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,080
or something like that.

900
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,840
That might be one you want to look into.

901
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,000
I would say that if you're, honestly, there's not

902
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,960
a good BeatMania for a handheld, except for the Wonderswan one.

903
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,520
Which actually, I mean, I don't know if you have a Wonderswan,

904
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,640
but it actually has a little scratch pad

905
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,680
that you attach to it, and all the sound effects

906
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,120
were digitized.

907
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,620
So, it's the closest you can get to having the actual handle beating it.

908
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,620
Yeah, I'm not a fan of beat-meaning on a handheld, though.

909
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,120
I don't know, but DJ Max seems to be alright. I haven't played it in depth.

910
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,620
Well, the one thing I liked about the Wonderswan version is that it played on the side, and you had enough buttons to accommodate the game.

911
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,120
That was kind of neat.

912
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,620
But, then again, the turntable didn't quite fit, because I have a Wonderswan color.

913
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Well, la-di-da.

914
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,120
Well, I'm saying, that's the problem I had with it.

915
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:27,620
I don't know if you're interested in it, too, but they also do make, sort of, like the Tiger Toy games.

916
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,500
They have Beatmania and DDR Portable.

917
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,940
There's even a Hello Kitty one.

918
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,540
And it's just like the size of a Pokemon Pikachu.

919
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,700
Cute.

920
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,900
They actually, not meaning,

921
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,700
I'm not actually saying this to actually plug a site,

922
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,500
but it is the one site I know that you can order them.

923
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,700
NCSX has them, and Toys and Joys.

924
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,900
So, if you're interested in that type of thing.

925
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,020
I'd say look through any of the importers list

926
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,900
except for BuyRight, because they suck.

927
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,540
But look through any of the importers lists.

928
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,900
Didn't BuyRight go out of business?

929
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:00,980
By right got shut down by the Better Business Bureau. All right next email. Hahaha. I was so happy

930
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,140
Okay, it's actually the last one is

931
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,580
From

932
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
Surya noji sama 91

933
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,480
From our chat. He was the phantom caller that didn't pick up for the music because it's my battery died

934
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,620
Oh, I got to miss out on a fun contest last week

935
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,020
Which by the way, we will do again because I got a really good reception

936
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,420
And by the way, we had Jamie play tonight the game from last week

937
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:29,460
If you're not even not sure we're talking about download part B of last week's show Jamie got six, so not too shabby

938
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,860
I'll write more down next time. I didn't write anything down. Yeah, she just named him off the top her head

939
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:42,660
So that was pretty good. It's pretty good as I'm hardcore. Okay, dear. Olr. I'm afraid I'm afraid for a lot of consumers

940
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,640
Afraid that they're going to be screwed over by Sony during this next-gen console war

941
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,640
I've been a loyal Sony fan over the years, maybe a little too loyal.

942
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,520
I own both an import PS2 and an American PS2, and I also happen to own a Japanese PSP which

943
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,800
I ordered at launch.

944
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,920
I'm afraid of the future of Sony with their release to the PS3 because of the possible

945
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,760
slip in sales due to the price tag.

946
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,560
I know people are going to buy the PS3, and it's obvious that they are going to sell out

947
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,080
at launch, but with their questionable market strategy releasing the PS3 under two SKUs

948
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,160
at sky-high prices, charges

949
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,920
for useless game content and the loss of sales at the UMD.

950
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:25,000
Sony may be in deep doo-doo this go-round. I would like to know what your

951
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,200
thoughts are about purchasing the PS3 and

952
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,960
also if it will be in good investment or a possible, quote, dreamcast.

953
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,000
Thanks, loyal fan. Ricky? You know what's funny is we had a very similar email last week.

954
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,320
There's been a lot of Sony

955
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,080
questioning going on lately, which isn't much of a surprise.

956
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:44,460
I'm gonna stick by something I said kind of similar last week is that you know

957
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,200
what I don't think it's something that I want to get on launch day but the end

958
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,760
and get then again the PlayStation 2 wasn't really something I needed on

959
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,560
launch day either so give it time see where it goes but for right now I don't

960
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,840
see any need to run out and buy I realize there's been a lot of hype

961
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,480
recently you know cuz the Xbox 360 had this huge launch thing and like that's

962
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,560
been like the big thing lately is launch day launch day but you don't have to buy

963
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,120
into that hype wait it's fine wait for the game you want to come out and then

964
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,480
make a decision I mean I'm waiting for Final Fantasy 13 or something else they

965
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,680
will grab my attention that same style then I will make a decision I still

966
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:22,980
stand by what I have always said since day one a system is only as good as the

967
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:28,240
games that are on it and from what I played it's crap even Sonic adventure as

968
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,640
for comparing it to the dreamcast I don't think that it's nothing is ever

969
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,600
going to be yeah because the dreamcast is kind of the other way around where

970
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:40,800
was just horribly underrated. But the system itself was so versatile. Yeah. I mean, hello

971
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:46,680
Bleemcast. You had a system that could run Playstation games. Did you notice the news

972
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,680
that was this week, um, that they were talking about? Remember Gran Turismo HD has a wor-

973
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,240
it was basically a tech demo? No, actually it's a full game. That's actually gonna be

974
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:04,720
now it is they have said it it is a port of Gran Turismo 4 all they did was

975
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:12,920
upscale the graphics and that is it so yay you can pay $59.99 for a freaking

976
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:17,000
game that is basically Gran Turismo 4 and by the way you can just get Gran

977
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,680
Turismo 4 and just put it in there and pretty much do the same thing Robway is

978
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,760
one of our loyals in chat right now and he says by the way a Best Buy HD DVD

979
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,020
outnumbers blu-ray two to run two to one so something to think about I so

980
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:36,500
remember DMN pointing out experience with comparing HD and blu-ray and HD

981
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,620
blowing away blu-ray all right oh you know what was pointed out to me and this

982
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,100
is actually this is our joke of the weekend

983
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:48,420
would me Kristen and Meg Z were hanging out our joke was that Ken kunaragi needs

984
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:53,740
oven mitts and a helmet and eats crayons because when asked what will you do if

985
01:01:53,740 --> 01:02:01,500
the blu-ray fails he said I don't understand how can it fail beta exactly

986
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,420
that's the same remember that's brave man even if the beta and that was also

987
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,700
Sony's format too even though the Betamax was technologically a superior

988
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:15,260
format it still failed against VHS hmm I could I could see Ken going you know what

989
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:19,740
if the PlayStation 3 does not sell I'll go door-to-door and punch people in the

990
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:23,820
face you know make them buy it at gunpoint or whatever all right so

991
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:28,740
quote Junami inconceivable you keep using that word I do not think it means

992
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,460
what you think we need we need some good mails that hate on Nintendo and

993
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,460
Microsoft to be fair no so send some Microsoft and Nintendo hate if you're

994
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:42,220
feeling it be obvious over the mailbag and orange hundred our listeners I hope

995
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:46,100
I'm not assuming for all of you mind you but our listeners in general I've seen

996
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:51,880
more support for Nintendo and followed by Microsoft. I honestly am seeing... Truthfully

997
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,080
I do feel the same way, but I want to hear from the other side. I actually am having

998
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:00,160
that same warm feeling in my heart for the Wii that the Dreamcast gave me. You know what?

999
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,920
I'll give you some hate news right here. The Wii is not going to have, the third party

1000
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:11,580
Wii titles will not be online at launch. And that's because Nintendo is not giving out

1001
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:18,300
the actual libraries to build online for the third-party titles until 2007 and the theory

1002
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,800
is that they're trying to perfect the online with their first-party titles and once they

1003
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,220
get that correct then they will, you know, release libraries.

1004
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:32,460
So if you're looking forward to playing some online Red Steel or online, you know, Tony

1005
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,500
Hawk or whatever, nope, not gonna happen.

1006
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,880
Please don't make the same mistake you made with the GameCube Nintendo, that's all I have

1007
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,880
to say.

1008
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,880
Please do not make the same mistake.

1009
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,960
but I don't think they are but I just kinda

1010
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,960
wish they would go online but whatever okay sir

1011
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,720
their release in 2007 so at least it's on the horizon

1012
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:53,540
will call him for DS didn't start online and it turned out okay so I'm and you

1013
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,960
know what the night I was it

1014
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,780
most the systems out there didn't start off online on the only accepted probably

1015
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,840
being the 360

1016
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,360
to say so though the dreamcast did actually come with

1017
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:07,720
a dial-up modem that's awesome

1018
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,760
We paid for the broadband that only worked on Quake 3

1019
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,560
All right, yeah, there's other people in this world who need oven mitts and a helmet

1020
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,760
If you all would like to email us send us an email to mailbag at orange launch radio comm send a dark soccer your oven mitts

1021
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:29,840
And helmets I do take worship too. All right. Well anyways, there are some interesting news coming out

1022
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,640
I remember we talked about it. I think a little bit last week about how

1023
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,200
some of the Toys R Us

1024
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Stores were actually selling the Xbox Live camera early.

1025
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:48,200
In fact, a few weeks early, because it's not supposed to come out until around the 19th and 20th of September.

1026
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,200
Well, some interesting news about that actually.

1027
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,200
One of the apparent readers of...

1028
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,200
What was it?

1029
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:02,200
Xbox360.qj.net

1030
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:09,200
read the headline on their site, and actually went down to a South Miami, Florida store

1031
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,120
and purchased one of the cameras.

1032
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:16,080
And he was speaking to the clerk there and asked them why they were selling it two weeks

1033
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,080
early.

1034
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,800
And it says, he was told by Microsoft that they're releasing a limited number for selective

1035
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,240
sales.

1036
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,840
And his assumption was, I can only assume that this was to start Buzz, in other words,

1037
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:34,720
sort of viral campaign to basically get the buzz out there about the brand new camera.

1038
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,360
For all those people that play UNO online, they go, OMG I'm starting to see people with

1039
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
cameras.

1040
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,720
Ooh, look, naked people.

1041
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,800
Well, anyways, if you are looking for some information about the camera, it is going

1042
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,400
to be coming out in two different SKUs.

1043
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,960
There's going to be a cheaper one for $39.99, which is the camera, a live headset, in case

1044
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,080
you don't have one, a free month of Live Gold and Uno, a card for the full game of Uno.

1045
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,380
And supposedly later on they're going to allow a free download for Totem Ball because not

1046
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,740
only is it playable through the camera.

1047
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:12,440
Then there's one also for $70.99, or $79.99, and that also includes the camera, the headset,

1048
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:20,560
a full year of Xbox Live Gold, and of course a free month, Uno, the full game, a to be

1049
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:27,560
announced third game for the camera and 200 Microsoft points. So, very interesting.

1050
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,960
Huh. Too bad I already bought Uno.

1051
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,960
Yeah, same.

1052
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,960
Yeah, thanks Microsoft.

1053
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,120
They should have just given us Microsoft points.

1054
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,240
Yeah, give us Microsoft points instead. Let's buy something else.

1055
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:41,600
Jerks! Well, yeah, the one thing you could have bought would be these new Xbox Live Arcade

1056
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:47,480
games that are being developed. They're tabletop European game favorites that are being ported

1057
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,160
over to Xbox Live Arcade. The Settlers of Catan is one game that's coming over to Xbox

1058
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,840
Live and forgive me if I'm horribly mispronouncing these, I've never heard of these games before

1059
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:03,680
in my life. Carcassonne is another game that's coming over and Alhambra are some games that

1060
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,880
are coming over to Xbox Live Arcade.

1061
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:06,940
Don't they bottle water?

1062
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:11,180
Maybe in this country, but over there it's a board game. So that should be interesting.

1063
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:14,320
Where's Axis and Allies? That's one of those. And Risk.

1064
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:18,320
Imagine online multiplayer risk.

1065
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:21,520
You think Uno is bad? Draw four, bitch!

1066
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,720
Or Monopoly. Monopoly would be ridiculous.

1067
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:30,640
Why can't they give us chess? Can you imagine how a hardcore

1068
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,640
risk would be online? I just took Russia, bitch!

1069
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,000
Or just like some board game collection like Connect Four

1070
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,640
or like Battleship. I suck your battleship, bitch!

1071
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,080
You have sunk my battleship!

1072
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,400
Go back to the start, bitch!

1073
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Do not-

1074
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,200
Go directly to go, bitch!

1075
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,080
Do not collect $200 or I kick your ass!

1076
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,080
For great justice.

1077
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,520
Or, as Drunami says in chat, I call the thimble, bitch!

1078
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,520
He used the thimble?

1079
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,960
You gotta fuckin' shoot, bitch!

1080
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Uh-uh!

1081
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,960
Uh-uh!

1082
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,960
It's the puppy!

1083
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,960
I use a-

1084
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,440
It's on with chutes and ladders, MF-er!

1085
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,100
mom alright anyway that by the way the reason why we do that because if you've

1086
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:19,840
ever actually like play it on Xbox live and listen to people like seriously they

1087
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,580
trash-talk and everything everything this is why we play with the thing

1088
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:27,400
turned off you need to put out like a strawberry I just feedback on everyone

1089
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:33,700
I'm like you know I don't care this I'll be the test yeah I wish you could type

1090
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:39,820
things in like eBay was fun to play with a plus plus plus would death match again

1091
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:45,400
you know what I want I really want like some multiplayer and Viva pinata I killed

1092
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,660
your pinata bitch I mean just like the cute now give me

1093
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:55,480
candy bitch the cutest like fucking game they need to just have an online death

1094
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:00,760
match for and just be hilarious loco broken death match yeah all right

1095
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:06,940
whatever keep it moving well as far as movements and this sort of makes me

1096
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:11,200
think more of bowel movements that Louisiana game law business that we've

1097
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,420
been hearing so much about hence the results of bowel movements making me

1098
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:21,220
think of actually it got stopped the unstoppable you know law got stopped

1099
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:25,580
yeah basically Jack Thompson was going around saying the law is constitutional

1100
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,300
as it addresses all the complaints raised by federal courts which have

1101
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,900
struck down other state video game laws that's what he's quoted as saying um yeah

1102
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:40,580
know you're still a dumbass Jackie poo so uh it was basically shot down by a

1103
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:45,420
federal judge said it was unconstitutional I think that that is

1104
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:49,860
fabulous there's also I remember reading on game politics they're saying that

1105
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:57,460
the video game industry filed for injunction against having it go into into

1106
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:04,100
law while or I should say practice while they're still undergoing the various

1107
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:10,580
appeals and stop wasting our tax money seriously well the the bill sponsor was

1108
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,940
saying was basically saying that he hoped testosterone would quote have the

1109
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:20,660
additional adrenaline and testosterone needed in the upcoming cockfight over

1110
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:25,540
the constitutionality of this bill anything that's going to attack our

1111
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:32,860
right to express ourselves or even you know it's still somebody's creative work

1112
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:39,980
and you're trying to censor how they are expressing their work it's still

1113
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:44,380
somebody somebody sat and thought this idea up and you are suppressing this

1114
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:49,980
idea now tell me what's constitutional about that Dark Sakura lay off the

1115
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:55,640
Smackdown hmm interesting well I thought this was kind of funny and when I read

1116
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,400
this story I know we joked about this on another show like god damn it I'm not

1117
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:05,280
buying that PlayStation 3 unless you know it cures cancer well they're gonna

1118
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,700
be helping the cure cancer at the PlayStation 3 and the way they're doing

1119
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:13,320
that is kind of been like a project that's been going on PC's right now with

1120
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:21,600
the folding at home project basically using distributing power by while your

1121
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,480
system is idle you can download a program or whatever and they'll

1122
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:31,600
basically kind of compute I believe this is looking at some of the proteins or

1123
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,760
whatever makeup I don't know it's computing something to basically help

1124
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,900
cure cancer and they're going to be supposedly expecting to get 100

1125
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:48,660
gigaflops with 10,000 ps3s churning away with this project so that's a lot of

1126
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:53,780
processing power towards a very good cause hopefully I don't actually have to

1127
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:59,020
you know run this no matter what but so is this how they justify the $600 price

1128
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:04,900
tag is that if you buy one of these then you won't get cancer I mean is that they

1129
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:08,780
actually have it is there is now the price tag sounds worth it again you can

1130
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:14,280
guarantee me that. Maybe I can get my insurance to pay for it. I'm sorry, this actually reminds

1131
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:20,720
me way too much of a book I read called, it's actually in the same series as Ring, Ring

1132
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,600
Spiral and Loop. This makes me think a lot of loop because they, the premise of that

1133
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,720
one is that they were building a society but it got infected like a virus and they're trying

1134
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:34,480
to. Basically, yeah, they're crunching the math of folding proteins that hold the secret

1135
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,200
to curing cancer. This is also like that old project study at home. One of the things I

1136
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,720
thought was really funny, it was kind of a comment in this article, it says, but mom,

1137
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:48,720
it cures cancer, if you don't buy it for me, granny will die. So I thought that was kind

1138
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:49,800
of funny.

1139
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:56,200
Well, speaking of the Playstation 3, DarkSakura mentioned earlier that the lineup E3 for the

1140
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,140
Playstation 3 left a lot of people unimpressed. Well, there's going to be a whole lot more

1141
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,720
shown at Tokyo Game Show. Sony's going to up it.

1142
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:03,960
Will they actually have systems?

1143
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,940
uh... supposedly they're gonna have more stuff and they're gonna be showing a

1144
01:13:06,940 --> 01:13:08,100
whole lot of games

1145
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,260
here's some stuff they're gonna be showing armored core four blade storm

1146
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,220
haikunen sensu

1147
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:18,900
uh... coded arms assault devil may cry four the eye of judgment fatal inertia

1148
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:20,860
formula one world championship

1149
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:22,300
genji working title

1150
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,860
gran turismo

1151
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:25,080
heavily stored

1152
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:26,500
layer working title

1153
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:30,140
mahjong takai four which probably won't come out here we ever got a mahjong game

1154
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,460
actually come out in the u.s. we've had a couple of mahjong games

1155
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,460
I've never seen one.

1156
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:35,460
Mostly for PC.

1157
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:40,900
Mina no Golf 5, another working title, Mobile Suit Gundam Target in Sight, Motor Storm,

1158
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:47,180
Railfan, Resistance, Fall of Man, Ridge Racer 7, and Warhawk are all going to make appearances

1159
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,580
at the Tokyo Game Show.

1160
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:53,820
You know Genji, or not Genji, Mina no Golf actually sounds, it's a very cute, so it means

1161
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,820
everybody's golf.

1162
01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:55,820
Isn't that just hotshots?

1163
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,820
Yeah.

1164
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,820
Over there?

1165
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,820
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1166
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:03,180
Heavenly Sword reminds me of like a female, it's almost like crossing God of War with

1167
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:07,920
Yeah, pretty much. I'm looking forward to Devil May Cry 4.

1168
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,300
I need to get my Dante on. If Devil May Cry 4 is made of

1169
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,900
awesome and win, will you maybe

1170
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,140
find some love for PlayStation 3 in your black heart? Like I said,

1171
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:21,060
a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1172
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:24,460
Yes, ma'am. They need to fix Sonic Adventure, the bastards. Yes, ma'am.

1173
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,780
Would you notice it wasn't on the list? Yeah, that's because it's crap.

1174
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:32,780
Alright. Well, look, the fact that a lot of you folks are getting

1175
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:37,140
to go to the Tokyo Game Show and we're not kind of makes us upset actually a

1176
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,580
lot of our listeners probably aren't going

1177
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,620
well we do have listeners in Japan so you know

1178
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,020
if you guys are going to the Tokyo Game Show we're a little jealous that we're

1179
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:45,940
not getting to go

1180
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:49,420
so that makes us a little bit angsty and you know what that means

1181
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:52,420
people die

1182
01:14:52,420 --> 01:15:12,420
A big F.U. goes toward the astrological community, and I understand why Pluto was downgraded.

1183
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:18,820
For anyone who doesn't know, I love my geek science so much, and I understand the logic

1184
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:23,900
behind downgrading Pluto status to a dwarf planet you know you know it was

1185
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,220
it was like a couple weeks ago that they were about to announce the 10th planet

1186
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:32,860
planet Xena which I I was like I want they nicknamed as in warrior princess

1187
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:40,800
they nicknamed the the it was a larger ice mass that they were going to it was

1188
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,860
nicknamed Xena and it's yes it's spelled the same way I was like I want planet Xena

1189
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:50,900
that's cool now I do not get planet zena will the moon be planet Gabrielle it

1190
01:15:50,900 --> 01:15:57,500
should be you know Zena and Gabrielle leave it to the astro astronomy

1191
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:01,780
community to name planets after zena warrior princess characters that would

1192
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:07,100
be awesome but but anyway there's a people who are saying oh so stupid you

1193
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:12,860
know what look for you know first of all there was another planet before that

1194
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:18,220
that existed in the 1800s that was actually downgraded to um i believe it was actually

1195
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:23,580
figured out to be a comet instead of a planet it was downgraded in the 1800s we didn't get Pluto

1196
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:28,700
until 1930 when it was just found and then they argued about it then too and then now that it's

1197
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:35,340
Pluto they're saying oh you know what we changed our minds again you know 60 years later 70 years

1198
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,780
later you know this news makes Walt Disney roll in this grave some days i feel like Pluto i wonder

1199
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:47,780
going to happen to Sailor Pluto? Is she going to shrink? Because she was really tall. Next

1200
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:52,880
FU please. I have more on this, I have more on this. Well the whole reason being is that

1201
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:58,200
one of the primary things is that the orbit of Pluto is elliptical and not circular in

1202
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:02,960
general like most of the other planets. It actually intersects with Neptune. Which even

1203
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,300
when I was a little kid was like, that's weird. So I agree with it, I understand. I just wish

1204
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:13,620
people would just, you know, freaking understand that these new criteria that they have for

1205
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:18,340
judging celestial bodies is actually sort of good and smart and should have been enacted

1206
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:20,700
a long time ago. So, yeah.

1207
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:28,700
Lowkey, I don't care what you all say, the world's flat. Anyways, um.

1208
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:29,860
As flat as your ass.

1209
01:17:29,860 --> 01:17:37,400
Thank you. I take that as a compliment. No, anyways, um, so, after you did drivers, because

1210
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,400
As I was leaving here yesterday, see, we were supposed to be doing some important work,

1211
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:46,400
um, interviewing a certain somebody, and the somebody decided to quit his company.

1212
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,400
Grrr.

1213
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:54,400
But anyways, so as I was leaving here, freaking crazy Asians in a goddamn little, like, Suzuki SUV thing,

1214
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:00,400
one of those mini-SUVs, blew through a goddamn stop sign, just WOOM, you know,

1215
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,400
and I honked my horn and they're like,

1216
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,400
What happened? I don't know.

1217
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,960
So, you know, stupid drivers, I swear to God, they're like trying to kill me out there.

1218
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,680
It's just, you know, you need to watch where you're going. I mean, as I mentioned-

1219
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,760
Are you ever gonna have a week when you have an F.U. for something other than drivers?

1220
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,640
I've had plenty of weeks where I've had things of, you know-

1221
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:19,840
I actually did have an email received that was an F.U. toward Loki's F.U.s.

1222
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,600
What the hell are those people? What is their problem?

1223
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,280
Why do they get to choose what I'm angry at? I don't understand. That doesn't make

1224
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,240
any sense, whatever.

1225
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:31,880
Alright. You know, F.U.s are the damn TV at work.

1226
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:34,680
because I took my TV to work since I don't have a place to put my old TV

1227
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:37,720
I have a sub F.U. to male drivers

1228
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,040
as in people with small penises that drive big trucks

1229
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:46,960
like the ones that tried to go past me until he with my faster Lancer got in front of them

1230
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,360
and flipped them off hardcore

1231
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,000
My F.U. of the week, I don't have a lot I'm not very anxious this week so I suppose my F.U.

1232
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,080
of the week would go to Jamie

1233
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,880
because you went to Disneyland

1234
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:58,380
I know.

1235
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,880
And he didn't take me.

1236
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,880
It was Girl Trip.

1237
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:03,880
So?

1238
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:08,880
I will petition next time that Rob gets to come on our next big gay trip.

1239
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,880
Thank you. Thank you.

1240
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,880
I want smoothies too some days, you know.

1241
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,880
Do you really?

1242
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,880
No.

1243
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:18,880
By the way, Robway in the chat room.

1244
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,880
Yeah, you did give me a smoothie today. Thank you.

1245
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
Robway in the chat room says,

1246
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,380
On the Astronomy, after declaring Pluto not a planet, they voted on Goofy, not a dog.

1247
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:30,880
I thought it was funny.

1248
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:31,380
And not funny.

1249
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:31,880
I got-

1250
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,880
I thought it was funny!

1251
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,380
I got to hug Goofy!

1252
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,880
I meant Goofy's not funny.

1253
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,380
Oh.

1254
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,380
I got to hug Goofy.

1255
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,880
Actually, no, what was funny was Goofy at Goofy's Kitchen.

1256
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,380
We went to a character breakfast, teasing Alice about having an affair with the Mad Hatter.

1257
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,880
It was funny.

1258
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,380
Have you ever played Toontown?

1259
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,880
No, I haven't.

1260
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Kind of seems like something you'd like.

1261
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,100
Anyway, I saw advertisements for that TV. I got my picture with the princesses

1262
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:57,960
back to gaming

1263
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,280
Yes back to gaming I know there's some really interesting news from SMK

1264
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:10,640
Yes, there was if people would give me a chance to freak and pull up my thing. Okay, you guys

1265
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,640
All right

1266
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:18,980
Today's fake news is host of orange knows radio dark sakura goes crazy and kills her co-host with a tray. Thank you

1267
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:25,040
No, actually she doesn't do that because she was distracted by the pretty princesses. Can we get through tonight's show in like under two hours?

1268
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,520
It's a mini show tonight, right? I wasn't sure

1269
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,820
Okay, I'm gonna put the pictures up on our forums cuz the Ariel was so pretty

1270
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,820
I was like, I wanted to follow her around

1271
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,400
Okay

1272
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:42,140
SNK I could walk to Disneyland by the time she gets to her next fucking story, you know, what?

1273
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:48,900
I'm going to take this lollipop that's shaped phallically and shove it up your ass if you

1274
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:52,380
don't get to the next story.

1275
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:56,500
Because the next story is about one of my sleeper favorite games ever, so you really

1276
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,500
need to get to it.

1277
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,940
Okay, so shut up so I can.

1278
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,940
Alright.

1279
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,940
I'm shutting up.

1280
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,660
Mr. He of Big Mouth.

1281
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:08,140
Let's talk shit about everybody today, oooh.

1282
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,180
Okay!

1283
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:17,360
So SNK is coming to Live Arcade and everybody goes YAY!

1284
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:22,020
So guess what's going to be showing up on Xbox Live Arcade since Capcom decided to give

1285
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,640
us Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.

1286
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,800
We will be getting Garo Densetsu Special aka Fatal Fury Special.

1287
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:37,040
That's badass because I can play, what was his name, Tung-Fu-Ruu on Xbox Live.

1288
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,040
That makes me all kind of happy.

1289
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,400
I was a Mai player.

1290
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:40,960
Mai is awesome.

1291
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,760
Mai is so- Mai frickin' would kick Chun-Li's ass any day.

1292
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,760
Seriously?

1293
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,260
She'd fuckin' take her out and beat her ass up and then go,

1294
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:50,260
Me bouncy!

1295
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:51,260
When she wins.

1296
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,480
No, she says me bouncy.

1297
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,160
No, she says me bouncy.

1298
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,160
That's what she says.

1299
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,160
She just bounces.

1300
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,720
Actually, now they're saying that on PS2 they had a non-playable demo of King of Fighters

1301
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:07,280
98 Ultimate Match with a playable demo of Garo Densetsu Battle Archives 2.

1302
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:12,380
also talking about Metal Slug Complete for PSP what I actually even more than

1303
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:18,300
having a Fatal Fury special I really want to see one of the old school KOF

1304
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:23,420
games because okay I'll tell you how hardcore of a KOF fangirl I am we have

1305
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:30,540
we went out and bought King of Fighters 2000 for the Neo Geo as in the cartridge

1306
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:39,980
Neo Geo. Jamie. What? Duck King. Ah! So awesome. Sorry. So what was your, what was your KOF,

1307
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:43,620
what's your major KOF team? I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters. I, I pretty much

1308
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:48,340
quit at Fale Fairy Special. Ah, sad. I played it a couple times. I'm pretty sure whatever

1309
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:55,820
team I was on. My, Leona, and then my alternating ones of either, um, Athena, or Kim Kefwan.

1310
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:59,340
I was gonna say Kim Kefwan, Kim Kefwan actually I would play more than my. I, I guess I love

1311
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:06,340
his moves. He's an awesome fighter. Or Iori with his letter pants. Typical fangirl. Typical

1312
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:13,560
fangirl. You know what? I also used the little boy with the big hat. Alright. Hmm. Well that's

1313
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:22,780
pretty cool. Anyways, I'm sorry I'm getting. Loki found sounds so enthusiastic. Hmm. Little

1314
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,780
Oh boy. Sounds like fun.

1315
01:23:24,780 --> 01:23:26,780
Listen, okay.

1316
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:28,780
I wasn't really a huge fan of Fatal Theory.

1317
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:30,780
I mean, I think I may have played it once

1318
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,780
at, like, a supermarket when they had those, you know,

1319
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,780
the Neo Geo with the four games on there.

1320
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,780
You know, when I was, you know, bored of Magical Lord

1321
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:38,780
or whatever. But, um.

1322
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,780
You mean Magician Lord? By the way.

1323
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:42,780
That's how much I played Neo Geo.

1324
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:44,780
Chatroom brought up World Heroes. That's pretty hot, too.

1325
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,780
Exactly.

1326
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,780
I played the hell out of World Heroes.

1327
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,780
World Heroes Jet.

1328
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:57,980
Special. Brain Age was bestowed with the Edge Award because I guess it's edgy. No just kidding.

1329
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:02,620
It's actually the award is for games that show their willingness to aim higher and try something

1330
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:10,300
new or original. God damn it. Okay I don't know if these people were nominated but it says Brain

1331
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:19,660
Age beat out cult hits like Guitar Hero and Oindon and Amp 3. Dragon Quest VIII, Electroplankton,

1332
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:24,580
Indigo Prophecy, and Killer7. Okay, here's my couple problems here. Ant 3, first of all,

1333
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:29,580
is a sequel to a snowboarding game. I mean, I guess cutscenes were kind of different,

1334
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:35,140
so I guess that would be something, but it's a snowboarding game, come on. And Dragon Quest,

1335
01:24:35,140 --> 01:24:41,500
you know, 8? I don't know, was that original of a game? Or whatever. Anyway, so 1, so that's

1336
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:47,660
awesome and you know the comment here made by Nintendo UK general manager

1337
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:57,380
David Yarton is only Nintendo could make arithmetic fun huh well we all know

1338
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:02,580
Konami made dancing fun and DDR supernova had its tracklist revealed

1339
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,440
earlier this week and some controversial songs showing up in the game the fan

1340
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,120
community has their panties in a bunch that fallout boy is showing up with a

1341
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:14,080
the dance dance in the game but you know some old fan favorites are coming to the

1342
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,480
game freckles

1343
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:19,760
which you guys remember from DDR Max and let's see we also have some other songs

1344
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,320
of course since you've been gone by Kelly Clarkson was already announced

1345
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:22,760
before

1346
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:26,340
I love this song if you haven't heard this song yet I'm you really should

1347
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:29,800
it's called the other side by Paul Van Dyke featuring Wayne Johnson that's a

1348
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:30,400
really good one

1349
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:34,560
Franz Ferdinand with Do You Want To, full song list is available over at

1350
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,080
orangelandtrader.com Jamie get this battle without honor or humanity

1351
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:42,820
which was made popular in Kill Bill, is going to be in DDR.

1352
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:47,860
Isn't that kind of weird? That is pretty awesome. I can imagine the steps to that. That'd be actually pretty cool.

1353
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:53,580
Yeah. UltraMix 4 also had its song list revealed. Very diverse song list, I gotta say.

1354
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:57,020
Let me get the bad news out of the way. There's a Toby Max song in it which

1355
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:57,420
can't...

1356
01:25:57,420 --> 01:26:03,060
which makes me go, huh? But otherwise the game does a lot of fan service.

1357
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:06,420
Waka Laka, which fans been demanding forever, It's Raining Men

1358
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:11,940
is in the game as well, some old fan favorites, and some really good contemporary hits as

1359
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:13,380
well showing up in the game.

1360
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:17,700
I know we had Don't Cha by the Pussycat Dolls, a remix showing up there.

1361
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:23,640
We had Free by Blue October, the liberation mix, and Juno Reactor with Masters of the

1362
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:33,860
Universe, Prodigy with No Good, Start the Dance, and Nevaraca.

1363
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:36,180
Real Life did Oblivion, it was the Nevaraca mix.

1364
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:38,940
Stray Cats with Rock This Town.

1365
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:39,940
That's cool.

1366
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:40,940
That is very cool.

1367
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:42,660
And get this, this is so cool.

1368
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:46,260
I know you can appreciate this too, Darsagra.

1369
01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,020
Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo.

1370
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:52,220
Isn't that cool?

1371
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,220
I know!

1372
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:54,420
I know!

1373
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,780
Jamie has like her mouth wide, like jaw on four.

1374
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,780
I know.

1375
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,780
What a cool.

1376
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,780
Rad.

1377
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,300
Ultramix 4 is made of awesome and win, and we'll be playing some of these tracks that

1378
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:04,660
perhaps you have not heard yet.

1379
01:27:04,660 --> 01:27:08,700
I can't tell you which ones because then I'd be telling you what's on the viewer, but pretty soon

1380
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:13,180
We're gonna be playing some of these tracks here on orange launch radio live not during the podcast though

1381
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:19,100
See orange launch radio comm for the details. That is pretty cool. Well speaking of other things that are cool

1382
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:25,340
there the cast of family guy has signed up to do voices for a game and

1383
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:31,120
2k actually said that the entire cast was signed to do a game that's based on the series

1384
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:36,320
Um, it's supposed to be out in the fall. And of course since it's Family Guy, it will be based on the series

1385
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,440
I'm still given how some of the Simpsons games have looked out

1386
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:49,740
I'm not sure but as it was described is that you'll be able to switch back and forth between three characters, which is Peter Griffin

1387
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,360
Stewie and

1388
01:27:52,360 --> 01:28:00,080
Brian really cuz I would have thought that you could have switched back and forth between the plot and really obscure pop-culture references

1389
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:06,400
That's our show. I think there's actually more characters than that because I remember seeing a screenshot with oh

1390
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:14,520
God, I'm drawing blanks now. They're fucking neighbor. Yeah, I'm like raised. Yeah, I can't remember racing after the nurses

1391
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:21,600
I think that they're going to be characters you interact with. Well, I'm not sure but yeah, it's freaking sweet

1392
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:29,200
I know it's coming out actually in October, October 18th, so that's actually pretty sweet.

1393
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,960
But you know what to be honest though, the game didn't look that good, I mean really

1394
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,680
it didn't look that good.

1395
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:38,820
But if that might not be the game for you, you may be a fan of say import games such

1396
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:44,360
like Disgaea, and I mentioned Disgaea 2 was actually coming out this coming week, however

1397
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:49,240
though if you may want something a little bit more portable, well fear not, well if

1398
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:57,500
if you live in Japan at least Disgaea is actually heading to the PSP so you can check that out.

1399
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:03,440
It's actually set to release in Japan on November 30th and they're going to be offering two

1400
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:09,360
packages one for 4,800 yen which will be the standard package and 6,800 yen for a limited

1401
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:14,920
edition version and they haven't really announced yet what's going to be coming out in the limited

1402
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:21,640
version so maybe an import since the PSP is fully region free.

1403
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:24,960
Now it's not uncommon for games to be remade for other systems.

1404
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:31,000
So one other interesting quote that has people buzzing this week regards GameCube games possibly

1405
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,520
being remade for the Wii.

1406
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,320
Quote from Miyamoto in Nintendo Dream Magazine, quote, I'm also thinking I can remake some

1407
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:41,560
of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote.

1408
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:44,800
Of course you can wander into a secondhand shop and buy a lot of these games still, so

1409
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,120
so I don't think we can release these Wii Makes

1410
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,480
at a full price.

1411
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,080
Since a lot of the development cost

1412
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:52,640
has already been accounted for,

1413
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,800
we'd be able to release these

1414
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,280
at a much more affordable price.

1415
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,840
And if others also take advantage of this

1416
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,840
and release Wii Makes, there's a high possibility

1417
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:01,960
of a lot of software from third parties as well.

1418
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,440
Can you imagine if it's like, say for example,

1419
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,720
I don't know, maybe like release Mario Kart Double Dash

1420
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,280
for the Wii, like 10 bucks or something.

1421
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,720
Hello, you have a virtual console.

1422
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,280
It wouldn't be that hard to get them out there, you know.

1423
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,080
Well, the Virtual Console would be a little tough because those games are going to be

1424
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:23,840
quite large on, you know, well granted they're on like mini-DVDs, but still, I mean, that's

1425
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,400
pretty large. But still though, if they could release something, you know, say even just

1426
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:34,280
like some of the Luigi's Mansion or something would be perfect for the Wii, maybe something

1427
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:37,760
like that for like, you know, even 1999 would be pretty cool.

1428
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,000
Dude, I actually think that game would be pretty cool with the Wii.

1429
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,080
I would think they would probably do a sequel to Luigi's Mansion

1430
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:49,240
more like first person or something. Luigi's Mansion 2 the non-sucky version.

1431
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,560
Alright, we'll see what happens with that.

1432
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,200
Speaking of things that don't suck, DarkSakura likes to surf the web

1433
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,380
up and down and back and forth every single week and find a website that she

1434
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:01,280
loves and adores that she wants to share

1435
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,880
with you, the listener. We call it DarkSakura's website of the week

1436
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:09,800
and here it is.

1437
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:15,800
Today's website of the week is otterpops.com.

1438
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,800
Dude! Alexander the Grape!

1439
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,800
I know!

1440
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:30,800
Okay, when I was in middle school in the 80s, we could go by Otter Pops on Friday after P.E.

1441
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:37,800
You realize that pretty much all Otter Pops are is like a double-strength Kool-Aid that's frozen?

1442
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:38,800
I know! It's so good!

1443
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,220
with those stupid little characters on them like Alexander the grape and I love

1444
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:48,140
them I know but this is pretty cool because it has music from the otter pop

1445
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:53,800
stars and you can meet the band and fun stuff you can actually get otter pop t

1446
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:59,020
shirts I want to go on an otter pop diet do you think I'd lose weight on another

1447
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:04,860
pop diet actually yes could Sir Isaac lime help me lose a weight keep in mind

1448
01:32:04,860 --> 01:32:09,140
I think an otter pop is what a hundred calories for you to get

1449
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:14,700
Your a basic a full two thousand calories. Keep in mind how many otter pops you have to eat ten

1450
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:17,700
That's not that's not hard for me. Well, I think actually one otter pops

1451
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,500
I think about a hundred calories. So ten otter pops would be a thousand calories

1452
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:24,900
So you'd eat 20 otter pops to get the two thousand. I'd be on a diet

1453
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:28,500
So I have to restrict myself to like 13, but you'd be getting no nutritional content

1454
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:33,440
So actually your body would would actually poop out the rest of the sugar and start eating your muscles

1455
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,680
so you'd be emaciated. Well that's a pleasant thought.

1456
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:40,160
Mmm, emaciation. Is all this explained for me on OtterPops.com?

1457
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,280
You'd look like Ally McBeal.

1458
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:48,320
That would be pretty morbid for OtterPops. At least I'd be beautiful.

1459
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,800
But I think it's cool because the site's

1460
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,280
like fully interactive and you can actually buy OtterPops online and stuff

1461
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,360
and it makes fun noises too. I want to have a flat ass like Loki. I need to go on the

1462
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,400
OtterPop diet.

1463
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:05,120
whatever I don't have a flat ass

1464
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:08,200
I know that's why I said the earth is as flat as your ass

1465
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:12,200
alright um

1466
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:16,080
but no otter pops especially the blue raspberry

1467
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:20,360
I really don't know how to do a segment and otter pops is all about pudding pops

1468
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,720
pudding pops are back pudding pops are

1469
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,040
I miss pudding pops look I really don't know how to transition from otter pops to

1470
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,400
this so I'm just gonna say it

1471
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:33,480
Final Fantasy 3 came out in Japan and

1472
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:37,720
basically it was sold out within 30 minutes of when shops open for business

1473
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,080
there

1474
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:41,960
there were lines early in the morning going around the block

1475
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:45,880
waiting for this game it's a beloved game in the series Final Fantasy 3 so

1476
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,560
why are you smiling? It sold out faster than an auto-pop melting in the summer heat

1477
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,880
That's a good connection!

1478
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,240
Loki just got promoted to head writer ladies and gentlemen

1479
01:33:57,240 --> 01:34:00,560
Yes, and now we have to give him a mannequin head and a sharpie.

1480
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,440
So there you have it. It's all that fun. Why don't people line up like that here?

1481
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,600
Well, I guess they did for Madden 2007, didn't they? Because they're stupid!

1482
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,000
And they do that for, like, episode 3.

1483
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Yeah! Which is stupid! People line up for all those movies and stuff, but

1484
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,040
they don't really have that same crate. Well, I guess there was Xbox 360. That was pretty nutty.

1485
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:24,760
Wait for Halo 3. Oh, Jesus. On September 9th, 1999,

1486
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:28,460
I was in line for a Dreamcast with nine other people. No

1487
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:33,040
They had us wrapped around the outside of the mall Wow, and then let us inside

1488
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:38,480
I will not be waiting for Halo 3 because I'm guessing Halo 3 will probably be one of those titles that we get early in

1489
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:40,480
Which case I will have it four days in advance

1490
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,360
We're like all over this old DDR bundle packets when we first got DDR

1491
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:49,520
I ordered mine online from Konami and got it like in five days

1492
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,160
hmm

1493
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,400
anywho

1494
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,760
Something that you might be lining up for well, I guess maybe I don't know

1495
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:04,740
Well blizzard is playing on doing wizard or a world of warcraft expansions every year. So which is kind of nice. I mean kind of

1496
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:08,080
typical for most MMOs out there and

1497
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,680
Man, oh definitely the final fantasy 11. So new expansions every year

1498
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:18,120
Awesome. And of course, I remember rumblings of possibly Starcraft 2 dear blizzard

1499
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:23,400
please put pandarins in the next expansion love sky thank you hugs and

1500
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,980
kisses I was I almost quit um World of Warcraft I'm about ready to but here's

1501
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:32,520
the thing and you guys need to talk me out of this okay miklotov is trying to

1502
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:36,680
get me back on Final Fantasy 11 no so why shouldn't I go back to Final Fantasy 11

1503
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:40,080
because it looks pretty it really died I kind of miss it some days he's our

1504
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:45,480
universe that's hot that is true over that is true I'm or actually actually

1505
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:49,480
Yeah, the Japanese ones coming out like, very soon, like the 31st, right?

1506
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,480
So Jamie's gonna quit World of Warcraft?

1507
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,480
Yeah, you know what? Fuck Final Fantasy XI, Fantasy Star Universe for a little while for me.

1508
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,480
And Fantasy Star Universe? No cost to you as far as online goes because it's gonna be over live.

1509
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,480
Oh, I love you Sega! Yay!

1510
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,480
Sega is still our friend.

1511
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:07,480
Oh, Sega. At least I assume it's no cost.

1512
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:13,480
I'm assuming because they have dedicated servers and stuff, I could be wrong, but I'm assuming it's no cost because it's over live and stuff.

1513
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,480
Actually, I think I'm going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

1514
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:16,480
Don't hold me to that.

1515
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Alright, alright, fine.

1516
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:20,480
I think in the interim I am going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

1517
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:25,480
But, um, yeah, I guess there is the PC version and they're not dedicated server.

1518
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,480
Thank you for the, again, because now when Megalotov tries to pressure me to go back

1519
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,480
to Final Fantasy XI, I'm just going to say, look, Phantasy Star, look, I can't, I can't.

1520
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:32,480
You'll quit too when Phantasy Star comes out.

1521
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,480
We need to go back to PS Opium.

1522
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,480
At least for a month.

1523
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:38,480
I can't wait to start the OL Army Guild on Phantasy Star Universe.

1524
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,480
That's going to be tons of fun.

1525
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,800
fun and if you want to join the O.L. Army on any variety of games it's growing and growing.

1526
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,160
It's going to be Saints Row. I'm starting a gang in Saints Row. Yeah Saints Row is going

1527
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:53,960
to be fun as well. And Saints Row is a game that I fucking own at so you know what I can't

1528
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:58,360
with them fighting. Oh you're going to throw down the challenge to Scott and actually play

1529
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,520
this time? Fuck that I'll do deathmatches by myself because I can guarantee that I will

1530
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,400
be there but I can't guarantee a team match or something. We'll see maybe if we can build

1531
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:11,920
in a while army if we can get fucking it's just it's participation but one-on-one man or even like

1532
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:17,120
in a you know throw down death match type thing i'm there because i've been i've been gearing up

1533
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:22,800
with you know grand theft auto fuck dude if grand theft auto vice city stories on the psp were online

1534
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:29,600
oh oh man i would just kick so much ass all right orange launcher trader.com if you want to uh join

1535
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,960
into fun there. Any last minute stories kids? Oh yeah, got lots of fun stuff. One thing

1536
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:43,960
that I was reading here on, it was actually xbox360.qj.net, they were talking about, there

1537
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:50,000
was this story regarding the vision camera and the third packing game that we didn't

1538
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:55,400
know what it was. Apparently, Robotron is the thought here and that comes from actually

1539
01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:03,120
Xbox 365 so I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks now here's something very interesting

1540
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:08,940
if you pre-order Ellibits one of the fun little prizes that you're gonna get is a stuffed

1541
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:17,740
Ellibit so a little plushy thing for you and yeah that was pretty much my fun oh oh I wanted

1542
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:22,180
to mention real quick actually I got a few more I forgot Crackdown that game's gonna

1543
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:27,340
be coming out actually November 1st and they've got some pretty cool stuff that they're going

1544
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:34,820
to be offering as downloadable content. One thing that they're talking about is a instant

1545
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:42,140
replay kind of program that will allow you to record your own replays, kind of like a

1546
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:46,500
replay editor and be able to upload them and show them to friends and stuff. So that's

1547
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:52,420
kind of cool and they're also talking about adding actual sections to the map as another

1548
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:58,220
kind of download because they built the game with that kind of stuff in mind. Some other

1549
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:03,500
things if you aren't getting cracked down and you happen to pick up a box of cereal,

1550
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:10,140
Kellogg's is packing some really crappy Xbox mini games that you can check out including

1551
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:19,420
Spaceship Blaster, Motorcycle Madness, Disco Mania, Robo Blast, and Mystic Castle, which I'm sure are worth every cent that you pay for them.

1552
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:25,940
And then the one I wanted to end with here, which I thought was very interesting, UiBol and his boxing matches.

1553
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:33,100
Well, he's picked out the matches now, and they basically have the whole lineup, including

1554
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:42,580
of course Richard Lotax from Something Awful, and Cool News writer Jeff Snyder, horror magazine

1555
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:50,220
Rue Morgue writer Chris Alexander, and a fifth opponent who it says, and this is from GameStop,

1556
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,380
GameSpot has reason to believe is a minor.

1557
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:57,620
So Ooey Bowl is beating up children, excellent.

1558
01:39:57,620 --> 01:40:00,340
Still a loser.

1559
01:40:00,340 --> 01:40:06,260
Now I actually have a couple of stories, it actually, as they applied to our European

1560
01:40:06,260 --> 01:40:13,160
listeners, Microsoft actually cut the Xbox 360 core unit to 199 pounds.

1561
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:21,780
So it actually is, that actually was effective as of today, I should say yesterday.

1562
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:28,800
pounds lighter. It's on a diet. So yeah they've dropped the retail price so that it

1563
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,740
would sell a little bit better I suppose. Also I believe that I read this right is

1564
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:42,160
that Eurogamer.de has launched. So for our German friends there is a

1565
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,640
there's some good info there. They actually have pictures of Silent Hill

1566
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:51,120
Origins up there as well. Unfortunately I can read German but I do not

1567
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:58,320
understand it. I know what an S-Tet is though. The little B thing, it goes...

1568
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:05,320
Alright. But I took German for three weeks and then had to change classes.

1569
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:09,120
Alright, I have one last piece of news and it's actually regarding

1570
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:12,620
Phantasy Star Universe. It's coming from the chat room. John F. is in chat

1571
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:16,320
right now and he's like a guru on Phantasy Star Universe. He's saying about

1572
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,980
the pricing. It's unknown right now about the 360. It's rumored that Sega's

1573
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:24,260
trying to work it out with Microsoft right now on the pricing there will be a

1574
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:27,700
monthly payment for the PS2 and Windows version but if you just want to play

1575
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:32,020
story mode and extra mode there's no fee there so just FYI. That was actually how

1576
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:37,220
a PSO was though on Xbox. Right. Until their billing messed up and a lot of

1577
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:38,860
people got their accounts for free.

1578
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:45,340
Very cool. I know actually you cost me 19 Julie. She didn't pay for a PSO for

1579
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,100
three years.

1580
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,100
Nice.

1581
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,100
Nice.

1582
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,260
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

1583
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:52,260
That's going to do it.

1584
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,980
Remember, no Part B this week, folks.

1585
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:55,660
It's a mini episode because we're pre-taping.

1586
01:41:55,660 --> 01:41:58,020
We will see you back here with a full episode next week, though.

1587
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,100
It should be a fun time.

1588
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,100
Power Preview will start next week.

1589
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:01,100
It's going to be fun.

1590
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,100
Loki, final thought.

1591
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,900
I've got to play lots of Saints here this weekend.

1592
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:08,020
My final thought is I need to hurry up and schedule my next Street Fighter 2 match.

1593
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:11,500
I forgot I was in that tournament until like two seconds ago when Arcade came up.

1594
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,860
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1595
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:16,780
I've been telling everybody give me money for Christmas so that I can buy a premium

1596
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:19,620
annual pass for Disneyland.

1597
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:21,140
That's what I want for Christmas from everybody.

1598
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:23,700
Alright, we'll see if she gets it.

1599
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:24,700
Till next time.

1600
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,820
And reject false icons.

1601
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:26,820
Till next time.

1602
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:29,140
