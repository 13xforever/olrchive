14144	25772	Tonight, August 6th, 2006, Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a really big PlayStation game, two big game companies post big losses, and do video games cause teen pregnancy?
32714	34355	Hey everybody, this is Loki.
35015	38496	Joining us once again, we have another week of wonderful game news.
38516	45039	This is August 6th, and well, we have a wonderful show for you guys tonight, especially when we're not giggling.
46339	49680	Joining us as always, we have the wonderful DarkSakura.
50341	51121	Of course I'm wonderful.
51841	52921	And I'm also really hot today.
53842	55182	Because the AC doesn't get in this room.
56563	59604	And normally introducing us, the wonderful Skye.
60405	60885	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
88973	94776	We tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, although tonight, thanks to all our fault starts, it's more like 6.36 right now.
94836	98078	We're finally getting into the show, but that's just all part of the live experience.
98378	103021	You can also hear us syndicated weekly on allgames.com, our affiliate station.
103041	108424	That's Mondays at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, and you get most of the same live stuff that you do here.
108823	109904	DarkSakura World of Warcraft Animal Crossing
135646	139007	I mean, really, this week has been a lot of preparation for other things.
139187	142689	Dan went to some pinball party in Concord, but I haven't heard how that went.
144370	149452	Actually, no, I did play a whole lot of Twilight Zone pinball, but Dan's been working on the machine.
150072	153193	It's been my usual stuff, however, I am looking forward to Dead Rising.
154914	155654	Did you play the demo?
156214	156755	No, I haven't.
157155	157755	I've been busy.
159107	160388	So you've just seen the trailer and stuff?
160408	162209	Yeah, I'm going to set it for download tonight.
162949	165650	Unfortunately, my work is wanting me to do another flyer for them.
166270	166770	Art for free.
167771	168791	So like overtime now?
169091	171593	No, I don't get paid for it, sadly, but it does go in my portfolio.
171713	172113	That's good.
172513	174354	You need something for it.
174634	175694	How's World of Warcraft going?
176475	177535	I'm at level 8.
179296	180616	Slowly but surely wins the race.
180776	184358	I play like an hour every so often just when I'm like, oh, I have an hour.
184578	186759	Plus, I notice you like to get on there and screw around too.
187501	188842	Yeah.
189122	191483	Like you'll be dancing out in the village and all that stuff.
191843	197646	I remember one time I logged in and my character on World of Warcraft is female because people give you stuff more when you're female.
198447	202649	And it was myself and DarkSakura and Tiara, right?
202689	203429	We were all playing.
203750	204090	Yeah.
204210	204730	It was Tiara.
204830	205631	And we were all dancing.
205991	207552	The three zombie ladies were all dancing.
207572	208152	She's listening right now.
208172	208432	Hi, Sauce.
208572	208852	Hello.
210033	210273	All right.
211285	212146	Loki, how was your gaming week?
233274	262827	it's just such a small section of the mall and I mean there's not really anything you can do I mean it's only it's 15 minutes timed as well so but it's fun I mean don't get me wrong I'm buying the game you know in a couple days but it's just you know for demo it's okay I'm not having as much fun as I did with Saints Row Saints Row it's just fun and then on top of all that I actually haven't bought Street Fighter 2 just because I don't really want to I don't know
263400	264961	It doesn't seem like something I'd like.
265441	267102	I'll wait for Pac-Man this week, I guess.
267662	271184	I don't know why the hell I'd buy Pac-Man, but Nelly will probably want to play it or something.
272004	274505	And then more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
274845	276166	We're really getting frustrated with it.
276186	280188	We need to get the new one, which is coming out early October.
280328	284930	So hoping, you know, hearing some good things on it.
284950	286971	They're going to have Jet Ski, the new one, which is awesome.
286991	288912	You can swim, so that's also good.
289352	290372	And it should be pretty cool.
291333	291553	All right.
292082	297905	Say hello as well to our very special guest, although, I don't know, the special thing is wearing off, because this is, what, like the third week in a row?
297985	298285	I don't know.
298585	303847	But say hello to... Are you changing your name to Drew Nami now, officially, or what's the deal?
303867	305128	I'm trying to do a handle change.
305188	306288	Alright, then Drew Nami it is.
306909	308590	The artist formerly known as 23rd Magus.
309030	309530	What's on your mind?
310350	310751	Not much.
310791	313672	I've been in a hotel for most of the week, so I've been playing a lot of DS games.
314312	319354	I've been replaying Phoenix Wright again, a little Animal Crossing, Wild World...
321556	322277	Actually, that's about it.
322297	324478	A little guilty pleasure of Yu-Gi-Oh!
324538	325359	Nightmare Troubadour.
326380	329122	Other than that, not much to speak of for my gaming week.
329262	329883	It's kind of sad.
330123	331944	But next week, I'll be back to World of Warcraft.
332985	333866	Alright, sounds good.
334907	335828	My gaming week, you know what?
335848	342333	Surprisingly, I haven't been playing a lot of World of Warcraft because, oh, and the WoW players are going to get pissed at me for this, but I don't care.
343454	345856	I decided to check out Guild Wars for the first time.
345876	349499	I haven't played Guild Wars in like, gosh, probably like a year and a half.
349539	351240	It's been a long, long time since I played Guild Wars.
351638	356000	But I remember that Guild Wars, one of the perks about it is that you don't pay a monthly fee for it.
356060	357321	So I can do that.
357401	359622	I can just decide to log in and play again.
359983	360923	So I decided to do that.
361163	363004	I just fired it up and played.
363104	365265	And it's interesting.
365566	369468	Lots changed because I haven't played ever since they rolled out the factions expansion.
369508	373230	And they really changed the interface and everything when factions rolled out, I guess.
373550	374811	But I created a new character.
374871	375831	I started to do it.
376992	380674	I think I'm a necromancer slash monk.
381630	382711	and having fun with it.
382991	384632	You know, the graphics in that game are really nice.
384812	389115	I love the fact that, you know, just like World of Warcraft, you can do a windowed full screen.
389155	389835	It's seamless.
389895	390376	It's easy.
390876	393818	The graphics are really nice, no matter which way you're playing it.
393838	396200	It gives you a lot of control over the video elements as well.
396680	402043	Gameplay style is very similar to that of World of Warcraft, except you're limited to how many skills you can take out on the field at a time.
402344	408828	And, of course, the biggest change is the fact that, you know, for those of you guys that do play WoW, it's almost like the entire world is like an instance.
409244	411185	You're only around other people when you're in towns.
411245	415006	And if you choose to go out with other people into the world, then you get your own copy of the world.
415046	415867	So it's kind of interesting.
416247	417767	I don't know how long I'm going to play it.
417847	419328	I don't know if I'm, you know, we'll see.
419508	421589	I guess it depends how many other people I can find that play it.
421949	425751	But the reason why I went on it is that some listeners were saying, hey, you should get it back on Guild Wars.
425771	427111	So I'm like, okay, I'll check it out.
427411	427951	So there I am.
428272	430372	So maybe we'll start a Noel Army Guild there.
430432	430713	I don't know.
430733	431053	We'll see.
431733	436595	Otherwise, I've been playing Prey a little more, just trying to make my way through that slowly but surely.
437060	439521	and Street Fighter 2 hit the arcade this week.
440141	441861	And, of course, I had to download the demo for that.
443321	444702	I actually downloaded the full game.
444722	445442	I didn't download the demo.
445462	446022	I just got the game.
446522	449383	And it's pretty good.
449443	454764	I know a lot of people have been knocking it for the lag online, but to be honest, I haven't had a lot of problem with lag.
455184	460445	I mean, I have played one or two laggy matches, but I've had way worse in Dead or Alive 4.
462157	463257	So maybe I'm just lucky.
463377	463677	I don't know.
463717	466158	Or the fact that there's so many people on Street Fighter 2 right now.
466458	467418	Maybe it's just not that bad.
468298	469499	You know, it is what it is.
469779	470399	It's Street Fighter 2.
470659	471919	There's not a lot of frills.
471979	474540	I mean, sure, there's the quarter mode, which is okay.
474920	477340	But it's not as great as you'd think.
477800	479521	And, of course, it has, you know, the achievements.
480461	485402	Granted, I know there's been problems with people that want to quit out when they don't win a match.
485482	486962	But truthfully, I haven't had that problem.
487301	489022	I haven't had anybody quit on me when I've beat them.
489202	490902	And of course, I do beat a lot of people on Xbox.
490983	492383	No, I'm kidding.
492423	493143	I'm about half and half.
493444	494524	I probably have as many wins as losses.
494544	495104	You've shown them death, Rob.
495124	495845	You've shown them death.
496365	497225	I have about half as many.
497425	498966	I have equal wins and losses.
499006	499766	I'm about 50-50.
500346	502067	And I haven't had a problem with that.
502407	505929	If somebody did do that to me, I would totally leave them the feedback that says they quit early.
506189	508730	Because 360 has that where you can leave the feedback.
509050	511611	And I just block them so I wouldn't get matched with them again.
511631	516013	You can do that feature too where you put the little frowny face next to their name and then it won't match you with them in the future.
516373	516493	So...
517059	534128	but I've had pretty good luck with my online on Street Fighter so I'm I'm very happy about that so I I think I think it's good I think for ten dollars is a decent value but at the same time if you have a Super Nintendo still hooked up and a Street Fighter cartridge I don't know if this is going to be
534870	536832	Good for you because you already have the game.
536852	537993	And here's the other thing to keep in mind.
538353	541857	Street Fighter 2 on Xbox Live has the arcade default difficulty.
542517	545140	And remember, the arcade machine was designed to suck away your quarters.
545420	548963	So a lot of people have complained, oh, the difficulty, the difficulty is so hard.
549003	549724	It's a hard game.
550117	554303	Well, it's the default arcade difficulty which was kind of hard to begin with.
554604	565500	I think a lot of people went from Super Nintendo Street Fighter 2 or Genesis Street Fighter 2 which default difficulty was much easier and then went on to this and thought, oh my gosh, I'm getting my butt kicked.
565800	570141	Well, I mean, keep in mind, and not only was it Street Fighter 2, it was Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.
570482	579525	So it was, I think, above and beyond designed to be a little tougher because that game came out after Street Fighter 2 was already a great success and lots of people were kicking each other's butts on it.
579805	586547	On the plus side, though, if you had experience with Anniversary Collection, that defaulted to arcade difficulty as well.
587045	592168	So if you have experience with the PS2 collection, then you should have no problem with the Xbox Live version.
608026	609627	If I recall was a bitch to set up.
609907	610527	Amen to that.
610767	614950	If you guys have that, then I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.
615430	617492	You know, because you're already playing Street Fighter 2 online.
617592	620794	But, you know, it's certainly a ton of people are on there right now.
621454	625016	I've only one time gotten the same person back to back.
625637	628719	I get a lot of different people and I don't have to wait long for a match at all.
629099	629699	It's really quick.
630360	630440	So.
631590	634152	All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
634212	639637	Actually, wait, quick, some housekeeping, because I actually have a Street Fighter 2 related thing in our housekeeping tonight.
640377	649285	Something I want to mention, it's going on over at allgames.com, which is our, you know, affiliate site that broadcasts us on Mondays at 5 Pacific Standard Time.
649785	658633	All Games is doing a big Street Fighter 2 tournament over there, and they've got room for quite a few people, so it's us and...
659333	664418	and I believe Bobby Blackwolf and All Games Interactive are all kind of coming together to try and get people in on this tournament.
664698	669423	So it's kind of like a Voltron tournament, so to speak, where we're all coming together to form a giant monster of a tournament.
669763	672045	So we're going to be holding this big Street Fighter 2 tournament.
672706	673586	No cost to enter.
673847	675929	It's just sign up, have fun with it.
676229	678371	And I believe there are prizes involved as well.
678691	681694	I believe they're giving away your choice of a Street Fighter 2 figure.
682354	682915	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
704912	709593	So by all means, go over to allgames.com, click on where it says tournaments, and check out Street Fighter 2.
710493	716335	And I entered the tournament myself, so possibly you will be playing against me in the first round.
716715	720456	And probably taking me out in the first round, because I'm not that good at Street Fighter 2.
720496	721696	I'm okay, but I'm not that good.
722096	722476	So we'll see.
722716	727657	I believe the way the rules work is it's three rounds, or I'm sorry, three matches.
727717	730118	It's best of three matches with three rounds apiece.
730518	734499	So if you get screwed your first game, you still have two chances.
734824	736684	So it's best two out of three matches.
737165	738745	So it gives you a fair chance.
738845	739485	So that should be fun.
741225	746126	Let me introduce our chat room as well over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
746527	747267	Click on chat.
747667	754468	JeremyTodd1, who by the way is a listener that I actually fought on Street Fighter 2 earlier this week because he happens to be on my buddy list on Xbox Live.
754948	756409	And I beat him.
757729	759970	To be fair, though, it was really close and he beat me one round.
760610	762110	So it was a good match.
762858	768664	Sky, or anyone else, when you do quick rank matches, do you ever get a timed out thing and then have to try to find another person to fight?
769044	770045	Yes, I do get that.
770866	778673	I read some tip on one of the gaming blogs, I want to say it was Kotaku, where you're supposed to be able, if you hit a button during that, then you don't get the time out.
778693	780114	It's the Xbox guide button.
780294	782576	I don't, yeah, I don't know why that would have an effect on it.
782596	785779	If it's counting down, what it's doing, the counting down from five down.
786138	792441	You just hit the Xbox Guide button once and then hit it again to basically kind of pop up your guide and then put it away.
793022	795063	And then that'll allow it to connect.
795323	795723	I don't know why.
796584	798945	But, you know, honestly, it's so fast.
799085	801566	The whole process is so fast to get in there and do a quick match.
801606	802467	It doesn't really bother me.
802807	807209	Like, I heard some people the first day were getting, like, tens and twenties of those in a row.
807550	808170	But my thing is...
808783	812385	If that's happening to me, I would create a match and wait for someone to join it.
812685	813486	Maybe that would be better.
813546	813926	I don't know.
814366	818229	And I think, to be honest, what it is is it's just that everyone was hammering it in the beginning.
818269	819770	It's going to get better as it goes along.
820210	822411	And if there is a serious problem, they will patch it.
823752	823992	All right.
824352	829275	So go represent the OL Army, you guys, over in the Street Fighter 2 tournament on allgames.com.
829295	831717	And for those of you guys that are in our chat room, I noticed Bobby Blackwolf is there.
832337	834698	And he posted a link right to the tournament page.
834818	835639	So check that out.
836972	838640	That's pretty much it for housekeeping.
838660	839745	I don't think I have a whole lot else.
840336	842957	That's on the agenda, so let's get into tonight's news!
869073	870154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
887833	905894	to basically attend this thing and it's going to be much lower key they're playing on just you know they're going to have the big press conferences like they did this year and the other years but it's not going to be the whole you know if I work at GameStop or something like that I can just get in you're not going to be able to so
907041	908923	Definitely more intimate type of thing.
909063	917469	And from the sounds of it, I know on the video side they have a thing called VSDA, which they're putting out with the EMA, and it's the same type of thing.
917549	922212	It's for the video industry, and it's also very low-key like that.
923133	934041	But it's always good, because to be honest, the E3 is just a clusterfuck of line-weighting and just a lot of behind-closed-door stuff anyway, so...
935248	936249	It could end up being good.
936269	937229	We just have to see.
937289	939591	They're also saying that they're going to be changing the date on it.
939771	942092	It's not going to be being held in May.
942172	943613	It's going to actually be in July now.
945495	948136	Response from our chat room here over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
948156	948797	Click on chat.
949197	952879	ZeroCool says, E3 Media Festival, worst effing name ever.
954160	954520	Let's see.
954560	960164	We also have PooEater says, E3 Watered Down Festival, less fun, more talk.
960624	962325	And, of course, we have somebody from the East Coast.
962345	963546	I'm assuming they're a Yuri lover.
964625	965225	Digital Life
994809	997291	It's just a bad taste in your mouth after the whole thing.
997871	1005097	I actually do have to admit I had to play up being female a little to get some of the stuff I did.
1005538	1009361	Jeremy Todd 1 says, For the people that go to E3, it sucks for them, even for OLR.
1010122	1012784	What are they going to do now then?
1012864	1015947	We do consider ourselves to be a legitimate media outlet.
1015967	1016927	We have a business license.
1016967	1017548	We're not...
1018149	1018770	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1042492	1049939	Look at the bottom of press releases and make sure you're in constant contact with these people and basically be interested in what they have to say.
1050019	1050480	And that's it.
1050660	1055425	Being in with some of the big game companies might be the secret to next year's E3.
1055545	1057587	And we might be lucky enough to have that.
1057687	1058027	I don't know.
1058067	1058868	It just kind of depends.
1059228	1062952	So I'm not going to speculate until we know a little more about what E3 really is going to be next year.
1063032	1065874	I'm not too concerned about E3 next year because it's my company.
1066295	1068036	They were in VIP retail last year.
1068416	1068997	Lucky you.
1069277	1070759	Well, they get four invites.
1070799	1073661	And from what I imagine, there wasn't that many invites.
1073701	1074942	So it was a good portion of them.
1075243	1077244	And they said that they're going to get the same thing next year.
1077325	1080187	So, well, one way or another, we'll be there.
1080267	1082109	But, you know, the Beyonce, it's...
1082984	1084465	Like I said, it's behind the scenes stuff.
1085705	1087586	Okay, so we've heard a lot about E3.
1087846	1091988	Most people I imagine listening to this show probably read a lot about this on the internet last week.
1092048	1104753	So let's change this a little bit and say, what do you think, being into E3 before, reading all this and staying on top of this this week, what do you think folks can realistically expect next year's E3?
1104793	1105593	What is it going to be like?
1105713	1110095	Next year's E3 is going to basically be press conferences with companies.
1110135	1111416	They're going to probably set up certain...
1112555	1122618	almost like workshops or something like that where you set a time and they basically preview the game and give you all the info in a block of like an hour or so.
1122918	1140984	For example, kind of like what we do with the Gamer Days and when the companies come into my company, they basically talk about the titles that are coming out, they show us a bit of it, they tell us the selling points of it, and then they'll give you either, in the case of E3, they'll probably give you some time to play with the game or, you know,
1141764	1142044	and so on.
1165759	1175147	They're not going to have maybe a lot of playable demos because companies are really... They say that interrupts their production cycle because they have to crank up this demo even though the game's not ready yet.
1175387	1178269	And so you're not going to probably see a lot of demos anymore.
1178289	1180131	It's just going to be press information.
1180611	1182052	That's why it's media festival.
1182412	1184174	Jamie, what do you think E3 is going to look like?
1184194	1187657	What are you going to see when you walk through the doors of E3 2007, which hopefully you will be?
1188197	1190939	I'm pretty much in agreement with Loki.
1190979	1193281	That's what it sounds like it's going to be developing into.
1194162	1194742	So it's kind of like...
1196336	1202519	It's a little more controlled where the publishers will have control over this certain block of time and sort of the crowd's attention or what have you.
1202599	1212943	Well, by doing that also, they bypass a lot of the overheard stuff because we've all overheard some of the executives walk around talking about certain things too.
1214444	1216985	It really controls the information given out.
1217932	1219032	That's, you know what, that's true.
1219113	1227436	I remember, yeah, the overhearing thing is interesting because I remember at E3 this year we were walking right by some Activision people and, you know, they said this in public, I don't have a problem repeating it.
1227696	1238341	The Activision people were talking about the purchase of Red Octane and they were talking about, like, wow, that was a really, I'm really glad we did that type, you know, they were saying, oh, that was a really good move and all that stuff, you know, I thought that was just kind of interesting to overhear something like that, like...
1238681	1241322	Should you be talking about that where all these people can hear you?
1241682	1243082	You know, so it's interesting.
1243242	1248943	And I think it also, for some of the higher-ups that are there, it actually protects them, I think, from some of the crowd.
1249623	1258905	Because, for example, I mean, I saw Miyamoto last year, this year, just freaking mobbed by people, by different press.
1259025	1266547	And, you know, it actually would be a more controlled way for some of the higher-ups within the companies to make appearances, I think.
1267168	1276273	That's true, because at Konami Gamers Day, there were a lot of celeb-type things, especially for the music games, and the only people mobbing them was us.
1277334	1279115	We're smart when we do it.
1279155	1279915	We don't mob them.
1280455	1282696	We didn't drool as much as normal.
1282737	1289760	And there were big media people, TV people, and stuff there, too, but I think in a more controlled environment like that, where you don't have the...
1291323	1293045	Rampant fanboyism, you know what I mean?
1293065	1295667	You kind of take the fanboys out and the people that are there for business.
1295727	1297188	It was a lot more controlled.
1297388	1298309	I was a rampant fanboy.
1298529	1310719	Well, yeah, but there's even a game journalist, you know, a game journalist is a game journalist, hopefully in part because they truly enjoy video games.
1311200	1314903	And so there's something that they're going to get giddy about whether they want to admit it or not.
1314943	1316404	It's just about, you know,
1316946	1318506	Kencha Hall in a hotel
1344624	1357409	I think it's going to look like Kensha Hall looks like or they have like all the meeting rooms in the back and then like the front or like a smaller booth and I think take out the people that used to be in Kensha Hall and plug in the bigger game companies and I think that's kind of what it's going to look like.
1357849	1371794	If it's anything like VSTA which normally is the show floor is hardly anything it's all meetings with companies and basically companies will invite you know hey we've got times you know for meetings you know let us know when you want to come by.
1372957	1376318	Sign up for a slot and come by and we'll show you what our product is.
1376538	1378198	And that's, I think, what's going to be.
1378659	1388741	I think they're really going to follow the model of VSTA, which is, like I said, it's all meetings, it's all in suites, and they're all basically just one-on-one contact with people.
1389261	1391382	And there are some stuff.
1391802	1392682	Lots of parties, though.
1392762	1394943	They do have parties, so that's good.
1395563	1396403	So there'll be that.
1396863	1401785	But it's more or less just one-on-one contact with your key retailers.
1401805	1402385	Because to be honest,
1402785	1406748	The way they see things, they're all, well, why should I even bother with the small press?
1406808	1416295	Because, you know, it's the big press that gets the most views out there anyways, and they're the ones that have the most influence over what people buy, or, you know, how they feel about our games, so what's it really matter?
1416335	1421179	That's how they kind of unfortunately view things, and you kind of have to convince them otherwise.
1421199	1422240	You're like, hey, you know what?
1422640	1429766	You know, mom and pop video stores out there may not be a big part of the rental scene, but they're still part of the rental scene, so you better pay attention to them.
1430606	1431487	Alright, well, let's hope
1431923	1434245	Let's hope that thought process carries over.
1434745	1435266	We're screwed.
1435766	1436267	We'll see, though.
1437047	1452260	Anyway, let's kind of move on here to kind of another aspect of this, and that would be, of course, with E3 going down, part of what we were talking about last week is who's going to try and rise up and take that big video game showy crown away.
1452721	1457605	And it looks like America's Video Game Expo might be throwing down the gauntlet saying, hey,
1458427	1458807	www.vgexpo.com
1488683	1489203	What do you guys think?
1517503	1522125	Do you think we're going to see more of this where other companies are trying to step up and say, hey, we want to be the new E3?
1522485	1525266	Or do you think this show might be where it's at or what?
1525546	1526827	It's an opportunity to capitalize.
1527647	1533570	And honestly, it's like, hey, our one and only competition has decided to do something stupid.
1533970	1535811	I'm sorry, decided to do something different.
1536751	1538232	And we're going to hop in their spot.
1538392	1539812	We're going to be the big name.
1539852	1542093	We're going to rise to the occasion.
1542133	1543834	I think that that's exactly what's going on with that.
1545935	1546035	Hmm.
1547298	1547478	All right.
1547498	1551539	Well, if you guys want to check that out for yourself, www.vgexpo.com.
1551779	1554820	And I won't be able to make it this year, and I don't think any of us can.
1554900	1555320	October?
1555340	1555900	Maybe next year.
1556480	1557080	End of October.
1558141	1561842	The problem is it's the exact same weekend, I think, as the New York City thing I'm doing.
1562122	1562602	But I'm not sure.
1562622	1563742	And I'm doing Wicon.
1563862	1566403	I don't think the wife would like me flying across country.
1566623	1566923	Yeah.
1566963	1568063	Philadelphia is a nice place, though.
1568183	1568623	I've been there.
1569063	1569464	Good times.
1569824	1570184	Good times.
1570744	1571004	All righty.
1571710	1579713	Well, to sort of give a little bit better news than the whole bummer E3 business, because everybody has been just buzzing on that.
1581894	1594138	It looks like Xbox Live Arcade is going to have the PlayStation 1 version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night, known in Japan as Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, the direct sequel to Dracula X for the PC Engine.
1595398	1600380	Which actually makes me incredibly happy, because then I don't have to dust off my PlayStation collection every time I want to play it.
1601104	1604407	But it will be on, they're saying, early next year.
1604847	1614355	There's also a lot of indication that it will be possibly emulated on the PSP and showing up on Wii's Virtual Console.
1615196	1616117	So that's pretty cool.
1617014	1618735	I'm going to be on Wii's Virtual Console.
1618775	1621896	I mean, that's the only weird thing about that because it was never on the Nintendo system.
1621916	1623157	Well, they're not saying they're going to do it.
1623197	1628038	It's just saying that the door is open for that possibility because it's a non-exclusive agreement.
1628279	1630339	Because I think a lot of people were saying, well, wait a minute.
1630359	1637142	What about the whole backwards compatible PS1 on the PSP Ridge Racer type thing that they were touting at Sony?
1637162	1638763	Does this mean that Konami's pulled out of that?
1639423	1640824	No, I don't think it does.
1640884	1641564	I think it just means...
1641926	1643687	Hey, they're trying to milk this for all it's worth.
1644927	1645547	Smart to me.
1645827	1655731	There's also First Quarter 2007 Frogger, Contra, Super Contra, Track and Field, Time Pilot, and Scramble and it's looking like they're the coin-op versions.
1655871	1661833	Well, Frogger... Oh yeah, I hope they're not releasing another Frogger.
1661873	1664473	It is the old school arcade Frogger.
1664894	1666634	Which I still can't play if I'm not on roller skates.
1668935	1669015	Um...
1669966	1671788	What was I going to say about Castlevania?
1671868	1679115	Oh, now I think it would be cool if they would unlock some bonus content in the Xbox Live Arcade.
1679155	1681538	Give it something that the PlayStation version never had.
1681818	1682799	Like Maria?
1683240	1683560	I don't know.
1684127	1687971	Just a thought, maybe do it, because in the Saturn version you could play as Maria, right?
1689172	1695438	Yes, but it was actually, she was supposed to be playable in the original release.
1696039	1698040	But basically what the Saturn version is, is the finished version.
1698421	1705988	Because also, there's a trick that you can do if, when you first run in through the gates in the castle, you jump back up and jump down through this...
1708250	1708730	Trapdoor.
1709311	1710711	You can knock the trapdoor down.
1710911	1715013	You can get in the trapdoor if you get there fast enough, and then it leads you to a save room.
1715153	1719956	But in Saturn version, it leads you to a whole new underground conservatory, I think.
1721636	1726459	And I was doing a lot of reading that a lot of that... In fact, actually, there's a voice sample.
1726939	1737644	If you have a viewer... Sorry, a list of something to play the audio files of PlayStation, where it has Maria saying, who would have thought that such a little girl had so much energy when she's possessed by the succubus?
1738468	1744410	An ending that was supposed to be in the game, which actually I don't think is in the Saturn one, because I've beaten it with Maria, which is actually kind of hard.
1748091	1754472	Well, that would be kind of cool if they would maybe realize that storyline's full potential in this Xbox Live Arcade release, maybe.
1755372	1761634	One thing that I really liked on the Saturn one is that Symphony of the Night is supposed to be a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood.
1762603	1773292	and it actually, I think that it would be a really neat thing is that if they can work it out to where they put like Rondo of Blood on the Wii and then have as a special offering Symphony of the Night.
1773512	1774893	That would kick ass.
1775954	1783620	I do remember that they did a script dump of the PlayStation version of Symphony of the Night and they had the fourth ending to it which was supposedly Maria's ending.
1783760	1785661	Maria being possessed by the Succubus was one.
1785681	1786162	Yeah, exactly.
1787463	1791786	My only comment is if they re-dub Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live...
1792367	1793007	They're going to kill it.
1794047	1796788	The whole cheesiness of the dub is sort of what sells it.
1797468	1813492	Well, for any of our listeners, if you want to see some of that special stuff that's tucked away, especially the sound files from Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you can go to Castlevania Dungeon and download those as well as see more stuff about the Rondo of Blood in case you
1815046	1817447	aren't lucky enough to have the TurboGrafx version.
1817907	1823468	And also for that text dump that I was talking about, you can find that on the Game Facts page for Sunday Night PlayStation version.
1824068	1829369	What do you guys think about the fact that this is really the first game that's going to be a really big game?
1829389	1829809	You know what I mean?
1830550	1834610	Not big in the sense... Well, I mean, it is probably, for me, the greatest PlayStation game they ever did.
1834930	1835351	Epic.
1835371	1835891	Classic.
1836151	1840192	I mean big in the sense of this is not just some 80s arcade game ported over.
1840472	1840952	You know what I mean?
1840972	1841772	Or this is not some
1842208	1845170	Little, Tiny, Cloning Clyde.
1845270	1853216	Not to knock those games, because they're good games, but it's not some little thing that was designed to be a little game, a flash game made big.
1853576	1858140	This is really the first CD game now downloadable.
1858160	1860081	This is the Holy Grail of Castlevania.
1860722	1866566	Well, it's one of the Holy Grails of the PlayStation era, and it's this very strange...
1867139	1868780	I mean, it's exciting, but it's kind of weird.
1868820	1873382	It's like, what kind of precedent does this set for future Xbox Live Arcade?
1873762	1874423	Yeah, what's next?
1874823	1876003	What are we going to see next?
1876284	1876624	I don't know.
1878085	1878445	Who knows?
1878925	1881326	But I know there is a lot of stuff coming out.
1881966	1882467	So definitely.
1883727	1884088	Like what?
1884768	1892652	Like, you know, well, definitely, well, one of the things, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 this week, which is one of the best-selling titles on Xbox Live Arcade.
1893512	1896194	Actually, one of the fastest games selling right now, even beating out...
1897366	1898867	Geometry Wars, Dig Dug, Paperboy, Rally-X
1916958	1920220	Rootbeer Tapper, Sonic the Hedgehog High Speed, Super Contra, Luminous Alive, Hoop World,
1936932	1938873	I don't know, Roleplaying Game or something?
1938973	1945995	By the way, Luminous Live will be that new game that on every post Major Nelson makes in his blog, now it'll be Where the Hell is Luminous?
1946015	1949277	Because it used to be Where the Hell is Street Fighter 2, now it's going to be Where the Hell is Luminous.
1949697	1950657	Yeah.
1950697	1954599	Some of the other things, though, that are going to be coming out, there's going to be a mini-golf game, which makes me happy.
1955139	1956019	That's pretty awesome.
1956239	1960561	Of course, Small Arms is going to be coming out, which is supposed to be just like...
1962840	1963540	Super Smash Bros.
1963721	1964501	So that should be pretty good.
1964821	1967422	Some ones I didn't... Track and Field.
1967842	1969162	They actually have Track and Field on here.
1969182	1970642	Totem Ball, which we actually saw at E3.
1970662	1974003	Which is kind of weird because it used the live vision camera.
1974023	1975624	It's almost like an eye toy type of thing.
1976004	1977924	Of course, Texas Hold'em coming out.
1978205	1979425	Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
1981185	1982866	So that should be pretty cool.
1983966	1985707	Yeah, so just lots of good stuff.
1987067	1990548	Definitely going to be... They're saying that they might even be able to do
1991974	1994015	I'm not excited to watch a Madonna video while I play Luminous.
2020148	2022109	You know, kind of knocking the whole video on the back.
2022169	2022989	Well, can't you turn them off?
2023370	2025171	Turn off the videos if you don't like it.
2025471	2032834	Well, as we speculated when we first talked about Luminous Live here on the show, a lot of those primo songs will probably be downloadable enhancements.
2033335	2037117	Now, before we get to the next story, tell me if you think this is a crazy idea or not.
2038437	2042800	What about an Xbox Live arcade game that could, like, enhance a 360 title?
2044713	2045754	Halo Cardfighter Chunk of a World
2066676	2067797	Chocobo World, Final Fantasy VIII
2092278	2095601	Well, wasn't that what they're planning on doing anyways with Forza?
2095621	2096281	Remember Forza 2?
2096321	2102906	You're going to be able to customize your cars on your Vista PC and use them in Forza 2.
2103306	2103746	I guess that's true.
2103766	2105187	Ooh, DJ Kibbles and Bits has a good idea.
2105527	2107649	Imagine a Halo that played like Gunstar Heroes.
2109090	2111151	No, they just need Gunstar Heroes live.
2111711	2112872	They would wreck that.
2113393	2114353	You know they'd wreck that.
2114413	2115234	It's sad but true.
2116094	2116695	They would kill that.
2116715	2116815	Well...
2121331	2122571	I do have some other good news.
2123271	2124372	Not as cool as Gunstar here.
2124432	2125192	Actually, it is pretty cool.
2125652	2126292	Okay, what's that?
2126852	2135534	Well, you know there was that little law that they passed in Minnesota that said that children can't buy or rent rated M or adult-only games?
2136134	2139134	Well, it's been struck down as unconstitutional, like we all knew it would be.
2139974	2144155	I seem to see this as a pattern amongst all these laws that keep getting passed.
2144195	2145435	They keep getting struck down.
2145796	2147556	Well, they need to realize that...
2148716	2152297	And it really needs to go, I think, to more federal court.
2152638	2157519	Because I believe that once it's passed three times in federal court, it becomes common law.
2159900	2164942	Or, to be honest, I don't remember the exact Latin term that they use in legal circles.
2165582	2170224	But I do believe that it has to pass three times in a federal court for it to become a common judgment.
2170644	2174786	Where these cases usually end up being thrown out once they try to bring in laws like this.
2175510	2177070	But they should really learn.
2177110	2181871	I mean, it's happened in so many places now where you say, oh, children can't do this.
2181951	2187052	Well, where's the constitutional precedent for you to be able to do that?
2187152	2192934	But yeah, they said that basically there was a lack of evidence showing that video game violence was harmful to children.
2193494	2199055	So it was actually overturned.
2200437	2211603	To quote also Judge Rosenbaum who overturned it said, Is it impossible to determine from the data presented whether violent video games cause violence or whether violent individuals are attracted to violent video games?
2212843	2214444	I thought that was a very good point.
2216087	2221191	Your general pacifist person isn't necessarily going to be into playing Halo.
2221671	2232880	You may have your completely docile person who loves their puzzle games, but I've known people who are calm, collected, cool, who just kick ass on Doom.
2234881	2236262	It's always the quiet ones.
2236522	2237623	It's always the quiet ones, yeah.
2237803	2242667	I think about our buddy Arcadian42, one of the quietest guys I know.
2243752	2245553	But a real butt kicker on Sega games.
2245973	2246613	Amen to that.
2247694	2253696	However, you know, there is something really sad that I've seen pointed out.
2254496	2258218	That, you know, while all of this debate is going on, you know who has to suffer for it?
2259078	2259518	Taxpayers.
2260779	2261739	It comes out of their pocket.
2262020	2262220	True.
2263360	2268822	So, how long is it going to be until, you know, the people are going to say, Hey, we're sick of paying for your idiocy.
2269683	2270363	Just don't.
2271164	2276066	Would you say it's a true statement that video games cause violence in the weak-minded?
2297239	2305143	I'm not saying that they're the cause, I'm saying it could be an influence, but the weak-minded, you know, need to be... Need to be hugged, or something.
2305604	2306724	They need special care.
2307064	2308005	Extra tender loving care.
2308025	2308986	Are you calling me weak-minded?
2310246	2312207	I see these looks going back and forth here.
2312227	2314028	I know you're talking about me.
2314769	2315969	Relax, you're looking at me.
2316690	2318591	Like, you know, it's always the quiet ones.
2319611	2320412	I'm far from quiet.
2320805	2325008	I'm saying that, like, I'll go ahead and define it this way.
2325588	2332073	I think that a violent video game can be an influence on somebody who does not have a more positive influence otherwise.
2333334	2333714	A.K.A.
2333794	2334575	parents who don't do their job.
2335675	2342740	And in your case, Loki, you talk about killing and you talk about how you're going to run everybody over on the road who can't drive.
2343140	2348364	And sure, you've done crazy things like, you know, your story about eating the lamb burger and then wiping it off on the lambs.
2348715	2349356	That whole thing.
2349636	2354380	But you don't actually act out on your murderous things.
2355080	2355881	That's why you're not.
2356341	2361306	The way I figure it, if I kill a prostitute in Grand Theft Auto, that's one less prostitute that's on the street.
2361986	2365769	I have saved society from that prostitute until she respawns again.
2365789	2367931	In the pixelated world of your PlayStation, yes.
2369633	2371294	I'm doing the greater good, okay?
2371674	2377039	We're going to give you credit for having the mental fortitude to be able to tell fiction from reality.
2378792	2380793	Otherwise, you would not be on this program, and neither would he.
2381013	2391516	But honestly, I really think that, you know, when mass media is covering things like, you know, children who play Doom who go out and blow away their school, they really need to look at what type of home life were they living.
2391536	2392976	Did they have chemical imbalances?
2393216	2394517	Did their parents abuse them?
2394977	2398178	Have they, you know, what's their major other influences be?
2398238	2398898	Do they, you know...
2399669	2409196	and I don't know if I want to go there but take the Columbine thing for instance and how Doom was pretty quick to be blamed for that and then what was it like Marilyn Manson and all that stuff.
2410336	2417901	I think you learned an awful lot about those kids' lives and it just kind of sounded like it wasn't just the game or just the music.
2417941	2421504	There was just something way off balance.
2422184	2424185	I think people like to look for an easy scapegoat.
2424205	2426347	People are looking for an easy thing to blame.
2427581	2431482	They want to be able to point fingers at everything but the true cause of the problem.
2432463	2442126	And honestly, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm being un-American or anything like that, but it is pretty much a very American thing to do, I've noticed.
2442686	2449888	We do hear some of this in a lot of other industrialized countries, but at the same time we hear most of it coming from here, I think.
2451169	2454710	That's at least where, in all of my reading, where I've seen a lot of it.
2456408	2457009	Blame Canada.
2466209	2468990	for the children being all foul-mouthed and potty-mouthed.
2469010	2470270	So let's blame Canada.
2471770	2473811	I love Canada, for the record.
2474131	2484573	I think it's a solution that would require a lot of work, but unfortunately people are not willing to put the work into changing themselves because they don't think there's anything wrong with them in particular or anything wrong with how they think.
2484953	2490554	But overall, I think there is a general problem on the issues that people focus on.
2491575	2493635	There's a general lack of accountability here
2494182	2497264	and the majority of individuals, I think, over in this country.
2498085	2500667	Gorilla says, hey, to cry like a baby and sue everyone.
2500707	2501648	That's the American way.
2501748	2502649	That coming from our chat room.
2503089	2503649	Sad but true.
2503970	2506572	Gorilla also asked the question, what would Brian Boitano do?
2507512	2510094	If he were here today, he would kick an ass or two.
2510955	2511836	Because it's the American way?
2512196	2513437	No, that's what Brian Boitano would do.
2513777	2522884	Speaking of crying like a baby, one of the people that was sponsoring the Minnesota anti-games bill had some, you know,
2523243	2526164	Some very choice words to say about the whole thing.
2526804	2531907	And she is sporting a very stupid looking haircut, I might add, by the way.
2532767	2542331	Anyways, her comment was, and I'm going to quote this in the voice I think would be best suited for her.
2542967	2544828	The whole ruling defied common sense.
2544928	2545929	I'm so disappointed.
2547109	2552192	The federal court said we don't have the right to protect our children, but we protect our children from other things.
2553153	2555114	We don't let them smoke or buy liquor.
2555934	2561197	You score points in video games for how many women you rape and how many cops you kill.
2561477	2564659	How could that not affect them psychologically?
2566380	2567420	So yeah, she's a whining bitch.
2567460	2570162	Anyways, but I don't know.
2570182	2570522	It's just...
2571656	2575777	These people don't understand why these bills keep getting overturned.
2575817	2577598	Maybe because they're not constitutional.
2578078	2583280	Maybe because there's actually no proof that any of this is true.
2584340	2589822	And yeah, it's great that you're limiting them from buying things that we know can harm them.
2590842	2596724	But things that have been proven or not proven to harm somebody, you can't really protect them from that.
2596944	2597804	So, oh well.
2600509	2601190	Magus, some thoughts?
2601230	2604152	Or Drew Nami, sorry, some thoughts?
2605313	2606914	These people just need to stop already.
2607054	2609136	I mean, yeah, we can tell the difference.
2609757	2621987	You might want to protect your kids, you know, the parents need to protect their kids because they may not know any better, but, you know, quit screwing the game buyers in general, giving us a bad name.
2625800	2639271	If you were lord and over ruler of the entire world, what would your solution be to this problem of kids play video games and then think it's okay to act that out in real life?
2640152	2642534	If you're gonna blame anyone, blame the parents.
2643174	2645016	Have the parents get sued, not the game companies.
2645845	2647525	What if the parents get sued for the damages?
2648006	2650046	It's their responsibility.
2650506	2651667	It is their responsibility.
2651747	2659009	However, the companies do have a right of responsibility in advertising, making sure that the information is fully out there.
2659689	2662370	I think that there are cases of misrepresentation.
2662410	2666511	There are cases where the parents do not choose to be properly informed.
2666971	2667531	Bullshit.
2667571	2669432	We have a rating system set up already.
2669472	2670212	But hold on, hold on.
2670272	2673913	I can't help but think about those episodes of Maury Povich where I'm seeing the...
2674873	2678376	The old moms that are on there with like the crazy ass kids, you know.
2678396	2679437	The ones really deformed?
2679777	2681018	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2681058	2683840	I'm talking about like, you know, the, I can't control my daughter.
2684100	2688124	She wants to dress like a hoe and she beats up everybody in school.
2688224	2689605	That's your fault, you stupid dick.
2689625	2690786	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
2690806	2693087	These are the people I'm beating up in Grand Theft Auto.
2693208	2693688	I don't know that.
2693728	2695549	What about those kids that are past the point of no return?
2697351	2703676	To start it this way, you do have to look in the origin of how a child...
2704560	2715775	Where I do believe that children are born with a certain genetic predisposition towards some behaviors, I do also think that a lot of behaviors are learned if you do not start from infancy.
2716559	2723702	preparing them for, you know, living a responsible adult life, then they're not going to be that way.
2723762	2735588	You have to start off with showing proper discipline, with not letting them walk all over you, first of all, because, I mean, if the kids get, honestly, and I was like this when I was a kid, if you give an inch, they'll take a mile.
2735828	2742771	I mean, but I honestly look at a lot of the more well-adjusted ones, the ones who don't need as much supervision,
2743531	2759125	and when you see the type of encouraging, responsible lifestyle that most of my friends who are more well-adjusted have grown up in, however, if there is a degree of, for lack of a better description, mental disturbance,
2760442	2763943	There are treatments available, you just have to be willing to offer it.
2764303	2768285	Here's an interesting quote in our chatroom, and let me get your guys' reaction to this, and then we need to move on.
2768365	2777087	Jonathan F. in our chatroom over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat, says, Companies should put a notice at every game startup to say that they are not responsible for the actions of its players.
2778428	2779948	What do you think of that comment?
2780268	2781189	That's a great idea.
2781329	2782189	That's a smart move.
2784053	2784374	Really?
2786017	2787499	It's an interesting idea.
2787540	2789623	I'm not saying it's a bad idea.
2790264	2791046	Should they have to?
2791286	2792068	Put the printing on the box.
2792088	2792809	Purchase of this game.
2796883	2798464	I always think about those commercials.
2798564	2803526	Like, you know, you see the commercials on TV where it's like, you know, the driving around and doing the stunts.
2803566	2804686	And what does it always say at the bottom?
2805006	2806107	Do not attempt at home.
2806127	2807888	And I'm thinking driving around a professional course.
2808048	2808628	Duh.
2808668	2809348	Well, you know what?
2809368	2810769	They have to because of lawsuits.
2810809	2815531	I mean, that's why Jackass, in front of every single show and the movie and the trailer, they have to put, you know.
2816011	2817172	Don't try this at home.
2817272	2818433	We're professionals.
2818493	2821356	If you try this, you're going to get hurt and possibly kill yourself.
2821716	2823357	We are not responsible for any injury.
2823798	2829042	Unfortunately, people in the Sue Happy world that we're in, we have to remind them of the stupid things out there.
2829262	2829642	Guess what?
2829682	2830323	Fire hot.
2831524	2832104	Ice cold.
2832845	2833746	Car dangerous.
2833806	2835567	I mean, just stupid shit like that.
2835707	2837068	I don't know.
2838590	2839971	That's how dumb America is.
2841280	2842661	Alright, one more thought, Drew Nami.
2842781	2844661	Okay, you know how we have those disclaimers?
2844701	2846442	People who've played MMOs get the disclaimers.
2846702	2849223	The whole ESRB disclaimer.
2849603	2851804	Game experience may change during online play.
2852324	2855985	They're not, you know, the company is not responsible for its player base.
2856646	2858486	The player base is responsible for the player base.
2859267	2863448	I would hope game experience changes in online play because I play as a woman in MMOs.
2864449	2865809	Like I said, more free stuff.
2866149	2867050	That's your problem, Rob.
2867750	2868290	Alright, anyway.
2868663	2869163	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2893496	2898479	When we heard about the whole, you know, video games cause teen pregnancy, I was serious when I said that.
2898859	2899199	Here it is.
2899719	2909345	There was an opinion piece that was on CantonRep.com that was addressing the high pregnancy rates in students at this particular high school, Timken High School.
2909905	2914068	And basically what it does is it places blame on all sorts of things.
2914128	2915188	And it says here, here's a quote.
2915688	2916589	Whose fault is it?
2917208	2920470	That more than 13% of Tim Kim's girls are with child.
2920930	2925452	Some would say fault finding isn't a fruitful exercise, but in this case it's critical.
2925893	2931375	Suspects range from movies, TV, and video games to lazy parents and lax discipline.
2931796	2934597	Only one thing is sure, schools don't impregnate children.
2935097	2936418	I'd like to point out, by the way...
2937523	2943470	The article said nothing about sex ed, birth control, education, or anything like that.
2943590	2948456	I actually did know somebody in Alabama who conceived her baby in the bathroom at my high school.
2949637	2950839	That's crazy shit.
2951500	2951860	Wow.
2952341	2954243	So yes, you... school...
2955278	2956119	and directly.
2956359	2971565	Okay, my thought is though, how did somebody get the notion, and I think the reason why this got picked up by some of the game blogs this week and why we're reporting on it now, how did somebody get the notion that video games cause pregnancy?
2971826	2980329	Because I don't know about you, but video games is usually an experience by yourself, unless it's Mario Party, something like that, Lamb Party.
2981310	2983891	And last time I checked, masturbation won't make you pregnant.
2984608	2989571	It's all about Rez.
2990692	2992534	I'm not even going to say what just popped into my head.
2993874	2994735	What popped into your head?
2995275	2995516	Come on.
2997417	2998738	Transcontroller Turkey Baster.
3000379	3003121	And more importantly, why was she looking at me when she said it?
3003861	3004822	I wasn't looking at you.
3007924	3008244	Oh, shit.
3008645	3009605	You're frightening me now.
3011918	3012859	It's the new hair.
3013279	3014560	She's made you a sexy beast.
3014820	3023286	I know all those chicks out there, they get totally hot and bothered when they see pixelated people having sex in games or pixelated nipples and stuff.
3023307	3023907	Yeah, your wife.
3024527	3028090	I know, she totally gets hot and bothered by all that shit.
3028110	3029811	She has to jump on the cock right there.
3029831	3031112	You know what?
3031513	3032373	Sex is overrated.
3035455	3037537	Of course I'm being sarcastic here, obviously.
3039128	3047097	I think that people just need to, you know, realize that there's stuff other than sex to be interested in and, like, stop blaming video games when people decide to be horny bitches.
3047317	3050440	Well, video games are responsible for every other of society's ills.
3050480	3051702	Why not blame them for this?
3051802	3052863	Rich Richard taught me how to drive.
3054446	3055967	Just a friendly reminder, boys and girls.
3056207	3059089	The following program is intended for mature audiences.
3059169	3061750	Okay, let me basically say something here.
3062330	3069434	If you've ever talked to any girlfriend out there that has her boyfriend who's playing video games, what's the biggest complaint?
3069514	3070575	He plays the video games!
3070595	3071615	He doesn't pay attention to me!
3072055	3078739	I would say, if anything, that video games, TV, and movies reduce the amount of sex that you have
3080129	3082191	rather than, you know, increase anything.
3082251	3091078	Because I can tell you this much, if there's a guy watching TV or football or something like that and this woman's trying to get up on him, he's like, excuse me, hun, I'm trying to watch the TV, you know, move over.
3091098	3092639	I mean, that's kind of what it is.
3092719	3094700	This is kind of what Pooeater's saying in chat.
3094740	3096382	He said this right before you said that, Loki.
3096442	3098123	Video games stop teen sex.
3098443	3100105	Hold up, baby, I gotta pwn this noob.
3100165	3100905	Stop touching me!
3102686	3109812	I remember a G4 vodcast with a fake commercial touting World of Warcraft as a birth control method.
3112262	3113142	and this is basically it.
3113162	3115563	Wait, something funny actually came from a G4 vodcast?
3115783	3116983	Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?
3117183	3117803	I know, amazing.
3118984	3119884	You know, new and exciting.
3120624	3123445	Alright, any other thoughts on the games and teen pregnancy?
3123865	3126386	Yeah, well, guess how many pregnant teens said the same thing?
3127766	3129986	Yeah, I would like to hear from a pregnant teen.
3130087	3131327	I would like to hear from anyone.
3131967	3132487	Seriously.
3132807	3134668	Did the video game cause you to get pregnant?
3134828	3135528	If so, how?
3135648	3136928	But please don't go into graphic detail.
3136988	3138809	Okay, we know how birds and bees work, okay?
3138829	3139489	You've got nine months.
3139709	3139849	Go.
3142082	3142362	All right.
3144082	3151664	You know, all these stories about the, you know, video game bills and the people saying video games cause pregnancy, it makes me a little angsty.
3151684	3153145	Does it make you angsty, DarkSakura?
3153805	3154585	I'm always angsty.
3154605	3155265	What are you talking about?
3155285	3161807	Well, then you know what it means that it's time for a particular segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio that we have to do every single week, right?
3162727	3163307	Of course we do.
3176934	3183977	My FU of the week goes toward the traffic from, uh, I'd have to say Vacaville to Davis.
3185297	3194201	I know I've been going to the Bay Area like every weekend now and coming back, but, um, it was really stupid and I thought it was maybe a car accident because, you know, people are retarded.
3194801	3200023	They like to look at the car crashy and see the pretty lights go in the air.
3200803	3204825	But this is just so many stupid people and the SUV drivers, oh my god.
3205589	3208670	Do not buy an SUV unless you live in the boonies.
3209230	3209710	The end.
3209730	3210530	Okay, thanks, bye.
3211591	3211951	Loki.
3212711	3222293	F you to the illegal immigrants that were carrying down the shed that's next to my apartment at 7.30 in the morning on Saturday because they didn't want to work late that day.
3223093	3225134	And, um, yeah, I don't know.
3225274	3229055	It's really annoying to complain to my apartment complex and they didn't really give a shit.
3229595	3231836	But, um, yeah, the shed's been sitting here.
3231976	3233196	They had it, like, framed the
3233860	3235541	F you to staying in a hotel.
3235561	3237622	A hotel is my least favorite place to stay, period.
3257260	3261002	We have these idiot people one floor down.
3261362	3267244	I so much as drop a water bottle, they make a call up to the front desk, and they threaten to check us out.
3267264	3269365	They can't throw us out, but they can check us out.
3271366	3277268	And the AC doesn't work right, although it's a welcome change from the house.
3278509	3279269	And the beds suck.
3279549	3281050	So yeah, F you to hotels.
3281770	3283711	Learn to make a comfy hotel, and maybe I'll stay there.
3285918	3289740	I'd like to give an F you to downtown San Francisco for smelling like pee.
3290080	3290540	Amen!
3293241	3293561	That's it.
3294702	3295762	I second that one, Rob.
3296962	3298803	Alright, back to the news.
3301344	3303165	Thank you for the mic there, Magus.
3304165	3304685	Anyways.
3305466	3306586	Maybe we should call him Magnami.
3307586	3314029	I'd like to really quickly clarify something in the chatroom because they're saying I said legal immigrants and that's maybe racist of me.
3315031	3321834	Okay, they had their 10-year-old son working on the job at the same time with these other people, so I don't think that's legal.
3322054	3322294	It is.
3322594	3325455	I do believe you have to be at least 15 in the state for a work permit.
3325495	3328297	Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, child labor laws and such.
3328837	3340662	Anyways, speaking of illegal things, Nintendo and Microsoft are being sued over controller patents, and they're being sued by this company called Aniscape, who apparently has patents on
3341421	3350543	Such things as remote controller with analog button, 3D controller with vibration, and game controller with analog pressure sensors, among other things.
3351804	3355405	What's funny, though, is this company, Anescape, hasn't made anything.
3355645	3360166	They just hold patents for a ton of shit, which is excellent.
3360826	3367388	And the kind of speculation around this is that this company, Anescape, is actually a company made to...
3369685	3371227	Basically, sue people.
3371787	3377733	And what's funny is, there was a comment by one of the people on Kotaku, which this story ran on.
3378957	3381559	by this guy named Baboon, and I think he sums it up pretty good.
3381579	3394288	It says, given that Nintendo 64 had an analog stick in 1996, and a patent describing it in 1999 won't be upheld in court, as to why Aniscape isn't suing Sony, this might have something to do with who owns Aniscape.
3394348	3397710	Take a quick Google search and you'll get nothing but patent applications.
3398191	3403054	It's quite likely Aniscape is nothing but a shell company created to litigate
3403755	3407818	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3431957	3434379	is just to not make any product at all.
3434779	3445926	If you don't do anything other than patent stuff, you can't be breaking anyone else's patents, and chances are you'll be able to reach a settlement that gets you mucho dinero.
3446526	3448167	Interesting comments from our chat room here.
3448427	3451890	Some folks kind of feel the same way, that probably this company is just set up to sue people.
3452710	3455732	Eddie in chat says, these companies survive on lawsuits.
3456212	3458594	VXJasonXV says, I hate patent sporgers.
3459702	3461864	and VidPal, it kind of sums up my thoughts on this.
3462264	3465606	Geez, how many more no-name companies have patents for vibrating controllers?
3465906	3467407	Didn't we kind of already go here already?
3467727	3469008	Exactly, and here's the other thing too.
3469348	3469909	Why now?
3470069	3484078	Why, you know, if you've held this patent since 1999, why when, you know, the original Nintendo 64, you know, came out or whatever, or when the PlayStation came out, why are you waiting until like five generations down the road before you start suing?
3484498	3486560	That's the kind of fishy part about it.
3486640	3486840	I mean...
3487498	3501210	It's like, you know, the whole thing, like if Konami didn't sue Roxor over DDR, if they let it go and stuff after a long time, then it almost seems like there's nothing they should be able to do about it, you know, because you've allowed it to happen.
3501250	3502671	It's kind of protecting your own asses.
3503612	3503893	Assets.
3504193	3506195	Yeah, I get it.
3507255	3508396	All right, well, interesting.
3508437	3509497	I guess we'll see what happens.
3509958	3510779	Did you have a comment on this?
3510799	3511219	I got nothing.
3511339	3511679	Oh, okay.
3513201	3513421	Well...
3514326	3522809	Speaking of Nintendo, there's actually going to be some Wii news breaking in Leipzig on August 23rd.
3523789	3530031	They have a keynote at the games convention that should last for about an hour called Wii Prove Our Promise.
3531691	3531992	Pun.
3532332	3533332	Speaking of more puns.
3533392	3535333	I'm glad even they can make fun of their own name.
3537913	3542835	There's also a plan to show five new Wii games during that event.
3544747	3548069	I wish we knew what games, but I guess that's part of the secret.
3548269	3549269	We will wait and see.
3550750	3551310	You're fired.
3551330	3553331	I am not sponsoring these jokes, I swear.
3553612	3554312	You're fired, too.
3556433	3559334	All right.
3559414	3564677	Do you think this is where we're going to finally find out, okay, here's the date it's coming out, here's the price, all that good stuff?
3565377	3567038	Yeah, because they're not at Tokyo Game Show.
3567218	3569119	They're not doing Space World this year.
3570340	3572281	It's the last big convention before the launch.
3572691	3574994	But I thought we weren't supposed to hear until September.
3575955	3577356	It's a goddamn week from September.
3577457	3578077	Close enough.
3579159	3580660	Alright, just thought I'd get that in there.
3580680	3582322	They're like, okay, we're a little early.
3582843	3583423	So sue us.
3583443	3585386	We're Nintendo, we can do what we want.
3587000	3593962	I must express, previously on the program, I had a little bit of disappointment that Mortal Kombat Armageddon was only coming out for current-gen consoles.
3594282	3602064	It's only coming out for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but actually there's been news this week that it is actually coming out for the Nintendo Wii.
3602324	3609326	No word on how it's going to take advantage of the Wii's control scheme, but this would be one more title that's going to be coming out.
3609987	3611287	There is a quote from the publisher.
3612541	3624644	Our Chicago studio, under the direction of Ed Boon, has been working extremely hard to make Armageddon stand out in a big way with the inclusion of the entire Mortal Kombat character lineup, the Motor Kombat minigame, which, by the way, is supposed to be like Mario Kart.
3624724	3625344	It looks awesome.
3625364	3626244	It's going to be great.
3626844	3629004	I just kind of wish it was next-gen, but whatever.
3629405	3635426	A new conquest mode and several other innovative gameplay additions that help keep the franchise at the top of its genre.
3636146	3640727	We're confident that Wii fans will truly appreciate the finished product when it's ready to hit store shelves.
3641243	3643144	You hear it's also being packaged with Mortal Kombat 3.
3644084	3644704	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3645024	3654426	You know what, but see, the only downside to this news, I think, for Midway, is that, at least for me, I was going to pick this up, even if it is on current gen, I was going to pick it up, but now, I'm going to wait.
3654627	3658448	I'm going to wait and get the one on the Wii, because I just have this feeling that there'll be something extra there, you know?
3658468	3660048	It's alright, they're both coming out in October anyways.
3660268	3667710	Well, maybe that one, but they're saying that Armageddon probably won't be out until early 2007, or do you think there's something...
3669362	3669702	I don't know.
3669862	3672603	The GameCube one was delayed.
3673503	3674703	Not this one, but the last one.
3675183	3675683	Deception?
3676284	3679724	Deception was delayed on GameCube.
3680104	3680484	I don't know.
3681085	3681385	Whatever.
3683945	3687206	Well, a little bit more Wii news.
3688426	3689446	Wii bits of news.
3690507	3697468	It sounds like Ubi's going to be releasing seven Wii launch titles.
3698582	3699262	So it looks.
3700263	3701384	Did they say what titles?
3701904	3704385	We do have a list.
3705626	3715591	We have Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Open Season, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Red Steel.
3716032	3716672	That's the list.
3717152	3719253	And Blazing Angels?
3720174	3721895	Well, that was also on the list too.
3721915	3723556	Yeah, that's going to be awesome.
3723596	3723856	Interesting.
3725327	3726669	These are all going to come out launch?
3727010	3729014	When they say launch, does that mean first quarter?
3729054	3730797	Does that mean the day the Wii's on the shelves?
3730877	3731779	All these games are going to hit?
3731919	3732260	They have.
3734090	3737771	Didn't I make some bet on the show that there weren't going to be more than 20 games when the system comes out?
3738051	3739452	I think that bet's been... Yes, you did.
3739472	3740272	I might be in trouble.
3740512	3741812	I think you owe some money to somebody.
3741932	3743913	No, I think it was something to do with pudding or something.
3744073	3746234	But wait, wasn't... $250.
3746874	3750575	I thought the deal was it had to be first party games.
3750595	3754076	I'm going to have to go back and find the show where I made the bet because I think it was 20 first party games.
3754376	3756056	Well, they're getting pretty close.
3756096	3757077	I know, I'm starting to worry.
3759037	3761318	I'm sure some listener's been keeping track of that.
3762296	3763016	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3792094	3793635	But it should be interesting.
3793675	3794835	I mean, I don't know.
3795095	3796436	Prince of Persia had a lot of swinging around.
3796456	3797937	How about old school Prince of Persia?
3798157	3800358	You know, where I actually swing my sword, you know?
3800898	3801158	Maybe.
3801358	3801598	I don't know.
3802019	3802639	That'd be pretty cool.
3803279	3804139	Maybe a hidden game.
3804219	3804540	Who knows?
3805760	3815124	I was going to mention real quick another title that we had coming out, which I'm sure you'll be reading about on all the major press sites later on this week, as the trend seems to be.
3815885	3820287	Anyways, I'm not sure if you're a big fan of fishing out there, but Rapala Pro...
3822230	3822570	What was it?
3822590	3826593	Trophies is going to be coming out on the Wii and on the Xbox 360.
3828154	3835359	Well, slated sort of in October, but we'll have to wait and see to see when the actual games come out.
3835880	3840323	So that is one title that you can look for so you can get your fishing on, your Wiimote fishing.
3842351	3844913	The chat room is commenting on the pudding thing.
3845754	3847415	It was not dance naked and pudding.
3847435	3848576	That would not happen on air.
3848616	3851678	I would not subject Loki and DarkSakura to that.
3851758	3853979	No, it was $250 worth of pudding.
3854359	3855220	It was not that either.
3855260	3859643	It was something about a whole six-pack of pudding rubbing it on my chest or something live on air.
3860804	3862845	I don't even know where that came from, but that was the bet.
3863226	3865327	Remind me not to be here for that show.
3865367	3867008	Some folks are saying it was first party.
3867048	3868149	Some folks are saying it wasn't.
3869190	3871231	I'll go back and dig up that show and figure it out.
3872699	3873219	So we'll see.
3875301	3877682	I want to mention this, though, regarding the price of the Wii.
3877802	3882205	You know, $250 a pudding, most people would say, could also buy you a Wii.
3882265	3888209	However, there's a possible leak to the price of the Wii, and it's coming through the most oddest of places.
3888229	3889310	7-Eleven.
3889890	3897335	And no, they're not going to be selling the Wii console, but they're giving away some prizes, and some of them are going to include Wii consoles.
3897675	3898716	Well, now, here's the deal.
3899389	3899729	DarkSakura.com
3925133	3929575	and maybe it's because the cost of shipping is included there and who knows what else.
3930456	3935178	I still think this is not the telltale and I'll be all signed of the Wii's price.
3936719	3937199	So we'll see.
3938520	3939360	Come on, 7-Eleven?
3940321	3940901	No.
3940981	3944463	And I don't believe 7-Eleven would be the place that would announce that either.
3944483	3949365	7-Eleven probably has no guests just like the rest of us do.
3949941	3953645	DMN in the chatroom says it's approximate retail value, Rob.
3953845	3954886	And that's correct.
3954946	3956527	It's the approximate retail value.
3957448	3957869	Who knows?
3957909	3959090	They're making an educated guess.
3959770	3960211	We'll see.
3960731	3962012	Educated or edumacated?
3962893	3963954	Probably a little of both.
3964735	3968138	Well, I have something that isn't an estimation.
3968178	3970280	These are actual release dates in the UK.
3970600	3971381	All right.
3971561	3973603	Our UK friends and pals, what are they getting?
3974852	4003799	just a few releases coming out on the 11th is Dark Star 1 for PC Panzer Elite Action for Xbox and Siphon Filter Dark Mirror on PSP so other things to look forward to coming up though is on the 25th Dig Dug Digging Strike Reservoir Dogs on the 25th that I think would be fairly interesting and there's a few really good ones coming out next month too because they get Dance Factory and Star Fox Command
4007916	4008336	Oh, I'm sorry.
4008676	4013838	There's also some cool, well, not too much coming out in the U.S., but some good stuff, though.
4014278	4016139	Well, let's start with the Game Boy Advance.
4016199	4017800	Games Explosion, which is coming out.
4018220	4020081	It's supposed to be a collection of, like, card games and stuff.
4020421	4021601	Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
4022282	4023602	Woo-hoo.
4023662	4029384	Super Robot Tyson, original generation, which is supposed to be, like, a robot fighting game.
4030465	4031505	More of a strategy fighting game.
4032045	4036147	Anyways, on the PC, a bunch of no-name stuff.
4037148	4039809	My favorite one on this list, though, is Pony Love.
4040309	4042049	And I hope that's not what I think it is.
4042610	4048231	Anyways, so on PlayStation 2... Maybe it's a game for little girls who have My Little Ponies.
4048371	4052873	And you're taking it and making it this sick, perverse thing that it doesn't have to be.
4053873	4054373	It has to be.
4054873	4059595	Anyways, D1 Grand Prix is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the official drift racing game.
4059995	4063836	Pirates of the Legend of the Black Buccaneer is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 as well.
4063976	4064416	And of course...
4065182	4070625	The best game of the week, Dead Rising on 360, which I will end up having a review for next week.
4085856	4086256	What was it?
4086316	4086896	Rampage?
4087616	4089017	Oh yeah!
4089317	4093499	That hit all those blogs this week and I'm thinking, didn't we cover that like two weeks ago on the program?
4094280	4098001	So here's the story you're going to hear about in two weeks everywhere else.
4098321	4099002	Exactly folks.
4099082	4112948	Anyways, well this is going to have to do with some wonderful Take-Two games and the Take-Two games I'm talking about of course are Darkness and Bioshock which are going to be coming out actually next year, 2007.
4115152	4116714	on around April 5th.
4117214	4118556	So check those out.
4119217	4120118	That's going to be pretty cool.
4120498	4129809	Also, for you music gaming fans, I'll have you know that we have the date now for Guitar Hero 2, which is going to be coming out on November 8th.
4130748	4132929	Project Gotham Racing 3 Cameo, Perfect Dark Zero,
4152811	4155675	Now all retail for $29.99 As of now?
4155935	4159340	As of last week, about Wednesday Really?
4159420	4163005	But why didn't, if that's the case, if they dropped on Wednesday, why hasn't anyone else picked this up yet?
4163505	4167591	Because I'm smooth like that Okay, I hope you're right
4168755	4174197	Otherwise, regardless, October and November are getting to be huge, huge release months, which is typical.
4174537	4176718	But we've got a lot of big titles coming out in October.
4176738	4179519	Well, hell, the Wii might be coming out in October, so we're still pretty convinced.
4179839	4183060	And then we've got September, just tons and tons.
4183700	4184460	September's not too bad.
4184480	4185321	Hello, November.
4185561	4187722	Tons and tons and tons of stuff.
4188182	4188982	November's pre-packed.
4189102	4190122	We're gearing up, folks.
4190162	4193343	We're getting closer and closer to some busy, busy, busy time for gaming.
4195274	4199436	One thing that won't be busy though much longer are some of EA's servers.
4199876	4203117	They're shutting down the servers for some of the old games.
4203717	4209720	And the good news is though it's mostly sports titles and I'm not trying to rub it in the sports fans' faces.
4210270	4211691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4238528	4247694	NCAA Football 2005, NHL 2005, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005, and UEFA Champions League 2004-2005.
4248074	4251076	All those games are getting shut off pretty soon.
4251176	4259421	By the way, on October 1st, 2006, Madden 2005 is going to be closing as well as NFL Street 2 Unleashed.
4259802	4261903	I should also mention one big title I left out there.
4261943	4266646	Need for Speed Underground 2 has also had their servers shut down.
4267276	4272239	So if you're a fan of playing those older games, unfortunately, time to upgrade to the newer games.
4275661	4279263	And to be really honest, I don't think anyone's playing those games online anymore.
4279343	4284346	I mean, I don't know if you've ever tried to go play some older games on multiplayer and stuff.
4284626	4285387	There's no one on.
4285727	4287608	Yeah, so it's probably not going to be missed.
4290831	4297415	Although you know there's a couple people that are holding out, that are holding on to those titles, and the one or two people that are still playing them, they're going to be pissed.
4298195	4299436	Write us angry emails, I don't know.
4300376	4300636	Awesome.
4303978	4309901	Well, speaking of some hate going around, which is sad, apparently LocoRoco sucks in Japan.
4311322	4314383	Yeah, LocoRoco is biting the big one.
4314664	4315364	No one likes it.
4316925	4318726	Yeah, they actually...
4319628	4321849	You know, advertise the hell out of this game.
4322350	4324251	Sony thought it was going to be really cool.
4324351	4325631	Their website was really cool.
4326852	4332855	And, well, when it went on sale on July 13th, it sort of was like, eh.
4333956	4336377	So, yeah, the critics were saying that it wasn't huge.
4337097	4338758	It's hitting bargain bins already.
4339659	4341860	They packaged it with PSPs.
4342961	4345022	It's just, it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.
4345042	4347343	They thought it was going to be the next Katamari Damacy, and it wasn't.
4347810	4349211	Do you think it's because they tried too hard?
4350152	4354235	The thing is that they didn't try to make Katamari Damashii a success.
4354295	4359379	In fact, it almost seems like they wrote that title off because it was a 1999 release.
4359399	4362901	It was just released under the table, practically, and became something huge.
4363161	4368025	But LocoRoco, especially in Japan, they really pushed to try and make it the next Katamari.
4368065	4370367	This is why I like the call of the snakes on a plane syndrome.
4370427	4372548	You can't force something to be a cult title.
4373049	4376171	You release it, and people like it, then it becomes a cult title.
4376551	4380873	Well, even the critics were saying that they should have let it go as a sleeper.
4380933	4382774	Let it sneak out into the market.
4382794	4384935	People go, oh, look where it go.
4385695	4394979	You know, I honestly, I hope that, you know, they actually look at that tactic for, you know, a release over here.
4395860	4396740	Because I think it really...
4397383	4398164	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4411912	4415573	It was a fun demo and stuff, but you know what?
4415673	4424196	I don't think it's going to keep me interested as long as, say, Scarface, which is coming out later that month, or Godfather, which is also coming out later that month.
4424416	4429417	However, depending on what you're into, I sat with LocoRoco with the demo for an hour screaming at it.
4429804	4437009	Well, they also have Capcom Puzzle World coming out in September as well, the same time around as local Rokos.
4437970	4438391	You know what?
4438491	4441513	I played the demo at E3 and I wasn't feeling it.
4442209	4443451	I'm still going to get LocoRoco.
4444231	4445092	Okay.
4445112	4446153	No, no, LocoRoco was cool.
4446173	4447575	I'm talking about Capcom Puzzle World.
4447615	4449176	I'm burnt out on Puzzle Fighter.
4449196	4453120	I was really close to importing it, and if it's as cheap as all that, I'm going to wait for the U.S.
4453180	4456123	release, but I'm thinking that we're going to see the Japanese release.
4456523	4458986	For all you import crazy people, we're going to see it drop.
4459086	4459947	That's my speculation.
4460067	4460267	Well...
4461087	4466571	In our chatroom, just real quick, VidPower seems to think it seems like everything nowadays is trying to be the next Katamari Damacy.
4467292	4472475	And I believe from Blaze's comment here in our chatroom, he thinks Elite Beat Agents could be the next sleeper hit.
4472615	4473075	I think so.
4473216	4478959	Jeremy Todd 1 points out something good that LocoRoco might not have also sold because the PSP didn't do so well in Japan.
4480260	4482542	I thought it did better over there than it did over here, but I don't know.
4482962	4484503	PSP was doing pretty good over there.
4484603	4485864	It seemed like it was doing okay over there.
4486852	4488834	I don't think the sales were what they speculated them to be.
4488974	4492879	It was getting beat down majorly by the DS, but it was still doing good.
4492899	4498807	The DS Lite had the craziness factor around it, whereas the PSP had a, you know, brisk sales factor around it.
4499328	4503213	I think that the DS, basically, especially in mind for the Japanese audience...
4503809	4508712	I think that it really did cater more toward what is typically a more popular item.
4509232	4517516	You know, something that may not be the most powerful thing, but it's cute, it's, you know, it's compact, it's easy to use, it's versatile.
4519197	4520278	It's new, it's innovative.
4520398	4524380	And the fact that, right, and what, what are you going by now?
4524460	4525080	Drew Nami?
4526321	4529262	What he said was, you know, that it's the new thing.
4529802	4531023	People, it's innovative.
4531723	4532324	People jump on it.
4532584	4532784	Well,
4533206	4534768	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4550683	4569713	West Yorkshire Police Federation Chairman Tom McGee called the game a sickening glorification of violence against police officers and says it's impossible to see how such a game can have anything other than a highly damaging effect on how people perceive and react to police officers.
4570813	4577877	The only problem is it's a game and people understand for the most part, at least I assume in the UK more than the US that the game is
4578547	4580609	Fantasy, and not reality.
4580909	4590258	I mean, so, they didn't really want it banned, they just wanted to basically kind of, um, they were gonna make it unrated, just because it was so violent.
4590378	4591519	That's pretty much what it was.
4591679	4594562	It was just because the game's so freaking bloody, and awesome!
4594762	4595443	Bloody awesome!
4595883	4600808	But, um, yeah, that's why they wanted to give it an unrated rating on it.
4602699	4607700	Meanwhile, ironically, the Reservoir Dogs movie is still being sold in the UK.
4608000	4609000	Hmm.
4610241	4611421	Hmm, I say.
4611801	4613921	Is it because of the interactive element, possibly?
4614481	4616582	Possibly, but it's still fiction.
4617122	4618802	People should be able to tell the difference.
4620523	4621243	Okay, fine.
4621383	4623143	So you can interact with the characters.
4623583	4623923	Great.
4624163	4625984	You don't have to kill the cop in the game.
4626264	4627144	You don't have to do that.
4627604	4628564	But here's the other thing, too.
4629544	4631965	The games don't look exactly as real as a movie.
4632628	4642272	I mean, the movie has real people in it, you know, performing simulated, you know, acts on people, but it looks very realistic, whereas a game looks like a game.
4642292	4653296	You know, unless maybe the PlayStation 5 or something, that may be a different story, but for right now, on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, I'm going to look at that and go, yeah, that's a game.
4654157	4654957	I'm going to know the difference.
4655728	4664232	I want to know, yeah, it's okay to kill a cop in the game because I know if I kill a cop in the game, the police are not going to be busting down my door in an hour to come kill me.
4664512	4666413	So it's fine.
4666593	4667194	It's acceptable.
4668494	4668894	All right.
4669495	4676858	Well, I think it's about time for us to take a little break here on the live show, and that means the podcast gets broken up as well because we release in two parts every week.
4677579	4682081	So we're going to take a break, and we will be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
