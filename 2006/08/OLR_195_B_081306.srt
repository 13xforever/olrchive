2
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:21,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,332
[SPEAKER_14]: and just, you know, people who want to have fun.

4
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:51,954
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what we're doing here on Orange Lawn Trader tonight is having a whole lot of fun.

5
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:57,018
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd love for you guys to join us sometime live Sunday nights at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

6
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get back into the gaming news, though, so we have something to rant about.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,820
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

8
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of stuff to rant about, I hate to do this every week,

9
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:06,842
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we play this game at work.

10
00:01:06,922 --> 00:01:09,544
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what stupid thing is Sony going to do this week?

11
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:10,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

12
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:11,466
[SPEAKER_01]: They never disappoint.

13
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:13,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But, okay.

14
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,869
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was news reports.

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:25,477
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't exactly PlayStation 3 related, but there's reports that the first Blu-ray drives that are going to be available in the Sony Vios, yeah, they won't play Blu-ray movies.

16
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,820
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a DVD player that does not play DVD movies.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the hell is it going to do?

18
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:33,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but you can, you know...

19
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:36,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn your own content and stuff.

20
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,228
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like a Blu-ray data drive or something.

21
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:42,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, pretty much.

22
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:54,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they said that the whole reason why that it can't is because there was actually some lagging software development and copy protection issues.

23
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,681
[SPEAKER_01]: So...

24
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:20,221
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good, because, you know what, I mean, these PlayStation 3s, they use PC drives, more or less, and, yeah, I hope they get this crap together when the PS3 comes out, or else, who knows, we may see some firmware updates now playing, you know, Blu-ray movies, because I don't know why else you would need a Blu-ray player.

25
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:22,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

26
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll see what happens with that.

27
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there is actually some interesting news in regards to the Halo movie.

28
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,293
[SPEAKER_04]: There is information on Ain't It Cool News.

29
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:40,654
[SPEAKER_04]: The director was basically saying that, first of all, he prefers Halo 1.

30
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was pretty funny.

31
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: but that is talking about some of the material that's going to be in the movie, talking about how Master Chief is going to be a mix of the Man in the Suit and CG.

32
00:02:54,856 --> 00:03:00,840
[SPEAKER_04]: To quote, the film has to have a feeling of reality so that it means I want to keep him as real as much as I can.

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking about how it's hard to have someone who moves like an animation as opposed to someone who moves like a human.

34
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:12,306
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also working on having the Covenant be along the same lines, making them

35
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:15,748
[SPEAKER_04]: as real as they can possibly make the movements.

36
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:20,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Another quote from him, from an organic standpoint, they have to be believable.

37
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,192
[SPEAKER_04]: They also need to be terrifying and alien.

38
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best way to start doing that is to break the human silhouette.

39
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:31,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Although many of them are bipedal automatically, you can shift the overall body to something very alien.

40
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:32,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was pretty cool.

41
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:33,739
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you think?

42
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:39,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think the Halo movie, hearing the director's perspective and all this, do you think the Halo movie is going to be winner or loser?

43
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:46,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Winner because he's actually a huge Halo fan and a huge gamer.

44
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:56,131
[SPEAKER_04]: He's basically saying that he's been picking the things that are the most holy of holy things in Halo and keeping them as faithful as possible.

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:03,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Chris, one of our in-house lesbians tonight seems to disagree.

46
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:03,653
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on?

47
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't really have an idea about the Halo movie.

48
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:09,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that I've heard other people who have done the same thing.

49
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:14,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, I was this huge fan of this, and I'm going to make sure everything's fine, and it just doesn't work.

50
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:17,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, do you think the guy who directed Street Fighter was a huge fan of Street Fighter?

51
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:21,737
[SPEAKER_02]: If he was, I feel very bad.

52
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:26,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, or at least a huge fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Kylie Minogue.

53
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:26,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty much.

54
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:31,423
[SPEAKER_14]: PoohEater seems a little upset in our chatroom over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

55
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:32,303
[SPEAKER_14]: Click on chat.

56
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:35,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Aw, no Uwe Boll for this movie.

57
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:37,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Uwe Boll can die in burning hell.

58
00:04:37,825 --> 00:04:40,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, don't hold back, please.

59
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:44,527
[SPEAKER_14]: And Zappy says, all hail Uwe Boll, maker of crappy game movies.

60
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:46,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

61
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:50,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, he may make crappy game movies, but you know what?

62
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think he's going to nail Postal.

63
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:53,810
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get that game wrong.

64
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,070
[SPEAKER_01]: But Postal is a crappy game.

65
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:57,544
[SPEAKER_01]: That means he's going to do it justice.

66
00:04:57,704 --> 00:05:02,047
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to realize that his movies are never going to be taken seriously.

67
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make it campy.

68
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:06,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe he should do the Dead Rising movie if there's ever one.

69
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,210
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

70
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,611
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he shouldn't.

71
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,312
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Romero should.

72
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, Dawn of the Dead Part 2!

73
00:05:29,904 --> 00:05:40,490
[SPEAKER_14]: The Consumer Electronics Association, or CEA, might be checking into the fact maybe they want to do a massive trade show specifically about games.

74
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:49,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, they already do the Consumer Electronics Show, and this was the nation's largest gaming show until about 1994 when E3 started.

75
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:55,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Only 11% of the attendees at Consumer Electronics Show 2006 had interest in games and gaming products.

76
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,040
[SPEAKER_14]: But, quote,

77
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:06,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Since ESA decided to eliminate the E3 event in its known format, we have been deluged with inquiries on whether we could fill the trade show needs of smaller video entertainment companies.

78
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:09,785
[SPEAKER_14]: This coming from Gary Shapiro, President and CEO of the CEA.

79
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:17,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Quote, our executive board met yesterday and unanimously asked staff to explore ways that we could help the gaming community.

80
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:23,450
[SPEAKER_14]: The Consumer Electronics Association believes that trade shows are the most viable means for reaching a market and

81
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:27,851
[SPEAKER_14]: as they serve smaller companies and entrepreneurs who need access to media, buyers, and investors.

82
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:31,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Our board, association, and events are committed to growing the industry.

83
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:36,455
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, nearly 80% of our members are companies with annual sales under $10 million.

84
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:46,500
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe here's where the smaller game companies can seek refuge is CES, whether it be in the form of next year's big show or a smaller separate show has been heard about.

85
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, in the past it was that way anyway, so why not?

86
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:51,647
[SPEAKER_14]: E3 CES

87
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of our chatroom folks seem to think this is a good idea, though.

88
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,973
[SPEAKER_14]: NintendoManiac64 says, Woot for CES.

89
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,575
[SPEAKER_14]: RavensDolphin says, Yes, CES is geek central.

90
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:25,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Firebomba thinks a different expo should step up, though.

91
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:29,240
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll go to the open arms of Penny Arcade Expo, which a lot of folks have been saying.

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this...

93
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Are the lesbians digging Penny Arcade Expo?

94
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:34,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Maisie says, hell yeah.

95
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:35,325
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up with that?

96
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:37,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm just a huge Penny Arcade fan.

97
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan.

98
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:39,630
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good stuff.

99
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,150
[SPEAKER_14]: It's good stuff.

100
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Those guys know their stuff.

101
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:41,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't get me wrong.

102
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:42,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan as well.

103
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:47,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And I met a dude in the line at E3 two years ago buying hamburgers.

104
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:50,941
[SPEAKER_14]: We randomly met them at E3 a couple years ago, and...

105
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:56,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in line with, we were in line buying lunch and just talking about stuff.

106
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:58,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they write very good editorial pieces on the gaming industry.

107
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,685
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.

108
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:02,206
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a lack of fundage.

109
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:03,326
[SPEAKER_14]: But have you been, Megzi?

110
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,247
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I haven't.

111
00:08:04,327 --> 00:08:05,387
[SPEAKER_15]: I would kill to go.

112
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard they're giving away a new car this year.

113
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,971
[SPEAKER_14]: The big gaming cluster tournament they have there of all these old school games.

114
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:13,831
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty awesome.

115
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

116
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:18,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Pardon?

117
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

118
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:21,402
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to.

119
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:24,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we could have an Orange Lounge Radio booth and staff it with lesbians.

120
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,528
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

121
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,491
[SPEAKER_14]: The new breed of booth babe.

122
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,376
[SPEAKER_14]: These booth babes don't want anything to do with you.

123
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And how's that different than any other year?

124
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:38,807
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.

125
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:40,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Very, very true.

126
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's kind of funny.

127
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:48,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyways, another cool thing that's going to be happening pretty soon, and you've probably seen it with a lot of the games out there right now.

128
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Xbox 360 games are pretty much the same with any other next-gen games.

129
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,173
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty expensive right now.

130
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,174
[SPEAKER_01]: $59.99 retail seems to be the going price for most games out there.

131
00:08:57,714 --> 00:08:58,435
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

132
00:09:14,306 --> 00:09:17,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Samurai Warriors 2, Just Cause, Blitz the League, Fusion Frenzy 2, Viva Pinata, Cars, and Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

133
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:34,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are all going to be coming out $49.99.

134
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:37,601
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's still too much for you, $39.99.

135
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:40,022
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be having Test Drive Unlimited coming out.

136
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:49,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1, if you happen to not be on live, which is weird, but whatever.

137
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:53,250
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be coming out early September as well as Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventure.

138
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to give you a hint, the game's probably going to be crap.

139
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:57,487
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably why it's cheap.

140
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,588
[SPEAKER_01]: World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions is going to be coming out.

141
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Pimp My Ride in November, Kabbalah's African Safari.

142
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:08,590
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

143
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:16,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Also to remind you, as we mentioned last week, the first party games from Microsoft, the launch ones...

144
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:22,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Cameo, Project Gotham Racing 3, and Perfect Dark Zero, all $29.99 right now.

145
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:25,854
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we mentioned in Part A, Ridge Racer 6, a whopping $19.99.

146
00:10:26,414 --> 00:10:26,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

147
00:10:26,874 --> 00:10:29,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I should invent a game.

148
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:30,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, wait, what's this?

149
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:32,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Unpimp My Ride.

150
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:40,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And have it sponsored by Volkswagen, where you get more points for, you know, like you get like 50,000 points for spinners and...

151
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:54,089
[SPEAKER_04]: and if they have like if they have vinyl applied to their paint you know when you destroy that car you get extra extra points and if it's actually painted on then you get a lot of points so yeah alright

152
00:10:55,286 --> 00:11:01,673
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say real quick, though, I heard Megzi give a little cheer over Viva Pinata, and I haven't heard a lot of people really excited about this game.

153
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,355
[SPEAKER_14]: So what has you excited about Viva Pinata?

154
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:10,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I just like those really obscure, quirky games like Katamari, stuff like that, Cube of War for the GameCube.

155
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:11,543
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the right show.

156
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:14,006
[SPEAKER_15]: You are.

157
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,149
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually heard about it from my manager at work.

158
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Animal Crossing Good Thing, Bad Thing

159
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Fire Resurrected in chat says, I got my Viva Pinata pre-ordered.

160
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:47,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And another game, of course, Rapala Trophies coming out on the 360.

161
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:48,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Also going to be $35.99.

162
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:52,015
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, how many fishing fans are out there on the 360 anyways?

163
00:11:52,075 --> 00:11:52,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you never know.

164
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,336
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's easy achievement points, you'll buy it.

165
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,057
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I won't.

166
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:58,438
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get it for free.

167
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:07,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, speaking of online-related things, and Megzi should be interested in this.

168
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead Rising already has download content.

169
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually going to be released in about a month in Europe.

170
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:21,612
[SPEAKER_04]: They've already put out, though, some quick downloadable content.

171
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:25,596
[SPEAKER_04]: They have basically keys that are unlocking costumes that are hidden in the games.

172
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: They're called Miami Knights, Casual, Weekender, Round Shades, Burgundy Grandpa, Pink Paparazzi,

173
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:34,508
[SPEAKER_04]: and Man in Black.

174
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:36,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you get, Johnny Cash?

175
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:36,789
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

176
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:40,070
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he's just got a black jacket, black pants.

177
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, so you've seen these costumes, Loki?

178
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're downloadable right now in live.

179
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,212
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out the same day as Dead Rising.

180
00:12:47,672 --> 00:12:56,195
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically in the very beginning of the game when you first get into the security room there's a bunch of lockers in there and you can walk up and change clothes.

181
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:57,495
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that in Resident Evil 2.

182
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the keys and you get Jill's cowgirl outfit and...

183
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:01,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Dead Rising, Jill's Sandwich

184
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.

185
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:30,724
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a smoothie shop in the mall?

186
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,587
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, I think.

187
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:34,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, all right.

188
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I see what you're doing.

189
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:41,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, go listen to Part A if you haven't yet, and you'll get that maybe.

190
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, smoothie.

191
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:46,856
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

192
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:08,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead Rising 2

193
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:32,314
[SPEAKER_14]: If not that, okay maybe that's a little ambitious, at least being the number two game, where Oblivion was a little while ago.

194
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:36,838
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I'm looking at my list right now, right this minute, somebody is playing Dead Rising.

195
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:40,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And this person on my friends list already got the infinite mode it looks like, so that's pretty cool.

196
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:41,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Lucky.

197
00:14:41,201 --> 00:14:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's great though?

198
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:49,547
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to read somethingawful.com, they have a little page on there talking about Dead Rising and how to spend the 72 hours in the game.

199
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:53,590
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious because they basically never left the security room for the 72 hours.

200
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, they kept taking pictures of the one chick's boobs in there.

201
00:15:01,605 --> 00:15:01,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

202
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:08,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear everyone, I have heard your concerns and passed them to every source within Capcom Possible.

203
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel your pain as I myself have a large SDTV and am having trouble reading the mission objectives, item names, etc.

204
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like you all to know we have heard your concerns and take them seriously.

205
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:45,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been seeing campaigns on other forums to send hundreds of emails to our support email.

206
00:15:46,348 --> 00:16:04,516
[SPEAKER_14]: unfortunately this doesn't expedite or increase the importance of the concern in any way but it does take time and resources from other fans equally deserving concerns all concerns are always important to us and do what we can we do what we can we would like you to know we appreciate your feedback blah blah blah so basically they're saying please stop emailing us we know

207
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:06,365
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a boo-boo in the game.

208
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:07,726
[SPEAKER_14]: My bad, shut up.

209
00:16:08,126 --> 00:16:09,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, my bad, shut up.

210
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:10,287
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think they're going to do?

211
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:11,067
[SPEAKER_14]: You think they'll patch it?

212
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:12,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they'll patch it.

213
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:13,088
[SPEAKER_14]: You really think?

214
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,169
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems like an awfully big thing to patch.

215
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he have font size?

216
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:16,889
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

217
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Mixi?

218
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:27,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really know much about it since I have yet to play Dead Rising, but it seems like, like you said, a big thing to patch and kind of a...

219
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:28,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Dead Rising MMO

220
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:55,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of folks would have just liked to see Dead Rising be multiplayer.

221
00:16:56,362 --> 00:17:01,666
[SPEAKER_14]: But my thought is, if they've done Dead Rising multiplayer, what's going to be the big catch for Dead Rising 2?

222
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Be the zombie?

223
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't they already do that?

224
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:14,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the perfect MMO would be you have your everyday life and then you release your serum.

225
00:17:14,936 --> 00:17:16,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And if your character gets infected...

226
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:18,295
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

227
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,400
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's get into the mailbag and find some other great thoughts.

228
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,940
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to put the hazmat suit.

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:02,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Jamie's going to suit up in the hazmat at bestest suit right now and get her hands wet and get there in the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com They better not get wet.

230
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:04,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Your emails right now.

231
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,002
[SPEAKER_04]: If they get wet, that means my suit's broken.

232
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:14,504
[SPEAKER_04]: First email comes from Nailhead.

233
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:22,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start by saying that I love the show, been listening to the podcast for a year, it makes traveling to work and back much faster.

234
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:28,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Most games that I buy are from recommendations from Orange Lodge Radio, so thank you for that.

235
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,869
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a scary thought that we're influencing the general public like that, but no thank you, seriously.

236
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a story that you may want to know about.

237
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm part of a small film company in Huntsville, Alabama.

238
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:39,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out to Jamie, I know she's from Alabama too.

239
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:39,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah!

240
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:43,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are in production of a World of Warcraft documentary.

241
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:47,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll link you to this article because I love the way it's written much better than me trying to describe it.

242
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read the URL, it's fairly long.

243
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:53,197
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at wowinsider.com slash 2006 slash 08 slash 08.

244
00:18:56,158 --> 00:19:02,892
[SPEAKER_04]: slash bowling dash four dash GnomeReagan G-N-O-M-E GnomeReagan, actually, but that's alright.

245
00:19:03,113 --> 00:19:03,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I don't...

246
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:05,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

247
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:09,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Dash wow, dash documentary, dash in, dash the, dash works.

248
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:12,510
[SPEAKER_14]: So it sounds like go to this wow insider and look for an August 8th post.

249
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:12,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

250
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like, okay.

251
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:14,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

252
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:22,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the link to the film's webpage is at worldofwarcraftthemovie.com and the film company is deadworkers.com.

253
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:23,478
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

254
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as cool as zombie flesh eaters, but still pretty damn cool.

255
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be curious to see what this documentary would turn out like.

256
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be great if you mentioned it on the show.

257
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,029
[SPEAKER_04]: It would surely help get us more interviews.

258
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we would love to interview you all as well.

259
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,934
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, if we can make it out west.

260
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,077
[SPEAKER_04]: In closing, I'll list three things about your show I love.

261
00:19:44,297 --> 00:19:46,500
[SPEAKER_04]: FUs of the Week, PC vs. Mac is hilarious.

262
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I tend to side with Loki on this one.

263
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:49,803
[SPEAKER_04]: You are Bruce Campbell fans.

264
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's something funny.

265
00:19:52,448 --> 00:20:01,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Penny Arcade earlier, they did a strip about Dead Rising and they had Mac fans drooling over the... That was great.

266
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:02,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was great.

267
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:07,164
[SPEAKER_04]: The closing on this is thanks, I love you all.

268
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:08,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Kisses.

269
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:09,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoochie, smoochie.

270
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:12,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Got one from Diginova.

271
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey crew, a big hello from DigiNova on the other side of the pond.

272
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:21,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Been a while since I last called in, but I wanted to raise the subject of the OLR Skype line.

273
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally find this part of the show one of the most interesting parts.

274
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:33,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, there are the regular callers, but to myself they are part of the OLR formula that makes it so addictive, that makes me so envious that I can't participate more often.

275
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:35,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to see the reaction of this week's show.

276
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:07,277
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, I want to make my dedication to the OLR crew and have purchased the above domain, which isn't a total rip-off, but I hope this makes me an official trooper from Sky.

277
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great show tonight.

278
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:12,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be sure to listen to and pass the word of OLR to the masses.

279
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So somebody bought OrangeLounge.co.uk for us, in a way.

280
00:21:22,456 --> 00:21:24,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, maybe we should have a UK Mirror.

281
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:26,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm down with that.

282
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Email us back if you want to help run a UK Mirror for us.

283
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Two things.

284
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:43,807
[SPEAKER_14]: A, I'm very glad someone's saying something positive about the call-in segment because I think, I want to say either the reviews in iTunes or somewhere was bashing on the callers and I, you know, they're just mad they don't listen Sunday nights and can call in themselves.

285
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:44,807
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what their deal is.

286
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:53,269
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm really glad something said, because we really want this to be everybody's show, not just, you know, DarkSakura, Loki, and Sky hog the airwaves for, you know, three hours.

287
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,170
[SPEAKER_14]: We like getting you guys involved, you know.

288
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Although my ego does like hogging the airwaves for three hours.

289
00:21:57,891 --> 00:21:58,671
[SPEAKER_14]: We are the stars.

290
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the diva of the show.

291
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:03,199
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Rob's the diva of the show.

292
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:03,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Second thing.

293
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:13,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm loving the increase it seems like we've been having in UK presence lately because I've noticed on Myspace we've been getting a lot of ads from UK folks lately.

294
00:22:14,277 --> 00:22:17,218
[SPEAKER_14]: So whoever's spreading our name out there in the UK, thanks.

295
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:23,962
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're really glad that you guys are noticing that we want to be representative of gamers everywhere.

296
00:22:24,182 --> 00:22:31,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Not just silly America, but UK, Australia, Canada, anywhere.

297
00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:34,187
[SPEAKER_14]: So worldwide gaming news.

298
00:22:35,328 --> 00:22:59,648
[SPEAKER_04]: I especially love our UK listeners though because I'm going to move into your country one day when I have money I'm in your country buying your stuff eating your food Oh Bobby Bobby Blackwolf wrote us

299
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:06,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com, who also does a show Sunday nights.

300
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,143
[SPEAKER_04]: The subject is Dear LLR Heart.

301
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,944
[SPEAKER_04]: As in, you know, less than three.

302
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:13,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear LLR, all in caps, by the way.

303
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:16,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is how many kills he'll get in the Chromestowns tournament, by the way.

304
00:23:16,987 --> 00:23:17,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Less than three.

305
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your mom.

306
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:19,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen.

307
00:23:22,705 --> 00:23:23,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop talking trash.

308
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:24,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

309
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,488
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

310
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:31,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Less than three is how many people we have signed up to participate in the Chrome House tournament right now.

311
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:38,536
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole thing reminds me of that South Park episode where they're trying to get Tweekin, I forget the other guy, to fight.

312
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:39,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Craig.

313
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:39,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig.

314
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:41,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Tweekin, Craig to fight.

315
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:43,699
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all talking trash for them.

316
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

317
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

318
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:57,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I love your show.

319
00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:59,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I also love destroying the crumhounds of your listeners.

320
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:00,686
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week.

321
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:01,987
[SPEAKER_04]: XOXOXOXO.

322
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart, heart, Bobby Blackwolf.

323
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:05,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Bobby.

324
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,610
[SPEAKER_14]: What a jerk.

325
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,951
[SPEAKER_04]: That email was full of awesome and win.

326
00:24:09,271 --> 00:24:11,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't give a shit because I don't play crumhounds.

327
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, easy for you to say until we get trashed on next week's show.

328
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:16,701
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait.

329
00:24:43,946 --> 00:24:44,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to read this.

330
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,367
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really long.

331
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:51,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know I enjoy the show and wanted to share my thoughts about video games causing violence in teen pregnancy.

332
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:58,154
[SPEAKER_04]: The knee-jerk reaction from many in our age group, like Junami, is to blame the parents.

333
00:24:58,474 --> 00:25:08,019
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the vast majority of us are not parents or are not parents of adolescent age children, especially when you factor out the Pac-Man and Sudoku playing grandmothers that bump up the average age of the gamer statistic.

334
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy for those of us who aren't parents to cast blame, but it's not so simple.

335
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:17,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Who among us growing up had parents who were successfully able to control all the influence that shaped our minds?

336
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:22,589
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many influences on a child, including the extended family, community, peers, and yes, media.

337
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents can only control so much.

338
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Full-time parents in the 60s couldn't keep Playboy and Pod out of the hands of children.

339
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: How can single parents and dual-wage parents today...

340
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:33,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching.

341
00:25:57,782 --> 00:25:58,983
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously not video games.

342
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,924
[SPEAKER_04]: People always blame new technology, trends, and music.

343
00:26:00,964 --> 00:26:05,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents of yesterday were convinced that Elvis singlehandedly deflowered a generation of virgins.

344
00:26:07,489 --> 00:26:07,989
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not fiction.

345
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:36,196
[SPEAKER_04]: but there are very few parents of today who grew up with that music agree there have been studies done linking video games to physical agitation like increased heart rate and aggression but also after playing a game of football doesn't feel that same agitation and aggression video games are new they will be scapegoated until we who have grown up with them become the parents of adolescents ourselves but then I'm sure we'll be blaming VR my god that role plays my god that role plays snuff films we never had that satan

346
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Defensively pointing to the First Amendment as a shield doesn't solve anything.

347
00:26:41,437 --> 00:26:45,919
[SPEAKER_04]: The game industry in particular and the gaming community in general has to take a lead in tackling these problems.

348
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:49,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Without casting blame, we need to improve our society's respect for life and human dignity.

349
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

350
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,882
[SPEAKER_04]: These ideas have to be proactively taught.

351
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:55,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply censoring or removing media to the contrary doesn't work.

352
00:26:55,983 --> 00:27:00,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Eliminating the video game where you can kill a prostitute does not by itself create respect for women.

353
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to directly teach respect for women.

354
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,114
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to directly teach respect for women, and a society that has respect for women will naturally not be entertained by a video game where you can kill a prostitute.

355
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,496
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the message that we need to communicate to the mainstream and to our government.

356
00:27:16,816 --> 00:27:19,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of fighting over whose fault it is, let's work on fixing the problem.

357
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:20,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that.

358
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:26,081
[SPEAKER_04]: As a side note, Canton, Ohio is a socially and religiously conservative city that teaches abstinence only.

359
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:33,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Conservative parents seem to generally believe that kids, if never told about sex, will never figure out how to perform sex or even that there are certain bodily parts that can be stimulated.

360
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:40,751
[SPEAKER_04]: This is even though one of these conservative parents themselves conceived their current crop of children in the back of a four pinto.

361
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:41,752
[SPEAKER_04]: But I digress.

362
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:44,634
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why these parents think that it must be music or video games.

363
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:48,918
[SPEAKER_04]: After all, children are never exposed to sex in their God-fearing homes and communities, right?

364
00:27:49,198 --> 00:27:50,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be an outside influence, right?

365
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Fighting the conservatives will always be an exercise in frustration.

366
00:27:54,102 --> 00:27:57,925
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they're angels, but an all-demonic influence must come from the outside.

367
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad.

368
00:27:58,365 --> 00:27:59,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for the long-winded email.

369
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted you to know that I enjoy the show.

370
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:01,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Johnny.

371
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with every damn thing that you've said there.

372
00:28:05,498 --> 00:28:11,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to say I have plenty of respect for women, but I enjoy games where you can kill prostitutes.

373
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:15,863
[SPEAKER_04]: They have little respect for themselves, though.

374
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:16,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

375
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:18,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I had fun with Grand Theft Auto.

376
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:29,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, I have to say, I do love having my random vows of fake, non-reality destruction.

377
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:30,730
[SPEAKER_04]: It's

378
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:32,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a release, a regression.

379
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:41,798
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of it, there's all those added studies too about how solving even the puzzles in some of these more violent games, how they raise your cognitive function.

380
00:28:41,998 --> 00:28:55,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have you know, I'm actually going to be putting Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my laptop so that during our segments or during our breaks between Part A and Part B, I can play the hot coffee mod at whim.

381
00:28:56,707 --> 00:28:57,087
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

382
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I give props to that listener for being well educated.

383
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,570
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all.

384
00:29:02,253 --> 00:29:02,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Well-educated.

385
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:03,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Individual.

386
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:06,714
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't agree with some... No, no, no, I'm... No.

387
00:29:06,834 --> 00:29:07,254
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I do.

388
00:29:07,614 --> 00:29:18,436
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I... Saying I... You know, not often you see well-educated internet rants, so I'm very pleased Well, honestly, I think that that type of attitude should be applied toward all sorts of things within, you know, society that's going on.

389
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:24,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I honestly think that... You know, I actually... I'm not going to go into detail about this.

390
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:26,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I recently had a conversation with my mother.

391
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,118
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about.

392
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:28,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

393
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:29,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

394
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a discussion with my mother and she started to preach at me and try to bring Bible quotes into it.

395
00:29:38,303 --> 00:29:39,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, excuse me?

396
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:41,925
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, do you believe in Jesus?

397
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, what does me believing in Jesus have to do with you respecting who I am?

398
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:56,018
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nothing wrong with being religious.

399
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:56,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing at all.

400
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:57,119
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just...

401
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:26,040
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're really trying to convince people to not act a certain way, or not to play these violent games, or to not do something, you need to actually have something substantial to support your claim with.

402
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:27,201
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I have to say.

403
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:43,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have, to defend, I'm not conservative or anything, but to defend the conservatives, there are a few people out there that are just that dumb that they will go out and do stupid things from games, but I would have more respect for them if they actually researched the subject they were talking about.

404
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:46,834
[SPEAKER_04]: You should see some of those anti-Harry Potter, oh, Harry Potter Promotes Witchcraft.

405
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:48,775
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Christians, hello.

406
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:54,179
[SPEAKER_04]: There actually is a book, though, that one of my friends who is, she's a very, she's a liberal Christian.

407
00:30:55,099 --> 00:31:03,545
[SPEAKER_04]: She is called What Harry Potter Teaches Us About Jesus or something like that and how they're actually using it as a relation, how it teaches good values.

408
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:04,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again.

409
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:05,167
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

410
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It does teach some good values, but.

411
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, if you want witchcraft, you watch Harry Potter.

412
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:16,687
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, you know, Jesus and all that stuff, you watch The Chronicles of Narnia.

413
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:23,793
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's movies out there that are both parallel to different religions.

414
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:28,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for my goddamn Pagan series, or better yet, Scientology.

415
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:30,960
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry, Battlefield Earth was already out there, so...

416
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:36,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Cruise, Saving the World with Scientology Jeremy Todd 1

417
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:51,259
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, RidRacer.

418
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,380
[SPEAKER_04]: R-I-D-R-A-Y-S-H-E-R.

419
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I found this on YouTube.

420
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:01,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson was interviewed, well, not really an interview, but more of a discussion about video game violence.

421
00:32:02,164 --> 00:32:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: The main discussion was about the game Bully and how it could affect children in schools.

422
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:06,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a link to the video.

423
00:32:07,406 --> 00:32:09,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Look on YouTube and look under Jack Thompson.

424
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:11,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, do a search if you really want.

425
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:22,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, there's a reason why we've relegated this sort of to the mailbag segment and didn't talk about it a whole lot in depth tonight, and that is, unlike G4, we don't feel like giving this guy more attention.

426
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:28,549
[SPEAKER_14]: With all due respect to the emailer, I realize it's in the blogs and everything, you know, and people are talking about it, but...

427
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to finish reading his email.

428
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:35,416
[SPEAKER_04]: They bring up some interesting points and I thought that OLR and possibly some of the listeners would want to see this video.

429
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,317
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion is also, by the way, on game politics.

430
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,678
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept bringing some of the stuff up.

431
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:48,362
[SPEAKER_04]: My opinion on this video is that Jack Thompson believes that when a kid starts playing a violent video game, that the kid will instantly turn into an angry, violent kid and that that's just not true.

432
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:53,625
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I found interesting is that when they asked Jack if he had seen the game being played by someone...

433
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:55,986
[SPEAKER_04]: and he replies by saying no.

434
00:32:56,566 --> 00:33:02,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically he is saying that the game Bully will make kids violent even though he hasn't actually seen the video being played and he doesn't know what the game runs.

435
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:15,493
[SPEAKER_01]: To be fair, none of them have seen the game yet and also to be fair, his whole assumption on the game was based off of the press release about the game, the pictures they've seen so far of the game and that kind of stuff.

436
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:19,495
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's in the wrong for assuming that this game is

437
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:24,870
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a certain way because of just, you know, a press release and some pictures and he hasn't played the game.

438
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,231
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also wrong in defending the game because they haven't played it yet either.

439
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:32,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the whole thing is, it's an argument over something completely retarded.

440
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:43,357
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like saying, you know, The Passion of the Christ and, you know, Mel Gibson is making a movie pretending the movie hasn't come out yet or something like that and debating, you know, that whole movie without having seen anything on it.

441
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:46,898
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, the whole argument, the whole interview is retarded.

442
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,419
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole thing was an...

443
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:51,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Ego cock-stroking thing.

444
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:52,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

445
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack Thompson wanted to be on cable TV.

446
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:58,468
[SPEAKER_14]: G4 wanted to be able to interview the big bad guy behind video games.

447
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:01,310
[SPEAKER_14]: There was nothing redeeming about that whole thing.

448
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:01,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

449
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They covered nothing.

450
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:06,235
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wish to not waste any more time talking about it.

451
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:07,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

452
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris emails us saying, Hey OLR, I recently received a DS Lite for my birthday and I was wondering, this is my favorite game for PSP and PS2 is SOCOM, if there are any games that are similar to SOCOM for DS because please let me know.

453
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:22,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, love the show.

454
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:24,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

455
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:25,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty Call of Duty

456
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:45,937
[SPEAKER_01]: DS, I don't know about that, but there might be something like that coming out.

457
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:51,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say probably right now, Metroid Prime Hunters is a first-person shooter.

458
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:56,124
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole lot of first-person shooters on the Wii just because of the control setup on it.

459
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:58,886
[SPEAKER_01]: DS, Wii, whatever.

460
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:08,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, though, if you have these games that you like, check the publisher's websites and see if they have any release dates listed for any games along those lines.

461
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:17,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just going to throw out as the Nintendo fangirl that Metroid Prime for the DS is really very, very good.

462
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:47,632
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm not a big fan of first person shooters in general but that was very very good I liked Metroid and the DS better than I did on the consoles to be honest I like the first Metroid on the Nintendo a little wireless multiplayer goes a long way Super Metroid yes that game was the shit that's all for the email though alright you should email us too you there sitting at your computer or sitting on the bus or in the car listening to our show right now I mean if you're driving don't email us right now but send us an email at some point mailbag at orange lounge radio

463
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,434
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanna say this isn't news.

464
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:12,260
[SPEAKER_14]: But I understand why we're covering it.

465
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:12,600
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

466
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to get that out there.

467
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,860
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't news.

468
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,361

488
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:05,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I rant for a minute?

489
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that game was really good-looking.

490
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:09,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Finite is a beautiful looking game.

491
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:10,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I rant for a minute, though?

492
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:15,956
[SPEAKER_14]: I am sick of G4 farting and it turning up on all these game blogs.

493
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:21,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, what has G4 done for the gaming industry in the past year?

494
00:37:21,898 --> 00:37:24,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a goddamn thing, but letdowns and disappointment.

495
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is the gaming community continuing to give a shit about anything G4 does?

496
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:33,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, don't look at it and maybe it'll go away.

497
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:50,758
[SPEAKER_14]: We should be focusing our attention on more promising gaming representations such as Independent Radio, GamePolitics.com, which is an impressive website, GameplayHD, that whole channel which is run by people who actually know things about video games, shock and awe.

498
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually seen good stuff come out of Eurogamer TV too.

499
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:54,615
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

500
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And YouTube.

501
00:37:56,117 --> 00:37:57,438
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know something funny though?

502
00:37:57,658 --> 00:38:00,582
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's G4ia was X-Play presents G4ia.

503
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:01,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know what?

504
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:04,066
[SPEAKER_01]: X-Play is the only gaming show on that network anymore.

505
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So seriously, gaming community?

506
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:06,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I challenge you.

507
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop giving a shit about G4 for like six months.

508
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

509
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:44,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, you know, even ever since the first GeForia that I saw, which was retarded anyways, I was amazed that Spike and their award show was actually better than GeForia when it first came out.

510
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:49,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, and this is a network that doesn't even, you know, this isn't a gaming network and they're doing a better show?

511
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:51,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, come on.

512
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, GeFor is not a gaming network anymore, and that is a fact.

513
00:38:54,587 --> 00:38:55,527
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come out and said it.

514
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,788
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a guy TV network like Spike.

515
00:38:58,868 --> 00:39:04,153
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just fucking sick of seeing all these, you know, G4 does this, and it ends up on Dig.

516
00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:07,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, G4 can suck my dick.

517
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:08,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Will that end up on Dig?

518
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:09,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably!

519
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:16,488
[SPEAKER_14]: G4 comes to Orange Lounge Radio Studio and proceeds to get down on their knees and serve a slob.

520
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:41,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And G4, remember everything negative I'm saying about G4 is in the past couple years, pretty much every decision they made since the tech TV merger, I think we can all agree.

521
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:44,349
[SPEAKER_14]: G4, when it first started, had a lot of promise.

522
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,230
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty cool.

523
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:57,039
[SPEAKER_14]: And sure, even myself, maybe on this program in the past, I gave Scott and some of the other G4 personalities a hard time, but no more than some of the internet gives us a hard time being a podcaster or whatever.

524
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:57,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

525
00:40:15,926 --> 00:40:25,535
[SPEAKER_14]: that he believed in and something that is so much more beneficial for the gaming community and it makes me so frustrated that all games does things.

526
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:32,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio, Gamer Andy, Chatterbox, Bobby, everybody does things and nobody seems to care.

527
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:33,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

528
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:37,545
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, if I report a street date or something of something, it doesn't matter.

529
00:40:37,765 --> 00:40:46,328
[SPEAKER_01]: But if G4 just says, oh, by the way, this is coming out, it will get posted on every single... If all games did an award show like G4ia did that, nobody would care.

530
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:50,289
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's sad because that award show would be brought to you by real gamers.

531
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:51,469
[SPEAKER_14]: Real gamers.

532
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Not Game for Pay.

533
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, that was my little rant.

534
00:40:57,478 --> 00:40:58,399
[SPEAKER_14]: That was my little rant.

535
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:58,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

536
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to give Scott massive kudos, though.

537
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:10,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I absolutely give Scott massive kudos because the whole reason why we're on board with all games is that we believe in his vision.

538
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:15,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Next story, please.

539
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:17,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott is full of awesome and win.

540
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:18,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

541
00:41:18,548 --> 00:41:18,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

542
00:41:19,042 --> 00:41:20,484
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good guy.

543
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:23,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Lawrence, I couldn't say enough great things about him.

544
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,654
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could afford to pay him to be our producer, we would.

545
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:32,022
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course Bobby, even though we give him a hard time about the whole Chromehounds and everything thing.

546
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:34,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby is full of awesome and win too.

547
00:41:34,946 --> 00:41:36,066
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.

548
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:45,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would rather kind of lump G4 in with the Jackie Poo thing and just basically treat it like that.

549
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just not talk about them anymore.

550
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:48,552
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

551
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:50,112
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm taking a stand right now.

552
00:41:51,013 --> 00:41:55,375
[SPEAKER_14]: G4, those words are banned from this program from here on out.

553
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,996
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless they are mentioned in other words and not together.

554
00:41:58,881 --> 00:41:59,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, you know what I mean.

555
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:04,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example, we could talk about a G4 map.

556
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:14,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that would be fine, but unless they talk about something really big, with the exception of one segment that's coming up tonight, because I just realized there's something coming up in a segment tonight.

557
00:42:14,452 --> 00:42:18,134
[SPEAKER_14]: After tonight's episode, seriously, no more G4 news stories.

558
00:42:18,515 --> 00:42:18,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously.

559
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:20,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Gee, I wish I had forearms.

560
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,305
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Pooeater, just linked to the chatroom, a dig story about G4.

561
00:42:27,907 --> 00:42:29,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it seriously get dug?

562
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:33,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God, you guys are crazy.

563
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:37,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, in news... Yes, please, thank you.

564
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:44,219
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a full-length feature made especially for Xbox Live that will be coming out on the Marketplace.

565
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:49,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically a recap of the so far Battlestar Galactica series.

566
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:53,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So if any of you missed it, go get it.

567
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:55,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Battlestar Galactica is awesome sauce.

568
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,872
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad we can talk about good cable TV now because Battlestar Galactica is pretty fracking awesome.

569
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to watch the old Battlestar Galactica.

570
00:43:04,593 --> 00:43:09,054
[SPEAKER_14]: The new one just takes the old one and makes it great.

571
00:43:09,194 --> 00:43:10,394
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they need to do for me though?

572
00:43:10,694 --> 00:43:15,076
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to freaking put the new Doctor Who episodes up there for me because the new Doctor is cute.

573
00:43:17,876 --> 00:43:23,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I made the mistake of watching Doctor Who on YouTube and I found out what happens to Rose.

574
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:31,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I love my British sci-fi, y'all.

575
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:34,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a really good idea to put this on Xbox Live.

576
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:36,976
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a marriage of geekdom.

577
00:43:37,376 --> 00:43:37,836
[SPEAKER_14]: It's great.

578
00:43:38,076 --> 00:43:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Microsoft, Doctor Who, please, for the win.

579
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Okie dokie.

580
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

581
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:49,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Louisiana employees of GameStop are suing the retailer for unfair labor practices

582
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:12,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Six managers claimed they were forced to work 60 or more hours a week without being paid overtime and were told they were not eligible for overtime.

583
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:17,811
[SPEAKER_14]: EA, by the way, and other major developers lost a court case of something similar.

584
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,132
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you guys think of this?

585
00:44:20,203 --> 00:44:25,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened in California, actually, and they changed, because this affected my husband's salary.

586
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:34,766
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually had to change part of, I think, something from salaried pay to, it was part of a class action lawsuit.

587
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:39,327
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to rework, because it was violating some California pay and labor law.

588
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the company I work for has actually had to redo that, because they were paying us by something that's legal in North Carolina and not what's legal in California.

589
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,845
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, that happened out here too.

590
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:58,228
[SPEAKER_14]: That thing's already up to seven digs on dig.com.

591
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:01,209
[SPEAKER_14]: But it doesn't link to anything because the podcast isn't up yet.

592
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:03,430
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have waited until the podcast was up and then they could link it.

593
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,230
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

594
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:04,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

595
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,370
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what happens.

596
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:05,851
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cute.

597
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:07,071
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are so great.

598
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:08,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Oil Army.

599
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:12,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

600
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:13,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Megzy was going to have a comment.

601
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:13,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Megzy.

602
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,535
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you want to say on the GameStop thing?

603
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,396
[SPEAKER_15]: I like GameStop.

604
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:23,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is Eris from GameStop.

605
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,500
[SPEAKER_15]: She called me like five times.

606
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Since I'm not a manager, it doesn't really affect me.

607
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:31,985
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess I don't really have anything to say about it.

608
00:45:33,426 --> 00:45:34,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I don't want you to endanger your job.

609
00:45:34,967 --> 00:45:36,849
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, from your perception, does it seem unfair?

610
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,530
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't have to answer.

611
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,291
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess.

612
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:45,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if you're working 60 more hours a week in any job, you should be paid fairly for it.

613
00:45:45,578 --> 00:45:46,719
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

614
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:55,030
[SPEAKER_04]: In California, basically, and I honestly, this is why I will never move out of state because I've worked in the South and it sucks.

615
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,242
[SPEAKER_04]: In California, you're required to have, for every six hours you work, you're required to have two 15-minute breaks.

616
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:07,944
[SPEAKER_04]: If you work over six hours, you get a 30-minute lunch that you're not paid for, of course.

617
00:46:08,364 --> 00:46:12,865
[SPEAKER_04]: If you work over eight hours in a day, unless there are other prior arrangements made, you get paid overtime.

618
00:46:13,205 --> 00:46:15,386
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go over 10 hours, you get time and a half.

619
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Not time and a half, you get double time.

620
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:21,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's law in California.

621
00:46:22,028 --> 00:46:24,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you work over 40 hours a week, you get overtime pay.

622
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:32,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, did they specify whether these were, this is probably just a small detail, if these were store managers or assistant managers?

623
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Just said six managers.

624
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, alright, then I really don't know.

625
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:40,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that there's actually something similar in regards, at least for the weekly overtime.

626
00:46:41,214 --> 00:46:46,215
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the, as far as I was aware, I think that most of the GameStop managers are on salary.

627
00:46:46,495 --> 00:46:46,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they are.

628
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:52,117
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually, they eliminated that in California because it was violating labor law.

629
00:46:52,297 --> 00:46:52,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I see.

630
00:46:53,979 --> 00:47:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop managers in Wisconsin are on salary as far as I can tell but if they're working 60 hours a week there should be some sort of provision because I believe that standard salary pay is on a 45 hour a week well in California it's 40 but I think that their old way that they did it is that 45 hours of pay each paycheck and if you're working 60 hours then no that doesn't apply

631
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure how it is in Wisconsin, I'm just a part-time worker, so I'm just glad when I get hours.

632
00:47:27,768 --> 00:47:33,313
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I guess that if you are working 60 hours, you should get some sort of compensation, because that's just insane.

633
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:38,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's keep it moving.

634
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:46,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, speaking of disappointments, PlayStation 3, not going to be playable at Lipzig.

635
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:55,436
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you German fans of the PlayStation 3 out there, sorry, basically Sony wants to save all their surprises for the Tokyo Game Show.

636
00:47:56,216 --> 00:48:01,141
[SPEAKER_01]: And no word if other developers are showing off any playable PlayStation 3 games.

637
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:08,355
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Sony decides that they are not going to show the unit, you can bet that a decent amount of the companies will follow suit.

638
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:09,996
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's this mean?

639
00:48:11,177 --> 00:48:19,724
[SPEAKER_01]: This means that they're going to have to pull out some serious leprechaun magic to get this thing to be impressive by the time Tokyo Game Show comes around.

640
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:20,745
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I've got to say.

641
00:48:21,866 --> 00:48:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know.

642
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too surprised that they're not having stuff playable because they don't need any more negative press.

643
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:58,595
[SPEAKER_04]: but I am surprised that they're not gonna well, who knows, maybe they will detail some more stuff about their online service and that kind of thing but no game sucks well, speaking of that particular little convention, there actually is an Ubisoft lineup that was posted if anybody cares about Ubisoft which I do, because I think Ubisoft is they do some happy

644
00:49:01,986 --> 00:49:05,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Messiah of Might and Magic will be out fall 2006.

645
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:10,729
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent.

646
00:49:11,669 --> 00:49:14,130
[SPEAKER_04]: It has single player, multiplayer mode on Xbox 360, PC, and...

647
00:49:19,571 --> 00:49:21,512
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Xbox 360, I'm sorry.

648
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:25,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Juarez, Western shooter, playable on PC, September 2006.

649
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,974
[SPEAKER_04]: The Settlers 2, The Next Generation.

650
00:49:28,994 --> 00:49:30,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of The Settlers 1, to be honest.

651
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:31,614
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on PC.

652
00:49:31,654 --> 00:49:32,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a strategy game.

653
00:49:32,915 --> 00:49:33,315
[SPEAKER_04]: No wonder.

654
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:37,696
[SPEAKER_04]: The Settlers, construction-based strategy game, playable on the DS.

655
00:49:38,456 --> 00:49:41,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Horses with a Z, riding adventure, playable on PC.

656
00:49:42,037 --> 00:49:45,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Open Season, action-adventure, playable on PlayStation 2.

657
00:49:47,103 --> 00:50:02,128
[SPEAKER_04]: and also there were members of the international development team available there who were giving some of the background into how games are created, speaking out on new projects, showing playable games.

658
00:50:03,649 --> 00:50:07,270
[SPEAKER_04]: They also had a playable of Dark Messiah available there.

659
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:09,331
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

660
00:50:11,078 --> 00:50:39,971
[SPEAKER_01]: some interesting things coming from Sony again talking about their online service for the PS3 well there's also an online service that's supposed to be coming to the PSP in the form of an iTunes like service to download movies and video and of course some music and stuff so anyways it's kind of interesting though right now they've got a total of 120 games coming out by the end of the year so

661
00:50:41,002 --> 00:50:42,123
[SPEAKER_01]: PSP, Gameplay Elements,

662
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:11,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So some games will support GPS.

663
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I think actually Hot Shots Golf, the new ones coming out, will support that.

664
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:19,314
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also talking about the camera add-on is going to have a microphone built in.

665
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:21,295
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be able to take still pictures and video.

666
00:51:22,156 --> 00:51:29,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And future iterations of the PSP are likely, but Sony is believing that the device will have a 10-year lifespan.

667
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,340
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all coming from Kotaku.

668
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:38,404
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had an interview that they did with John Kohler, the senior marketing manager for the PSP.

669
00:51:39,482 --> 00:51:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of interesting.

670
00:51:41,582 --> 00:51:50,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know when their download service for the games is coming out because if they're having trouble with the movies and the music, games is going to be another thing too.

671
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you really think this is going to take off?

672
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:53,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

673
00:51:58,525 --> 00:51:59,686
[SPEAKER_14]: But, Maisie?

674
00:52:00,726 --> 00:52:06,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I've got a vendetta against Sony and the PSP is one of the things I hate most about Sony.

675
00:52:06,567 --> 00:52:06,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

676
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:06,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

677
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:26,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, let's see, looking at it from, if you just look at it hypothetically, it's a great system, you know, it does all this stuff, but it seems like it almost does too much and everything is kind of half done, and it seems like all this other stuff is just overkill, and it's going to all be half done, just kind of like the movies and the music and the games.

678
00:52:26,731 --> 00:52:28,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick something and do it well?

679
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:36,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the business world has that saying that if you do one thing well, then you've succeeded, if you do three things halfway, then you've failed, and that's the PSP.

680
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:37,360
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

681
00:52:57,878 --> 00:53:03,381
[SPEAKER_01]: There really, to be honest, isn't a game that you gotta have for the PSP.

682
00:53:03,741 --> 00:53:07,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I play Grand Theft Auto religiously, and that's pretty much it.

683
00:53:07,403 --> 00:53:09,765
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my one game I buy each year.

684
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:11,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, but you know what?

685
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:17,028
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty sad, because I don't even play the DS that much, and I've bought more than one game for it this year.

686
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:20,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And I plan on buying a lot more coming soon.

687
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,153
[SPEAKER_01]: But there just isn't any games out there that come out that are really great.

688
00:53:25,293 --> 00:53:25,753
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just...

689
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,549
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I waste my money on this stuff?

690
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:29,790
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the other thing, too.

691
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,811
[SPEAKER_01]: The games are more expensive than the DS.

692
00:53:32,291 --> 00:53:39,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So, great that, you know, it's a more powerful system, but it's just, I don't know, they're not making good software for it.

693
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:44,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have to, though, give mad props to DJ Janai, the Wonderswan.

694
00:53:45,868 --> 00:53:47,749
[SPEAKER_04]: The Swan Kicks All Your Portable Asses

695
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:24,206
[SPEAKER_15]: The analogy I use a lot with the PSP when trying to explain to someone is it's like when you go to Thanksgiving dinner and you load up your plate with all sorts of stuff, like everything, way too much of anything, and then you sit down and you try to eat it and you just can't finish it.

696
00:54:24,406 --> 00:54:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get sick.

697
00:54:25,326 --> 00:54:26,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that too.

698
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,827
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's all just half done.

699
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:32,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the DS, you got a bunch of turkey and you can finish all your turkey and it's really good.

700
00:54:32,808 --> 00:54:34,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have a nice nap when you're done.

701
00:54:34,328 --> 00:54:35,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, then you fall asleep.

702
00:54:36,389 --> 00:54:36,729
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

703
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure we'll get some emails on that, so we look forward to reading those.

704
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:47,101
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime, we're going to shift gears here a little bit on Orange Lounge Radio.

705
00:54:47,121 --> 00:54:51,669
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do something we have not done in a long time, at least six months.

706
00:54:51,749 --> 00:54:52,470
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what, kids?

707
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:53,592
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a slow news week.

708
00:54:54,273 --> 00:55:06,937
[SPEAKER_14]: and all things considered, it's a pretty slow news week and it's time for us here on Orange Lounge Radio to bring back an old segment that we used to do back in the day when we did like a three hour live show and a podcast and all that stuff.

709
00:55:06,997 --> 00:55:07,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite.

710
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:08,037
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

711
00:55:08,537 --> 00:55:09,697
[SPEAKER_14]: So, are we ready?

712
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:11,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I think, Loki, are you filming this?

713
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:12,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Match Game

714
00:55:33,561 --> 00:55:35,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Video game match game to be specific.

00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:44,986
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't escape you.

722
00:55:45,006 --> 00:55:45,786
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you cannot.

723
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,427
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not in studio tonight.

724
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:48,167
[SPEAKER_14]: You're still there.

725
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:51,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I love GS68 in our chat room.

726
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,569
[SPEAKER_14]: What did GS68 in our chat room say?

727
00:55:52,689 --> 00:55:53,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Nissan Skype line.

728
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,891
[SPEAKER_14]: So, okay, no more calls on Skype, please.

729
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:57,611
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our contestant.

730
00:55:57,631 --> 00:55:59,052
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to play some match game tonight, Drew Nami?

731
00:55:59,588 --> 00:55:59,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

732
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:00,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, hell yeah.

733
00:56:01,389 --> 00:56:08,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, and you're going to be playing against somebody from our chatroom, and the person you're going to be playing against in our chatroom tonight is DMN.

734
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:16,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so DMN, we did a trivia contest in chat earlier, and DMN won, so it's you against DMN tonight.

735
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:18,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Sound good, Magus?

736
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:19,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.

737
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, you know how the match game works, right?

738
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:25,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, well let me explain it for those folks that don't know how Match Game works.

739
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:30,890
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going to happen is that we're going to read some sentences and they kind of have something to do with video games, but not really.

740
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:40,354
[SPEAKER_14]: And then our celebrities here in studio will fill in the blank and then you guys are going to try and guess what's in that blank.

741
00:56:41,414 --> 00:56:43,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And for every one that you guess, you get a point.

742
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:46,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And the person with the most points will win a fabulous prize.

743
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:51,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Tonight's prize is a space on our MySpace Top 8.

744
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:55,668
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so let's introduce tonight's celebrities.

[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're a celebrity.

00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:16,675

768
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:21,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.

769
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:45,297
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house.

770
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:50,521

00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:03,071
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

774
00:59:03,711 --> 00:59:05,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Our celebrities are thinking about their answers.

775
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:10,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting on our...

776
00:59:12,213 --> 00:59:14,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting on our chat room person to send me an answer there.

777
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:15,875
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our celebrity.

778
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:16,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Are our celebrities a ding-ding?

779
00:59:17,175 --> 00:59:17,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:18,896

[SPEAKER_14]: Megs, he's a ding.

786
00:59:22,057 --> 00:59:22,257
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

787
00:59:22,277 --> 00:59:25,519
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just waiting on our chat room, our chat person.

788
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:28,200
[SPEAKER_12]: In chat room, I am not looking at your answers.

789
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,421
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing this all by myself, okay?

790
00:59:30,461 --> 00:59:31,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're not looking at chat room answers?

791
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,422
[SPEAKER_12]: You're doing it all by yourself?

792
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:33,122
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a big boy now.

793
00:59:33,142 --> 00:59:33,382
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, there we go, we have an answer.

795
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:41,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so Magus, what is your answer?

796
00:59:41,156 --> 00:59:42,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me read the question one more time.

797
00:59:43,318 --> 00:59:45,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.

798
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:51,408
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house Nelly screaming, Matt, put down the blank so we can have whoopee.

799
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:52,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, what's your answer?

800
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Matt, put down the Rez Transvibrator.

801
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:59,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Rez Transvibrator, so we can have Whoopi.

802
00:59:59,212 --> 01:00:02,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and let's see what contestant number two in chat, DMN, said.

803
01:00:02,753 --> 01:00:06,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Said, Matt, put down the Wii, so we can have Whoopi.

804
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:07,455
[SPEAKER_14]: The Wii.

805
01:00:07,555 --> 01:00:08,755
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, DarkSakura.

806
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:10,056
[SPEAKER_14]: I said Transvibrator.

807
01:00:10,096 --> 01:00:13,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Transvibrator, 1.4 Magus.

808
01:00:13,537 --> 01:00:14,437
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.

809
01:00:14,717 --> 01:00:20,059
[SPEAKER_14]: And yes, we're writing it down in studio, and she does have that written down on her little piece of paper.

810
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:22,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I had that written down ten minutes ago.

811
01:00:40,382 --> 01:00:41,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Xbox 360 Control.

812
01:00:41,702 --> 01:00:42,563
[SPEAKER_14]: What a boring answer.

813
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:43,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up.

814
01:00:44,783 --> 01:00:50,545
[SPEAKER_14]: My answer was put down the Wii so we can make Whoopi.

815
01:00:50,705 --> 01:00:53,646
[SPEAKER_14]: So I matched with DMN so it's all tied up one to one.

816
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:54,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

817
01:00:55,086 --> 01:00:56,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Megzy, what did you put?

818
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Put down the... Corn.

819
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:58,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Corn?

820
01:01:01,448 --> 01:01:02,168
[SPEAKER_02]: The corn?

821
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:03,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to know.

822
01:01:03,648 --> 01:01:06,169
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only going to get that if you've seen Sensitive Pornograph.

823
01:01:06,309 --> 01:01:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

824
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Book of the Sexual Harassment.

825
01:01:10,086 --> 01:01:10,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Nerds!

826
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:12,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Nerds!

827
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:13,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

828
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:18,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris, Matt, put down the... Third hand.

829
01:01:18,768 --> 01:01:20,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Third hand.

830
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:21,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match.

831
01:01:21,209 --> 01:01:22,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know.

832
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's alright.

833
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,470
[SPEAKER_14]: You're still hot, so we'll give it to you.

834
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:30,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, but it doesn't help out our chatroom DMN, or it doesn't help out Magus any.

835
01:01:30,271 --> 01:01:33,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still 1-1, though, which is a higher score than usual for a match game.

836
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:33,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we go.

837
01:01:34,313 --> 01:01:35,473
[SPEAKER_14]: We're ready for question number two.

838
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:36,533
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready, Magus?

839
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:37,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it.

840
01:01:37,714 --> 01:01:39,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Any choice words for DMN?

841
01:01:40,956 --> 01:01:41,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're going down.

842
01:01:42,217 --> 01:01:43,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

843
01:01:43,757 --> 01:01:44,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number two.

844
01:01:46,158 --> 01:01:47,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops, no music yet.

845
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:52,981
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura is planning a road trip with her girlfriends very soon.

846
01:01:54,942 --> 01:02:03,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Luckily, they drive a magical car capable of playing any video game to entertain themselves on the trip there.

847
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:10,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Realizing this, DarkSakura says, Oh, I better make sure to bring a copy of blank.

848
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:30,182
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, our folks are thinking about their answers there.

849
01:02:31,082 --> 01:02:32,003
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our celebrities.

850
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, no cheating, no conferring over there.

851
01:02:34,803 --> 01:02:36,824
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're not, but we all think the same thing anyway.

852
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:38,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Which video game are they going to bring?

853
01:02:38,565 --> 01:02:40,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have an answer from chat.

854
01:02:40,705 --> 01:02:41,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm ding.

855
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:42,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

856
01:02:43,586 --> 01:02:44,626
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we got everybody.

857
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:46,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus.

858
01:02:47,659 --> 01:02:52,561
[SPEAKER_14]: We better make sure to bring a copy of... Kingdom Hearts for those Bishonen.

859
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts for the Bishonen.

860
01:02:55,382 --> 01:02:56,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting guess.

861
01:02:56,943 --> 01:03:01,865
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN says bring a copy of... LocoRoco!

862
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,005
[SPEAKER_03]: LocoRoco is close.

863
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:06,587
[SPEAKER_14]: If I had to be in the car with those girls, I'd be going LocoRoco as well.

864
01:03:10,128 --> 01:03:10,689
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in hell.

865
01:03:12,149 --> 01:03:13,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if there's a match.

866
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:13,750
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.

867
01:03:14,755 --> 01:03:15,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Animal Crossing!

868
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Animal Crossing!

869
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:19,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, all these girls love their Animal Crossing.

870
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:20,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match, though.

871
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:20,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki!

872
01:03:23,363 --> 01:03:25,384
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you guys laughing at?

873
01:03:25,565 --> 01:03:27,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, I guess... What?

874
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:30,169
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tell you later.

875
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:32,791
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the Animal Crossing a euphemism for now?

876
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:33,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tell you later.

877
01:03:33,832 --> 01:03:35,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Nook something dirty.

878
01:03:35,253 --> 01:03:36,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, look.

879
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:37,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Nookie.

880
01:03:37,595 --> 01:03:38,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Nookie.

881
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:39,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, look, what...

882
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:41,215
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your answer, Loki?

883
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:44,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my answer... I'm one question too late.

884
01:03:44,838 --> 01:03:48,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I said the Rez with the Rez Trans Vibrator.

885
01:03:49,082 --> 01:03:50,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Where were you, Loki?

886
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:51,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Where were you when I needed you?

887
01:03:51,985 --> 01:03:53,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match, not a match.

888
01:03:54,187 --> 01:03:55,689
[SPEAKER_14]: My answer is, of course...

889
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:57,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Girls are going to get together.

890
01:03:57,771 --> 01:04:02,033
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to play Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.

891
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:03,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match, though.

892
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:03,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match.

893
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Good answer from myself, but not a match.

894
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:05,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Sad to say.

895
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:07,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Megzi, what did you say?

896
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:08,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Animal Crossing.

897
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:10,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Animal Crossing.

898
01:04:10,255 --> 01:04:10,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris?

899
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:11,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Animal Crossing.

900
01:04:11,636 --> 01:04:12,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wow.

901
01:04:13,857 --> 01:04:18,598
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a... It's a massive... There are too many giggling girls on tonight's program.

902
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:20,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Way too many.

903
01:04:20,199 --> 01:04:20,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not in on it.

904
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:24,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember those emails we got back in the day about the giggling co-hosts.

905
01:04:25,459 --> 01:04:26,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is revenge.

906
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:29,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

907
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:30,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number three, boys and girls.

908
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:31,602
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready for question number three?

909
01:04:31,622 --> 01:04:32,723
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still tied up, one to one.

910
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here it is.

911
01:04:34,784 --> 01:04:36,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Question numero tres.

912
01:04:37,445 --> 01:04:40,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.

913
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:47,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.

914
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my answer.

915
01:04:51,372 --> 01:04:51,792
Dang it.

916
01:04:56,482 --> 01:04:58,323
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.

917
01:04:58,343 --> 01:05:02,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.

918
01:05:29,036 --> 01:05:29,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Still waiting.

919
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, there we go.

920
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:31,218
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an answer.

921
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:35,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so let's go over to Magus.

922
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:38,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob gets scared when playing games.

923
01:05:38,583 --> 01:05:42,746
[SPEAKER_14]: He has to remember when playing scary games to bring some... Clean underwear.

924
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Clean underwear.

925
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:46,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Clean underwear.

926
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:52,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and DMN says... Has to remember to bring some... Depends.

927
01:05:52,113 --> 01:05:52,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Depends.

928
01:05:53,274 --> 01:05:53,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Depends.

929
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:55,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

930
01:05:56,605 --> 01:05:57,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Oops, I cracked my pants.

931
01:05:57,626 --> 01:05:59,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, oops, I cracked my pants.

932
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:01,769
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's see if we get a match.

933
01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:03,370
[SPEAKER_14]: We have clean underwear and Depends.

934
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are different things.

935
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:07,373
[SPEAKER_14]: They are distinctly different because you don't poop in clean underwear, okay?

936
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:08,734
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can poop in Depends all you want.

937
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:10,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I said Depends adult diapers.

938
01:06:11,136 --> 01:06:11,697
[SPEAKER_14]: You did?

939
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:12,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I did.

940
01:06:12,337 --> 01:06:14,379
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that's a point for DMN.

941
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I specifically said Depends.

942
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,940
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, point for DMN.

943
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:17,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, oops, I cracked my pants.

944
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:18,562
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, here we go.

945
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what'd you say?

946
01:06:20,363 --> 01:06:21,384
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually said...

947
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:26,451
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, a baby bottle and a blanket.

948
01:06:26,491 --> 01:06:30,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Because only babies would be scared of Silent Hill yet, jackass.

949
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:33,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Ouch.

950
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:34,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Burn.

951
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:34,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Ouch, ouch.

952
01:06:34,964 --> 01:06:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are very cruel.

953
01:06:36,004 --> 01:06:36,324
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

954
01:06:36,665 --> 01:06:37,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's not a match.

955
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:44,090
[SPEAKER_14]: My answer was Rob better bring some Guinness because if I'm drinking, it's okay.

956
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:44,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Guinness.

957
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,171
[SPEAKER_14]: It calms me down.

958
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:47,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Guinness goes well with everything.

959
01:06:47,352 --> 01:06:50,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Meg Z, we're looking for Depends or Clean Underwear.

960
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:51,014
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you say?

961
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:52,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Pyramid Head Plushies.

962
01:06:52,555 --> 01:06:53,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Pyramid Head Plushies.

963
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:54,356
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cute.

964
01:06:54,436 --> 01:06:55,297
[SPEAKER_15]: I want one.

965
01:06:55,397 --> 01:06:55,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

966
01:06:55,837 --> 01:06:56,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Me too.

967
01:06:56,378 --> 01:06:57,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody should make one.

968
01:06:57,438 --> 01:06:57,999
[SPEAKER_14]: That's cute.

969
01:06:58,439 --> 01:06:59,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I like the way you think, Megzi.

970
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris, do we have another match?

971
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:01,983
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you say?

972
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:04,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring some... I said a blanket.

973
01:07:04,546 --> 01:07:05,507
[SPEAKER_14]: A blanket.

974
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I get really, really scared by those things.

975
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:13,876
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big pussy, too.

976
01:07:14,717 --> 01:07:18,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if I want the lesbian on the show to be talking about what a big...

977
01:07:21,736 --> 01:07:27,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go back to the scoreboard where DMN has two points and 23rd Magus has one point.

978
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,061
[SPEAKER_14]: So Magus, you're lagging behind.

979
01:07:30,081 --> 01:07:31,401
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got two more questions to catch up.

980
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:31,742
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready?

981
01:07:32,922 --> 01:07:33,142
Sure.

982
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

983
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:35,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Here comes question number four.

984
01:07:35,824 --> 01:07:36,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number four.

985
01:07:38,123 --> 01:07:42,526
[SPEAKER_14]: And I apologize for this after the earlier rant, but these match game questions were written in advance.

986
01:07:43,006 --> 01:07:47,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently, yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.

987
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:56,736
[SPEAKER_14]: What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled, he said about Adam Sessler, Man, does that guy need blank!

988
01:08:01,299 --> 01:08:05,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack Thompson said about Adam Sessler after that interview, Man, that guy needs blank!

989
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, Chris already ding.

990
01:08:14,042 --> 01:08:15,783
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm ding as well if I didn't already say.

991
01:08:18,624 --> 01:08:18,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

992
01:08:19,624 --> 01:08:20,004
[SPEAKER_14]: You got it?

993
01:08:20,445 --> 01:08:20,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

994
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:24,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're just waiting on DMN there in chat.

995
01:08:24,526 --> 01:08:25,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, do you have an answer?

996
01:08:25,426 --> 01:08:26,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you ready to go?

997
01:08:27,327 --> 01:08:28,127
[SPEAKER_14]: More cowbell.

998
01:08:28,487 --> 01:08:29,248
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

999
01:08:29,308 --> 01:08:30,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't give your answer yet.

1000
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:30,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1001
01:08:31,328 --> 01:08:31,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Eh, it's not my answer.

1002
01:08:31,848 --> 01:08:32,689
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

1003
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:34,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, I'll get another one.

1004
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll pull another one on my ass.

1005
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:39,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to know about your ass.

1006
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:40,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure you do.

1007
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, okay, here it is.

1008
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:43,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

1009
01:08:44,114 --> 01:08:44,874
[SPEAKER_14]: We got our answer.

1010
01:08:46,615 --> 01:08:46,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1011
01:08:48,076 --> 01:08:51,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.

1012
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:58,962
[SPEAKER_14]: What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled, he said about Adam Sessler, man, does that guy need what, Magus?

1013
01:09:00,423 --> 01:09:00,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Yowie.

1014
01:09:01,343 --> 01:09:01,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Yowie!

1015
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:06,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, Chris and Maisie gasped at that answer.

1016
01:09:07,348 --> 01:09:09,850
[SPEAKER_14]: That might be a bad sign, though, because that usually means they didn't think of it.

1017
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:16,154
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN says, that guy needs to get laid, says DMN.

1018
01:09:16,174 --> 01:09:17,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if there's any matches here in studio.

1019
01:09:18,055 --> 01:09:19,255
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what was your answer?

1020
01:09:19,916 --> 01:09:20,816
[SPEAKER_14]: A good ass hammering.

1021
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:22,257
[SPEAKER_14]: A good ass hammering.

1022
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:24,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a match with to get laid?

1023
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's a match with to get laid.

1024
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:27,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Both.

1025
01:09:27,981 --> 01:09:34,363
[SPEAKER_04]: But we think it's... No, actually, honestly, it's a half point on the Yowie side because he would be the recipient instead of watching it.

1026
01:09:34,423 --> 01:09:35,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's give a half point to each.

1027
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:37,444
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll give a half point to each.

1028
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:38,084
[SPEAKER_14]: How's that sound?

1029
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:40,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you just not give a point to either one?

1030
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:41,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, let's do that.

1031
01:09:41,305 --> 01:09:42,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, that is actually getting laid.

1032
01:09:45,049 --> 01:09:48,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That is technically getting laid.

1033
01:09:48,834 --> 01:09:50,115
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to give it to DMN.

1034
01:09:50,175 --> 01:09:51,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Magus, but we'll give you a half point.

1035
01:09:51,697 --> 01:09:53,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless they've got a mirror up or something.

1036
01:09:53,419 --> 01:09:54,680
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't specify.

1037
01:09:54,841 --> 01:09:56,122
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the ruling of the judges.

1038
01:09:56,182 --> 01:09:56,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So be it.

1039
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:58,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1040
01:09:58,885 --> 01:10:01,208
[SPEAKER_14]: He needs to get shot in the face because...

1041
01:10:02,688 --> 01:10:04,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, shot in the face.

1042
01:10:04,389 --> 01:10:05,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't hold back, Loki.

1043
01:10:05,309 --> 01:10:10,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's because, you know, Jack Thompson says all gamers need... Oh, okay, okay, good.

1044
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:11,592
[SPEAKER_14]: That'd be irony right there.

1045
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:12,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Good justification.

1046
01:10:12,732 --> 01:10:14,873
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, not a match, though.

1047
01:10:15,293 --> 01:10:20,756
[SPEAKER_14]: My answer was, man, does Adam Sessler need personality, was my answer.

1048
01:10:20,936 --> 01:10:21,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Personality.

1049
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, not a match.

1050
01:10:27,697 --> 01:10:29,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, enough Pyramid Head plushie talk, please.

1051
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:34,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Meg Z, Adam Sessler, man, does he need... To sit on a tack.

1052
01:10:34,402 --> 01:10:35,663
[SPEAKER_14]: To sit on a tack.

1053
01:10:36,644 --> 01:10:37,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that count with getting laid?

1054
01:10:37,985 --> 01:10:38,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1055
01:10:38,926 --> 01:10:40,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it does at this point.

1056
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:42,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that count as yowie?

1057
01:10:43,209 --> 01:10:45,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it would count if it was sex with Kevin Pereira.

1058
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:46,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Ba-dum-bum.

1059
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:47,333
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1060
01:10:48,554 --> 01:10:49,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Kevin.

1061
01:10:49,554 --> 01:10:50,095
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mean it.

1062
01:10:51,109 --> 01:10:51,809
[SPEAKER_14]: You're still cute.

1063
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:53,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Chris.

1064
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:58,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually said butt sex, which is... Butt sex would count to get laid.

1065
01:10:58,951 --> 01:11:00,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on, come on.

1066
01:11:00,211 --> 01:11:01,231
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be yaoi.

1067
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:01,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

1068
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of yaoi.

1069
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:04,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay.

1070
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:06,833
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll give 23rd Magus another half point.

1071
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:08,813
[SPEAKER_14]: So Magus has two points.

1072
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:09,813
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't involve a paddle, does it?

1073
01:11:10,093 --> 01:11:12,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus has two points and DMN has four.

1074
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:15,205
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN is on it tonight.

1075
01:11:15,325 --> 01:11:16,485
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN is on it tonight.

1076
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:19,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise butt sex coming from DJ tonight.

1077
01:11:19,986 --> 01:11:21,987
[SPEAKER_14]: You have one more chance, Magus.

1078
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:22,367
[SPEAKER_14]: You ready?

1079
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:23,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it.

1080
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:24,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is, the last question.

1081
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:30,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?

1082
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:37,011
[SPEAKER_14]: When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, Oh, that last compartment.

1083
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:38,912
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where you can store the blank.

1084
01:11:49,926 --> 01:11:50,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Celebrities are thinking.

1085
01:11:51,588 --> 01:11:51,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Ding.

1086
01:11:52,589 --> 01:11:52,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh.

1087
01:11:53,830 --> 01:12:01,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Jinx.

1088
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:02,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, was that a ding?

1089
01:12:02,698 --> 01:12:02,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding.

1090
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:03,880
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, you dinged.

1091
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:06,822
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm just waiting on our chatroom player there.

1092
01:12:10,066 --> 01:12:11,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, don't give us your answer, but do you have one?

1093
01:12:12,388 --> 01:12:12,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1094
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,470
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to get two points with it because that's what you need.

1095
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:16,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, can I?

1096
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:20,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, don't get smart with me, asshole, or you're going to lose this game.

1097
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, someone has to be smarter around here.

1098
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, but I'm bummed.

1099
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:25,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny, funny guy.

1100
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:29,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather be smart in my little head than in my ass.

1101
01:12:29,243 --> 01:12:30,904
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a... Alright.

1102
01:12:32,324 --> 01:12:34,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, that's... Okay, here we go.

1103
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:35,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

1104
01:12:35,465 --> 01:12:36,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Fifth question.

1105
01:12:37,666 --> 01:12:40,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?

1106
01:12:40,327 --> 01:12:44,769
[SPEAKER_14]: When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, oh, that last compartment, that's where you can store the...

1107
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:48,346
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, what did you say?

1108
01:12:48,426 --> 01:12:48,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Lube

1109
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:10,702
[SPEAKER_14]: You need some lube for your Wii, apparently.

1110
01:13:10,722 --> 01:13:12,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe with a special cock attachment.

1111
01:13:13,303 --> 01:13:16,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what you got planned for your Wii, DarkSakura.

1112
01:13:16,285 --> 01:13:17,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Loki.

1113
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would a match game be without this answer?

1114
01:13:21,468 --> 01:13:24,410
[SPEAKER_01]: That last compartment is the store of the Iraqi suicide babies.

1115
01:13:26,883 --> 01:13:28,524
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in on that joke when it started

1116
01:13:45,441 --> 01:13:46,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1117
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:51,003
[SPEAKER_14]: My answer was, that's where you can store the weed.

1118
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:52,783
[SPEAKER_14]: You put your weed in there.

1119
01:13:53,284 --> 01:13:54,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, the SNL.

1120
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:55,865
[SPEAKER_14]: You put your weed in there.

1121
01:13:55,885 --> 01:13:56,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

1122
01:13:56,025 --> 01:13:57,685
[SPEAKER_09]: That actually was my first answer, and I changed it.

1123
01:13:58,065 --> 01:13:59,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, get it?

1124
01:13:59,546 --> 01:13:59,806
Weed.

1125
01:13:59,906 --> 01:14:01,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha, ha, ha.

1126
01:14:01,406 --> 01:14:01,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Fired.

1127
01:14:02,547 --> 01:14:02,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Magazine.

1128
01:14:03,487 --> 01:14:04,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Lesbian porn.

1129
01:14:04,467 --> 01:14:05,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Lesbian porn.

1130
01:14:05,648 --> 01:14:06,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a match.

1131
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:06,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris.

1132
01:14:08,029 --> 01:14:08,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs.

1133
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:09,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Drugs.

1134
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:14,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, no points scored there, so let's look at the scoreboard and tally it up.

1135
01:14:16,633 --> 01:14:23,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, you have two points, which is very good for Orange Lounge Radio Match Game to even get on the damn scoreboard.

1136
01:14:23,596 --> 01:14:25,017
[SPEAKER_14]: So you should be very proud of your effort.

1137
01:14:25,037 --> 01:14:30,760
[SPEAKER_14]: But unfortunately, DMN kicked your butt by scoring four points.

1138
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,820
[SPEAKER_14]: He broke the record.

1139
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he broke the record.

1140
01:14:32,761 --> 01:14:34,022
[SPEAKER_04]: The record was two and a half.

1141
01:14:34,442 --> 01:14:34,762
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1142
01:14:35,062 --> 01:14:36,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations, DMN.

1143
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,404
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a winner and you get a space in our top eight on MySpace.

1144
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:42,306
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to bump Freeze Pop for you because they have like 11 billion friends.

1145
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:42,946
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't need any more.

1146
01:14:44,087 --> 01:14:49,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, you get a clump of dirt as a runner-up prize, and we'll give that to you at the next show, okay?

1147
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,850
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll dust it in your backyard.

1148
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:53,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, fine.

1149
01:14:53,092 --> 01:14:54,472
[SPEAKER_12]: No special gifts for you guys.

1150
01:14:54,732 --> 01:14:55,093
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1151
01:14:55,613 --> 01:14:57,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Magus, anything you want to say while we have you on the line?

1152
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's on, DMN.

1153
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:02,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Another time, another place, it's on.

1154
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:04,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you have fun on tonight's program?

1155
01:15:04,578 --> 01:15:06,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah, even though I did get served.

1156
01:15:06,219 --> 01:15:07,499
[SPEAKER_14]: You did get served, I'm sorry to say.

1157
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:09,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, have fun and enjoy the dirt.

1158
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:11,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, dirt is good.

1159
01:15:12,461 --> 01:15:12,762
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1160
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear it's a growing investment.

1161
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:15,887
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gay dirt.

1162
01:15:16,248 --> 01:15:16,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Gay dirt.

1163
01:15:16,668 --> 01:15:18,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's gay dirt because we all touched it.

1164
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:19,253
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1165
01:15:19,293 --> 01:15:19,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1166
01:15:20,555 --> 01:15:20,835
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1167
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:25,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And he gets a good old-fashioned orange lounge hanging up on at the end there for playing there.

1168
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1169
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,945
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN is going to earn a space in our top eight.

1170
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,066
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you guys think?

1171
01:15:30,346 --> 01:15:36,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm curious because we haven't done the game in a long time and our podcast audience hasn't really gotten to see the game, so I'm curious.

1172
01:15:36,771 --> 01:15:38,373
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you guys think of the game?

1173
01:15:38,693 --> 01:15:39,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Was that fun?

1174
01:15:39,554 --> 01:15:40,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it stupid?

1175
01:15:40,354 --> 01:15:41,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it a waste of your time?

1176
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:43,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Give us feedback in chat and in mailbag.

1177
01:15:43,517 --> 01:15:44,958
[SPEAKER_14]: That's old school OLR for you.

1178
01:15:44,998 --> 01:15:46,440
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a fun, stupid waste of time.

1179
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:46,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1180
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:53,976
[SPEAKER_14]: but anyway, we do still have a little more gaming news before we finish up the show and of course we're going to open up the skype line very soon for your general calls Loki!

1181
01:15:54,636 --> 01:16:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, speaking of games anyways, we've got to talk about Sony again why?

1182
01:16:00,521 --> 01:16:16,254
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have to and we've got to talk about the PSP and we've got to talk about firmware updates because with PSP's firmware 2.8 there are some more problems not only is it Sony's latest attempt to stop homebrew

1183
01:16:16,974 --> 01:16:17,815
[SPEAKER_01]: On the PSP.

1184
01:16:18,676 --> 01:16:19,256
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?

1185
01:16:19,436 --> 01:16:21,658
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not be able to browse certain websites.

1186
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:38,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now, the brand new web browser not only allows a developer to use the site to obtain specific information on how you got to their website, more importantly, they can check what firmware you have and deny you access based on that.

1187
01:16:39,653 --> 01:16:42,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a suggestion for the homebrew websites then.

1188
01:16:43,336 --> 01:16:45,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a keyword on your site that says porcupine.

1189
01:16:45,959 --> 01:16:50,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever anyone puts in Porcupine, it brings up Homebrew Games.

1190
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:54,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And all the information on Porcupine she ever wanted to know.

1191
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:58,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Put in Porcupine in video game, and there you go.

1192
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:04,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, I mean, I assume that this is only for, like...

1193
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:08,141
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, manufacturer websites or something like that.

1194
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:12,563
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, stuff that's pertaining to games, you know, official sites and that kind of thing.

1195
01:17:12,983 --> 01:17:16,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not going to be if you're running, you know, Flash games or something like that.

1196
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:17,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not going to run into a problem with this.

1197
01:17:18,306 --> 01:17:20,406
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, I mean, come on.

1198
01:17:20,787 --> 01:17:23,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what more do they really need to do to block stuff?

1199
01:17:23,968 --> 01:17:25,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the web browser sucks as it is.

1200
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:30,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we really need, you know, to deny people more browsing on there?

1201
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:30,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1202
01:17:32,174 --> 01:17:36,797
[SPEAKER_01]: More than likely, anyways, we wouldn't be able to pull up the page you're trying to block anyway, so whatever.

1203
01:17:38,818 --> 01:17:39,238
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1204
01:17:39,878 --> 01:17:41,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I have one more story there.

1205
01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:44,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you going to upgrade, Loki, or screw it?

1206
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got two, so yeah, I can.

1207
01:17:46,822 --> 01:17:47,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1208
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:55,086
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we've got one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for general feedback, so you can start hammering away there.

1209
01:17:55,166 --> 01:17:58,088
[SPEAKER_14]: The username is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can always call us on the landline,

1210
01:17:58,422 --> 01:18:02,425
[SPEAKER_14]: 916-226-9067 But please keep in mind, that's a toll call.

1211
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:03,446
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an 800 call.

1212
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:11,292
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're not paying the bill, Mom is going to get very angry with you, says Meg Z. Like last night.

1213
01:18:13,594 --> 01:18:15,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1214
01:18:16,196 --> 01:18:19,959
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to do a story real quick here on Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

1215
01:18:20,059 --> 01:18:21,540
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some new details.

1216
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:25,984
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, our in-house lesbians would love to hear some more details on Dead or Alive Extreme 2, right?

1217
01:18:26,864 --> 01:18:27,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yes.

1218
01:18:29,803 --> 01:18:37,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds like it will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show, and Japan's Famitsu Magazine got a quick look at the game, and of course, you know, the trailer's online.

1219
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:41,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Excluding Beach Volleyball, the game engine is mostly complete.

1220
01:18:41,652 --> 01:18:51,159
[SPEAKER_14]: For Beach Volleyball, we had the previous title, so we left it until the end, but since we're at last finishing up the other areas, we're at the point where it's about time we start making the new Beach Volleyball, and that comes from...

1221
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:52,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Itagaki Itagaki

1222
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:09,685
[SPEAKER_14]: JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis

1223
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:43,153
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now, you're also talking to two lesbians who happen to be in graphic arts and are taking art classes.

1224
01:19:43,473 --> 01:19:44,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Artsy lesbians.

1225
01:19:45,874 --> 01:19:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the colors and the skin tones, that's pretty... Yeah, I got a bone.

1226
01:19:51,736 --> 01:19:52,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1227
01:19:54,217 --> 01:19:58,439
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what they have to say.

1228
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:02,241
[SPEAKER_14]: So we love interacting with our listeners, and we're going to take some phone calls right now.

1229
01:20:02,321 --> 01:20:03,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1230
01:20:03,622 --> 01:20:04,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1231
01:20:04,922 --> 01:20:05,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, can you hear me?

1232
01:20:05,963 --> 01:20:06,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, who is this?

1233
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,701
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Nintendo Maniac 64.

1234
01:20:09,141 --> 01:20:09,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Haven't called in a while.

1235
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:11,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.

1236
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:12,142
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1237
01:20:12,942 --> 01:20:14,083
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple things.

1238
01:20:14,803 --> 01:20:18,465
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, Megzie seems to actually have a lot of similar interests to me.

1239
01:20:18,485 --> 01:20:22,006
[SPEAKER_06]: She likes Nintendo games, and her opinion on Sony is pretty much the same as mine.

1240
01:20:22,206 --> 01:20:23,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony, die.

1241
01:20:23,947 --> 01:20:25,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So a Nintendo Maniac agrees with you.

1242
01:20:25,848 --> 01:20:27,569
[SPEAKER_14]: It loves the Nintendo, and Sony can go die.

1243
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:28,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Sony can suck my dick.

1244
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:32,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you just trying to get points with the lesbians?

1245
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,950
[SPEAKER_14]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

1246
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I've been dying to ask you this.

1247
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:45,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Please don't hang up on me.

1248
01:20:46,297 --> 01:20:48,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, guy, what do you think about straight sex?

1249
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:56,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Try a joke that's not like 30 years old on this program.

1250
01:20:56,965 --> 01:20:58,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not gonna hang up on you, but seriously.

1251
01:20:59,207 --> 01:21:00,348
[SPEAKER_14]: We have plenty of new jokes.

1252
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:01,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to tonight's match game.

1253
01:21:01,969 --> 01:21:02,670
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot there.

1254
01:21:03,851 --> 01:21:10,755
[SPEAKER_14]: For those that have no idea what we're talking about, you've got to go back to, like, an old To Go episode back when we were doing the podcast separately.

1255
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:12,196
[SPEAKER_14]: When Guitar Hero first came out.

1256
01:21:12,496 --> 01:21:13,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Firebomba says, fail, get.

1257
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:18,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Chat room is booing you, so you better say something thoughtful right now to make up.

1258
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Thoughtful, thoughtful.

1259
01:21:22,402 --> 01:21:26,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Who needs TV when you have YouTube?

1260
01:21:26,804 --> 01:21:27,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Indeed.

1261
01:21:27,104 --> 01:21:30,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any gaming-related clips on YouTube that you want to point out?

1262
01:21:30,506 --> 01:21:31,227
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I just thought of that.

1263
01:21:32,717 --> 01:21:33,017
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1264
01:21:33,938 --> 01:21:36,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to let you go, Nintendo Maniac 64, but thanks for the call.

1265
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:37,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1266
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,020
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1267
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:39,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Good job failing.

1268
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:41,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Boom, failed.

1269
01:21:45,324 --> 01:21:49,606
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a nice kid, but seriously, leave the inside jokes.

1270
01:21:49,687 --> 01:21:51,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, it's Raven's Dolphin.

1271
01:21:51,027 --> 01:21:52,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1272
01:21:52,068 --> 01:21:53,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I hadn't even said hello yet, but hi, how you doing?

1273
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:55,070
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind?

1274
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:55,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm...

1275
01:21:56,556 --> 01:21:57,456
[SPEAKER_05]: More lesbians.

1276
01:21:59,737 --> 01:22:00,078
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

1277
01:22:00,098 --> 01:22:03,039
[SPEAKER_14]: The lesbian gamers can have their own podcast as far as I'm concerned.

1278
01:22:03,059 --> 01:22:04,680
[SPEAKER_05]: This reminds me of an episode of Raw.

1279
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:11,583
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to bring up wrestling, but it just reminds me of hot lesbian action, just kissing and all kinds of craziness.

1280
01:22:11,623 --> 01:22:14,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, I want this on the record.

1281
01:22:14,264 --> 01:22:24,789
[SPEAKER_14]: We're making the lesbian thing kind of a joke tonight because if we did really have a hot lesbian podcast, people would be like, oh my god, I've got a boner, da-da-da-da.

1282
01:22:25,134 --> 01:22:25,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Make out!

1283
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:25,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Make out!

1284
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:57,435
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, seriously, do you have anything gaming related you want to share?

1285
01:22:58,595 --> 01:23:02,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they were talking about the PSP being like a big paperweight.

1286
01:23:02,616 --> 01:23:03,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, what do you think?

1287
01:23:04,256 --> 01:23:04,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I think different.

1288
01:23:05,316 --> 01:23:06,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I love my PSP.

1289
01:23:06,697 --> 01:23:07,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you love your PSP?

1290
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:14,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't own an iPod, and the Apple Store didn't open up yet, so I'm still stuck with it for a while.

1291
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:16,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like Chris is all, where do you live?

1292
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I live in New Jersey.

1293
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,020
[SPEAKER_05]: They just don't understand.

1294
01:23:22,261 --> 01:23:23,841
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no Apple Store in New Jersey?

1295
01:23:24,574 --> 01:23:32,677
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, but it's like two hours away, and they're opening one on the boardwalk where I live, so it's like heaven, finally.

1296
01:23:33,197 --> 01:23:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1297
01:23:34,478 --> 01:23:40,160
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but you're not using, it sounds like you don't really use your PSP as a gaming device, you use it as an MP3 player, primarily.

1298
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I use it for everything, mostly.

1299
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:44,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, interesting, okay.

1300
01:23:45,002 --> 01:23:48,843
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to kind of try to redeem myself about my comments about Sony.

1301
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:53,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get me wrong, I hate them, but the PSP, it's

1302
01:23:54,263 --> 01:24:10,531
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a good system if you're looking for it to do all that stuff but you're straight up games if I'm going to drop $250 on a gaming system I want it to play games are you going to buy Star Fox Command for the DS?

1303
01:24:11,952 --> 01:24:13,953
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe are you a Star Fox fan?

1304
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:15,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Not so much.

1305
01:24:16,562 --> 01:24:16,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1306
01:24:18,564 --> 01:24:20,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to get my hands on that thing.

1307
01:24:20,765 --> 01:24:21,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

1308
01:24:21,305 --> 01:24:23,727
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have a little love for DS and PSP then?

1309
01:24:24,447 --> 01:24:24,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.

1310
01:24:24,948 --> 01:24:28,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I own two DSs and I own two PSPs.

1311
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:29,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're just a hardcore nerd.

1312
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:32,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1313
01:24:32,685 --> 01:24:33,186
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1314
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:34,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1315
01:24:34,526 --> 01:24:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I like you.

1316
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:35,446
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1317
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:36,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1318
01:24:36,807 --> 01:24:37,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1319
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:37,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1320
01:24:37,747 --> 01:24:38,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1321
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:38,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1322
01:24:38,507 --> 01:24:38,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I like you.

1323
01:24:59,906 --> 01:25:02,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, TV's dead and YouTube is for porn.

1324
01:25:03,567 --> 01:25:05,768
[SPEAKER_14]: YouTube is for great stuff.

1325
01:25:06,428 --> 01:25:07,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good night, Raven's Dolphin.

1326
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:08,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1327
01:25:08,328 --> 01:25:09,128
[SPEAKER_14]: You too, bye.

1328
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:13,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze is coming up with a witty retort there about me bashing on nerds.

1329
01:25:13,970 --> 01:25:17,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Blaze, Sky, again, you are hosting a podcast about gaming.

1330
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:19,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point, good point.

1331
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:21,772
[SPEAKER_14]: I am pretty hardcore to my nerdom.

1332
01:25:22,032 --> 01:25:23,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Zones Radio, who's this?

1333
01:25:23,732 --> 01:25:25,032
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Black Boy, James.

1334
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:26,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Black Boy, James.

1335
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:27,313
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind?

1336
01:25:28,486 --> 01:25:30,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a question about the PSP.

1337
01:25:31,409 --> 01:25:32,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, what do you want to know?

1338
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:41,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Because with their firmware updates, they include something else, like something to enhance the functionality of the PSP, and I was just curious, was there anything like that with this update?

1339
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:44,542
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're my man for the PSP updates.

1340
01:25:44,582 --> 01:25:45,063
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

1341
01:25:45,824 --> 01:25:48,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, 2.8 was video podcast, RSS.

1342
01:25:48,827 --> 01:25:49,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, this is that one.

1343
01:25:51,263 --> 01:25:55,784
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can watch the one-up show on your PSP, yippity-yay, hooray.

1344
01:25:57,025 --> 01:26:02,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Or you can watch Hope is Emo, which is a great vodcast.

1345
01:26:02,486 --> 01:26:05,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Upgrade your PSP so you can watch Hope is Emo.

1346
01:26:05,067 --> 01:26:07,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, maybe I'll do that.

1347
01:26:08,548 --> 01:26:11,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Or maybe me and Gregor will go find a pizza box to live in.

1348
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:16,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so does that sound worth it to you, Black Boy?

1349
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:17,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Not really.

1350
01:26:18,828 --> 01:26:19,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think so.

1351
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:22,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Just use iTunes for your vodcasting needs.

1352
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seriously.

1353
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:25,632
[SPEAKER_14]: I use my iPod for my podcasts.

1354
01:26:26,072 --> 01:26:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you're fancy enough to own a color video iPod.

1355
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:30,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm too broke, unfortunately.

1356
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:31,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the old school one.

1357
01:26:31,976 --> 01:26:33,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I have an old school iPod.

1358
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:36,718
[SPEAKER_14]: It was my Christmas gift to myself.

1359
01:26:36,919 --> 01:26:37,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I have Kristen's.

1360
01:26:37,819 --> 01:26:38,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1361
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I do actually.

1362
01:26:40,801 --> 01:26:48,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to say to your guests tonight that they get major love and win for being lesbians and not frightening me.

1363
01:26:49,409 --> 01:26:52,072
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't mind me saying you're a gay gamer, correct?

1364
01:26:52,272 --> 01:26:52,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I am.

1365
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:56,936
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that because you're on All Games Interactive all the time and they pick on you so horribly for that.

1366
01:26:57,477 --> 01:26:58,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So sorry.

1367
01:26:58,578 --> 01:27:02,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Every time I listen to frickin' Ron, I cringe.

1368
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:02,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway...

1369
01:27:03,482 --> 01:27:06,363
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I love Ran, but seriously, he needs to stop the gay jokes.

1370
01:27:06,644 --> 01:27:07,384
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, we all do.

1371
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to come back to Arena and have more Ran love.

1372
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:13,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Not like that!

1373
01:27:13,347 --> 01:27:13,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Not like that!

1374
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd pay money for that.

1375
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:20,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you loving our friend Black Boy here?

1376
01:27:20,272 --> 01:27:20,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1377
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:26,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, most of the extreme lesbian jokes that we've been doing have been just that.

1378
01:27:26,534 --> 01:27:27,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Just jokes.

1379
01:27:28,054 --> 01:27:29,815
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fully clothed.

1380
01:27:30,275 --> 01:27:31,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's disappointing.

1381
01:27:32,196 --> 01:27:32,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are cuddling.

1382
01:27:33,396 --> 01:27:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like you.

1383
01:27:33,976 --> 01:27:36,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1384
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:38,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I like you too.

1385
01:27:41,863 --> 01:27:42,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1386
01:27:42,303 --> 01:27:42,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1387
01:27:43,123 --> 01:27:43,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1388
01:28:08,686 --> 01:28:10,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go to one more call here on the Skype line.

1389
01:28:11,169 --> 01:28:12,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1390
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:12,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1391
01:28:13,531 --> 01:28:14,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, this is DMN.

1392
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:18,076
[SPEAKER_14]: DMN, congratulations on your match game win earlier this evening.

1393
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, apparently 23rd Magus wants my neck now.

1394
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, he'll get over it.

1395
01:28:23,221 --> 01:28:24,743
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to say tonight?

1396
01:28:26,255 --> 01:28:29,098
[SPEAKER_14]: I am bitching about World of Warcraft.

1397
01:28:29,498 --> 01:28:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1398
01:28:30,058 --> 01:28:31,800
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not a big fan of this new news?

1399
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:50,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've never been a fan of World of Warcraft, mainly more so because I've got a roommate who's very hardcore into it, and I don't understand why it takes them almost two years to release an update to the damn game when, you know, pretty much everybody and their mom's at the highest level.

1400
01:28:51,055 --> 01:28:53,838
[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft, though, it patches all the frickin' time.

1401
01:28:54,761 --> 01:28:56,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but there's a difference between a patch and an expansion.

1402
01:28:57,062 --> 01:29:00,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, patches just adjust certain things and piss certain people off.

1403
01:29:00,924 --> 01:29:03,386
[SPEAKER_08]: You have an expansion, it's a whole new way of opening things up.

1404
01:29:03,466 --> 01:29:05,387
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just do a patch, it's the same map.

1405
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:06,887
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing new.

1406
01:29:07,127 --> 01:29:09,949
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're not changing anything with this, DMN.

1407
01:29:10,189 --> 01:29:13,791
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, they're adding new stuff that's going to have a slightly different spin to it.

1408
01:29:15,162 --> 01:29:18,584
[SPEAKER_08]: True, but I don't see anything about it.

1409
01:29:18,624 --> 01:29:21,265
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying, oh, you can go up to level, what, 70 now?

1410
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:23,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I don't care.

1411
01:29:23,166 --> 01:29:23,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 10 more levels.

1412
01:29:24,266 --> 01:29:29,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Drew Nami in our chatroom, your good pal after tonight's match game battle, says, WoW doesn't end at 60.

1413
01:29:30,409 --> 01:29:31,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Patches add content.

1414
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1415
01:29:34,311 --> 01:29:36,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, like I said, I don't play it, so I don't know.

1416
01:29:37,012 --> 01:29:38,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know the basics.

1417
01:29:38,313 --> 01:29:39,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I know 60's the highest.

1418
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:40,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah.

1419
01:29:40,614 --> 01:29:41,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any MMO you do enjoy?

1420
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Gunbound, but that's not really an MMO anymore.

1421
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:50,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, I'm not a huge fan of MMOs.

1422
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:57,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm intrigued by the, I guess, the society within them, but not a fan of playing them, no.

1423
01:29:58,882 --> 01:30:00,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1424
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:07,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born in Wisconsin, so to hear somebody else from Wisconsin on the show tonight was pretty freaking awesome.

1425
01:30:07,384 --> 01:30:08,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay, Wisconsin!

1426
01:30:08,464 --> 01:30:09,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Only not so much.

1427
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring me some cheese next time.

1428
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:12,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I will.

1429
01:30:14,257 --> 01:30:15,617
[SPEAKER_08]: DM out.

1430
01:30:15,637 --> 01:30:18,378
[SPEAKER_15]: I brought Chris and Jamie cheese.

1431
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:24,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm offering to give you something from the Nintendo store because I work there and stuff.

1432
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:27,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's supposed to give me that info.

1433
01:30:27,703 --> 01:30:33,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I told you earlier that we need your address to... Look at all the straight boys trying to get points of the lesbians tonight.

1434
01:30:35,146 --> 01:30:37,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not trying to hit points.

1435
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:38,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just being a nice guy.

1436
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:38,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1437
01:30:38,509 --> 01:30:39,630
[SPEAKER_14]: You are a nice guy, DMN.

1438
01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:41,451
[SPEAKER_14]: We appreciate you calling in as always, okay?

1439
01:30:42,072 --> 01:30:42,392
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1440
01:30:42,432 --> 01:30:43,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care, guys.

1441
01:30:43,032 --> 01:30:43,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one, buddy.

1442
01:30:43,773 --> 01:30:43,933
Bye.

1443
01:30:44,233 --> 01:30:44,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

1444
01:30:44,414 --> 01:30:45,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye-bye.

1445
01:30:46,215 --> 01:30:48,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, thank you guys so much for the calls tonight on Skype.

1446
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:49,998
[SPEAKER_14]: That was fun, and that's what it's all about.

1447
01:30:50,058 --> 01:30:53,381
[SPEAKER_14]: So even though a few guys listening on the Internet are about to write us, they hate me.

1448
01:30:54,028 --> 01:30:59,431
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys don't talk about video games enough, and you let your callers call in and talk about lesbians and yaoi.

1449
01:30:59,451 --> 01:31:01,632
[SPEAKER_10]: What is wrong with you people at Orange Lands Radio?

1450
01:31:01,672 --> 01:31:02,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

1451
01:31:02,553 --> 01:31:03,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you, Sky.

1452
01:31:03,813 --> 01:31:04,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you, Rob Roberts.

1453
01:31:04,894 --> 01:31:05,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you die in a fire.

1454
01:31:07,515 --> 01:31:08,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you know what?

1455
01:31:08,356 --> 01:31:10,557
[SPEAKER_14]: You can get in line behind G4.

1456
01:31:13,518 --> 01:31:14,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I love you, Rob.

1457
01:31:14,619 --> 01:31:15,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1458
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:18,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1459
01:31:18,461 --> 01:31:18,861
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1460
01:31:19,362 --> 01:31:20,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to cut you.

1461
01:31:21,547 --> 01:31:21,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Promise?

1462
01:31:22,668 --> 01:31:23,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, baby.

1463
01:31:23,388 --> 01:31:25,449
[SPEAKER_14]: With that pyramid head plushie of love.

1464
01:31:25,869 --> 01:31:28,150
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, eight last minute stories tonight.

[SPEAKER_14]: Loki.

1466
01:31:30,111 --> 01:31:31,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And then DarkSakura, you have one too?

1467
01:31:32,772 --> 01:31:32,952
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1468
01:31:33,153 --> 01:31:33,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, Loki then.

1469
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:35,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Okie dokie!

1470
01:31:56,907 --> 01:31:57,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

1471
01:31:57,848 --> 01:31:58,228
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.

1472
01:32:14,915 --> 01:32:15,795
[SPEAKER_01]: It is coming soon.

1473
01:32:16,756 --> 01:32:21,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Other news, of course, Atari has finally picked up Bullet Witch to distribute it in the US.

1474
01:32:22,338 --> 01:32:24,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always good, because that game looked awesome.

1475
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:35,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, Shiny has announced that they're doing a free MMO called Two Moons, which is supposed to be the most violent MMO to date, which is going to be awesome.

1476
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:40,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, finally, the best part about this, you're going to love this, is...

1477
01:32:41,445 --> 01:32:50,568
[SPEAKER_01]: According to Game Daily Biz, production company Project 51 has snatched up the rights to do an anime version of Castlevania.

1478
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:54,209
[SPEAKER_14]: My god!

1479
01:32:54,829 --> 01:32:56,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I think three sets of panties just got wet.

1480
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:59,570
[SPEAKER_07]: That boner just came back.

1481
01:33:00,711 --> 01:33:01,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Gross!

1482
01:33:05,432 --> 01:33:06,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I don't know.

1483
01:33:06,313 --> 01:33:07,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Did that get picked up by the mics?

1484
01:33:07,633 --> 01:33:08,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you folks hear that at home?

1485
01:33:08,893 --> 01:33:11,134
[SPEAKER_14]: That just collective gasp of

1486
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,441
[SPEAKER_14]: We also got one from Sauce.

1487
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:23,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, real quickly, I just want to cover this too.

1488
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,602
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a... This was actually reported on Kotaku.

1489
01:33:28,822 --> 01:33:35,245
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a guy, a fanboy here, who's doing a short film adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

1490
01:33:35,545 --> 01:33:35,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1491
01:33:36,225 --> 01:33:38,146
[SPEAKER_14]: That person just wins the internet.

1492
01:33:38,266 --> 01:33:40,668
[SPEAKER_14]: You win your own slice of the internet just for you.

1493
01:33:42,248 --> 01:33:43,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And the adoration of lesbians everywhere.

1494
01:33:43,809 --> 01:33:44,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty awesome.

1495
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,051
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically part of this...

1496
01:33:49,308 --> 01:33:54,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Project TV Short Film Contest Project TV Short Film Contest Project TV Short Film Contest

1497
01:34:17,972 --> 01:34:20,873
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard a gamergasm like that since Snake being in Smash Bros.

1498
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,393
[SPEAKER_14]: A gamer chasm, I love it.

1499
01:34:50,376 --> 01:34:51,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Snakes on the game?

1500
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:52,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit.

1501
01:34:52,501 --> 01:34:53,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god.

1502
01:34:56,235 --> 01:35:00,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge needs its own Wikipedia for these terms that we're coining tonight.

1503
01:35:00,677 --> 01:35:01,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, anyway.

1504
01:35:01,898 --> 01:35:02,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Loki.

1505
01:35:02,398 --> 01:35:07,140
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I had, I actually saw this last week, and I'm trying to find the exact link I had.

1506
01:35:07,961 --> 01:35:14,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what it was is they were also doing a live-action version, this was also fan-done, of Devil May Cry.

1507
01:35:14,244 --> 01:35:16,164
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's being done by some Japanese guy, so.

1508
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:17,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of neat.

1509
01:35:18,606 --> 01:35:18,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1510
01:35:19,486 --> 01:35:21,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of fan service out there, so.

1511
01:35:24,213 --> 01:35:27,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, well, tonight has certainly been a... Oh, I'm sorry, Megzi!

1512
01:35:27,894 --> 01:35:28,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Megzi, yes!

1513
01:35:29,314 --> 01:35:31,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Reporter-in-training for Orange Lawn Radio.

1514
01:35:31,274 --> 01:35:31,515
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up?

1515
01:35:31,735 --> 01:35:42,317
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't really news, but a couple weeks ago, DarkSakura gave a shout-out to one of my good friends who was in a car accident.

1516
01:35:42,997 --> 01:35:43,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember this, yes.

1517
01:35:44,917 --> 01:35:49,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just wanted to give an update, is that she's perfectly fine, and she actually went home yesterday.

1518
01:35:50,216 --> 01:35:50,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay!

1519
01:35:50,977 --> 01:35:51,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

1520
01:35:51,778 --> 01:35:51,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1521
01:35:52,078 --> 01:35:54,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So Larissa is back home.

1522
01:35:54,481 --> 01:35:54,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1523
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:55,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And doing just fine.

1524
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,124
[SPEAKER_15]: She made a full recovery.

1525
01:35:57,284 --> 01:36:00,248
[SPEAKER_15]: No, nothing psychological or weird or anything.

1526
01:36:00,968 --> 01:36:01,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1527
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:03,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give a big shout out to the twins right now, though.

1528
01:36:03,772 --> 01:36:05,734
[SPEAKER_15]: The twins, Larissa and Corinne.

1529
01:36:06,243 --> 01:36:06,744
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1530
01:36:26,209 --> 01:36:30,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Our chat room wants us to mention the Grand Theft Auto Coca-Cola ad.

1531
01:36:30,711 --> 01:36:33,212
[SPEAKER_14]: If you haven't seen this on YouTube, it's kind of interesting.

1532
01:36:33,512 --> 01:36:35,352
[SPEAKER_14]: We were watching this just before the show tonight.

1533
01:36:35,392 --> 01:36:37,213
[SPEAKER_14]: There's this CGI ad.

1534
01:36:37,853 --> 01:36:41,555
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a Coke ad with the Grand Theft Auto characters.

1535
01:36:41,615 --> 01:36:42,375
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of interesting.

1536
01:36:42,415 --> 01:36:45,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Check it out on YouTube if you want to.

1537
01:36:46,234 --> 01:36:50,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to mention something about that Devil May Cry short film that's being done.

1538
01:36:50,398 --> 01:36:53,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the director has a MySpace page if you want to check it out.

1539
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:56,823
[SPEAKER_01]: MySpace.com slash Shadow Motion Pictures.

1540
01:36:57,724 --> 01:36:58,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.

1541
01:36:59,005 --> 01:36:59,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1542
01:37:00,276 --> 01:37:02,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's going to do it for tonight's program.

1543
01:37:02,456 --> 01:37:05,277
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1544
01:37:06,097 --> 01:37:08,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Megzi, thank you so much for being here all the way from Wisconsin tonight.

1545
01:37:09,098 --> 01:37:14,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, all joking aside about the lesbian, you're a very cool gamer gal, gamer in general.

1546
01:37:14,478 --> 01:37:16,219
[SPEAKER_14]: And have fun with the Wii when it comes out.

1547
01:37:16,259 --> 01:37:16,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I will.

1548
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:18,459
[SPEAKER_14]: And let us know how dirgeous service is.

1549
01:37:18,599 --> 01:37:18,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I will.

1550
01:37:18,979 --> 01:37:20,239
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, final thought.

1551
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:22,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Any last message you want to give to our listeners?

1552
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:28,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken Kutaragi needs a helmet and some oven mitts and needs to ride the small bus.

1553
01:37:31,343 --> 01:37:31,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Very well put.

1554
01:37:32,003 --> 01:37:32,304
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1555
01:37:33,165 --> 01:37:33,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it?

1556
01:37:34,967 --> 01:37:35,948
[SPEAKER_15]: GameStop for the win.

1557
01:37:36,228 --> 01:37:36,569
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1558
01:37:36,889 --> 01:37:42,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris, likewise, thank you so much for being here and representing the gamer girls very well.

1559
01:37:42,616 --> 01:37:43,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

1560
01:37:43,557 --> 01:37:44,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Your final thought.

1561
01:37:46,843 --> 01:37:48,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is full of awesome and win.

1562
01:37:49,265 --> 01:37:50,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome sauce.

01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1564
01:37:51,886 --> 01:37:53,447
[SPEAKER_02]: All your listeners are actually really, really cool.

1565
01:37:54,087 --> 01:37:55,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have some great listeners.

1566
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:59,470
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very, very patient with all of our really stupid lesbian jokes.

1567
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:00,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Fangirl lesbian.

1568
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:01,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Fangirl lesbian.

1569
01:38:01,371 --> 01:38:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you all.

1570
01:38:02,232 --> 01:38:05,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys all deserve your own piece of the win internet.

1571
01:38:07,134 --> 01:38:07,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everybody.

1572
01:38:08,055 --> 01:38:09,235
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

1573
01:38:09,716 --> 01:38:11,156
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, reject false icons.

1574
01:38:12,317 --> 01:38:14,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And number two

1575
01:38:15,563 --> 01:38:17,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the shampoo I sent you?

1576
01:38:18,244 --> 01:38:20,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's made for very fine hair.

1577
01:38:21,845 --> 01:38:25,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And if your friend says I love you, don't punch!

1578
01:38:25,767 --> 01:38:26,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Say thank you.

1579
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:34,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And my final thought is you put your weed in there.

1580
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, your final thought.

1581
01:38:38,711 --> 01:38:44,673
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I want to play more Dead Rising, but people want me to play more Chromehounds.

1582
01:38:45,117 --> 01:38:46,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Decisions, decisions.

1583
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:46,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

1584
01:38:46,598 --> 01:38:47,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck in the tournament.

1585
01:38:47,859 --> 01:38:48,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be cheering you on.

1586
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:49,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.

1587
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:53,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for nominating me for this tournament.

1588
01:38:53,905 --> 01:38:56,027
[SPEAKER_01]: For not even having a team.

1589
01:38:56,287 --> 01:38:56,567
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1590
01:38:56,587 --> 01:38:57,288
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1591
01:38:57,688 --> 01:38:59,110
[SPEAKER_14]: I say, screw it.

1592
01:38:59,530 --> 01:39:06,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's figure out a way to get Chris and Megzy and two other lesbian gamers and we'll just have the giggling lesbian squad go up against you.

1593
01:39:06,476 --> 01:39:06,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, right.

1594
01:39:06,916 --> 01:39:07,317
We'll kick

1595
01:39:08,137 --> 01:39:08,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah!

1596
01:39:08,878 --> 01:39:10,858
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll kick so much ass with our giggles.

1597
01:39:11,358 --> 01:39:13,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay.

1598
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:17,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Because all the straight guys from all games in Gamer Andy will have such big boners that they won't be able to play.

1599
01:39:17,861 --> 01:39:19,462
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll bounce around.

1600
01:39:19,742 --> 01:39:23,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take them on one-on-one, but this four-on-four crap is ridiculous.

1601
01:39:24,764 --> 01:39:31,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't agree to do any sort of... I said I wanted to play these guys, but I never said... Just take one for the team, Loki.

1602
01:39:32,607 --> 01:39:33,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're being a woman.

1603
01:39:34,007 --> 01:39:34,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1604
01:39:35,348 --> 01:39:35,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1605
01:39:36,926 --> 01:39:40,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks everybody so much for listening and tuning in, supporting Internet Radio.

1606
01:39:40,289 --> 01:39:46,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Even on a crazy night like tonight, the fact that you guys are sticking with Orange Lounge Radio means you too are made of winning awesome, and we love you for it.

1607
01:39:46,995 --> 01:39:47,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks so much.

1608
01:39:47,656 --> 01:39:49,137
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you next week for Orange Lounge 196.

1609
01:39:50,178 --> 01:39:51,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Sakura's not going to be here next week.

1610
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:52,380
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1611
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:58,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be at Disneyland having a big massive Disneyland Mississippi orgy.

1612
01:39:58,966 --> 01:39:59,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Which means...

1613
01:40:00,413 --> 01:40:03,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Boys, take control of Orange Lounge Radio next week once again.

1614
