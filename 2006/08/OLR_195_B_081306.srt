00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,800
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 195 for this August 13th of 2006, and

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,440
If this is your very first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, I'm sorry, because

3
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,900
it's a slow news week and we're getting a little crazy tonight, but that's part of what

4
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,320
makes us us.

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,240
Anybody can open up a game blog and read the latest news, what's going on, but we're here

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,720
to talk about games and gaming culture and our thoughts and just celebrate all types

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,280
of gamers and just people who want to have fun, and that's what we're doing here on Orange

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,840
Lounge Radio tonight is having a whole lot of fun.

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,520
We'd love for you guys to join us sometime live Sunday nights at orangeloungeradio.com.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Let's get back into the gaming news, though, so we have something to rant about.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,520
Alright, speaking of stuff to rant about, I hate to do this every week.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,800
You know, we play this game at work, it's what stupid thing is Sony gonna do this week?

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,800
And you know what?

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,040
They never disappoint.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,360
But okay, so there was news reports, this isn't exactly PlayStation 3 related, but there's

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,760
reports that the first Blu-ray drives that are gonna be available in the Sony Vios, yeah,

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,480
they won't play Blu-ray movies.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,200
That's like a DVD player that does not play DVD movies.

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,120
So what the hell is it going to do?

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,120
Oh, but you can burn your own content and stuff.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,720
So it's like a Blu-ray data drive or something?

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah, pretty much.

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Weird.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,900
And because they said that the whole reason why that it can't is because there was actually

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,560
some lagging software development and copy protection issues.

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,900
So that's not good because, you know what, I mean, these Playstation 3s, they use PC

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,300
drives more or less and yeah, I hope they get this crap together when the PS3 comes

28
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,020
out or else, who knows, we may see some firmware updates.

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,100
Now playing, you know, Blu-ray movies, because I don't know why else you would need a Blu-ray

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
player.

31
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
Wow.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,660
Well, we'll see what happens with that.

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,020
Well, there is actually some interesting news in regards to the Halo movie.

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,740
There is information on Ain't It Cool News.

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,900
The director was basically saying that, first of all, he prefers Halo 1.

36
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,700
I thought that was pretty funny.

37
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,180
But that is talking about some of the material that's going to be in the movie, talking about

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,880
how Master Chief is going to be a mix of the man in the suit and CG.

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,140
To quote, the film has to have a feeling of reality so that it means I want to keep him

40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,500
as real as much as I can.

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,020
They're talking about how it's hard to have someone who moves like an animation as opposed

42
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,700
to someone who moves like a human.

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,620
They're also working on having the covenant be along the same lines, making them as real

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,760
as they can possibly make the movements.

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,060
Another quote from him, from an organic standpoint, they have to be believable.

46
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,820
They also need to be terrifying and alien.

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,180
And the best way to start doing that is to break the human silhouette, although many

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,740
of them are bipedal automatically, you can shift the overall body to something very alien.

49
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,220
So I thought that was pretty cool.

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
So what do you think?

51
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,220
Do you think the Halo movie, hearing the director's perspective and all this, do you think the

52
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,460
the Halo movie is going to be winner or loser?

53
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:46,480
Winner because he's actually a huge Halo fan and a huge gamer.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,940
He's basically saying that he's doing his very best.

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,420
He has been picking the things that

56
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,620
are the most holy of holy things in Halo

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,820
and keeping them as faithful as possible.

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,020
Oh, Chris, one of our in-house lesbians tonight

59
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,180
seems to disagree.

60
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,060
What's going on?

61
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,900
Well, I don't really have an idea about the Halo movie.

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,300
it's just that I've heard other people who have done the same thing it's like

63
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,260
oh I was this huge fan of this and I'm gonna make sure everything's fine and it

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,900
just doesn't work yeah I think the guy who directed Street Fighter was a huge

65
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:24,260
fan of Street Fighter if he was I feel very bad yeah or at least a huge fan of

66
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,100
Jean-Claude Van Damme or Kylie Minogue yeah I don't know who eater seems a

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,180
little upset in our chat room over orange laundry calm click on chat that

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,440
I know we bowl for this movie

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,820
any broken diet burning hell well I don't

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,880
don't hold back please and zappy says all hail label Mac Matt maker of crappy

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
game movies

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,320
I see now I he may make crappy game movies but you know what

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,720
I really think he's gonna nail postal you can't get that game

74
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,640
postal is a crappy game doesn't matter that's all that is going to do justice

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,360
he needs to realize that his movies are never going to be you know taken

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,860
seriously, just make it campy. Maybe he should do the Dead Rising movie, if there's ever

77
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:13,860
one. No. No, he shouldn't. No, Romero should. We'll see. Here we go, Dawn of the Dead Part

78
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,680
2. Alright. Well, one place we could have heard more about the Halo movie would possibly

79
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,960
be E3 next year, due to its game relation, but of course, as we all know, E3 is going

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
to be changing a little bit. Where does that leave the folks in Kensha Hall? We speculated

81
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,280
about this a little bit during Part A. Well, the Consumer Electronics Association or CEA

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,360
might be checking into the fact that maybe they want to do a massive trade show specifically

83
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
about games.

84
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,560
Now, they already do the Consumer Electronics Show and this was the nation's largest gaming

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,960
show until about 1994 when E3 started.

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Only 11% of the attendees at Consumer Electronics Show 2006 had interest in games and gaming

87
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
products.

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Since ESA decided to eliminate the E3 event in its known format, we have been deluged

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,560
with inquiries on whether we could fill the trade show needs of smaller video entertainment

90
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,600
companies, this coming from Gary Shapiro, President and CEO of the CEA.

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,300
Our executive board met yesterday and unanimously asked staff to explore ways that we could

92
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,580
help the gaming community.

93
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,400
The Consumer Electronics Association believes that trade shows are the most viable means

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,460
for reaching a market as they serve smaller companies and entrepreneurs who need access

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,380
to media buyers and investors.

96
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,060
Our board, association and events are committed to growing the industry.

97
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,840
In fact, nearly 80% of our members are companies with annual sales under $10 million.

98
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,100
So maybe here's where the smaller game companies can seek refuge is CES, whether it be in the

99
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,460
form of next year's big show or a smaller separate show has been heard about.

100
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,860
To be honest, in the past it was that way anyway, so why not?

101
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,900
Why did they leave in the first place then?

102
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,900
E3.

103
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,500
I guess that makes sense, but you know, it's still a little sad.

104
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,700
And CES is a lot better too because they have two shows, but still it comes down to the

105
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,100
whole thing where they have to make these demos for these shows and it interrupts the

106
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,100
development cycle and that kind of thing, so it might be the same whole problem all

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
over again.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,740
Some of our chat room folks seem to think this is a good idea though.

109
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,400
Nintendo Maniac 64 says Woot for CES.

110
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Ravens Dolphin says, yes, CES is Geek Central.

111
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,280
Fireboma thinks a different expo should step up, though.

112
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,240
They'll go to the open arms of Penny Arcade Expo, which a lot of folks have been saying.

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,600
Are the lesbians digging Penny Arcade Expo?

114
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Maisie says, hell yeah.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What's up with that?

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,680
I'm just a huge Penny Arcade fan.

117
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan.

118
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
It's good stuff.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
It's good stuff.

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Those guys know their stuff.

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Don't get me wrong.

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan as well.

123
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I met a dude in the line at E3 two years ago buying hamburgers.

124
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,040
We randomly met them at E3 a couple of years ago.

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,320
I was in line with, we were in line buying lunch and just talking about stuff.

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,840
I think they write very good editorial pieces on the gaming industry.

127
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,440
I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday, it's just a lack of fundage.

128
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
But have you been, Megsy?

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,960
No I haven't, I would kill to go.

130
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,460
I heard they're giving away a new car this year, the big gaming cluster tournament they

131
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,240
have there of all these old school games, that's pretty awesome.

132
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,720
Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

133
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Pardon?

134
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,680
Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?

135
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
I'd love to.

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,240
Maybe we could have an Orange Lawns Radio booth and staff it with lesbians.

137
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
That'd be awesome.

138
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,420
The new breed of booth babe!

139
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,080
These booth babes don't want anything to do with you.

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Unless you're hot.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
And how's that different than any other year?

142
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
That's very true.

143
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,960
Very, very true.

144
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,520
So yeah, that's kind of funny.

145
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Well anyways, another cool thing that's going to be happening pretty soon, and you've probably

146
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,240
seen it with a lot of the games out there right now, like Xbox 360 games are pretty

147
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,480
much the same with any other next-gen games, they're pretty expensive right now.

148
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,880
$59.99 retail seems to be the going price for most games out there, however that's not

149
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,520
going to be the case going forward because there are going to be a lot of games coming

150
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,240
out at $39.99 and $49.99.

151
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,880
And some of those games we're going to mention for you, including such wonderful classics

152
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,900
as Bomberman Act Zero, which is going to be coming out on the 28th of August, Lego Star

153
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,980
Wars the original trilogy, it's coming out early September, Samurai Warriors 2, Just

154
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:27,540
Cause which is going to be pretty awesome, Blitz the League, Fusion Frenzy 2, Viva Pinata,

155
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,020
Kars and Rayman's Raving Rabbids.

156
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,820
And those are all going to be coming out $49.99, if that's still too much for ya, $39.99, we're

157
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:43,940
We're going to be having Test Drive Unlimited coming out, Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume

158
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:49,840
1, if you happen to not be on live, which is weird, but whatever.

159
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,140
That's going to be coming out early September as well as Cabalas Alaskan Adventure.

160
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,540
I'm just going to give you a hint, the game's probably going to be crap.

161
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,400
That's probably why it's cheap.

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,060
World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions is going to be coming out, Pimp My Ride in

163
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,820
November, Cabalas African Safari.

164
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,260
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

165
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:15,660
Also to remind you, as we mentioned last week, the first party games from Microsoft, the

166
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,460
Launch 1s, Cameo, Project Gotham Racing 3, and Perfect Dark Zero, all $29.99 right now,

167
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,820
and as we mentioned in Part A, Ridge Racer 6, a whopping $19.99.

168
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
Wow.

169
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,460
I should invent a game.

170
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,460
Now wait, hold on, what's this?

171
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
Unpimp My Ride.

172
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,580
And have a sponsor by Volkswagen where you get more points for you know

173
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,660
like you get like 50,000 points for spinners and and

174
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,060
If they have like if they have a vinyl applied to their paint, you know

175
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,220
When you destroy that car you get extra extra points and if it's actually painted on then you get a lot of points

176
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
So yeah, all right

177
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,040
I want to say real quick though

178
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,780
I heard magazine give a little cheer over viva pinata and I haven't heard a lot of people like

179
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,460
like, really excited about this game. So what has you excited about Viva Pinata?

180
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,620
Well, I just like those really obscure, quirky games, like Katamari, stuff like that, Cube

181
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,460
of War for the GameCube. You're on the right show.

182
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,980
You are. And when I actually heard about it from my

183
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:21,020
manager at work, but when I heard about it, I just thought, okay, just another quirky,

184
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,460
obscure game that I'm probably just going to adore. So, yeah.

185
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,460
Even though, but Microsoft kind of sounds like they want to make it mainstream with

186
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,100
the cartoon and everything like it sounds like they just they want an

187
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,300
Animal Crossing competitor yeah good thing bad thing well I love Animal

188
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:41,260
Crossing so I guess good thing all right sounds good fire resurrected in chat

189
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,820
says I got my viva pinata pre-ordered and another game of course Rapala trophies

190
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,180
coming out on the 360 also gonna be 35.99 but really how many fishing fans

191
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,140
are out there on the 360 anyway hey you never know might be if it's easy

192
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,940
achievement points you'll buy it no I won't I will get it for free well

193
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,420
speaking of online related things and magazine should be interested in this

194
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:15,220
dead rising already has download content it's actually going to be released in

195
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,260
about a month in Europe they've already put out though some quick downloadable

196
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,260
content. They're basically keys that are unlocking costumes that are hidden in the games. They're

197
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:33,380
called Miami Nights, Casual, Weekender, Round Shades, Burgundy, Grandpa, Pink Paparazzi,

198
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,780
and Man in Black. So what do you get, Johnny Cash? That's cool.

199
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,220
No, he's just got a black jacket, black pants.

200
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,140
Wait, so you've seen these costumes, Logie.

201
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,820
Yeah, they're downloadable right now in live. They came out the same day as Dead Rising.

202
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,260
basically in the very beginning of the game when you first get into the

203
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,100
security room

204
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,220
there's a bunch of lockers in there and you can walk up and change clothes.

205
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,820
Like Resident Evil 2. They did that in Resident Evil 2. You get the keys and you get Jill's cowgirl outfit.

206
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,700
When I was playing Dead Rising the other day, some of the folks that were watching me

207
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,180
play were making Resident Evil comparisons

208
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,140
to Dead Rising, which I guess is an easy thing to do. You know, both being zombie

209
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,180
Capcom games.

210
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,660
Zombies. So, then again, Ghost of the Ghost was the zombie Capcom game too. I'm gonna laugh my ass off there

211
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,460
if I find the line

212
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,260
itchy-tasty in this game apparently one of the malls is named jill's sandwich

213
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,300
yeah

214
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,740
which you know that's a great reference to uh... the old-school

215
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,060
resident evil step where i

216
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,280
critical is there a smoothie shop

217
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
in the mall uh...

218
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,980
there is i think

219
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,540
uh... all right

220
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,060
all i see what you're doing i got a little less

221
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,460
go listen to part a if you haven't yet and you'll get that maybe

222
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,700
remember

223
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,500
smoothie

224
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,320
pass it on

225
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,180
well if you're excited about dead rising as i was uh... you'll be happy to know

226
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,020
that dead rising 2 is already in the works in fact

227
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,260
uh... one of the things you'll notice is when you get your copy of dead rising

228
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,560
there's actually a link to a capcom survey where they're asking you

229
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,240
questions about dead rising and what you might want in dead rising 2

230
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,900
so that's always good and we knew that this is going to be a popular game

231
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,480
anyways so uh...

232
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,500
wonder what dead rising 2 is going to be

233
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,820
seriously though my friends list on xbox live has been nothing but dead but dead

234
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,220
rising like just tons of that street fighter

235
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,100
just tons of people playing dead rising i won't be surprised

236
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,620
uh... all if it uh... it ends up maybe pop possibly taking the crown from halo

237
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,860
to its most played live game

238
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,540
if not that okay missile ambitious lease being the number two game where oblivion

239
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,620
was a little while ago

240
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,060
that i'm looking at my list right now right this minute

241
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,180
somebody is playing dead rising

242
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,620
and this person on my friends list already got the infinite mode it looks

243
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,020
like. So that's pretty cool. Lucky. You know what's great though? If you happen to read

244
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,800
something awful.com, they have a little page on there talking about Dead Rising and how

245
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,980
to spend the 72 hours in the game. It's hilarious because they basically never left the security

246
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,980
room for the 72 hours. It's funny. They kept taking pictures of the one chick's boobs in

247
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:07,480
there. Wow. Alright. Well, now another Dead Rising story and maybe this made you a little

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,760
upset, especially if you donít have an HDTV, but itís that text in the game is so freaking

249
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
small.

250
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,560
Well, some folks decided to start a thread on a Capcom bulletin board, bitching about

251
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,120
the small text in the game, and Wicked Kitty, one of the administrators of the forum, meaning

252
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,280
obviously thereís got to be some ties to Capcom itself, responded, ìDear everyone,

253
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,040
I have heard your concerns and passed them to every source within Capcom possible.

254
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,300
I feel your pain as I myself have a large SDTV,î standard I suppose, ìand am having

255
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,060
trouble reading the mission objectives, item names, etc.

256
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,140
I'd like you all to know we have heard your concerns and take them seriously.

257
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,860
I've been seeing campaigns on other forums to send hundreds of emails to our support

258
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
email.

259
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,500
Unfortunately, this doesn't expedite or increase the importance of the concern in any way,

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,620
but it does take time and resources from other fans equally deserving concerns.

261
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,860
All concerns are always important to us and we do what we can.

262
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,740
We would like you to know we appreciate your feedback, blah, blah, blah."

263
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,160
So basically they're saying, please stop emailing us.

264
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,800
know there's a boo-boo in the game and what yeah my bad shut up what do you

265
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,840
think they're gonna do you think they'll patch it or you think they're gonna go

266
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,040
patch it you really think I don't that seems like an awfully big thing to patch

267
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:23,000
just yeah font size now make see I have yet to play dead rising but it seems

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,680
like like like you said a big thing to patch and kind of a minor problem I mean

269
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,360
like I said I haven't played it but all right well that's my two cents it

270
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
It depends how big your TV is. If you're playing on a little bitty TV, you're going to have a problem there.

271
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,360
But then again, Xbox 360 wasn't really made for a little bitty TV. But I understand.

272
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Even on big TVs, it's still hard to read.

273
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Yeah, it's hard to read even on my TV. It's pretty bad.

274
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,360
GS191 has an interesting thought here in our chatroom related to Dead Rising.

275
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
I would love to see a Dead Rising MMO.

276
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I think a lot of folks would have just liked to see Dead Rising be multiplayer.

277
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,360
But, you know, my thought is, if they'd done Dead Rising multiplayer, what's going to be the big catch for Dead Rising 2?

278
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:13,540
I think the perfect MMO would be you have your everyday life and then you release your

279
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,700
serum and if your character gets infected you lose your character you have to make a

280
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,540
new one however your character never dies your character is undead then and can pass

281
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,900
on or you can actually control the zombie and pass on your virus to other people they've

282
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,280
I've already done this.

283
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,600
Oh, was that infected?

284
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,080
No, there was actually a Resident Evil game

285
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,120
that was online.

286
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,960
That's right.

287
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
And then they did this.

288
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
Oh, OK.

289
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,440
I still think it's cool, because I want to infect people.

290
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,740
All right, have you ever played that game, Infected, on PSP?

291
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,240
No.

292
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,800
All right, let's get into the mailbag

293
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,520
and find some other great thoughts.

294
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,040
We're going to put the hazmat suit.

295
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,080
Over email.

296
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,760
Yes, Jamie's going to suit up in the hazmat at best

297
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,580
suit right now and get her hands wet and get there in the mail bag at mailbag.orangelaungeradio.com

298
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,400
and pull out your e-mails right now.

299
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,560
If they get wet that means my suit is broken.

300
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,720
First e-mail comes from Nailhead, awesome name.

301
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
I'll start by saying that I love the show, been listening to the podcast for a year.

302
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,800
It makes traveling to work and back much faster.

303
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Thank you.

304
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Yes, thank you.

305
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,560
The names that I buy are from recommendations from Orange Lounge Radio, so thank you for

306
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
that.

307
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,360
That's a scary thought, that we're influencing the general public like that, but no thank

308
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
you, seriously.

309
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
I have a story that you may want to know about.

310
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm part of a small film company in Huntsville, Alabama.

311
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Shout out to Jamie.

312
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,560
I know she's from Alabama too.

313
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Hell yeah!

314
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,760
And we are in production of a World of Warcraft documentary.

315
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,820

eighth post yeah sounds like okay yeah okay the link to the film's webpage is a world

323
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,380
of warcraftthemovie.com and the film company is deadworkers.com.

324
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,860
Not as cool as zombie flesh eaters, but still pretty damn cool.

325
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I'd be curious to see what this documentary would turn out like.

326
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,980
It'd be great if you mentioned it on the show.

327
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,660
It would surely help get us more interviews.

328
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,820
Also we would love to interview you all as well, that is if we can make it out west.

329
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,740
In closing, I'll list three things about your show I love, FUs of the Week, PC vs Mac

330
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,340
is hilarious i tend to side with loki on this one wow you are bruce campbell fans um here's

331
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,460
here's something funny and speaking of penny arcade earlier they did a strip about dead rising

332
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:04,060
and they had mac fans looking drooling over the uh that was great yeah that was great well the

333
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:12,540
closing on this is thanks i love you all oh kisses smoochy smoochy got one from digi nova

334
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,380
It says, hey crew, a big hello from DigiNova on the other side of the pond.

335
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,340
It's been a while since I last called in but I wanted to raise the subject of the OLR

336
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,340
Skype line.

337
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,060
I totally find this part of the show one of the most interesting parts.

338
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,620
Granted there are the regular callers but to myself they are part of the OLR formula

339
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,980
that makes it so addictive that makes me so envious that I can't participate more often.

340
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,140
The recent edition of the voicemail section gives the listeners who can't make those

341
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,380
late night sessions a regular thing, a chance to put their views across.

342
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,560
In short, OLR combines the great factors of anime, gaming, and humor that make me crack

343
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,080
up on the train to work every Monday and Thursday.

344
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
Please note I get odd looks from some fellow passengers when I get a dirty smirk about

345
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,600
fanboy funk from Ron Masao Tomy.

346
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,960
I can't wait to see the reaction to this week's show.

347
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,740
At this point, I want to make my dedication to the OLR crew and have purchased the above

348
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,240
domain which isn't a total ripoff, but hope this makes me an official trooper from Sky.

349
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Have a great show tonight.

350
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
I'll be sure to listen to and pass the word of OLR to the masses

351
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,880
and it's

352
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,720
orangelounge.co.uk. So somebody bought orangelounge.co.uk for us

353
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,320
in a way. Dude, seriously, maybe we should have a UK mirror.

354
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,720
I'm down with that. Email us back if you want to help run a UK mirror for us.

355
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,600
Two things. A, I'm very glad someone's saying something positive about the

356
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,920
call-in segment because

357
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,360
I think I want to say either the reviews in iTunes or somewhere was bashing on

358
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,800
the collars and I, you know, they're just mad they don't listen Sunday nights and

359
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
can call in themselves.

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,360
I don't know what their deal is, so I'm really glad something's said because we

361
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,080
really want this to be everybody's show, not just, you know, Dark Sakura, Loki and

362
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,560
Sky hog the airwaves for, you know, three hours.

363
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,200
We like getting you guys involved, you know.

364
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,880
Although my ego does like hogging the airwaves for three hours.

365
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
We are the stars.

366
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
No, I'm kidding.

367
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Anyway.

368
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm the diva of the show.

369
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,560
No, Rob's the diva of the show.

370
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,360
One thing, I'm loving the increase it seems like we've been having in UK presence lately

371
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,360
because I've noticed on MySpace, we've been getting a lot of ads from UK folks lately.

372
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,760
So whoever's spreading our name out there in the UK, thanks and we're really glad that

373
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,480
you guys are noticing that we want to be representative of gamers everywhere, not just silly America

374
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:35,000
but you know UK Australia Canada anywhere so worldwide gaming news here

375
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,480
at Orange Launch Radio so thank you I especially love our UK listeners though

376
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,280
because I'm going to move into your country one day when I want to visit

377
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:59,000
it when I'm in your country buying your stuff Oh Bobby hahaha Bob Bobby black

378
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,360
wolf wrote us oh our good pal Bobby black wolf from all games calm this also

379
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,560
does a show Sunday night such as dear lol our heart as in you know less than

380
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
3.

381
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Mm-hmm.

382
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Dear Alala, all in caps, bye-bye.

383
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,040
Which is how many kills he'll get in the Chromestowns tournament, by the way.

384
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
Ooh.

385
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Less than 3.

386
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Like your mom.

387
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Listen.

388
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Last night.

389
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,040
Ooh.

390
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Stop talking trash.

391
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I know.

392
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm going playing.

393
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Everyone's...

394
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm sorry.

395
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,920
Less than 3 is how many people we have signed up to participate in the Chromestowns tournament

396
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
right now.

397
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
Exactly.

398
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,000
This whole thing reminds me of that South Park episode where they're trying to get Tweak

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
in...

400
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,520
I forget the other guy, to fight.

401
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Oh, Craig.

402
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Craig, yeah.

403
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:47,760
Craig the fight and they're all like talking trash for them and yeah okay

404
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,540

408
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,360
ChromeHounds yeah easy for you to say until we get trashed on next week's show

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,960

410
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,840
oh suddenly black wolf woke up in chat cute we have people starting to rise

411
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,100
it's right you should have been doing this when we called for you guys last

412
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:37,020
Last week where the fuck were you?

413
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,980
This email comes from, scrolling down to the bottom of the really freaking long email,

414
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,980
Johnny.

415
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,860
I'm going to read this.

416
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,860
It's really long.

417
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,220
Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know I enjoy the show and wanted to share my thoughts

418
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,100
about video games causing violence in teen pregnancy.

419
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:58,260
The knee-jerk reaction from many in our age group, like Junami, is to blame the parents.

420
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,180
However, the vast majority of us are not parents, or are not parents of adolescent-aged children,

421
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,380
especially when you factor out the Pac-Man and Sudoku playing grandmothers that bump

422
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,660
up the average age of the gamer statistic.

423
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,580
It's easy for those of us who aren't parents to cast blame, but it's not so simple.

424
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,940
Who among us growing up had parents who were successfully able to control all the influence

425
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
that shaped our minds?

426
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,100
There are many influences on a child, including the extended family, community, peers, and

427
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
yes, media.

428
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,700
Parents can only control so much.

429
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,480
Full-time parents in the 60s couldn't keep Playboy and pot out of the hands of children.

430
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:34,760
How can single parents and dual-wage parents today facing our new economic realities?

431
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,420
I hope to attain that much supervision.

432
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,420
That's not to say that I'm letting parents off the hook.

433
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,080
Dysfunctional parents tend not to realize their dysfunction.

434
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,700
But is it in reality their fault if they were raised with the same dysfunctional manner?

435
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,860
And even if it is their fault, does simply screaming at these damaged people

436
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,300
to raise their poor kids better contribute to a solution.

437
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,260
Sorry, tongue tied.

438
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,000
It's obviously not video games.

439
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,920
People always blame new technology, trends, and music.

440
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,700
The parents of yesterday were convinced that Elvis single-handedly deflowered a generation

441
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,980
of virgins, equipment.

442
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,800
That's not fiction.

443
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,860
Yeah. But there are very few parents of today who grew up with that music agree.

444
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,300
There have been studies done linking video games to physical agitation

445
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,080
like increased heart rate and aggression, but also, after playing a game of football,

446
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,620
doesn't feel that same agitation and aggression. Video games are new. They will be scapegoated

447
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,660
until we, who have grown up with them, become the parents of adolescents ourselves. By then,

448
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,780
I'm sure we'll be blaming VR. My God, that will play snuff films. We never had that.

449
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,660
Satan. Defensively pointing to the First Amendment as a shield doesn't solve anything. The game

450
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,320
industry in particular, and the gaming community in general, has to take a lead in tackling

451
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,680
these problems. Without casting blame, we need to improve our society's respect for

452
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,600
life and human dignity. Amen. These ideas have to be proactively taught. Simply censoring

453
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
and removing media to the contrary doesn't work. Eliminating the video game where you

454
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,220
can kill a prostitute does not, by itself, create respect for women. We have to directly

455
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:10,220
teach respect for women, and a society that has respect for women will naturally not be

456
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,320
entertained by a video game where you can kill a prostitute. That's the message that

457
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,520
we need to communicate to the mainstream and to our government.

458
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,740
Instead of fighting over whose fault it is, let's work on fixing the problem."

459
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
I agree with that.

460
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,120
As a side note, Camden, Ohio is a socially and religiously conservative city that teaches

461
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,620
abstinence only.

462
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,880
Conservative parents seem to generally believe that kids, if never told about sex, will never

463
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,720
figure out how to perform sex or even if there are certain bodily parts that can be stimulated.

464
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,040
This is even though one of these conservative parents themselves conceived their current

465
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,300
crop of children in the back of a four pinto, but I digress.

466
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,620
So why do these parents think that it must be music or video games?

467
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,700
After all, children are never exposed to sex in their God-fearing homes and communities,

468
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
right?

469
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,340
It must be an outside influence, right?

470
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,120
Fighting the conservatives will always be an exercise in frustration.

471
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,740
They think they're angels, but an all-demonic influence must come from the outside.

472
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
Sad.

473
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,940
Sorry for the long-winded email, just wanted you to know that I enjoy the show.

474
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Thanks, Johnny.

475
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,540
I agree with every damn thing that you've said there.

476
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,220
I'd like to say I have plenty of respect for women, but I enjoy games where you can kill

477
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
prostitutes.

478
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,060
that was but they have no they have little respect for themselves though

479
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,700
okay well I had fun with with the I actually

480
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,420
I I have to say I do I do love having my

481
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,580
my random about a fake non-reality

482
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,700
destruction it's it's a release of aggression and on top of that there's all those

483
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,340
you know added studies too about

484
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,740
how solving even the puzzles in some of these more violent games

485
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,020
how they raise your cognitive function. I'll have you know.

486
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,140
I'm actually going to be putting Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

487
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,740
on my laptop so that during our segments or during our breaks between

488
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,900
part A and part B

489
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,700
I can play the hot coffee mod at whim.

490
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,580
You know what? I give props to that listener for being well-educated.

491
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,820
That's all. Well-educated.

492
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,740
Individual. You don't agree with them? No, no, no.

493
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
No, I do.

494
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Not often you see well-educated internet rants, so I'm very pleased with the other one.

495
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,100
Well, honestly, I think that that type of attitude should be applied toward all sorts

496
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,160
of things within society that's going on.

497
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,660
I honestly think that, and I actually am not going to go into detail about this, I recently

498
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,720
had a conversation with my mother.

499
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,500
You know what I'm talking about.

500
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,780
I had a discussion with my mother and she started to preach at me and try to bring Bible

501
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,340
quotes into it.

502
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,900
And I was like, excuse me?

503
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,780
She's like, do you believe in Jesus?

504
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:51,980
I was like, what does me believing in Jesus have to do with you respecting who I am?

505
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,860
There's nothing wrong with being religious, nothing at all.

506
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,860
It's just, you know.

507
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,860
It's so inflected on everybody else.

508
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,400
But the whole thing about that is that I think that that's an attitude that we keep running into.

509
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,800
If the fundamentalists really want to support their position, they're going to,

510
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,300
they should actually go from a more valid standpoint.

511
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,660
Not everybody is going to believe in what you believe.

512
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,760
You need to, if you're really trying to convince people, you know, to not act a certain way

513
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,220
or that, you know, not to play these violent games or to not, you know, do something,

514
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,000
you need to actually have something substantial to support your claim with.

515
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,240
That's what I have to say.

516
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,820
I actually have to defend I'm not I'm not conservative or anything but to defend the conservatives

517
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:37,580
There are a few people out there that are just that dumb that they will go out and do stupid things from games

518
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,840
But I would have more respect for them if they actually research the subject they were talking about

519
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,240
You should see some of those anti Harry Potter, but Harry Potter promotes witchcraft. There's actually Christians

520
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,140
Hello, there actually is a book though that one of my friends who is she's a very she's a liberal Christian

521
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
She is called

522
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,440
What Harry Potter teaches us about Jesus or something like that and how they're actually using it as a relation for how it teaches good values

523
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:11,440
It does teach some good values, but listen if you want witchcraft you watch Harry Potter if you want, you know

524
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Jesus and all that stuff

525
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
You watch this

526
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,900
So, you know, there's movies out there for that are both

527
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,680
parallel to different religions. I'm waiting for my goddamn pagan series, or better yet,

528
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,320
Scientology. Oh, I'm sorry, Battlefield Earth was already out there, so...

529
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,760
Moving on. Tom Cruise saving the world with Scientology.

530
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,000
Religion Wars 101 here on this program, please. No, but my whole point was, is just that,

531
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
you know, fucking think for yourself, people. Don't be a fucking sheep.

532
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,360
Okay, Jeremy Todd won!

533
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,360
First of all, RIDRASHER.

534
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,480
R-I-D-R-A-Y-S-H-E-R.

535
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,140
Okay, I found this on YouTube. Jack Thompson was interviewed, well not really an

536
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,800
interview, but more of a discussion about video game violence.

537
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,280
The main discussion was about the game Bully and how it could affect children in

538
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,040
schools. Here's a link to the video.

539
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,800
Look on YouTube and look under Jack Thompson. Yeah, do a search if you really want.

540
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm not gonna...

541
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,100
Honestly, there's a reason why we've relegated this sort of to the mailbag segment and didn't

542
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,740
talk about it a whole lot in depth tonight, and that is, unlike G4, we don't feel like

543
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,740
giving this guy more attention.

544
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,780
With all due respect to the emailer, I realize it's in the blogs and everything, and people

545
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,780
are talking about it.

546
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,780
I'm going to finish reading his email.

547
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Sure.

548
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,220
They bring up some interesting points, and I thought that OLR and possibly some of the

549
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,080
listeners would want to see this video.

550
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,500
My opinion is also, by the way, on game politics.

551
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,440
They kept bringing some of the stuff up.

552
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,020
My opinion on this video is that Jack Thompson believes that when a kid starts playing a

553
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,780
violent video game, that the kid will instantly turn into an angry, violent kid and that that's

554
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,960
just not true.

555
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,300
One thing I found interesting is that when they asked Jack if he had seen the game being

556
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,620
played by someone, and he replies by saying no.

557
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,900
So basically he is saying that the game Bully will make kids violent even though he hasn't

558
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,060
actually seen the video being played and he doesn't know what the game runs.

559
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:09,020
To be fair, none of them have seen the game yet, and also to be fair, his whole assumption

560
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,420
on the game was based off of the press release about the game, the pictures they've seen

561
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:18,980
so far of the game, and that kind of stuff. So he's in the wrong for assuming that this

562
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,520
game is a certain way because of just a press release and some pictures and he hasn't played

563
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,920
the game. But they're also wrong in defending the game because they haven't played it yet

564
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,720
either. So the whole thing is it's an argument over something completely retarded. That's

565
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,260
just like saying, you know, the passion of the Christ. And Mel Gibson is making a movie

566
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,060
pretending that the movie hasn't come out yet or something like that and

567
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,580
debating you know that whole movie without having seen anything on it

568
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,780
it's just it the whole argument

569
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,940
you know the whole interview was retarded. The whole thing was an

570
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,180
ego

571
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,740
cock stroking thing seriously Jack Thompson wanted to be on cable TV

572
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,780
G4 wanted to be able to interview the big bad guy behind video games

573
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,720
there was nothing redeeming about that whole thing. They covered nothing.

574
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,720
and I wish to not waste any more time talking about it next email.

575
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,920
Moving on, Chris emails us saying,

576
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,420
Hey, OLR, I recently received a DS Lite for my birthday and I was wondering,

577
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,120
this is my favorite game for PSP and PS2 as SOCOM,

578
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,520
if there are any games that are similar to SOCOM for DS because please let me know.

579
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,620
Thanks, love the show. I don't know, because those type of games don't really interest me,

580
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,820
personally. Point blank, maybe?

581
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:36,400
Now stuff I wouldn't say point-blank if anything I mean there's not a lot out right now

582
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,300
I think that they might be porting over Medal of Honor or Call of Duty to the

583
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:45,920
DS didn't know about that, but there might be you know something like that coming out

584
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,460
I would say probably right now Metroid Prime Hunters. You know the first you know first-person shooter

585
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:56,820
There's not a whole lot first-person shooters on the Wii just because it's difficult set up on it. Yes

586
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:03,120
DS, Wii, whatever. Well, I would say though, if you really, if you have these games that

587
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,220
you like, check the publisher's websites and see if they have any release dates listed

588
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:13,480
for any games along those lines. I was just going to throw out, as the Nintendo fangirl,

589
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,840
that Metroid Prime for DS is really very, very good. And I'm not a big fan of first

590
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,420
person shooters in general, but that was very, very good. I liked Metroid and the DS better

591
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,220
than I did on the consoles, to be honest, perfectly honest.

592
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,500
I like the first Metroid on the Nintendo.

593
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
A little wireless multiplayer goes a long way.

594
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
Super Metroid, Super Metroid.

595
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,300
Yes, that game was the shit.

596
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,500
That's all for email though.

597
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,000
All right, you should email us too.

598
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,060
You, there, sitting at your computer,

599
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,740
or sitting on the bus, or in the car,

600
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,460
listening to our show right now.

601
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,460
I mean, if you're driving, don't email us right now.

602
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,020
But send us an email at some point.

603
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,820
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

604
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,060
Meanwhile, back to the gaming news.

605
00:35:53,060 --> 00:36:01,020
Yes, and speaking of G4, they actually just did G4 yet, 2006, and that kind of snuck by

606
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,100
because I didn't see anything about it, but we have their results so that you don't have

607
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,860
to see the reruns. Anyways, don't get...

608
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,620
I just want to say this isn't news, but I understand why we're covering it. That's fine.

609
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,120
I just want to get that out there. This isn't news.

610
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,460
Okay. Best game of the year, Elder Scrolls IV. Duh. Okay. Best voiceover, Kingdom Hearts

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,080

614
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,080
with right here. Most original game, Guitar Hero.

615
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Uh, Guitar Freaks anyone?

616
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I don't know.

617
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Um, best role playing game, Elder Scrolls IV, Oblivion, best shooter, Call of Duty 2,

618

619
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
sports game, Fight Night Round 3.

620
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Can I rant for a minute?

621
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Actually that game was really good looking.

622
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Yeah, yeah, Fight Night is a beautiful looking game.

623
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Um, can I rant for a minute though?

624
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,080
I am sick of G4 farting and it turning up on all these game blogs.

625
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:22,040
I mean seriously, what has G4 done for the gaming industry in the past year?

626
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,000
Not a god damn thing but let downs and disappointment.

627
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,600
Why is the gaming community continuing to give a shit about anything G4 does?

628
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,520
Seriously, don't look at it and maybe it will go away.

629
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,200
We should be focusing our attention on more promising gaming representation such as independent

630
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
radio.

631
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,360
Game politics?

632
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,240
politics.com, which is an impressive website, I love that place, Gameplay HD, that whole

633
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,600
channel which is run by people who actually know things about video games, shock and awe.

634
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,280
I've actually seen good stuff come out of Eurogamer TV too.

635
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
You know what?

636
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,740
And YouTube, and you don't want to know something funny though?

637
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,740
Certain vodcast out there.

638
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,040
This year's G4 was X-Play presents G4.

639
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
Because you know what?

640
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,240
X-Play is the only gaming show on that network anymore.

641
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,700
So seriously, gaming community, I challenge you, stop giving a shit about G4 for like

642
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,900
six months, and maybe something better will rise up, and you might find something better

643
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,820
that is more deserving of your attention than anything that joke of a network producer.

644
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,540
And investors, remember, Orange Lounge Radio TV can happen.

645
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
And you know what?

646
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,140
It won't happen on G4 after my little rant, sorry, but look, that's how I feel, and how

647
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,740
most of the gaming folks feel, I'm sure.

648
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:39,620
I'm just saying, ever since the first G4 that I saw, which was retarded anyways, I was amazed

649
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,580
that Spike and their, you know, award show was actually better than G4, yeah, when it

650
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,920
first came out, I'm like, and this is a network that doesn't even, you know, this isn't a

651
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,560
gaming network and they're doing a better show? I mean, come on. Well, G4's not a gaming

652
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,100
network anymore, and that is a fact. They've come out and said it. It is a guy TV network

653
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:03,420
like Spike, so. I'm just fucking sick of seeing all these, you know, G4 does this and it ends

654
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:10,420
up on Digg. I'm like, G4 can suck my dick. Will that end up on Digg? Probably.

655
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:16,060
G4 comes to Orange John's radio studio and begins to get down on their knees and...

656
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,260
Black Wolf brings up an interesting point. You know Black Wolf has something to say about

657
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:25,140
this. He says All Games was born from G4. Well, not really born from G4, but All Games

658
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,340
as it is today. All Games has been around for 10 years, but of course we all know Scott,

659
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:33,020
who started all games, started G4 with Comcast.

660
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,100
And G4, everything negative I'm saying about G4

661
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,700
is in the past couple years,

662
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,940
pretty much every decision they made

663
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,780
since the tech TV merger, I think we can all agree,

664
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,460
G4, when it first started, had a lot of promise.

665
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,300
It was pretty cool.

666
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,940
And sure, even myself, maybe on this program in the past,

667
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:51,260
I gave Scott and some of the other G4 personalities

668
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,500
a hard time, but no more than some of the internet

669
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,380
gives us a hard time being a podcaster, whatever.

670
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,060
I have nothing but respect for him, for the fact especially that he knew when to jump

671
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,060
ship.

672
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,660
I mean, that speaks a lot of points to Scott's gamer cred and everything, and what All Games

673
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:16,140
is all about, is that he was able to jump from that cable TV guy position and do something

674
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:21,340
that he believed in, and something that is so much more beneficial for the gaming community,

675
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,260
And it makes me so frustrated that All Games does things, you know, Orange Launch Radio,

676
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:32,820
Gamer Andy, Chatterbox, Bobby, everybody does things and nobody seems to care.

677
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Exactly.

678
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:37,340
It's like, you know, if I report a street date or something of something, it doesn't

679
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,340
matter.

680
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,820
But if G4 just says, oh, by the way, this is coming out, it will get posted on every

681
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
single...

682
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,740
If All Games did an award show like G4ia did that, nobody would care.

683
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,060
And it's sad because that award show would be brought to you by real gamers.

684
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,060
gamers not not game for pay anyway that was my little rant that was my little

685
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:04,320
rant sorry I do want to you know give Scott massive kudos oh I absolutely give

686
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,860
Scott massive kudos because the reason the whole reason why we're on board with

687
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:15,060
all games is that you know we believe in his vision you know and just next story

688
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,700
please I'm sorry Scott is full of awesome and

689
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:22,100
Yeah, I know. I know. He's a good guy. Everybody at all games... Lawrence, I couldn't say enough

690
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,780
great things about him. If we could afford to pay him to be our producer, we would. And,

691
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,660
you know, of course Bobby, even though we give him a hard time about the whole, you

692
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,580
know, ChromeHounds and everything thing, he's just, he's...

693
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,860
Bobby is full of loss and can win too.

694
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,540
They're great.

695
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I think, I think I would rather, you know, kind of lump G4 in with the Jacky-poo thing

696
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:47,060
and just basically treat it like that. Let's just not talk about him anymore.

697
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,300
You know what? I'm taking a stand right now.

698
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,460
G4, those words are banned from this program from here on out.

699
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:59,340
Unless they're mentioned in other words and not together.

700
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,820
Yeah, you know what I mean.

701
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,580
Like, for example, we could talk about a G4 Mac.

702
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,340
Okay, that'll be fine, but unless they talk about something really big,

703
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,260
with the exception of one segment that's coming up tonight, because I just

704
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,180
realized there's something coming up in a segment tonight.

705
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,260
after tonight's episode seriously no more G4 news stories

706
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,380
seriously. Gee I wish I had four arms.

707
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:27,260
By the way, poo eater, slink to the chat room, dig story about G4

708
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,060
Did it seriously get dug?

709
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,420
I am, oh god you guys are crazy. Anyway

710
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,780
in news, yes please thank you, there is a

711
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,460
full length feature made especially for Xbox Live that will be coming out on the

712
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:50,460
a marketplace. It's basically a recap of the, so far, Battlestar Galactica series. So if

713
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,940
any of you missed it, go get it. Battlestar Galactica is awesome sauce.

714
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,700
I'm glad we could talk about good cable TV now, because Battlestar Galactica is pretty

715
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,420
frackin' awesome. I mean, it's...

716
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,620
I used to watch the old Battlestar Galactica.

717
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,740
The new one just...

718
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,220
You know what they need to do?

719
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,220
...takes the old one and makes it, like, great.

720
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,460
You know what they need to do for me, though?

721
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,740
Huh.

722
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,180
need to freak and put the new Doctor Who episodes up there for me because the new

723
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,860
doctor is cute and I was because I made the mistake of watching Doctor Who on

724
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:30,820
YouTube and I found out what happens to Rose I'm sorry I love my British sci-fi

725
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:35,740
y'all I think it's a really good idea to put this on Xbox Live you know just it's

726
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,060
It's a marriage of geekdom, it's great.

727
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:45,060
Dear Microsoft, Dr. Who, please, for the win.

728
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,700
All right, well, I know we have some GameStop pride here in studio tonight.

729
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,580
We have Meg Z who works at GameStop, and I know Jamie's Husby.

730
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,220
I know stuff about this too.

731
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,780
Yes, well here it is, I have to mention this, and of course I want to know what you guys

732
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,780
think about this, Louisiana employees of GameStop are suing the retailer for unfair labor practices.

733
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,260
Happened in California too.

734
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,900
Six managers claimed they were forced to work 60 or more hours a week without being paid

735
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,220
overtime and were told they were not eligible for overtime.

736
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,980
EA, by the way, and other major developers lost a court case of something similar.

737
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,780
So what do you guys think of this?

738
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:24,860
It happened in California actually and they changed because this affected my husband's

739
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,540
salary.

740
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:34,300
They actually had to change, I think, something from salary to pay as part of a class action

741
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
lawsuit.

742
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,940
They had to rework because it was violating some California pay and labor law.

743
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,020
In fact, the company I work for has actually had to redo that because they were paying

744
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,540
us by something that's legal in North Carolina and not what's legal in California.

745
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,660
But yeah, that happened out here too.

746
00:44:52,660 --> 00:45:00,200
I think it's already up to seven digs on dig.com, but it doesn't link to anything because the

747
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
podcast isn't up yet.

748
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,660
They should have waited until the podcast was up and then they could link it.

749
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:07,180
We'll see. I don't know. We'll see what happens. That's cute. You guys are so great.

750
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,380
I love, I love O.L. Army.

751
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh, I'm sorry. Megsy was going to have a comment for us. Megsy, what would you want to say on the GameStop thing?

752
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,580
Uh, I like GameStop.

753
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:24,540
I go there. Hi, this is Eris from GameStop. Hi, this is Eris from GameStop. She called me like five times.

754
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,700
Uh, since I'm not a manager, it doesn't really affect me.

755
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,860
Um, so I guess I don't really have anything to say about it.

756
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,040
Well, I don't want you to endanger your job. I was going to say, from your perception,

757
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,720
does it seem unfair? You don't have to answer.

758
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,780
I guess. If you're working 60 more hours a week in any job, you should be paid fairly

759
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,780
for it.

760
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,780
True.

761
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,180
In California, basically, and honestly, this is why I will never move out of state, because

762
00:45:52,180 --> 00:46:00,100
I've worked in the South, and it sucks. In California, you're required to have, for every

763
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,620
Every six hours you work, you're required to have two 15-minute breaks.

764
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,380
If you work over six hours, you get a 30-minute lunch that you're not paid for, of course.

765
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:11,980
If you work over eight hours in a day, unless there are other prior arrangements made, you

766
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,260
get paid overtime.

767
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,220
If you go over ten hours, you get time and a half.

768
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,700
Not time and a half, you get double time.

769
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,860
Yeah, that's law.

770
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,100
Yeah, that's law in California.

771
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,220
And if you work over 40 hours a week, you get overtime pay.

772
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,060
Now, did they specify whether these were, these were, this is probably just a small

773
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,760
detail if these were store managers or assistant managers or just managers.

774
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,760
You just said six managers.

775
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,760
Oh, all right.

776
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,760
Then I really don't know.

777
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,380
But I think that there's actually something similar in regards at least for the weekly

778
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:45,620
over time, but as far as I was aware, I think that most of the GameStop managers are on

779
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,620
salary.

780
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,620
Yeah, they are.

781
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
And they actually...

782
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,620
That's how I understand it.

783
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,540
They eliminated that in California because it was violating labor law.

784
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,540
I see.

785
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,540
But...

786
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,020
GameStop managers in Wisconsin are on salary as far as I can tell.

787
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,840
But if they're working 60 hours a week,

788
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,420
there should be some sort of provision.

789
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:07,460
Because I believe that standard salary pay is on a 45 hour

790
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
a week.

791
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,980
Well, in California, it's 40.

792
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,180
But I think that their old way that they did it

793
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,780
is that 45 hours of pay each paycheck.

794
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,340
And if you're working 60 hours, then no, that doesn't fly.

795
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,020
I'm not sure how it is in Wisconsin.

796
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,180
I'm just a part-time worker.

797
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:31,340
I'm just glad when I get hours, but yeah, I guess that if you are working 60 hours you

798
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,220
should get some sort of compensation because that's just insane.

799
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,220
Yeah.

800
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,260
Alright, let's keep it moving.

801
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:44,180
Anyways, speaking of disappointments, PlayStation 3.

802
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,460
Not going to be playable at Lipzig.

803
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:52,500
So all you German fans of the PlayStation 3 out there, sorry.

804
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,740
Sony wants to save all their surprises for the Tokyo Game Show. No word if other developers

805
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:04,380
are showing off any playable Playstation 3 games. It says, but if Sony decides that they

806
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,620
are not going to show the unit, you can bet that a decent amount of the companies will

807
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:13,580
follow suit. So what's this mean? This means that they're going to have to pull out some

808
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,900
like serious leprechaun magic to get this thing to be impressive by the time Tokyo Game

809
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,620
show comes around, that's all I gotta say. So, I don't know. Not too surprised that they're

810
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:30,140
not having stuff playable, because they only need a more negative press. But I am surprised

811
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,140
that they're not gonna, well, who knows. Maybe they will detail some more stuff about their,

812
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:42,140
you know, online service and that kind of thing. But no game sucks.

813
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:51,420
Well, speaking of that particular little convention, there actually is an Ubisoft lineup that was

814
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,420
posted.

815
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:58,380
If anybody cares about Ubisoft, which I do, because I think Ubisoft does, they do some

816
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,380
happy.

817
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,380
Ubisoft FTW.

818
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,380
They're cool.

819
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,380
Yeah.

820
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,500
Dark Messiah of Might and Magic will be out Fall 2006.

821
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,520
There's also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent that has single player multiplayer mode

822
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:23,960
on Xbox 360, PC, and this is Xbox 360, I'm sorry, Call of Juarez Western Shooter playable

823
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,260
on PC September 2006.

824
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,160
The Settlers 2 The Next Generation, I haven't heard of The Settlers 1 to be honest, it's

825
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,560
on PC, it's a strategy game, no wonder.

826
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,580
Settlers construction construction based strategy game playable on the DS

827
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,160
horses with a Z riding adventure playable on PC

828
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,980
open season action adventure playable on PlayStation 2 and

829
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,480
Also

830
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,560
There were

831
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:58,040
numbers of the international development team available there who are giving some of the background into how games are created created and

832
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,840
Speaking out on new projects showing playable games

833
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:08,840
games. They also have a playable of Dark Messiah available there.

834
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,920
That's pretty cool. Some interesting things coming from Sony again, talking about their

835
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,040
online service for the PS3. Well, there's also an online service that's supposed to

836
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:27,040
be coming to the PSP in the form of an iTunes-like service to download movies and video, and

837
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,360
and of course some music and stuff. So anyways,

838
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,760
it's kind of interesting though,

839
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,840
right now they've got a total of 120 games coming out

840
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,000
by the end of the year for the PSP, so that's pretty good.

841
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,240
It is, you know, that service right now is being held up,

842
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,400
the download service for the videos and the music

843
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,440
is being held up by the digital rights management that they haven't

844
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,440
quite figure out how to implement yet. What's kind of cool though is

845
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,200
they're talking about the GPS system as well. They're going to be adding

846
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,800
use for both mapping,

847
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,920
you know, your standard GPS mapping, and also gameplay elements.

848
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,200
So some games will support GPS. I think actually Hot Shots Golf, the new ones

849
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:13,760
coming out,

850
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,520
will support that. They're also talking about the camera add-on

851
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,440
is going to have a microphone built in. It'll be able to take still pictures and video.

852
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,820
and the future iterations of the PSP likely

853
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:30,220
are likely but Sony is believing that the device will have a 10-year lifespan. This is all

854
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,140
coming from Kotaku. They actually had an

855
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:35,660
interview that they did with John Kohler,

856
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,680
the senior marketing manager for the PSP.

857
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:44,360
So, it's kinda interesting. I want to know when their download service for the games is

858
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,540
coming out because if they're having trouble with the movies

859
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,620
and the music, games is gonna be another thing too.

860
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,980
And, and do you really think this is gonna take off? I don't know.

861
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:58,820
Ehh, ehh.

862
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:02,020
What, Maisie? Like I said, I've got, I've got a

863
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,300
vendetta against Sony and the PSP is one of the things I hate most about Sony.

864
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,540
Why? Um, because, let's see,

865
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,660
let's see, um, well looking at it from,

866
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,060
if you just look at it hypothetically, it's a great system, you know, it does all this stuff,

867
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,540
but it seems like it almost does too much and everything is kind of half done,

868
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,540
and it seems like they're just it's just all this other stuff is just overkill

869
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,500
and it's gonna all be half done just kinda like the movies and the music and

870
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,060
the games

871
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,140
it's like uh... pick something and do it well? yeah it's it's the business world has it

872
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,500
saying that if you do one thing

873
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,860
well then you've succeeded if you do three things like halfway then

874
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,420
you've failed and that's the PSP

875
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,460
you know it's almost like the same mistake the N-Gage made because

876
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,420
and I hate to compare the PSP to the N-Gage because I give PSP a lot more credit than that

877
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,660
yeah but the N-Gage was kinda you know it it tried to be was it a phone was it a

878
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,740
gaming system and

879
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:54,860
But it just was a hockey puck. Yeah. Well and the other thing too about it is and I mean having oh

880
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,860
I have two PSPs, so

881
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:03,300
They're really to be honest isn't a game that you gotta have for the PSP

882
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:09,740
I mean, I play Grand Theft Auto religiously and that's pretty much it. That's my one game. I buy each year

883
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,740
I mean

884
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,780
but you know what that's pretty sad because I don't even play the DS that much and I've bought more than one game for this

885
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:23,320
year and I plan on buying a lot more coming soon but there just isn't any games out there

886
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:28,700
that come out that are really great and it's just why would I waste my money on this stuff

887
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:34,120
and that's the other thing too the games are more expensive than the DS so great that you

888
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,460
know it's a more powerful system but it's just I don't know they're not making good

889
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,000
software for it.

890
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,880
I actually have to, though, give mad props to DJ Geni, the Wonder Swan.

891
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,360
The swan kicks all your portable asses.

892
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,380
As much as I love the Wonder Swan, I still prefer PSP, even then.

893
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,380
Even then.

894
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,380
I love my Wonder Swan.

895
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:55,380
I like the PSP.

896
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,380
It just...

897
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,380
It's...

898
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,380
Neo Geo Pocket Color!

899
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,720
I like the PSP, but I agree it spreads itself a little too thin to try to do too much, then

900
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
focus on the games.

901
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,880
But for some people, that's what they need.

902
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,400
As far as the N-Gage reference, I played the Game.com more than I played our N-Gage, and

903
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,560
We gave it away.

904
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,200
The analogy I use a lot with the PSP when trying to explain to someone is it's like

905
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,580
when you go to Thanksgiving dinner and you load up your plate with all sorts of stuff

906
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,040
like everything, way too much of anything, and then you sit down and you try to eat it

907
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,480
and you just can't finish it.

908
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:25,480
And you get sick.

909
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,480
Well, that too.

910
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,080
But it's like, it's all just half done.

911
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,720
Whereas the DS, you got a bunch of turkey and you can finish all your turkey and it's

912
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,860
really good.

913
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,360
And then you have a nice nap when you're done.

914
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,360
Yeah, then you fall asleep.

915
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,960
All right, I'm sure we'll get some emails on that.

916
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,640
So we look forward to reading those.

917
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,080
In the meantime, we're gonna shift gears here a little bit on Orange Lounge Radio.

918
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,720
We're gonna do something we have not done in a long time, at least six months.

919
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:54,120
But you know what, kids, it's a slow news week.

920
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,080
And all things considered, it's a pretty slow news week.

921
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,320
And it's time for us here on Orange Lounge Radio to bring back

922
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,280
an old segment that we used to do back in the day when we did a three hour live show

923
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
and a podcast and all that stuff.

924
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,720
Quite.

925
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:08,480
All right.

926
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,780
So are we ready?

927
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,520
Because I think, Loki, are you filming this?

928
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,040
I don't know.

929
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,000
I think so, because they wanted more film for the station.

930
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,080
All right, well, here we go.

931
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,760
Here we go, whenever you guys are ready.

00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:10,120

00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,120
I'm waiting on our chat room person to send me an answer there.

993
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,120

00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
Alright, we're just waiting on our chat room.

Our chat person.

1002
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,120
In chat room, I am not looking at your answers.

1003
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,120
I'm doing this all by myself, okay?

1004
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
Oh, you're not looking at chat room answers, doing it all by yourself?

00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120

Alright, there we go, we have an answer.

1007
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,120
Okay, so Magus, what is your answer?

1008
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,120
Let me read the question one more time.

1009
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,120
Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.

1010
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,120
It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house Nelly screaming,

1011
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,120
Matt, put down the blank so we can have Whoopi!

1012
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,120
Magus, what's your answer?

1013
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,120
Matt, put down the res trans vibrator.

1014
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,120
Res trans vibrator so we can have Whoopi!

1015
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:03,560
We can have Whoopi, and let's see what contestant number two in chat DMN said, said, Matt, put

1016
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,920
down the Wii so we can have Whoopi.

1017
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,920
The Wii.

1018
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,920
All right, Dark Soccer.

1019
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
I said Transvibrator.

1020
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Transvibrator!

1021
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,920
One point for Magus.

1022
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:13,920
Good job.

1023
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:14,920
That's crazy.

1024
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,440
And yes, we're writing it down in studio and she does have that written down on her little

1025
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
piece of paper.

1026
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,600
I had that written down ten minutes ago.

1027
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,720
All right, let's see.

1028
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,520
Loki, what did you have?

1029
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:35,520
Well, seeing as the Wii isn't out yet, and also the Res Transfiberator, I don't own that.

1030
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,520
That's what you say.

1031
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,520
I said the Xbox 360 controller.

1032
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,520
Xbox 360 controller, what a boring answer.

1033
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
What a boring, boring answer.

1034
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Okay, my answer was put down the Wii so we can make Whoopi.

1035
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,520
So I matched with DMN so it's all tied up one to one.

1036
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
Let's see.

1037
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,260
Megzi, what did you put? Put down the...

1038
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:57,760
Corn.

1039
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,760
Corn?!

1040
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,560
The corn?!

1041
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,760
I don't want to know.

1042
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,920
You're only going to get that if you've seen Sensitive Pornograph.

1043
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,800
No, no, no, it was in my sexual harassment.

1044
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,000
Nerds! Nerds!

1045
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,640
Alright, Chris, Matt, put down the...

1046
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:18,640
Third hand.

1047
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,120
Third hand, not a match.

1048
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
I didn't know.

1049
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:25,580
Alright, that's alright. You're still hot, so we'll give it to you.

1050
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:29,700
Alright, but it doesn't help out our chat room DMN or it doesn't help out

1051
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,920
Magus any. It's still one to one though, which is a higher score than usual for a

1052
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,080
match game. So here we go.

1053
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,480
We're ready for question number two. You ready Magus?

1054
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,200
Any choice words for DMN?

1055
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,640
Oh, you're going down. Alright, here it is. Question number two.

1056
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,840
Oops, no music yet. Dark Sakura

1057
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,920

1058
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,280

1060
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,880
any video game to entertain themselves on the trip there

1061
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,960

Not a match though, not a match. Good answer from myself, but not a match, sad to say.

1081
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,340
Magsy, what did you say?

01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:08,340

That was a...

1087
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,340
It's a massive intro.

1088
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:20,340
There are too many giggling girls on tonight's program. Way too many.

1089
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,340
I remember those emails we got back in the day about the giggling co-host.

1090
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,340
Oh, this is revenge.

1091
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:29,640
All right, here it is.

1092
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,640
Question number three, boys and girls.

01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,640
You ready for question number three?

1094
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,120
It's still tied up one to one, all right?

1095
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,260
Here it is.

1096
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,740
Question numero tres.

1097
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:42,320
Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.

1098
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:49,980
Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.

1099
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,980

1100

There's a little bit of a delay. He's trying to think of a good answer.

1108
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,980
Here's that question one more time. We are playing video game match game tonight on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,980

1130
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:28,180
I actually said basically a baby bottle in a blanket because only babies would be scared

1131
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,780
of Silent Hill yet, jackass.

1132
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,780
Boo!

1133
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,780
Ouch.

1134
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,780
Burn!

1135
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:34,780
Ouch.

1136
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,780
Ouch.

1137
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,780
You guys are very cruel.

1138
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:42,420
that's not a match. My answer was Rob better bring some Guinness because if I'm

1139
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:47,760
drinking it's okay. It calms me down. Guinness goes well with everything. Meg Z

1140
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,780
we're looking for Depends or adult or Depends or clean underwear. What'd you

1141
01:06:50,780 --> 01:07:00,460
say? Pyramid head plushies. That's cute. I like the way you think Meg Z. Chris we

1142
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,380
have another do we have another match what'd you say bring some? I said a

1143
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:04,860
blanket a

1144
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:08,980
Blanket I get really really scared by those things. I'm a big pussy, too

1145
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:18,300
Here I don't know if I want the lesbian on the show to be talking about what a big

1146
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:25,020
Yes, you did um let's go back to the scoreboard where DMN has two points and

1147
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:31,660
23rd Magus has one point so Magus you're black and behind you got two more questions to catch up you ready

1148
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:32,660
Ready?

1149
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,660
Sure.

1150
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,660
Alright, here we go.

1151
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:36,060
Here comes question number four.

1152
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,180
Question number four.

1153
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:41,940
And I apologize for this after the earlier rant, but these match game questions were

1154
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,940
written in advance.

1155
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:48,340
Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently, yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.

1156
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:52,660
What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled

1157
01:07:52,660 --> 01:08:01,260
he said about Adam Sessler, man, does that guy need blank.

1158
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,180
jack thompson said about adam sesler after that interview man that guy meets

1159
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,820
blank

1160
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:13,820

1161
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,620

01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:20,820

1163
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,060
now we're just waiting on uh...

1164
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:27,200
dm and there in chat maggots you have an answer you're a girl

1165
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,640

01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,520

1169
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,080
here it is we got our answer alright

1170
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,880
Jack Thompson was on attack at the show recently yelling back and forth with

1171
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,860
Adam Sessler we didn't see though is after the interview jacks feathers were

1172
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,680
so ruffled

1173
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,200
he said about Adam Sessler, man does that guy need what?

1174
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,280
Magus? Yowie. Yowie!

1175
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:06,280
Wow, Chris Amazy gasped at that answer

1176
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,240
I think that might be a bad sign though because that usually means they

1177
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:09,960
didn't think of it

1178
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,960
DMN says that guy needs

1179
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:17,840
to get laid, says DMN. Let's see if there's any matches here in studio

1180
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,960
DarkSakura, what was your answer? A good ass-hammering

1181
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,600
A good ass-hammering. Is that a match with to get laid?

1182
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:29,320
yeah to match with to get laid do you think it's book it do you think it's no

1183
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:33,000
cuz actually honestly it's a half point on the yaoi side because he would be the

1184
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,640
recipient instead of watching it let's give a half point to each we'll give a

1185
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,960
half point to each how's that sound why only point to either one yeah let's do

1186
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,560
that is actually getting laid that is technically getting late all right well

1187
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:50,800
this is getting laid none well we'll have to give it to DMN sorry maggots but

1188
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,360
we'll give you a half point unless they've got a mirror up or something

1189
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,360
Alright.

1190
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,360
But I didn't specify.

1191
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,360
That's the ruling of the judges.

1192
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,360
So be it.

1193
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,360
Loki.

1194
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,360
Um.

1195
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,680
He needs to get shot in the face because, wow!

1196
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,680
Shot in the face.

1197
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:05,680
Don't hold back, Loki.

1198
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,840
Well, that's because, you know, Jack Thompson says all gamers need...

1199
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,840
Oh!

1200
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
Okay.

1201
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,840
Okay.

1202
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,840
Okay.

1203
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,840
Good.

1204
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,840
That'd be irony right there.

1205
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,840
Good justification.

1206
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,840
Alright.

1207
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,840
Um.

1208
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,840
Not a match, though.

1209
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,840
My answer was man.

1210
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,840
Does Adam Sessler need...personality was my answer.

1211
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,840
Personality.

1212
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:27,480
unfortunately not a match

1213
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,280
state enough period was he talked with the big c

1214
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,640
it's adam sessler man does he need to sit on a tack to sit on a tack

1215
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,640
with that count with getting laid out of it i don't i don't think it back in

1216
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,260
this year we

1217
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,040
maybe

1218
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,880
it maybe it would count if it was sex with kevin pereira but i'll bump

1219
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,080
all right i think that i i'm sorry kevin i didn't mean it

1220
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,680
You're still cute. Alright, Chris.

1221
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,520
I actually said butt sex, which is...

1222
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,160
Butt sex would yow with to get laid, so...

1223
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:02,000
Come on, come on, come on. That would be yow. Yes, yes.

1224
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,880
I was thinking of yow, but...

1225
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,840
Okay, okay. So we'll give 23 Magus another half point. So Magus has two points...

1226
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,000
It doesn't involve a paddle, does it?

1227
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,160
Magus has two points and DMN has four.

1228
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,160
What?

1229
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,160
DMN is on it tonight.

1230
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,120
DMN is on it tonight. Alright, you have one...

1231
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,120
Surprise is butt sex!

1232
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,500
You have one more chance

1233
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,940
Magus, you ready? Here it is, the last question.

1234
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:29,400
Did you hear about yet another

1235
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:34,760
new flap on the Wii? When asked for comment our dear pal Reggie told us

1236
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,760
Oh, that last compartment. That's where you can store the blank.

1237
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,760
Celebrities are thinking. Ding! Jinks.

1238
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:01,760
Uh, Loki? Was that a ding? Ding. Alright, a ding. I'm just waiting on our, uh, chatroom

1239
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:12,160
player there. Magus, don't give us your answer, but do you have one?

1240
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,680
Yep.

1241
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:15,560
You gonna get two points with it? Because that's what you need.

1242
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,760
I don't know, can I?

1243
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't get smart with me, asshole, or you're gonna lose this game.

1244
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,200
Hey, someone has to be smarter around here.

1245
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:37,740
Oh, here we go, here it is, fifth question.

1246
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,440
Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?

1247
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,760
When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, oh that last compartment, that's

1248
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:49,400
where you can store the trans vibrator.

1249
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,400
Okay, let's see

1250
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:58,900
DMN says that's where you can store the saved money get it because the we see ah

1251
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:06,880
Good answer good answer, but may not match because we're idiots apparently Dark Sakura. What'd you say lube?

1252
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,760
You need some loop for your we

1253
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:17,440
I don't know what you got planned for your we Dark Sakura. Okay, uh Loki

1254
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,840
Where would a match game be without this answer?

1255
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,440
That last compartment is the story of the Iraqi suicide babies.

1256
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,440
I was in on that joke when it started.

1257
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,640
Oh my god, that joke is like a hundred episodes old, literally.

1258
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,640
Wow, like nobody listening tonight is going to get that because all our old listeners are coming up.

1259
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on a second.

1260
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,840
Yeah, we have our grandpa in our contest right now, Magus.

1261
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,140
Young whippersnappers?

1262
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:43,640
Alright.

1263
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,840
Bite my ass.

1264
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,920
Here we go. My answer was

1265
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:51,200
that's where you can store the weed.

1266
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,520
You put your weed in there.

1267
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,840
You put your weed in there. Get it?

1268
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,040
Weed.

1269
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,120
Meganzie. Lesbian porn. Lesbian porn. Not a match.

1270
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:09,760
Chris. Drugs. Drugs!

1271
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,680
Unfortunately, no points scored there, so let's look at the scoreboard and tally it

1272
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:15,680
up.

1273
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:22,280
Magus, you have two points, which is very good for Orange Lawn's Radio Match Game to

1274
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,400
even get on the damn scoreboard.

1275
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:29,520
So you should be very proud of your effort, but unfortunately, DMN kicked your butt by

1276
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,520
scoring four points.

1277
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:31,520
He broke the record.

1278
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,520
Yeah, he broke the record.

1279
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,520
The record was two and a half.

1280
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,640
All right, congratulations DMN, you're a winner and you get a space in our top eight

1281
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,640
on Myspace.

1282
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,720
Bump Freeze Pop for you, because they have like 11 billion friends, they don't need

1283
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,720
anymore.

1284
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:48,880
Magus, you get a clump of dirt as the runner-up prize, and we'll give that to you at the

1285
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:49,880
next show, okay?

1286
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,880
We've dusted in your backyard.

1287
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,840
Well, fine, no special gifts for you guys.

1288
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,840
Alright.

1289
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,640
Magus, anything you want to say while we have you on the line?

1290
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,060
It's on, DMN.

1291
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,800
Another time, another place, it's on.

1292
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,120
Did you have fun on tonight's program?

1293
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,240
Oh yeah, even though I did get served.

1294
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,720
You did get served, I'm sorry to say.

1295
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,720
I have fun and enjoy the dirt

1296
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Yes, dirt is good. All right. I hear it's it. I hear it's a growing investment

1297
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:19,400
Hey dirt gator. Yeah, it's gay dirt because we all touched it. Oh, all right. Bye

1298
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,760
No, no, all right

1299
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:25,080
He gets a good old-fashioned orange lounge hanging up on at the end there for playing there

1300
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,800
All right, so DMN is gonna earn a space in our top eight. What did you guys think?

1301
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,480
Okay, I'm curious because we haven't done the game in a long time and our podcast audience hasn't really gotten to see the game

1302
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:40,160
So I'm curious what what'd you guys think of the game? Was that fun? Was it stupid?

1303
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:45,000
Was it a waste of your time? Give us feedback in chat and in mailbag. That's old-school ORR for you

1304
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,720
It was a fun stupid waste of time

1305
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,640
But anyway, we do still have a little more gaming news before we finish up the show

1306
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,760
And of course, we're gonna open up the skype line very soon for your general calls. Loki. Yes

1307
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,760
speaking of games and

1308
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,840
Anyways, we got to talk about Sony again

1309
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,960
Why because we have to and we got to talk about the PSP and we got to talk about firmware updates

1310
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:12,080
Because with PSP's firmware 2.8, there are some more problems.

1311
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:19,520
Not only is it Sony's latest attempt to stop Homebrew on the PSP, but guess what?

1312
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,040
You may not be able to browse certain websites because now the brand new web browser not

1313
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,240
only allows the developer to use the site to obtain specific information on how you

1314
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:36,860
got to their website. More importantly, they can check what firmware you have and deny

1315
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:38,440
you access based on that.

1316
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:44,680
I have a suggestion for the homebrew websites then. Put a keyword on your site that says

1317
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:51,600
porcupine. Whenever anyone puts in porcupine, it brings up homebrew games.

1318
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,720
And all the information on porcupine she ever wanted to know.

1319
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,720
Put in porcupine in video game and there you go.

1320
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,740
So, but I mean

1321
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,760
I assume that this is only for like manufacturer

1322
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:10,780
websites or something like that. You know stuff that's pertaining to games.

1323
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,800
You know official sites and that kind of thing. Probably not gonna be if you're running

1324
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,820
Flash games or something like that. Probably not gonna run into a problem with this. But

1325
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,840
still I mean come on. What more do they really need to do

1326
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:28,240
to block stuff, I mean the web browser sucks as it is, and do we really need to deny people

1327
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:33,760
more browsing on there? I don't know. More than likely anyways we wouldn't be able to

1328
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,760
pull up the page you're trying to block anyways, so whatever.

1329
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:44,940
Alright, well I have one more story there, are you going to upgrade Loki? Or screw it,

1330
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:50,200
I've got two, so yeah I can, okay. Alright we've got one more story for you guys, and

1331
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:54,180
then we're gonna open up the skype line for general feedback so you can start

1332
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:57,040
hammering away there the username is orange lounge radio or you can always

1333
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,040
call us on the landline nine one six two two six ninety sixty seven but please

1334
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,400
keep in mind that's a toll call it's not an 800 call so if you're not paying the

1335
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:11,920
bill mom is gonna get very angry with you says Meg Z and like less last night

1336
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:18,960
all right sorry let's uh I want to do a story real quick here on dead or alive

1337
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:25,960
There are some new details, and of course our in-house lesbians would love to hear some more details on Dead or Alive Xtreme 2, right?

1338
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:36,960
It sounds like it will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show, and Japan's Famichu Magazine got a quick look at the game, and of course, you know, the trailer's online.

1339
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,960
Excluding Beach Volleyball, the game engine is mostly complete.

1340
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,960
For Beach Volleyball, we had the previous title, so we left it until the end.

1341
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,160
left it until the end but since we're at last finishing up the other areas we're

1342
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,560
at the point where it's about time we start making the new beach volleyball and

1343
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,280
that comes from Itagaki. Let's see, the real mode of playing DOAX2 is the

1344
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:00,800
vacation mode and this will string a bunch of games together. You start off

1345
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:07,600
with a jet ski and an old camera. The camera takes pictures of the girls and

1346
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,560
of course as you can imagine the jet skis uses jet skis so it's not going to be much

1347
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,200
more than just volleyball, which is why they've dropped the name, Dead or Alive, and it looks

1348
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,720
like Jamie is showing screenshots to our in-house lesbians.

1349
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,960
What do you think of Dead or Alive Xtreme 2?

1350
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,640
I just got a boner.

1351
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:38,480
Even though I'm the gay guy and I'm fascinated with this game, I think it's great.

1352
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:43,240
You're also talking to lesbians who happen to be in graphic arts and are taking art classes

1353
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:48,120
and just the colors and the skin tones.

1354
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,120
That's pretty...

1355
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,120
Yeah, I got a bone.

1356
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:59,000
All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what they have to say.

1357
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,720
We love interacting with our listeners and we're going to take some phone calls right

1358
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,720
now.

1359
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,720
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1360
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Who's this?

1361
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,720
Hello, can you hear me?

1362
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,720
Yes, who is this?

1363
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:10,000
This is NintendoManiac64, I haven't called in a while.

1364
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,280
Hi NintendoManiac64, what's on your mind buddy?

1365
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,720
A couple things. First off, Megsy

1366
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,320
actually has a lot of similar interests to me, like she likes Nintendo games, and her opinion on

1367
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,160
Sony is pretty much the same as mine. Sony, die.

1368
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,680
So a NintendoManiac agrees with you, it loves the Nintendo and Sony can go die.

1369
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,960
Yeah, Sony can suck my dick. Are you just trying to get points with the

1370
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,640
lesbians?

1371
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:41,840
What else is on your mind, buddy?

1372
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,960
One thing I've been dying to ask you this, please don't hang up on me.

1373
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:51,760
Hey, guy, what do you think about straight sex?

1374
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,900
Try a joke that's not like 30 years old on this program.

1375
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,880
I'm not going to hang up on you, but seriously, we have plenty of new jokes.

1376
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,960
to tonight's match game there's a lot there for those that have no idea what

1377
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,520
we're talking about you've got to go back to like an old to go episode back

1378
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,120

clips on YouTube that you want to point out?

1383
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,760
I just thought of that.

1384
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,760
All right.

1385
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,760
I'm going to let you go, NintendoManiac64, but thanks for the call.

1386
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,760
Okay.

1387
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,760
All right.

1388
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:39,760
Good job failing.

1389
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,760
Boom!

1390
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,760
Failed.

1391
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:49,840
He's a nice kid, but seriously, leave the inside jokes.

1392
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
Hello.

1393
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:51,840
It's Raven's Dolphin.

1394
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,840
Well, hi, Raven's Dolphin.

1395
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,840
I hadn't even said hello yet, but hi.

1396
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,840
How you doing?

1397
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,840
What's on your mind?

1398
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,640
more lesbians

1399
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,640
you know what the lesbian gamers can have their own podcast as far as I'm

1400
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,000
concerned

1401
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,720
this reminds me of an episode of Raw, I'm sorry to bring up wrestling but

1402
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:10,860
it just reminds me of like hot lesbian action just kissing and all kinds of

1403
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:11,600
craziness

1404
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,940
look I want this on the record we're not doing that we're making the

1405
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,560
lesbian thing kind of a joke tonight because you know

1406
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,680
if we did really have like a hot lesbian podcast people would be like oh my god

1407
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,880
I've got a boner da da da

1408
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,360
but the reality is is that what we're really trying to do here is that you

1409
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,680
know we're just gamers

1410
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:34,600
of all types shapes sizes sexualities colors religions

1411
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,600
it's just about the games and we just let you know we poke fun at each other

1412
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,760
for you know some of those

1413
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,200
other stereotypes but I I love how this show can show

1414
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,360
that there's all different types of gamers and we all get along

1415
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,520
you know our chat room is very diverse so

1416
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,160
that being said are you guys ever gonna make out tonight?

1417
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:57,560
No, I'm kidding. Make out! It's radio. Alright, seriously, do you have anything gaming related you want to share?

1418
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,360
Yeah, they were talking about the PSP being like a big paperweight.

1419
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,360
Ah, what do you think? I think different. I love my PSP.

1420
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:10,320
Why do you love your PSP? Well, I don't own an iPod

1421
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:14,480
and the Apple Store didn't open up yet, so I'm still stuck with it

1422
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,320
for a while. Yeah, like Chris is all, where do you live? I live in New Jersey.

1423
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,600
they just don't understand. There's no

1424
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,000
Apple Store in New Jersey? There is but it's like

1425
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,840
two hours away and they're opening one on the boardwalk where I live

1426
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,600
so it's like heaven finally. Oh okay.

1427
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,240
So but you're not using it sounds like you don't really use your PSP as a

1428
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,260
gaming device you use it as an MP3 player primarily.

1429
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,880
Yeah I use it for everything mostly. Hmm interesting okay.

1430
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,740
I'd like to kind of try to redeem myself about my

1431
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:59,740
you know, comments about Sony, don't get me wrong, I hate them, but, uh, the, the PSP, uh, it's, it's a, it's a good system if you're looking for it to do all that stuff, but, since, but like...

1432
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:02,740
But you, you're, you're straight up games. You want games.

1433
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:07,740
Yeah, I want, if I'm gonna buy, if I'm gonna drop $250 on a gaming system, I want it to play games.

1434
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:11,740
Alright, are you gonna buy Star Fox Command for the DS?

1435
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,740
Maybe.

1436
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:13,740
Are you a Star Fox fan?

1437
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:15,740
Um, not so much.

1438
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:16,740
Oh, okay.

1439
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:21,340
But I can't wait to get my hands on that thing, I love it.

1440
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:24,260
So you have a little love for DS and PSP then?

1441
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:28,700
I do, I own two DS's and I own two DSP's.

1442
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,660
Now you're just a hardcore nerd.

1443
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,460
I like you!

1444
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,460
Chris likes you.

1445
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,460
I like you.

1446
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:40,660
Oh yay, yay, love from lesbians, I'm not going to die happy.

1447
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,580
By the way Raven's Dolphin, no offense, but that's the only time in your entire life you're

1448
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:46,540
going to get a lesbian to say that to you, just so you know.

1449
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:52,420
know what you're right treasure this moment forever and remember orange launch

1450
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:59,100
radio brought it to you anything else you want to share with our listeners

1454
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,780
You are hosting a podcast about gaming.

1455
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:19,780
Good point.

1456
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,780
Good point.

1457
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:21,780
I am pretty hardcore in my nerd-im.

1458
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:23,860
Orensons Radio, who's this?

1459
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,540
This is Black Boy, James.

1460
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:26,900
Hi, Black Boy James.

1461
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,900
What's on your mind?

1462
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:30,580
I had a question about the PSP.

1463
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:33,740
Okay, what did you want to know?

1464
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:38,540
Their firmware updates, they include something else, like something to enhance the functionality

1465
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,380
of the PSP, and I was just curious, was there anything like that with this update?

1466
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,680
Loki, you're my man for the PSP updates.

1467
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:45,680
What do you think?

1468
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:51,320
Well 2.8 was video podcast RSS oh this is that one.

1469
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:57,840
So you can watch the one up show on your PSP yippity yay hooray or you can watch hope is

1471
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
emo.

1472
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:11,440
Okay maybe maybe I'll do that or maybe me and Gregor will go find a pizza box to live

1473
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,440
in.

1474
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:17,240
All right, so does that sound worth it to you, black boy?

1475
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,720
Not really.

1476
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:19,720
I didn't think so.

1477
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:22,680
Just use iTunes for your podcasting needs.

1478
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,680
Yes, seriously.

1479
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,520
I use my iPod for my podcasts.

1480
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,300
Oh, you're fancy enough to own a color video iPod.

1481
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,300
I'm too broke, unfortunately.

1482
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,300
I have the old school one.

1483
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:32,300
Yeah, I have an old school iPod.

1484
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:33,300
It was like a smooth gift to myself.

1485
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:34,300
I have Kristin's.

1486
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:39,440
Anything else you wanted to share with our listeners?

1487
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,760
I do, actually.

1488
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:46,020
I wanted to say to your guests tonight that they get major love and win for being lesbians

1489
01:26:46,020 --> 01:26:49,460
and not frightening me.

1490
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,180
You don't mind me saying, you're a gay gamer, correct?

1491
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:53,180
I am.

1492
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:56,460
I know that because you're on All Games Interactive all the time and they pick on you so horribly

1493
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:57,460
for that.

1494
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:58,460
I'm so sorry.

1495
01:26:58,460 --> 01:27:02,540
Every time I listen to freaking Ron, I cringe.

1496
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:06,520
Anyway, no, I love Ron, but seriously, he needs to stop all the gay jokes.

1497
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:07,520
I don't love Ron.

1498
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,520
I know, we all do.

1499
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,800
I can't wait to come back to Arena and have more Ron love.

1500
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,800
Not like that!

1501
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,800
Not like that!

1502
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,040
I'd pay money for that.

1503
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,160
Are you loving our friend Black Boy here?

1504
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,160
I do.

1505
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:26,280
Keep in mind, most of the extreme lesbian jokes that we've been doing have been just

1506
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:27,280
that.

1507
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,280
Just jokes.

1508
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,480
We're fully clothed.

1509
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:36,720
I know that's disappointing, but we are cuddling if you want to keep it.

1510
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,720
But I like you.

1511
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,880
Thank you. Alright. I like you too.

1512
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:46,680
See, it's like that old rumor is being proven wrong tonight.

1513
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,240
Lesbians and gays can get along. Who the hell started that?

1514
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:53,240
My first boyfriend was gay and I loved him.

1515
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:57,520
No, I think some of my boyfriends are probably gay too.

1516
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,400
We gotta take some more calls here, try to get it back to games.

1517
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,680
Thank you Black Boy for your call. We really appreciate it, okay?

1518
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,240
Thank you. Tell the folks at Arena we said hi. I will.

1519
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,860
later. Alright, let's go to one more call here on the Skype line.

1520
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:15,120
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Good evening, this is DMN.

1521
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,160
DMN, congratulations on your match game win earlier this evening.

1522
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:21,800
Yeah, apparently the 23rd Meg is once my neck now.

1523
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:24,800
Well, he'll get over it. What did you all want to say tonight?

1524
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,240
I am bitching about World of Warcraft.

1525
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:32,880
Why? You're not a big fan of this new news?

1526
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,200
Well, I've never been a fan of World of Warcraft.

1527
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:41,840
Mainly more so because I've got a roommate who's very hardcore into it and I don't understand

1528
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:47,880
why it takes them almost two years to release an update to the damn game when, you know,

1529
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,280
pretty much everybody and their mom's at the highest level.

1530
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,000
World of Warcraft though, it patches all the frickin' time.

1531
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,520
Yeah, but there's a difference between a patch and an expansion, I mean patches just adjust

1532
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,400
certain things and piss certain people off, you have an expansion it's a whole new way

1533
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,180
of opening things up, if you just do a patch it's the same map.

1534
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,180
There's nothing new.

1535
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:11,140
But they're not changing anything with this DMN, they're only, I mean they're adding new

1536
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:15,100
stuff that's going to have a slightly different spin to it.

1537
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:21,140
True, but I don't see anything about it, they're saying, oh you can go up to level what, 70

1538
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:22,140
now?

1539
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,300
I'm like, I don't care, it's 10 more levels.

1540
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:29,500
Druunami in our chat room, your good pal after tonight's match game battle says, WoW doesn't

1541
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,300
end at 60, patches add content.

1542
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:36,900
Okay, well like I said, I don't play it, so I don't know.

1543
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:40,620
I just know the basics, I know 60's the highest, blah blah blah.

1544
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,740
Is there any MMO you do enjoy?

1545
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:49,040
Uh, Gunbound, but that's not really an MMO anymore.

1546
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,860
But no, I'm not a huge fan of MMOs.

1547
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:57,360
I'm intrigued by the, I guess, the society within them, but not a fan of playing them

1548
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,360
now.

1549
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,360
Alright.

1550
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,200
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1551
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,840
I am I was born in Wisconsin today so to hear somebody else from Wisconsin on the

1552
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,280

01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:19,780

1577
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:20,780
What?

1578
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,780
Rob.

1579
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:22,780
I'm gonna cut you.

1580
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:23,780
Promise?

1581
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:24,780
Oh, baby.

1582
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:25,780
With that pyramid head plushie of love.

1583
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:26,780
Ooh!

1584
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:28,780
Any last minute stories tonight?

1585
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:29,780
Loki.

1586
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:30,780
Oh, I got one.

1587
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,780
And then Darkstalker, you have one too?

1588
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:33,780
Um, no.

1589
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:34,780
Okay, well Loki then.

1590
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:35,780
Okie dokie.

1591
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:40,780
Of course, would it be without a show where we talk about what's coming out in Xbox Live's

1592
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,780
arcade or demos?

1593
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:52,460
Viva La Revolution, or better just cause, the demo's coming out on the 24th of August,

1594
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,100
and actually the game looks pretty sweet, it's kind of Grand Theft Auto meets Far Cry

1595
01:31:56,100 --> 01:32:01,420
Another thing though is we know that the F.E.A.R. demo is coming soon and the rumor is it's

1596
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:06,700
going to be in the next official Xbox magazine. The reason we know this is because somebody

1597
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:12,340
who posted this on Xboxic.com noticed that their friend is playing the demo and showed

1598
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:18,720
him on live playing the demo. So it is coming soon. Other news, of course, Atari has finally

1599
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:23,460
picked up Bullet Witch to distribute it in the US. So that's always good because that

1600
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:29,300
looked awesome. And then, of course, SHINee has announced that they're doing a free MMO

1601
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:34,700
called Two Moons, which is supposed to be the most violent MMO to date, which is gonna

1602
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:41,700
be awesome. And then, finally, the best part about this, you're gonna love this, um, according

1603
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:48,480
to Game Daily Biz, uh, production company Project 51 has snatched up the rights to do

1604
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:52,760
an anime version of Castlevania.

1605
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:56,940
My god! I think three sets of panties just got wet.

1606
01:32:56,940 --> 01:33:00,640
All in that succession here.

1607
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:05,320
Gross!

1608
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:08,800
I don't know, did that get picked up by the mics? Could you folks hear that at home?

1609
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,920
That just collective gas

1610
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,920
of pure fanboy orgasm, or fangirl?

1611
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,480
What is it? We also got one from Sauce. Wow.

1612
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:23,840
Also, real quickly, I just want to cover this too.

1613
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,720
There is a, this was actually reported on Kotaku.

1614
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:32,000
There is a guy, a fanboy here, who's doing

1615
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,360
a short film adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

1616
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:40,080
Yes! That person just wins the internet. You win your own slice of the internet

1617
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:40,800
just for you.

1618
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,520
And the adoration of lesbians everywhere. So that's pretty awesome. It says

1619
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:56,440
It's basically part of this Project TV short film contest, and the competition is going

1620
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:01,560
to be taking place, I guess, until September 1st, and there's going to be three rounds

1621
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,560
of voting.

1622
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,720
So, if you're interested in checking it out, you can actually find more information on

1623
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:10,760
website Game First, who it looks like ran this story originally.

1624
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:14,200
So it's gamefirst.com slash, um,

1625
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,520
well, you can just find it on gamesfirst.com. It wasn't

1626
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:21,480
posted too long ago. And check that out. The other thing... Wait, wait. A couple comments from

1627
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,480
chat I want to share real quick before we get into too many topics. Tigerclaw says,

1628
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,600
anime version of Castlevania. I read that Paul W.S. Anderson will direct the

1629
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,960
live-action movie though. So,

1630
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:32,200
like, Castlevania going to these different, these different franchises.

1631
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:35,320
Wow.

1632
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,760
Hey, there went the explicit guy.

1633
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,640
Oh, anyway, one other quick thing. SSJ100Matt would like to say,

1634
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,680
I haven't heard a gamergasm like that since Snake being in Smash Brothers.

1635
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,440
A gamergasm, I love it.

1636
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,280
Snakes on the game? Shit.

1637
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:59,080
We, oh my god. Orange Lounge needs its own Wikipedia for these terms that

1638
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,320
we're coining tonight.

1639
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,320
Alright, anyway. Sorry, Logie. The last one I had,

1640
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:07,240

1641
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,320
basically what it was is they were also doing

1642
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,120
a live-action version this was also fan done of Devil May Cry

1643
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,680
and it's being done by some Japanese guy so it was kind of neat

1644
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:21,120
alright lots of fan service out there

1645
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,080

1646
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,320

01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:37,540
Dark Sakura was

Our chat room wants us to mention the Grand Theft Auto Coca Cola ad.

1662
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:33,560
If you haven't seen this on YouTube, it's kind of interesting.

1663
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,540
We were watching this just before the show tonight.

1664
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:41,500
There's this CGI ad, it's like a coke ad with the Grand Theft Auto characters.

1665
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,500
It's kind of interesting.

1666
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:46,020
Check it out on YouTube if you want to.

1667
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:49,900

1673
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,260
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1674
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:10,020
Meg Z, thank you so much for being here all the way from Wisconsin tonight and you know,

1675

1676
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:18,540
have fun with the Wii when it comes out and let us know how Durgis' service is.

1677
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,540
Oh, I will.

1678
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:22,620
final thought, any last message you want to give to our listeners?

1679
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:25,940
Ken Kutaragi needs

1680
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:29,180
a helmet and some oven mitts and needs to ride the small bus.

1681
01:37:29,180 --> 01:37:32,380
Very well put.

1682
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:36,060

01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,820
And number two...

01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:17,820
Did you see the shampoo I sent you?

1693
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:20,820
It's made for very fine hair.

1694

And if you fancy, I love you.

01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,820

01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:41,820
My final thought is...

01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,820
I want to play more Dead Rising, but people want me to play more ChromeHounds.

1703
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,820
Decisions, decisions. Good luck in the tournament. We'll be cheering you on.

01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:58,820
For not even having a team. You know what? You know what? I say, screw it.

1706
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:03,820
Let's figure out a way to get Chris and Megzi and two other lesbian gamers

1707
01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:06,820
