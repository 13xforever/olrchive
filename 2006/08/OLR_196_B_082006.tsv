5898	14747	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15447	19091	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19651	21572	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
21652	25275	This is episode number 196 for this, August the 20th of 2006.
25815	29137	And we're in part B of our podcast.
29438	37423	Thank you guys so much for downloading us on iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast or whatever podcast program you decided to use to check us out.
37443	38343	We really appreciate it.
38844	42666	You're supporting independent radio and that is quite awesome.
42706	43647	So thank you guys very much.
43967	48010	We're here to celebrate the gamer lifestyle and gaming culture.
48630	72022	and you know anybody can just repeat what you read on gamer blogs but you know when it's real people and real gamers been doing this for a while talking about it we like to think it puts a different angle on everything so thank you guys for checking us out so we're gonna get right back into the news and kind of along with independent gaming I guess this kind of fits into that whole thing doesn't it Loki exactly because if you want to make an independent game and have it on live then you're in luck
72726	77568	Microsoft is actually releasing a new package called XNA that will help you do that.
77648	85951	It's going to be some development tools and libraries to help develop a game and actually eventually get it onto live arcade or something like that.
86871	90872	It is going to cost you though to get it actually onto live and all that stuff.
90892	92173	$99 I believe.
92573	98475	But you can develop it free and at least be able to upload it to your own Xbox or whatever.
98875	98975	But
99892	100813	Yeah, it should be pretty cool.
101093	111340	Details on it are a bit scarce right now, but they are going to be adding some info coming up in the next couple weeks here when it actually launches.
112180	113321	So it's actually pretty cool though.
114222	128431	And basically, like I said, the $99 subscription or whatever per year allows you to become part of this Creators Club, which will offer you downloadable samples of games to help you get your stuff created.
128572	128992	Also, um,
130427	131248	Thanks for watching!
150242	151803	But this is a neat idea.
152023	161448	I really like the idea of, you know, some of these games that we see created could graduate to Xbox Live, essentially, and really buff up the Xbox Live community.
161768	168972	I think it's kind of a smart response, in a way, to Nintendo's Virtual Console, which will have many, many, many games on it to start.
169393	172254	It's kind of a way for Xbox Live Arcade to sort of buff up, so to speak.
172814	178918	And this also says that they're going to... The subscription also gets you a copy of the runtime libraries for...
180049	181730	And that's why some people like it
205216	205596	Well said.
206317	212683	BlackWolf says, you can't send a game you wrote for the 360, send to someone who does not pay that $99 a year.
213023	221872	True, but hypothetically, games made with this, what I was saying is that games made with this could, like the cream of the crop, could graduate to regular Xbox 360, right?
222132	222332	Yeah.
222352	223794	That's the idea, I hope.
223814	224975	So that would be kind of neat.
225655	227997	Yeah, so that's kind of what they're hoping for, at least.
228218	228478	All right.
228936	229837	Devil May Cry, Sins Remembered
256296	264441	Evil Unleashed is a gaming site that has an interview with the director in which he talks about how it's been challenging to bring Devil May Cry to the screen.
265081	272906	Quote, did not want to see a film that was completely from their own writers as it would not be a pure representation of what I could offer them as a filmmaker.
273586	279190	It's only going to be a 50 minute picture and it's basically kind of being used to sort of promote R.L.
279210	281691	Scott as a filmmaker, but hey, it's Devil May Cry.
282732	283953	He has worked on some other...
286183	290206	Hollywood Productions as well, including The Legend of Bagger Vance and Underworld.
290646	291787	So we'll see.
291847	295850	He's going to be using this promo to try and sell a full-length feature called Devil Hunter.
296330	298993	So we'll see how good this movie actually is.
299213	300674	It sounds like it's going to be shown at DragonCon.
300694	302615	It should be interesting for those of you folks that are attending.
302956	308240	And I understand our good buddy Bobby Blackwell is actually going to be on a podcasting panel there, kind of similar to what we did at Fonamay.
308260	310661	And I think the whole thing is airing on all games.
311162	313744	So check that out, a little closer to DragonCon.
314584	315185	That's pretty cool.
315678	342778	and especially if you're looking for the game movies probably the biggest game movie you're going to be looking for forward to I should say well maybe not the biggest game movie there is going to be a Hitman movie script that's actually leaked out and Latino Review of course the usual suspect for reviewing those types of scripts since they actually reviewed I think the Halo 3 script maybe I can't remember I know they've gotten their hands on like Transformers and stuff but anyways
343171	349075	They have a review of the Hitman script, and they said that it's actually going to be pretty good as far as the movie goes.
351036	359441	Whether this is going to be one of the better adaptations out there right now, of course, I think the mark's going to be set by Halo 3, whenever the hell that gets out.
359661	363424	The mark will definitely not be set by Dead or Alive, the movie, because that's going to suck.
363724	364925	But lots of TNA, I hope.
366206	371689	But anyways, moving on, we've got some stuff for Chromehounds.
372355	373716	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
402888	409410	I know you can actually go to the online store in Chromehounds once you've purchased them and buy an infinite amount of them.
409791	414932	I haven't really played enough Chromehounds to really tell, so why don't you answer that question because you've actually played Chromehounds.
414992	417313	Is it going to be worth the points?
417753	418174	I don't know.
418354	430158	I mean, I think 100 points for all of them would be good, but it's like 160 points for each one, and there's about, you know... Well, if people buy horse armor, I mean...
431024	432845	There's gonna be somebody that buys this.
432885	433786	But you know what, though?
434366	439609	A horse armor's... I don't know, unless you're really hardcore in the armored core, then maybe.
440029	444812	But the only thing I don't like about it is you don't really know what the parts are until you actually buy them.
445352	447254	So, I mean, you don't know what the stats are on them.
447294	448154	That's a little different.
448274	454478	And I think that's kind of one thing that, you know, maybe the PlayStation 3 will have an advantage of over, like, say, the marketplace...
455266	463473	And on live right now, you actually get to see, you know, say if you're going to purchase tracks or whatever, you can see it in the game and see the specs for it.
463613	471500	Then use your Microsoft points to buy, you know, well, Sony points, whatever you're going to call them, to buy those items.
471700	473862	Whereas this, it's kind of like Light Arms 1.
474542	476564	Hmm, well, what the hell is that, you know, so.
478513	479193	Yeah, I'll probably buy them.
479594	481435	Because I'm a sucker for that crap.
501867	511212	This isn't too much of a surprise when you consider we had a story about six months ago or so when Guitar Hero was first getting big that said they wanted to do a variety of sequels to Guitar Hero.
511993	512733	So, I don't know.
512973	514454	Is this going to be oversaturation?
514934	517856	I wonder if they'll make a sequel and the game will actually be good.
518316	520317	You're like the one person that doesn't like Guitar Hero.
520357	521558	Why don't you like Guitar Hero?
521658	523699	It's not fun and I hate the music.
523759	525080	But you like Guitar Freaks, right?
525680	528421	I like it just a little more, which means I still don't like it.
529062	529362	Huh.
529727	531168	I had to ask, I had to ask.
553757	554798	No, they need the hat.
555078	556118	They should have Madonna Hero.
556138	557899	Somebody in the chatroom agrees with me.
558019	560380	Saikun says Guitar Hero blows.
560421	561681	That's two people.
561821	566804	I'm sure that there is going to be a backlash against Guitar Hero because of the uber popularity the game has had.
569325	569986	I like Guitar Hero.
570006	570626	It's a great game.
570666	575789	The only thing that ruffles my feathers is when people say it's this original new concept that's never been done before.
576549	577489	That bugs me too.
577549	580451	Or when people say that Beatmania was a copy of Guitar Hero.
580491	582212	I'm like, uh, no.
583308	588338	I'll say it before, I'll say it again Guitar Hero made music games like that accessible
588868	589428	Yeah, yeah.
589468	590569	Made it mainstream.
590669	592089	That's absolutely right.
592109	596571	And of course, there are the people who are going to hate it because they're into you now because it made it into mainstream.
596731	602393	Sad but true, it's a game where people are going to look at it and they're not inclined to go, that's gay.
602974	611057	Like, you know, when people are playing DDR, you have the, you know, stupid a-holes that walk by the machine and look at the people playing DDR and go, that's gay.
611097	615599	Yet, for some reason, playing a plastic guitar in the middle of your living room is not gay.
615819	618060	Actually, that's funny because we have one of my...
618940	619781	Boss is at work.
619901	620722	He's a guitarist.
621342	632351	And when we did the interview with the local news station here, and I got a copy of the game finally, I showed him it, and he's all pretty much, that's gay.
633873	636055	It kind of is funny when you think about it.
636075	637055	He's all, that's crap.
638056	638957	That's not a real guitar.
638977	639738	That's a toy.
640879	644121	How about with all these Guitar Hero sequels, we get Guitar Hero gay?
644201	646043	I mean, SingStar did it, right?
646443	647044	Oh, God.
648369	651613	We already have Karaoke Revolution for that.
651633	653275	The Karaoke Revolution is cool!
653855	656718	And they have the country one, which would totally not be gay.
656878	661423	Now, Karaoke Revolution American Idol, I don't know, sounds pretty gay to me.
661783	663005	You don't know the song list.
671783	684932	I'm assuming the song list is probably... Since it is licensed through American Idol, I'm assuming we've got Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia, Ruben... You can assume all you want, but just hold your reservations.
684952	685533	Alright, fine.
685553	692598	I'll hold my reservations for a few more days, and then... Once it gets fully announced with the song list, then you can say...
693038	694099	Well, that's a terrible game.
694399	698002	Like I say, but until then, you're not allowed to say that.
700104	702406	Harry K. Ames sums it up very well in our chatroom.
702446	704488	People who use gay as an insult are gay.
705829	707951	But I don't use it as an insult.
708452	709593	Rob probably does.
710894	711154	I do.
711835	712215	Loser.
712435	715138	Fine, but now I want to be like, that's homosexual.
716943	719066	Then you're from the Midwest.
719306	720508	But gay, no, look, look.
720928	722430	Gay means two things.
722691	730240	Gay means happy and gay means likes to, is a man that likes to date other men or a woman who likes to date other women.
730280	731502	It's like a dual meaning thing.
731642	732223	Hey, you know what?
732263	734646	This is off topic, so why don't you get back on topic?
734806	735167	Great.
736845	740867	All right, one thing that is definitely not gay is Epix.
741147	741907	Remember Epix?
742047	744388	They were a big company on the Commodore 64.
745289	747429	No, okay, how about Impossible Mission?
747529	748250	I don't know any of these games.
748270	749530	California Games?
749870	750931	I remember California Games.
750951	751671	There you go, thank you.
752031	755232	Okay, look, Epix has been dormant for a long, long time.
756873	768065	System 3 is the development house that changed its name to Studio 3 and then back to System 3, and they are bringing back the Epyx name as well as Epyx Games.
769066	775012	In January, System 3 is going to release Impossible Mission for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS.
775693	778776	Stay a while, stay forever!
780060	783001	If you've ever played Impossible Mission, you'll get that.
783162	785723	Oh god, that was my favorite Commodore 64 game.
786623	790965	Oh my, yes, that's what that does for me, is nostalgia squee all over, definitely.
791466	797128	Hopefully it's better than the Impossible Mission 2 that was on the Genesis, I think?
797569	798289	It was pretty bad.
798769	799930	It was a pretty bad translation.
801110	805012	Anyway, there's also going to be California Games coming to both systems in May.
806153	808094	They won't be remakes of the original titles.
808753	810834	They won't be 3D either.
811195	817878	Quote, you gotta keep the gameplay mechanics the same or else it ceases to be the original game and you're only using the game brand to sell games.
818299	821801	It ceases to be Impossible Mission or California Games or what have you.
822161	826663	What we're doing is we're incorporating the original gameplay and mechanics and bringing the gameplay up to date.
827124	827944	I like this guy.
828044	829425	I like this guy.
829545	832607	You do not update a game like you update, say, NARC.
833656	834657	That isn't the way you do it.
834997	836698	You don't put Bill Bellamy in anything.
836838	838739	This guy has got it.
839119	841160	So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they produce.
841640	842000	You know what?
842040	843341	I'm going to write him a letter and try to get him on the show.
844061	845002	I want to talk to this guy.
845042	845902	I like the way he thinks.
847443	851285	Anyways, I'm kind of on a completely different subject.
851605	856847	And speaking of updating things, the Phantom console is back.
857648	861930	They're actually going to be re-emerging the console as a PC download service.
862962	864564	and, um, yeah.
864704	870149	So you'll actually be able to, um, download Phantom games to your PC.
870349	871210	Which it was anyways.
871310	872331	I mean, it was basically a PC.
872351	873832	Will they disappear as soon as I download them?
875553	875754	No.
876434	881339	But yeah, there's official relaunts going on over at the website, phantom.net.
882980	883300	Yay.
884161	884842	Do we care?
886532	893016	You gotta give these guys credit because they just keep trying and trying and eventually something will happen.
893036	894878	Shane, what have they done?
895663	896423	They've tried.
896443	898224	They had a fun little booth at E3.
898504	900084	I really liked their booth at E3.
900104	901985	That was a nice booth to sit in.
902505	907727	I mean, literally, I could have set money on fire, and that would have been fun, too.
908247	909607	But you wouldn't want to sit on that.
909627	917650	They have an interesting little Flash video, and I might add, they probably spent more time on the Flash video than they did the actual, I don't know, Phantom.
917850	920632	I'm sorry, I don't know how to spin this a nice way.
920652	924496	What have they done that I can touch and play with?
924516	926638	Because they're obviously not good people.
926678	929420	Well, you can touch and play with the Phantom Lapboard.
929520	930261	Look, no, no, no.
930581	931602	I'm saying the reverse.
931702	933284	I mean, I don't blame the people.
933464	937687	I blame the management behind this whole thing and the marketing, obviously.
937787	938848	I mean, some poor-ass decisions were made.
938928	942712	I just think it's nice that they think that somebody still cares and they're still trying...
943172	943773	You know what, though?
944213	956627	If you're interested in checking out The Phantom, you can either check it out in Germany next week during Leipzig, or you can check it out at Digital Life coming October 12th through the 15th.
956887	959850	Blackwolf says they should put out a game called Phantom Vision.
963935	964756	I wouldn't play that.
965666	975673	Now, what it boils down to is they can't make vaporware systems anymore, so they're just going to offer vaporware over the internet, stuff that's never going to ever be released.
976413	982277	Hey, look, if anyone from Phantom is listening and thinking we're giving you guys a bad rap, seriously, you are cordially invited to come on the show and defend yourself.
982337	983898	Wait, wait, wait, I got it, I got it.
984358	985039	Freedom of speech.
985339	985759	Doesn't matter.
985919	989642	They're going to release Duke Nukem Forever on Phantom Online.
990543	991163	That'd be hilarious.
993054	1002465	They might be trying to put out something eventually, but you still give them credit for putting money into something that's not going to work.
1002686	1005469	I like DJ Jani's thought in chat here.
1006050	1008392	Fast and the Furious, Oregon Trail Drift Remix.
1008913	1011456	I guess that's a Phantom game that's going to come out.
1013787	1018429	If they released something that had an organ trail in it, you know it would sell like 20 copies to the people that still care.
1018449	1020770	Wang Gang Midnight Organ Trail Tune.
1020950	1025712	Well, look, Phantom, you're not alone in taking a lot of heat for being a console.
1026312	1027293	The PlayStation 3.
1028253	1029774	Some more news about the PlayStation 3.
1029874	1038897	There was a report that was released this week that basically said, quote, By the time third-generation consoles reach market maturity in 2011...
1040598	1043141	The PlayStation 3 will once again be the market leader.
1043762	1045264	Boy, I wish I could be an analyst.
1045324	1046906	I get paid to talk out of my ass.
1048728	1049449	I mean, maybe.
1049769	1050350	I don't know.
1050830	1054414	Maybe, but based on what's there right now, I don't see it happening.
1054975	1056917	According to the nation, you talk out of your ass for free.
1058439	1059280	Is this going to take them to 2011?
1061684	1061964	Anyway.
1062204	1073026	But by then we'll all be rich, and that's why... Another thing that should be noted, PlayStation 3s have still not gone into production, and we're not that far away from the launch date.
1073346	1078527	So as we get further and further out here, shortages become more and more likely.
1081267	1081908	Yeah, I love that.
1082328	1084068	PlayStation 3 will dominate it all.
1084848	1086388	Ah, we haven't started making them yet.
1087489	1088089	Don't worry.
1088729	1089709	We'll stay up late.
1090359	1091300	The Night Before.
1091520	1092221	We'll get them all then.
1124712	1127354	I'd like to start off tonight since DarkSakura isn't here.
1127855	1137323	I would like to give an F you to my bad grammar skills and give a big giant F you to Loki for making fun of them and laughing in my ear which throws me off even further.
1137723	1138383	You dick.
1138564	1140765	Well, Shane's a dick too and he likes Fantavision.
1141886	1143307	Like that's a bad thing.
1144128	1145089	Loki, your F you's of the week.
1145549	1151154	F you to stupid people who can't fucking pull up to the goddamn stoplight or the line.
1151534	1153936	I've seen people with like six car lengths
1154266	1157188	before the stop sign or stoplight or whatever.
1157508	1158669	They're just stopped there.
1159370	1164293	Talking on their cell phones, of course, because they're jackasses and not paying attention to where they need to be.
1164914	1171899	Or the people that drive in the goddamn bike lane because they're not paying attention or driving over the lanes and all over the place.
1172119	1174921	They should really ban cell phone use while driving.
1176843	1177303	Nico Tavi.
1178186	1179968	Okay, I got two FUs for short.
1180188	1184812	FU to eating rabbit, because rabbit actually ended up not tasting that great.
1185572	1186693	I was very disappointed.
1186753	1191717	However, lamb is... Lamb is worse than rabbit, so... Lamb.
1192418	1196902	It tastes like dirty meat, and I actually like my meat not...
1198119	1201141	Okay, what is your other FU, Mr. Jumping Flash is the best game ever?
1201381	1204483	It's not the best game ever, it's just really far up there.
1204543	1212607	My other FU goes to myself for not learning a certain Taco Bell employee's work schedule so I can stalk him effectively.
1212807	1216469	FU to the fact he's probably under 18 and this is all being documented.
1216509	1217649	He's so not under 18.
1218490	1221451	And if he is, I can delete this.
1225028	1226389	Drew, you're FU.
1226549	1233552	Alright, FU to having a clean house, kind of a realization that, yeah, he does the forest pretty well, but Mr. Clean's a dick.
1234472	1237953	Parks off all the allergies I ever had and some I didn't know I had.
1239294	1244256	FU to obligatory stupid drivers, especially in the country called Lanes area.
1244716	1246517	Learn how to fucking park, would ya?
1246537	1251719	I'm just trying to get in, out, no fucking about, and these people are just blocking the driveway.
1253217	1254018	That's about it.
1254618	1255119	Alright.
1258721	1263565	Anyway, speaking of stupid, there's a stupid idea going around on Kotaku here.
1264386	1267508	Apparently people have been emailing them saying, Hey!
1267949	1270190	You know that awesome movie, Snakes on a Plane?
1270211	1271191	Is there going to be a video game?
1272012	1272132	No.
1272592	1273173	No, there's not.
1273653	1275535	And they're like, well, why the hell not?
1276035	1277096	So they propose that
1285693	1293675	I feel like I'm like the only person my age who hasn't seen Snakes on a Plane yet I haven't seen it No You two are lame, go see it Why?
1294015	1303017	If I was ten years older and closer to your age Which is a lie, you are not that much younger than me, I'm sorry to say I would still not go see it, I am too No you're not How old are you?
1304678	1307266	Old enough to be 10 years younger than you.
1307286	1310678	Then you would be 18, and it would be okay for you to be stalking the...
1312247	1314468	Taco Bell guy who's probably not an agent.
1314488	1315469	That's what I've been saying.
1316470	1317030	Alright.
1317050	1318391	Drew, you actually saw the movie, right?
1318411	1318811	Yeah, I saw the movie.
1318831	1319572	Was it worth the hype?
1319852	1320492	It kicked ass.
1320752	1321033	Really?
1321253	1322253	Yeah.
1322574	1326096	I'm at that point where I'm like, I feel like Snakes on a Plane jumped the shark before it ever came out.
1326176	1335182	It lived up to the hype in the sense that we knew it was going to be cheesy, we knew it was going to be a bad movie, but it has the Rocky horror appeal.
1335882	1337624	It's best when it's seen in a theater.
1337664	1339586	You have to have the audience participation.
1339606	1341168	You have to have the audience participation.
1355122	1363466	I'll give it a try, but see, now I'm worried that I missed opening weekend because no one will go see it with me, that I'm going to just kind of miss out on everything.
1363506	1364246	You threw snakes?
1364786	1367568	You went with some of the Something Awful kids?
1367748	1369248	Yeah, I went with a pair of goons.
1369969	1374250	We had rubber snakes around our necks at random points.
1374270	1378552	We were just throwing snakes down into the crowd, and the people were enjoying it.
1378672	1382534	Everyone was heckling and riffing and throwing the snakes back and forth.
1383502	1389387	It was a good time, but the movie itself will probably just lose its appeal when it's not in a theater.
1390608	1393891	You know what movie was underappreciated for audience participation value?
1394532	1395052	Showgirls.
1396794	1397714	Absolutely frightening.
1399816	1400377	Next up.
1401258	1402138	That's pretty funny.
1402659	1403279	Showgirls.
1404220	1405581	Moving on to something that...
1406789	1409091	could be only popular as a cult phenomenon.
1409131	1412794	The PlayStation 3, oh, we're so, we pick on them so much, I feel bad.
1412934	1415496	I really tried not, I tried to find positive stories.
1415516	1416577	I do, I do too.
1416597	1418819	But then they go and say we're not making it.
1418879	1434913	Well, this is, I mean, okay, so the PlayStation 3 hasn't gone into development yet, but what happened recently is Sega had a PlayStation 3 day, and there was a demo of Full Auto 2 Battle Lines, and IGN got to take a peek at this, and basically, to make a long story short, you know, obviously the dev kits are there,
1435673	1460790	The controller was smart enough to realize what system and what player it's connected to And the PlayStation Network appears to be up and running at this time So the PlayStation Network platform appears to be up and running Because these folks were demoing the game on there And so the developers were able to use it So something's ready So I guess that's a good sign Full Auto 2 wasn't bad I remember playing it at E3, it wasn't bad I like Full Auto It was okay
1461530	1462672	Yeah, it was okay.
1462712	1463033	I don't know.
1463053	1468063	I kind of think there'll be other driving games that'll make me go, wow, a little more, but... Like, uh... Never mind.
1468083	1468925	I don't know.
1469045	1469186	Like...
1470248	1471368	I'm not going to say it.
1471409	1472529	I swear to God I'm not going to say it.
1472549	1474610	I wish they could do like a Mario Kart.
1474710	1483453	I mean it's inevitable we'll have a Mario Kart on the Wii, but like a Mario Kart in like super high def 720 and all that because obviously the Wii is not going to support that.
1483473	1485054	I would like to see a very pretty Mario Kart.
1485074	1488535	We need to get in contact with Square and have them do Rad Racer 3.
1488855	1490936	How about Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation?
1490976	1492497	Chocobo Racing 2 on the PlayStation 3.
1492717	1493517	That's what I'd like to see.
1493677	1494078	That'd work.
1494358	1494638	All right.
1495178	1495598	Fine by me.
1495858	1496499	We can agree on that.
1496699	1497279	Speaking of the Wii.
1497599	1497699	Yeah.
1497972	1514461	Speaking about the Wii and online, kind of the repeat of something we were talking about earlier with Reggie, and talking about how the online service is going to be free, and basically kind of enhancing the way you're going to be playing games, which, you know, you've probably already been doing that on Xbox Live.
1516362	1524786	But yeah, it's basically, it's going to be massive amounts of hands-on activity, as well as showcasing exactly how the Wii games are different.
1524806	1525707	They're talking about the...
1526801	1550254	of course their brand new games and how they're going to market them and stuff and of course we're going to create advocacy and we're going to make it so that everyone who tries the Wii experience talks to their friends and neighbors so of course they're going to do that because they're not showing it to the press they're showing it to secret parties of ravers laughing
1551164	1554845	I'll get my pacifier and candy bracelets ready for the Wii bus to come by.
1554885	1557325	No, but their online service is going to be okay.
1557366	1558526	I'll get my Darude CD.
1558886	1560966	Look at the... I mean, here's the thing, too.
1561086	1575490	I mean, if you look about it, the DS Wi-Fi Connect service, you know, we hear people talking about that and stuff, but we forget that PSP actually has their infrastructure mode that, you know, is Wi-Fi online, too.
1575510	1580671	But, I mean, you don't really see them pushing that very much, which I find very interesting.
1581287	1590776	Sony's not even trying to say, hey, by the way, our games are also connected over the internet as well, but they don't really have a service provided.
1590816	1592999	I don't think they actually use Sony's servers or anything.
1593379	1594640	Kind of like the PlayStation 2 does.
1595941	1596822	I thought that was interesting.
1598144	1598444	Alright.
1598885	1600026	Star Trek Legacy
1620044	1620284	E3, E3, E3, E3
1644083	1646345	They are trying to encapsulate everything.
1646365	1655191	And it's basically a ship strategic command fighting game, which I think a lot of people are going to be really into, especially the Star Trek kind of fans.
1655231	1656872	I think that kind of is a natural fit.
1657893	1661756	And in seeing the early demo, it looks really, really good.
1661816	1663397	The game graphically is really well.
1663757	1665979	And I kind of thought it was cool what they did in the demo.
1666059	1667380	And this was all real time when they did it.
1667640	1672764	They kind of duplicated the big fight from the end of Star Trek II, Wrath of Khan.
1673291	1673571	Rayhound
1704000	1707823	RayHound is actually pretty cool.
1707963	1710705	You actually don't shoot any weapons in this game.
1710785	1720171	What you have is these turrets that are shooting at you, these lasers, and you can pull up a shield that causes the laser to spin around you in an orbital fashion.
1721011	1725814	You use that to throw the lasers back into the actual turrets themselves.
1726275	1729977	Each level, as it progresses, more and more turrets are on the screen and it gets more crazy.
1730526	1736147	You know, it's the kind of simple gameplay that's fun, and what's great is you can actually download it for free.
1736707	1742408	So, what you need to do is definitely check out the game, because I did, and it's awesome.
1742428	1756191	You can find it at www.18.big.or.jp, and then the little ampersand symbol, hikoza.prod, and then
1757463	1758425	That should pull it up for you.
1758666	1762936	Or just basically search for Warning Forever and Rayhound and you'll find it in any search engine.
1763819	1764561	But it's pretty sweet.
1764982	1765884	So check it out.
1766670	1767330	Beat the Host
1792799	1793379	with a stick.
1793980	1794560	I'll play.
1794760	1795800	We're going to take a caller.
1795820	1798261	No, because tonight you and Miklatov count as hosts.
1798642	1800542	So you might get beaten with a stick.
1801263	1804124	All right, let's go to the phones and get a caller for tonight's game.
1804744	1805785	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
1805805	1806185	Who's this?
1806645	1807745	Oh my God, I got picked.
1808046	1808566	Who is this?
1809366	1810267	Raven's Dolphin!
1810367	1811968	Hello, Raven's Dolphin!
1812008	1812948	How are you doing tonight?
1813548	1814509	I'm doing fine.
1814689	1816870	Alright, now... Sounds really fine.
1816890	1818811	Yeah, he's happy he got pictures.
1818831	1819772	This is going to be a fun game.
1820132	1825215	Raven's Dolphin, how would you say your knowledge is on old school video games?
1827475	1829216	Super Nintendo to NES, I guess.
1829317	1830017	I guess pretty good.
1830257	1839445	Okay, would you be willing to challenge one of our hosts tonight in exactly who's got more skill in identifying songs from old school video games?
1839605	1840806	Come on, you know you want to throw down.
1840926	1842688	Yeah, yeah, I'll try.
1842708	1845270	I'm pretty sure I know old school video games.
1845350	1847792	Alright, Raven's Dolphin, there's three people you can challenge tonight.
1847812	1853757	You can't challenge me because I wrote the damn thing, but you can challenge Drunami, Miklatov, or Loki.
1853937	1854438	Who's it going to be?
1855117	1858460	RavensDolphin, I have to ask you to leave our chat room.
1858480	1859881	I see you logged in there right now.
1859901	1863464	Actually, I'm just going to go ahead and kick you from chat because we can't have them helping you out.
1863484	1865345	I'm kicking both those names from chat right now.
1865365	1866426	Alright, you ready to play?
1883371	1884453	No, not yet.
1884513	1886976	I still haven't closed the chat client yet.
1898268	1899128	8-Bit Video Games
1917362	1918623	and whoever gets more wins.
1918964	1928713	And if you actually win tonight's game, we will let you do something very special in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio regarding the DDR premieres we announced earlier this evening, alright?
1930054	1930374	Alright.
1930494	1930935	Sound good?
1931826	1932707	I'll try my best.
1932767	1934388	I can't guarantee anything.
1934488	1935449	Alright, well try your best.
1935469	1936190	That's all we can ask.
1936210	1938151	And of course, chat room, feel free to play along.
1938171	1943976	You guys will actually get to hear this twice because you'll get to hear it again when Loki comes back and folks playing on the podcast as well.
1944497	1948400	We have a lot of folks out there that I know think they could do really well on this, so see how well you do.
1948821	1950562	Alright, you ready, Raven's Dolphin?
1950582	1951403	You only get to hear it once.
1951723	1952003	You ready?
1952724	1953825	Alright, here we go.
2009945	2014048	All right, Raven's Dolphin, you have 30 seconds to name back 10 games.
2014309	2014609	Go.
2015990	2016671	Metroid.
2016831	2017091	Yes.
2017611	2018152	Fight Club.
2018312	2018812	I meant fight.
2018893	2019353	Punch Out.
2019373	2020074	Sorry, Punch Out.
2020134	2020394	Yes.
2020694	2020954	Mario 3.
2021495	2021735	Yes.
2022055	2022656	Ice Climber.
2022996	2023236	Yes.
2023697	2024557	Final Fantasy.
2024978	2025218	Yes.
2027241	2028282	I don't know the other ones.
2028782	2032324	I was going to say Excitebite, but I'm sure that's wrong.
2033465	2033645	No.
2037006	2039167	I sure heard, what was it?
2039408	2040008	I forget.
2040108	2040708	I told you.
2042969	2043470	Five seconds.
2044350	2044850	I forget.
2045691	2045991	That's it.
2046011	2046831	All right, time's up.
2047392	2048292	You got five out of ten.
2048312	2048972	You got half of them.
2048992	2049693	That's not that bad.
2049753	2054015	You got Metroid, Punch-Out, Mario 3, Final Fantasy, and Ice Climber, okay?
2054035	2054115	Okay.
2055235	2057957	We're going to see if Loki does any better.
2058197	2060979	Drunami, if you'd be so kind, run out and get Loki for us.
2060999	2063941	All right, Raven's Dolphin, stay on the line and see how it does.
2064501	2064981	Oh, you bet.
2065142	2065442	All right.
2070925	2071225	All right.
2071966	2072606	Welcome back, Loki.
2073567	2073827	All right.
2074147	2076048	And Loki's getting situated here back in studio.
2076749	2078090	Okay, here's how it's going to work, Loki.
2078871	2085553	You're going to hear a one-minute clip of ten old-school 8-bit Nintendo games music all strung together.
2085873	2092136	Then you're going to have 30 seconds after you hear the clip to repeat back to me the ten songs that you heard in the clip.
2092416	2092756	In order?
2093296	2093456	No.
2094136	2094676	Any way you want.
2094736	2094997	Okay?
2095137	2095417	Okay.
2095517	2096197	Alright, so you ready?
2096870	2097130	Here we go.
2097150	2098091	You only get to hear this once.
2098291	2101412	Now, you can actually make notes or make notes there if you want, okay?
2101592	2105033	Because we let him write, but he wasn't allowed to be in the chat room to do that.
2105713	2107594	So you can't be in chat either, Loki.
2107814	2109015	Well, I'm not even watching chat.
2109035	2110135	I'm just... All right.
2110175	2110455	Hold on.
2110495	2111576	I want to kick you from chat anyway.
2112036	2112316	All right.
2112676	2113356	You're a bastard.
2113876	2114177	All right.
2114477	2114797	You ready?
2114997	2115517	Hold on.
2115717	2116017	All right.
2116678	2116978	All right.
2118595	2119836	He's bringing up Notepad here.
2120176	2120917	Yes, I am.
2121117	2124400	We are playing Beat the Host here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2124420	2128364	Do you feel pretty confident about how you did Raven's Dolphin?
2128384	2130606	Don't tell him the score, but do you think you feel confident with your score?
2131366	2131987	I feel pretty.
2132467	2132667	Alright.
2133348	2133969	You feel pretty?
2135650	2136411	I feel pretty too.
2136731	2137712	Alright, you ready, Loki?
2138332	2138573	I am.
2138613	2139453	Quit wasting time here.
2139493	2139834	Here we go.
2195562	2196743	All right, Loki, that was the clip.
2196783	2198244	You have 30 seconds to say them back.
2198324	2198545	Go.
2199025	2199746	Super Mario Bros.
2200166	2199746	3.
2200266	2200506	Yes.
2200626	2201307	Final Fantasy.
2201427	2201687	Yes.
2202027	2202568	Ice Climber.
2202688	2202928	Yes.
2203148	2203528	Goonies 2.
2203989	2204229	Yes.
2205029	2205550	Metroid.
2205710	2205990	Yes.
2207171	2208692	And, oh, crap.
2209052	2210954	I should write down more of these.
2212335	2212815	That's all I got.
2214116	2215078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2226649	2227650	And time's up!
2227950	2228990	He tied with me, didn't he?
2229290	2231231	Alright, yep, it tied up!
2231771	2235913	Raven's Dolphin got five and Loki got five, so it's all tied up.
2236393	2240735	And since I wasn't creative enough to think of a tiebreaker, it will just have to be a stalemate, okay?
2241295	2242015	That's fine by me.
2242075	2244816	Alright, so Raven's Dolphin, you know what, we could be nice.
2244836	2245496	What do you think, Loki?
2245516	2246617	Should we just give him the prize anyway?
2247510	2249851	All right, RavensDolphin, we'll see you back here in two weeks.
2249871	2252631	You're going to help us out with the DDR Power Preview, okay?
2253251	2254292	Ooh, can't wait.
2254512	2255872	All right, sounds good.
2255892	2257032	That's genuine excitement.
2257252	2260033	But, RavensDolphin, I bet you're dying to know what the correct answers were.
2260873	2261393	I'm dying.
2261433	2262074	All right, here we go.
2262154	2263054	Here they are, chat room.
2264134	2264854	Metroid.
2266135	2269095	I can't believe Noah got the next one.
2270456	2271816	Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!
2271856	2273536	Oh, I forgot the way down.
2273556	2274337	This is why.
2274357	2274937	Super Mario Bros. 3.
2277816	2294080	Willow Shadowgate Final Fantasy Ice Climber Goonies 2
2310836	2316945	Gyruss, which you DDR people should know, Gyruss And lastly, Ninja Gaiden
2318539	2319460	That was the 10.
2319800	2322723	You should be lucky that you did not pick me, because I got 6.
2323764	2325245	Oh, thank god.
2325325	2330110	Well, I would have had 6 too, had I wrote down all the titles instead of saying, I'll remember the first two.
2330290	2333393	I think I would have got like 3, so I was the easy kill.
2333433	2335234	So you could have won flat out if you told me.
2335274	2338197	But I told the chatroom I knew a lot of them, so I saved face.
2338457	2341100	But now that I admitted it, I lost the saving face.
2341932	2347476	All right, chat room once posted there, so I will post the list there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2347496	2348117	Click on chat.
2348477	2349818	There's the list for you folks in chat.
2350018	2352040	RavensDolphin, thanks so much for playing our dumb little game with us.
2352080	2355242	Sorry you did not get to beat the host tonight, but maybe next time.
2355262	2356703	You got to push him a little bit.
2356743	2357284	It was a push.
2358605	2359646	Yeah, that was fun.
2359826	2362928	All right, anything else you want to share with the listeners before we let you go and get back to the news?
2363669	2365110	Snakes on a Plane looks funny.
2366766	2367106	A little bit.
2388422	2388722	Anyway.
2389383	2391144	I was trying to see how well the chat room did there.
2391164	2392465	It looks like some folks really like the game.
2392505	2393345	I want to see that again.
2393406	2394206	So we'll do that.
2394366	2396728	It looks like Willow is the big stumper for most people there.
2397008	2400530	For what it's worth, I thought the last one was Double Dragon, not Ninja Gaiden.
2400591	2401451	It's very close.
2401471	2406875	I know for next time to write down everything I hear instead of just saying, oh, I'll remember those and not to go back.
2406915	2407455	It's tough.
2408096	2412078	I figured folks in chat would really like that game and the folks listening on the podcast because you kind of get to play longer.
2412099	2415781	You should have done more random games like throwing Kickle Cubicle or something like that.
2415801	2416121	You know what?
2416181	2416862	If we do it again...
2417362	2419384	Maybe it'll be Super Nintendo, maybe Arcade.
2419444	2422486	You know, if I wanted to be really mean, I'd do Commodore 64 games.
2422526	2423827	Do Virtual Boy games.
2424067	2424387	All right.
2426529	2431952	Maybe some other time we'll do Beat the Host with a stick, but for now we're going to get back into the gaming news.
2432293	2441939	Anyways, there is a rumor going around this week that Walmart had stopped selling Bully because of pressure from a certain somebody, and we'll call him J...
2443322	2447367	T, and rhymes with Fuck Omsen
2463129	2475480	and it was funny though because Walmart spokesperson John Simley, he made a comment and he said, I'd like to give credit to Jack Thompson but there are a lot of Jack Thompsons out there and we are just listening to our customers.
2476141	2477982	I think he means there are a lot of Jackoffs out there.
2479564	2489673	And it says the decision has not been made on whether the chain which sells 127 million customers a day will carry Bully once it is rated and available for sale.
2490374	2494195	If it comes out as adults only, we think that's something that we're not going to carry.
2494835	2496735	I think first we look at the rating.
2498156	2499756	More likely it's going to be mature.
2499816	2507357	I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart anyway, because indirectly you're supporting their electronics department, which would be the music as well.
2507417	2511858	And I hate, hate, hate the fact they censor music the way they do.
2511918	2515179	They refuse to sell CDs in the store unless there's a clean version available.
2515559	2523704	It's like, you know, here at Walmart we're going to sell the statue of David, but we've put, you know, tighty-whities on it.
2523844	2527026	You know, it's like, that's not, you've ruined the art.
2527226	2532189	You know, I don't, anyway, this is kind of getting a little bit outside, but I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart.
2532409	2539293	And I realize some folks feel they have no other choice living in a remote area, you know, where maybe Walmart is the only big game retailer you have, but...
2540094	2541275	Online, my friends.
2541295	2547119	Seriously, I would rather buy my, even if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would rather buy my games online than buy them at Walmart.
2548400	2551702	And this show will never be carried at Walmart, thanks to my little rant there, but that's alright.
2552843	2553143	I don't care.
2554264	2558247	We're too far off the radar for Big Bad Walmart.
2559241	2569290	I will admit I bought my copy of 99 Nights at Target, which probably isn't much better, but the other place I wanted to go to first was out of it, and I really wanted 99 Nights.
2569490	2571752	Hey, Target got a mention in a Freeze Pop song.
2571772	2572653	That makes them okay by me.
2573473	2574394	Call me a hypocrite if you want.
2574434	2574774	I don't care.
2575575	2575895	All right.
2576991	2577632	XBOX LIVE VISION CAMERA
2594890	2597511	and Freeverse, who made Toy Sight for the Apple iSight.
2597791	2599932	Was this the game we played at E3 for a little bit?
2599972	2600592	I seem to remember.
2600772	2602773	But it was on, like, the PC camera, wasn't it?
2602993	2605454	No, it was the Vision camera.
2605875	2614758	It's just that it sucked because there's people walking behind you, so you had to raise, like, one hand to... You used your hands, like, think of iToy, basically.
2614818	2621181	It was like trying to play iToy with the Today Show behind you, that whole set where they have all the people moving and it just throws everything off.
2621221	2621821	You couldn't do it.
2621961	2623522	However, though, there is some...
2624495	2629520	Rumors, though, actually I should say that that might not exactly be true, that Totem Ball's coming with it.
2630060	2638008	The reason being is that some of the live vision cameras have actually sneaked out in Toys R Us lately, and some people have already purchased them.
2638428	2648537	And they said that it's included one month of Xbox Live Gold, as well as a registration key for Uno, as I previously said on a podcast.
2649198	2649298	And...
2651434	2659082	But what you might end up finding out a little bit later on, as I think I mentioned before, there is two bundles that they're going to be having.
2659522	2662365	One that's for $39.99 and one that's $79.99.
2663046	2666149	And the $79.99 one might come with Totem Ball.
2666510	2669713	And I think it's supposed to come with a year of Xbox Live Gold as well.
2671054	2671435	Interesting.
2673001	2676383	All right, well, we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take your calls.
2676503	2686028	If you want to call our show, you can hit us up on the Skype line at InteractWithUs over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, or you can pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.
2687108	2692311	But remember, that is not an 800 number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, you best be getting some permission.
2692391	2693212	We already have a call.
2693252	2694152	Let's go to the line.
2694612	2695693	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
2695713	2696133	Who's this?
2697234	2698254	Hey, Rob.
2698454	2699555	It's the other Drew.
2700185	2701245	The other Drew.
2701405	2704586	Is this the Drew that goes by Cutress online?
2705527	2706147	That would be it.
2706427	2707667	Hey, how you doing?
2707707	2713189	Hey Shane.
2714009	2714370	What?
2714470	2716650	Kick him off right now.
2716710	2718351	No, no, no.
2718391	2720672	I gotta let him plug the site he works for.
2721832	2723492	No, we're good buddies with this site.
2723532	2725473	So Cutress, where do you work?
2726313	2728094	I guess it's more of a hobby, but so is what we do.
2729306	2734247	Oh, well, it's not like I was just calling in to plug DDR Freak, but yeah, there you go.
2734507	2736307	Alright, I wanted to let you plug DDR Freak, though.
2736347	2738348	So what are you calling in about tonight?
2740428	2744329	Well, first off, I had to make sure that everyone knew that Sui Koden sucks.
2745329	2747169	Why are you letting him still talk?
2747269	2748089	Because it's funny.
2748209	2750290	It's not, he's saying lies.
2751490	2752510	Let's take a quick vote.
2752550	2754710	How many people think Cutris is funny in the room?
2758683	2759123	Let's see.
2759323	2760384	Oh, we got two.
2761044	2763085	And how many people think Cutress is not funny?
2763806	2764366	And we have two.
2764406	2766427	Oh, and I break ties.
2766467	2774511	No, actually, the two full-time hosts here voted that he is funny, and the two peon guests voted that he wasn't funny.
2774712	2777313	I'm going to delete a lot of stuff off your computer tonight.
2777873	2778554	Cutress, please.
2778574	2779454	Stop poking me.
2779634	2780935	Look, let's stop taking up his time.
2780955	2784737	Cutress, please, whatever you want to say on your mind besides the fact that Suikoden sucks.
2786262	2792884	Well, for one thing, next time you do the music game, you need to have Mega Man music in there because that's sort of mandatory.
2792964	2795305	Look, I have to save something for next time.
2795345	2798606	I couldn't blow the Blaster Master wad on the first go, okay?
2798966	2800706	And Mega Man and all that other stuff.
2802127	2805668	You know I love me some Mega Man and some Blaster Master, but I have to wait.
2807108	2809749	Yeah, if you had gotten me in, I would have gotten seven of ten.
2810473	2813354	Oh, looks like I do have some competition.
2813374	2817056	A little Drew vs. Drew action, huh?
2818276	2819757	That sounds like a porno, be quiet.
2820837	2821757	That was the intent.
2822197	2823658	What games have you been playing lately, Drew?
2825119	2828000	Well, I just finished Dragon Quest a couple days ago.
2831021	2836843	I'm pretty much wrapping up all the rest of the endgame stuff in that, and pretty much everything I have is packed up.
2837495	2840978	Right now, I kept out Front Mission 4 and Curse of Darkness.
2843340	2843860	Very cool.
2845101	2850126	That's basically all I've got until I move into my new house and unpack everything again.
2850646	2854349	I just quit FFXI so that I could finally start playing my console games again.
2855490	2859473	I remember quitting Final Fantasy XI to free myself to play other video games.
2859553	2860974	You come back, you always do.
2861735	2866019	I remember when I quit also, which didn't happen last night or today.
2867301	2873085	Yeah, by the way, Miklatov signed back up for Final Fantasy XI last night because he's weak, everybody.
2873145	2873646	He's weak.
2874066	2876468	Okay, real quick.
2877209	2878770	I've got to ask this real quick.
2879966	2880226	DDR Freak
2899912	2911875	You know, I've gotten to play it only once, and I only played two games of it, and basically I was just so out of shape and out of whack that I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore because I was taking up too much time from other people.
2912376	2917197	I know people are complaining about the sync and everything, but I haven't noticed any problems myself.
2917337	2918037	I'm enjoying it.
2918157	2918617	It's fun.
2919138	2920398	That's all there really is to it.
2920658	2933460	No, I didn't notice the sync problems either, I have a life, but I agree with you on the fact that we all got out of shape, because Konami didn't put out a new game for forever, we all got burned out on Extreme, and now we're all fat and don't want to play DDR again.
2933640	2934380	Wait, sync?
2935941	2936241	Get it?
2936381	2939321	Shut up!
2939421	2941902	Is there two in one thread on the forums?
2941922	2948543	You know, I'm not the sort of guy that runs vertex squared through my head when I'm having sex, so I don't notice these sync issues.
2949105	2950105	Oh, and the group sucks.
2950165	2950505	Wow.
2950605	2954166	Okay, Cutris, anything else you want to share with our listeners so we can take more calls?
2956426	2959967	No, just thanks for having me on the show again, and I wish I could hang out with you guys more.
2960247	2960767	Not a problem.
2960947	2962027	Come visit the bay.
2962107	2965088	It's a real bummer about E3, but maybe there'll be something.
2965148	2966908	We should have a DDR con or something fun.
2967788	2968628	Yeah, hopefully.
2968688	2970169	I can't wait to hang out with you guys again.
2970349	2970889	Sounds good.
2970949	2971689	Have a good one, Cutris.
2971709	2972009	Take care.
2972109	2972709	Bye.
2973589	2974089	Bye-bye.
2974909	2975269	All right.
2975309	2976790	Thank you, Cutris, for being on the program tonight.
2976810	2977470	Let's take another call.
2977790	2978430	Drew, real quick.
2979033	2980013	How's that for new low?
2980253	2981794	I'm actually making get it jokes on the air.
2981814	2982334	Alright, be quiet.
2982674	2983454	Let's go to another call.
2983494	2984455	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
2984475	2984835	Who's this?
2985775	2986335	It's Ranma.
2986375	2987196	Who do you think it is?
2987936	2989016	Hello, Ranma.
2989496	2991497	God, you have a way of getting through every week.
2991537	2992077	What's on your mind?
2992097	2993738	We're getting hammered tonight, too, and you get through.
2993998	2994458	What's up?
2995358	2997779	Oh, I have three things I want to talk about.
2997859	2998699	Three things.
2998719	2999299	Make them quick.
3000240	3000700	Number one.
3001786	3005350	First thing, this whole high def versus standard def mission, fuck it.
3005710	3010015	I have a nice 20 inch TV, it's standard def, it looks great.
3010375	3014659	I don't care about this high def live stream, it's just a concept.
3014720	3016662	I mean, I just don't get it, you know?
3016722	3020806	It's just... Ranma, surely you've heard this old saying, okay?
3020826	3021847	Have you ever heard this old saying?
3022448	3024209	Once you go black, you never go back?
3025131	3026412	That's because we won't let you go free.
3026932	3027132	Yeah.
3027673	3027993	Same.
3028814	3030995	Apply that thought to an HDTV.
3031195	3031776	Seriously.
3032156	3036179	Because, like, once I bought an HDTV, I can't watch Standard anymore.
3037364	3048972	I know, I used to play my PSU on a 55 inch high definition TV, but when I moved I had a 20 inch SD, standard deaf television, to me it just looks the same, I enjoy both of it, you know?
3049593	3056278	Alright, well, you know, I can appreciate that because that tells me that you are about the game first, the graphics second.
3057158	3058199	Yes, definitely.
3058459	3060781	Alright, what's the second thing you wanted to call in about?
3062310	3065733	I was kind of tired of the DDR fanboys in chat.
3066093	3066734	Shut up.
3066854	3068375	It's just a game.
3069256	3070237	What were they saying in chat?
3070277	3070698	I missed it.
3071690	3075034	I mean, it was about your announcement about DDR.
3075574	3077456	Somebody said, you guys sold out the Kanaan.
3077497	3080260	I'm like, what the hell, you know?
3080340	3081921	Better than selling out to Roxor.
3082082	3084284	We didn't sell out to anybody.
3084304	3085606	I haven't seen any of this money.
3085646	3088609	We're not getting any money for this, so tell me how we're selling out.
3088649	3093114	We're doing this because we like DDR and we like this, you know.
3093454	3100697	Hmm, let's see, we are a radio station, and on radio stations they play music, DDR of which has a lot of music.
3101118	3103119	This partnership makes a lot of sense to me.
3103319	3104519	I don't know about the rest of you.
3105380	3110242	This is something that we would have done for Konami three years ago, but whatever, it's finally happening now, it's great.
3110642	3112143	Alright, number three.
3113083	3116025	The last thing is the whole thing about the PS3, it's $400, $500.
3116665	3123028	Some people are forgetting about another console that came out that was just as expensive.
3124212	3124575	What's that?
3125602	3126145	Neo Geo
3128066	3135669	But then again, the Neo Geo wasn't exactly... You know, the Neo Geo was like the rich kid system, you know what I mean?
3135729	3138651	Like, everybody knew some rich kid who actually had a Neo Geo.
3138771	3142392	And the difference is, it had games that kicked major amounts of ass.
3142512	3152457	It did, but it also, towards at least the end of the run... Like, you know, the first wave of games was pretty cool, but towards the end of the run, it was all Bust a Move, King of Fighters, you know, 99, all that stuff.
3152497	3154578	I mean, that's all it ever was, in the end.
3154818	3155538	Which is kind of sad.
3155578	3157039	Is there something wrong with King of Fighters?
3157299	3160786	No, but I'm just saying I wouldn't buy a console just for King of Fighters.
3160986	3161547	Don't get me wrong.
3161808	3164633	I appreciated the Neo Geo, but I wouldn't have spent that much money on it.
3165612	3166092	What is Madden?
3166152	3166792	What is Madden?
3166913	3169173	It's the same game over and over with little upgrades.
3191522	3191842	Right?
3191962	3194164	That's why I don't play men.
3194325	3195466	I play Tecmo Bowl.
3195906	3196226	Alright.
3196867	3197828	Tecmo Bowl for life.
3197908	3198708	Ranma, we gotta let you go.
3198768	3199269	Take more calls.
3200050	3200450	One more thing.
3200490	3201631	Rat Racer 3, PS2.
3201671	3202171	That's what I want.
3202192	3202452	Bye.
3202812	3203252	Bring it.
3204714	3205995	With the 3D glasses, I hope.
3208618	3226148	Your calls, we're taking them tonight here on OrangeLoungeRadio.com Go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on interact with us Or you can always pick up the telephone and call us that way 916-226-9067 Hey podcast listeners, are you pissed off at the call-in segment because it's always the same people calling in?
3226688	3231171	Well, you should call us sometime Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3232491	3235053	It's DMN Hi DMN, what's on your mind?
3236479	3237020	Not much.
3237860	3241982	I wanted to comment about the whole BDR TV show thing, too.
3242542	3247285	But first, I want to congratulate you guys on getting that association with Konami.
3247325	3249025	I'm really excited about hearing the new music.
3249286	3250266	We're excited about it, too.
3250306	3251407	We think it's going to be a fun time.
3251427	3251727	Thank you.
3253047	3254608	Awesome.
3254988	3256769	Now let's bag on the TV show a little bit.
3256949	3258430	A little bit.
3259130	3259691	Here's the thing.
3259971	3263613	I'm going to be a bit of a devil's advocate about this whole slumber party gang thing.
3263733	3264173	Fair enough.
3264213	3264573	We need it.
3265610	3294809	um you've got to look whenever you're at the arcade being the seasoned DDR veterans that all of us are who do you see that annoys the ever loving shit out of you on those machines the target audience is number party girls birthday party girls yeah alright yeah so I think Konami is targeting that demographic I think they're doing it right I think it's going to be a laughing stock fest for the rest of us but I think it'll
3295804	3323199	whoever watches Saturday Morning TV and it'll sell more copies and that's what Konami wants right and to play devil's advocate to devil's advocate I understand what Konami's trying to do with that and you know you do make a good point but you can't help but as a long time DDR fan before there were little girls everywhere you can't help but cringe a little bit inside because this doesn't help the whole people walking behind the machine going that's gay thing that I was talking about earlier you know
3324028	3327789	Yeah, well no, I cringe at the thought too, but I see where they're going from a business standpoint.
3328109	3335212	So, I kind of wish if they're going to do this, that they would also do a DDR Macho show on Spike TV as well or something.
3336152	3339553	No, I don't know, I just... You know, I think...
3340825	3349628	You can't let society, and this goes with anything, you can't let society tell you what to do, essentially, and if you enjoy something, you should wear it proud, you know what I mean?
3349889	3363694	So even though we joke about, you know, we don't like the people that come behind the machine and go, that's gay, that's gay, I think that you should have enough confidence in yourself to be able to do whatever you want, you know what I mean?
3364477	3372901	And I think if you do, and DDR is a very social game, a friendly game, and I remember some kid once did this to me when I was on the machine, and Jamie tore him a new asshole.
3373261	3375943	He was like, do you want to challenge him on the game?
3376083	3376643	Do you want to fight?
3376703	3380985	Here, I will pay for you to play against Rob, and we'll see who does better on the game.
3382506	3384307	That situation has happened with all of us.
3384347	3389250	That's why Jamie's on this program, by the way, because she has her moments of gold like that, which you just gotta love.
3389410	3390170	You just gotta love.
3390618	3394001	I think we should look on the bright side of this whole slumber party girls though.
3394021	3399526	It might appeal to the 20-something female demographic who thinks it's oddly cute.
3400606	3402148	Might get more of a turnout in the arcades there.
3402368	3404230	Alright, DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?
3405190	3409234	Go to PAX and the Wii's coming soon.
3409614	3410575	Alright, thank you very much.
3410615	3411315	We appreciate that.
3411336	3412356	Alright, bye-bye.
3412376	3412837	Take care, guys.
3413826	3418688	All right, let's do at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio, and then we'll probably go and tie up the show.
3419068	3420169	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3420209	3420609	Who's this?
3421669	3422550	Yes, this is Bobby.
3422850	3423610	Hi, Bobby.
3423750	3425331	You mean Bobby Blackwolf?
3425971	3426431	Sure.
3426752	3427312	Okay, yes.
3428292	3432614	Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show on AllGames.com Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific.
3432794	3433174	Hint, hint.
3434015	3434535	What's on your mind?
3436327	3438648	I wanted to share my opinion on something real quick.
3439029	3439389	Lies.
3439509	3441350	These are lies that he's going to be talking about.
3441410	3442251	It's about this game.
3442871	3444092	It's called Suikoden.
3444413	3445333	Ah, yes, Suikoden.
3445353	3446154	I've heard of this game.
3446574	3448075	Can we hang up on him, please?
3448095	3451118	Miklatov, didn't you get your name from a character in Suikoden 2?
3451218	3453339	Yes, he's the best character ever.
3453459	3455221	An ambiguously gay character in Suikoden.
3455241	3455901	Ambiguous.
3456622	3457242	All right.
3457342	3459504	Yes, Bobby, I'd love to know your thoughts on Suikoden.
3460496	3461436	I thought it sucked.
3462036	3463117	I think you suck.
3463197	3466217	Okay, why does Suikoden suck?
3466817	3468778	No, it's mainly just to piss Miklatov off.
3468978	3469218	Oh, okay.
3469358	3469898	And it works.
3470018	3471738	You actually think it's a good game, deep inside?
3472719	3474059	I like the first and the third one.
3474319	3475079	What about two?
3475779	3476819	Besides the translation?
3477180	3478680	It was so hard to find.
3479440	3480420	I haven't played it.
3480460	3481280	I can't even find it.
3481460	3482161	Oh, yeah, because it's like $250.
3482301	3484501	Yeah, I'm not going to pay $250.
3484561	3485361	Play five.
3485501	3487022	I wrote that game really well.
3488222	3488662	All right.
3490236	3492498	Bobby, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?
3493339	3493979	No, that was it.
3494019	3495340	I was just doing this for the chat room.
3495600	3496481	All right, I appreciate it.
3497002	3498122	This is what we call quality radio.
3498142	3498943	All right, take care, Bobby.
3500364	3501065	Comedy gold.
3501145	3503587	You can hear little gems like that on his program every week.
3503607	3505789	I like how people call in to make me whine.
3507110	3507650	That's why you're here.
3507670	3508611	That's really fun.
3508691	3510172	That's why you're here, because you're a whiner.
3510653	3515777	All right, any last-minute stories, folks, on Orange Lounge Radio tonight?
3515917	3516597	But of course.
3517018	3517318	Okay.
3517938	3518659	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3544949	3548691	But it's still in development, so look forward to more stuff from that.
3549411	3559435	And of course, if you're looking for a nice clone, in fact, I think a lot of people got in trouble for the Grid Wars.
3559675	3563617	Now they have Trigonometry Wars, the final version, out for the PSP.
3564017	3565838	You can download it on PSP Updates.
3566358	3569820	Definitely something fun if you like Geometry Wars.
3570717	3573479	I heard about all the scandal going around there with Geometry Wars.
3573800	3574040	Yeah.
3574180	3575161	The clones, at least.
3575621	3577162	And people getting sued and stuff.
3577643	3579524	I have one quick last minute story, if you're done with that one.
3579925	3585809	I just want to say real quick, with Madden 07 coming out, Slashdot ran a recent piece.
3586910	3586991	E.A.
3587091	3587551	Online Account
3603590	3610797	and Granting Electronic Arts the ability to collect your name, address, and credit card information as well as a variety of demographic information about how you use their products.
3611237	3615722	Not only that, they explicitly say that they may tie these demographics to your personal information.
3616382	3617643	It's not anonymous here.
3618424	3624450	Now, a site called Gamers With Jobs actually cornered EA and Microsoft about these issues and they were met with silence.
3625009	3626470	The multiplayer version of FEAR, FEAR Combat
3648272	3649814	has been released to the public for free.
3650335	3653718	You can sign up for a free CD key and a download of the game.
3654559	3659124	I don't know the link offhand, but I know we have a link to it in our OL Army Clan section.
3659144	3662268	There's already an OL Army Clan building up for this.
3662388	3663889	I definitely want to check out the game next week.
3665091	3666953	I just finished downloading and installing it.
3667033	3668354	I'm going to be checking it out tonight.
3668634	3668995	Very cool.
3669733	3672094	Oh my god, I'm so scared of this game, I just saw.
3672374	3672715	What's that?
3673195	3676877	Remember how I mentioned last week Happy Feet's coming out on the Wii?
3677217	3678497	I've got Happy Feet!
3678818	3684260	Okay, Happy Feet, for those who don't know, is kind of like a spoof of... Will they have Happy Wii?
3685041	3685321	Okay.
3686562	3687762	No, no, no, get this.
3687782	3693145	Okay, so Happy Feet, basically, as you might know or not know, it is...
3694156	3696957	A movie kind of spoofing the whole March of the Penguins thing.
3696997	3698217	It's got penguins doing stuff.
3698738	3702539	However, Happy Feet the game is going to be like DDR.
3704400	3706120	And with arrows and all.
3706400	3711162	So when I said you could strap the Wii controller to your feet, I wasn't exactly too far off, was I?
3711742	3712542	No, you were not.
3712602	3713163	Interesting.
3713223	3714623	So that's kind of interesting.
3715363	3719325	Some other fun stuff, especially when we get into the speculation area here.
3720506	3724668	The PSP being redesigned, kind of almost like a PSP Lite.
3725408	3727669	It's supposed to be coming out in March.
3727689	3728889	Gee, I wonder where they got that idea.
3730150	3731890	Well, it says it's supposed to be like the PSP Lite.
3731930	3733211	It didn't call it the PSP Lite.
3733911	3735572	Anyways, PSP 2 or whatever.
3736712	3746476	It's going to include 8 gigs of flash memory for storing your wonderful movies and stuff on, as well as they're getting rid of
3747677	3749918	GS68 in our chatroom says, Please fix the D-pad, Sony.
3750038	3750838	And then finally...
3776929	3778470	Of course, gotta mention this.
3779770	3785373	Speaking of speculation, the Xbox 360 is supposed to get another skew.
3785773	3801101	And apparently, rumor for now, it's gonna be a black Xbox 360 with a built-in HD DVD drive, an HDMI AV out, 250 gig hard drive, and PVR functions, like Xbox Live slash DirecTV or that kind of stuff.
3801141	3801921	Planned for $600 US.
3804446	3806226	Oh, yeah, that's a brilliant idea.
3806246	3808507	This is in the official Xbox magazine.
3808987	3810908	Oh, rumor for now.
3812628	3817369	Wait, you had me going bullshit until you said it was in the official Xbox magazine?
3817729	3818469	Yeah, it's rumor, though.
3818909	3819250	Probably.
3819270	3820130	Okay, I don't know.
3820630	3822170	A black Xbox 360, huh?
3822670	3823391	Something for the emo kids.
3823411	3824191	Maybe, I don't know.
3824431	3828272	It sounds a little weird, but I don't know.
3828492	3833793	And finally, I thought I'd mention the lineup since Arcade Wednesdays is still going on.
3834361	3838865	and, of course, we had Texas Hold'em coming out free of charge, as we mentioned, for 48 hours.
3839506	3845091	The week after that, though, we'll be seeing some more stuff, including, I know, what was it?
3845311	3845732	Time Pilot.
3845752	3846172	Time Pilot.
3846652	3846973	Yay!
3847013	3848794	Time Pilot and then Scramble.
3848874	3849976	Yeah, I can do without Scramble.
3850716	3851917	So, yeah.
3852578	3852858	That's it.
3853279	3854079	Huh, interesting.
3854159	3856802	As somebody mentioned in the chat room, and it's true, the...
3858139	3862282	Black Xbox 360 isn't that special because those are the dev kits also.
3862462	3864424	And you have the faceplates too, right?
3864464	3864664	What?
3865044	3868967	I mean, you could make your Xbox 360 black looking with the new faceplates.
3868987	3873270	Well, I'm just saying, we already have 360s in existence that are black, so it's not like...
3873686	3874406	Thanks for watching!
3894656	3897798	Well, I guess it's about time to wrap up the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.
3897878	3900839	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us this week.
3901459	3904821	But we do have one more story for you guys tonight, Loki.
3905921	3908843	We saved this for the end because this is just one of those WTF stories.
3909543	3919908	Well, if you were a high school student and, of course, in a math class, you probably were playing with a TI calculator or TI-83 in this case.
3920689	3923430	Well, there's somebody creating a homebrew calculator
3924131	3924371	and more.
3940610	3942951	It's 50% done so far and it looks pretty cool.
3943351	3947913	If I remember correctly, they actually did port Link's Awakening 2 at TI83 back in the day.
3949054	3952675	A completely original Zelda game on a calculator?
3952935	3959318	The only good thing about the old graphing calculators was that you could type letters into them.
3959778	3962759	I know I used to do this for calculus tests all the time.
3963139	3965520	I'd put in the notes in my calculator and cheat.
3965860	3966361	Exactly.
3966401	3967341	Because I was smart.
3968032	3980096	Well, I remember with, like, the TI-83, you know, big thing when I was just going in high school is they actually, you know, finally got it to run assembly on there and then you could do grayscale and just, like, crazy shit on a calculator.
3981789	3982129	I don't know.
3982269	3989255	I remember that's why I had to drop my calculus class because I was programming games in it instead of listening.
3989535	3991957	A lot of TI-83 love in the chat room.
3991997	3995640	GS68 says, I use my TI-83 Plus to play FireTrack.
3996001	3997182	Kind of a crappy shmup.
3998122	4002066	And some folks are saying, yay, Zelda game, and so on and so forth.
4002926	4005568	EvilCheese666, OMG, I love those calculators.

4015039	4020323	I'm sure if DarkSakura were here, she would say reject false icons, but she'll be back next week.
4020644	4022205	I should point out about next week.
4022485	4026068	Next week's show will not be taped live on Sunday night.
4026768	4029010	This is because, I know this is going to sound hella lame,
4029420	4056618	I have concert tickets on Sunday that I got for my birthday and the person didn't realize that I would have Orange Lounge so of course I gotta go because it's a birthday gift and I'm going to see Journey how cool is that I'm hoping they'll have the old school game there but yeah so we're going to pre-tape next week more news to come to the LiveJournal community we'll probably pre-tape live earlier in the week we'll let you know when as soon as we work it out between the three of us let's go around and get everybody's final thought now Miklatov your final thought
4057515	4062039	I hope my ticket to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour comes pretty soon through the mail.
