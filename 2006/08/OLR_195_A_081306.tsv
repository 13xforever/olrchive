13971	19154	Tonight, August 13th, 2006, is Squeenix going to get in the business of hardware?
19415	21876	Get ready for some retro Sega Genesis action.
22336	25118	What is holding up the PSP download service anyway?
27900	37586	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another wonderful episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
37626	43210	We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gaming culture and of course, video games that don't suck.
43803	44323	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
70717	71597	I would never do such a thing.
71797	72458	I wasn't talking about you.
72918	74738	Also say hello to Loki.
75278	75518	Hi.
76179	76579	Hi, Loki.
76599	76999	How are you doing?
77279	77459	Good.
77999	78239	Hungry.
78699	79000	Hungry?
79280	80400	Why didn't you eat before the show tonight?
80680	81420	Here's some beer nuts.
81560	82521	I want nuts.
84181	85642	You don't like nuts, do you?
85662	86702	I don't like eating nuts.
87202	89843	Tonight also we have some very special guests in the studio.
89883	92224	We actually have some guests tonight who have never been on the show before.
92844	94664	That's a rarity because usually we get the same old people.
94704	96845	But tonight we have some guests.
97005	99826	Our first guest tonight is coming to us all the way from Wisconsin.
100612	101313	Say hello to Megzi!
101353	101493	Hi.
102674	103754	Hi, how you doing?
103774	105316	You can put the mic a little bit closer to your mouth.
105556	105856	Hi.
106216	106817	Hi, how you doing?
106997	107417	I'm okay.
107617	107797	Yeah?
107897	108418	I like your shirt.
108438	109339	You have Mario on your shirt.
109359	110619	Yeah, I wore that specially for the show.
110800	111060	Right on.
111080	111800	Are you a gamer girl?
112041	112301	Uh, yes.
112541	113241	What kind of games do you like?
113902	114602	Um, let's see.
114722	115663	I like RPGs.
115703	117845	Don't be afraid to just get that microphone, like, right there by your mouth.
118005	118405	Ah!
118465	119486	Okay.
119986	121447	Um, let's see.
121467	122328	I like RPGs.
122408	123429	I like platformers.
123929	128953	Um, I actually like any type of game, uh, as long as it's fun.
130046	131447	The Best Game You've Played in the Past Year
155241	156262	A-ha, a-ha, a-ha
178473	179676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
187110	187390	DarkSakura
215939	216499	Pillow fights?
216719	217620	Are there ever pillow fights?
219100	220921	No pillow fights, but we did have an orgy.
220981	221901	We had a Mississippi orgy.
222361	223442	What's a Mississippi orgy?
224202	227063	It's when you get people in a room without their socks or shoes.
228583	229404	It was really hot.
229664	230164	It was hot.
230244	233585	So wait, if I take off my socks right now, because I'll have on my socks.
233765	235246	Uh-oh, Megsie's taking off her socks.
236066	237246	And I'm taking off my socks.
238827	240767	We are now officially having a Mississippi orgy.
240787	242968	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, an orgy.
243028	243588	This is fun.
245149	245449	All right.
245799	246739	Let's get to the games.
246759	250220	Of course, the guys in the room are now going, it's a lesbian show.
250320	250660	Oh, yes.
250720	251981	How could I forget our chat room?
252241	254541	www.orangeloungeradio.com.
254581	257602	Click on chat if you're listening to us live here on this lovely Sunday evening.
258222	259802	And we'd love to hear your opinion.
260923	261743	And then, of course, there we go.
261763	264023	Jeremy Todd, OMG, they're having an orgy on the show.
266344	268265	Tonight's going to be, it's a slow news week, boys and girls.
268305	268845	What can we say?
268945	273226	This is the type of stuff that happens during slow news weeks is we have Mississippi orgies with lesbians.
273626	274046	So this is...
275859	276399	Dead Rising Pinball
306881	318388	and I actually almost, I tried to hunt down the Saturn so I could play our Sega Ages collection that we got from the guy who was the man behind Working Designs who Dan just bought the Twilight Zone pinball from.
319089	319789	He's really awesome.
320610	321630	And Dan got me a monkey.
323992	325373	Like a real monkey that flings poo?
325393	326533	A monkey ball monkey.
327634	327954	Right on.
328374	330336	Yeah, so I have a monkey.
330356	332177	That's cool.
332257	333057	Chris has a monkey too.
334278	335019	I got her the monkey.
335079	335679	I work at GameStop.
336407	337768	GameStop Pride GameStop Pride
359591	360312	So cool.
360652	362033	I don't know how to describe it.
362133	363774	It's so great.
363874	365736	Like, zombie killing is love.
365916	366416	It really is.
366516	373702	I mean, I knew I was in love with Dead Rising the minute I picked up the lawnmower and mowed over 70 zombies in a minute.
374322	374663	I mean...
375785	378887	Whoever thought of this concept for a game, I want to kiss you.
379228	379468	I do.
379528	380108	Right on the lips.
380929	381950	This is a beautiful game.
382010	383371	More games should be like Dead Rising.
383631	385333	Now, Dead Rising's not perfect.
385893	387835	There are some things that need to be fixed for Dead Rising 2.
388175	390056	One of them is that small-ass text size.
390617	391698	I mean, it's really hard to read.
391758	394019	Even on my HDTV, it's kind of hard to read the text.
394059	395961	I know a lot of people have been bitching about this, but...
396341	398642	Seriously, the text has got to be fixed.
399022	401764	The graphical style of Dead Rising isn't for everybody.
402684	405846	I let Mikhail Tov watch me play for a little bit, and he's like, this game looks like crap.
405986	407246	And I said, what are you smoking?
407266	408047	This game's beautiful.
408667	409688	It's a different art style.
410228	412949	It's a little bit cartoonish with the blood, but it's zombies.
413009	414850	It's supposed to be cartoonish.
416451	418372	And then the other thing that kind of annoys me is the saving.
418752	422414	Because you have to save in a bathroom or on a couch.
422734	423674	And it's really weird.
423694	424675	The first time you play, you're not...
425623	428746	Ready for the fact that you're going to die, and you're going to die fast.
428826	433070	And if you select the option that says save and quit, you literally start all over.
434831	438414	So it's a little weird because the game's main mode is a 72 hour mode.
438454	439976	It's not literally 72 hours.
440276	442558	Loki was telling me before the show every hour is 5 minutes.
442618	443399	I couldn't figure it out.
443419	445461	I knew it was running faster than a real hour though.
446421	447162	But the game was...
448399	463506	you know kinda interesting where you would start that over if you selected that but that's kinda cool because you get power yourself up more and more and then you know start the game in in that mode so I like powered myself up to level three and I was like you know I'll start over because I was getting my ass kicked by zombies
464566	467867	Other than those little bitches, I love the game.
468467	470668	I love the fact that you can take pictures of zombies.
471648	473648	I thought it was so hilarious.
474368	475589	What are those Mega Man guys called?
475609	476549	I can never remember their names.
476569	478309	With the little yellow heads.
478669	479490	Servbots, thank you.
479830	483691	I put the little Servbots head on a bunch of zombies and took pictures of them all walking around.
483731	484591	It's really funny.
485171	485591	And then just...
486055	487895	Getting to use all these weapons on zombies.
487915	489716	It's a great aggression taking out game.
490096	498438	I just kind of wish from the start there was like a sandbox mode where it was more like the demo where it just drops you into a sea of zombies with all the items around you and you just start going.
498458	502318	Like, I could do this game without the story for fun and just like a party.
502358	505599	And also, it would be nice if the game had multiplayer.
505839	506499	I know.
507319	512700	Oblivion didn't have multiplayer and it's a great game so it's not like the game has to have multiplayer but it would be so cool.
512840	514521	I mean, it would just make a cool thing even cooler.
514961	515101	So...
516058	516598	Dead Rising.
516718	517879	I do recommend Dead Rising.
517919	519559	I think a lot of you guys would have fun with it.
520179	523460	But just those little minor complaints aside might frustrate you for a little bit.
523501	526502	But then you take your aggression out on zombies with a lawnmower, and it's wonderful.
526762	528742	And then that hook that lets you pull their heads right off.
528842	529262	It's great.
529843	530763	Sounds beautiful.
530923	531523	Yeah, it's fun.
532243	532904	Killing is love.
533064	533884	Killing zombies is love.
534664	535004	Let's see.
535144	539826	So there's Dead Rising, and then I also play more Prey because I'm slowly but surely trying to make my way through Prey still.
540725	542847	which is a great game because you never die.
543168	546270	So it's made for people who suck at first-person shooters like myself.
546330	547251	You'd never die.
547571	552135	You just go to a little spirit world, shoot some Medusa heads or whatever those things are, and then you come back to life.
552476	552936	It's beautiful.
553316	553556	Love it.
554497	556899	Loki, how was your gaming week?
558180	558661	It was okay.
558881	566948	I just played Morgrantheth out of Liberty City Stories to tide me over until Vice City Stories comes out.
568117	570618	I kicked ass this week, so it was awesome.
571598	576959	Played Dead Rising, not too much though, just during lunches.
577739	583821	Got to play the lawnmower and chop zombies up with that, then pick up the lawnmower and just slam it into their head.
584561	592843	And we also, I played Chromehounds, and yes, I did play Chromehounds, and I have been on there, and no one's joined our clan.
593543	596884	One person, you know, Fire Resurrected, excellent, but...
599662	622574	whatever you know talk about the chrome hounds thing in a minute yes it's just i'm ready to go and just no one else wants to but whatever um and then was it i watched someone play a game that will not be named it was cool and creepy but we'll talk about that at another time all right uh magsy chris anything you guys want to say what kind of games you've been playing this week
623140	624861	I played Animal Crossing on the plane.
625301	625581	Yeah?
626081	627201	Yeah.
627341	628042	Did they let you though?
628062	631083	I thought because the DS had the wireless they don't like it when you play DS on the plane.
631263	632243	I didn't have a problem with it.
632423	632903	Okay, that's good.
633203	635124	And I tried to finish Kingdom Hearts 2.
636064	639025	See, I was real smart and played it the first time around on proud mode.
640206	642646	And I'm having a hard time beating it.
643247	644267	Okay.
644427	648808	And I played a really old school arcade machine Super Mario Brothers.
650089	650509	That was fun.
651394	652074	Are you a big Mario fan?
652094	653615	Because I noticed you have Mario on your shirt.
653635	654775	Yes, I am a big Mario fan.
654816	659898	I'm looking forward to Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii and Super Paper Mario on the GameCube.
660078	662519	Now, some people thought that Mario on the Wii looked kind of weird.
663199	663499	Is that okay?
663519	664520	Mario always looks weird.
667681	667981	All right.
668622	668862	All right.
668902	669642	Very cool.
669982	672243	Now, I need to get from the lesbian perspective.
672643	674444	Who's better, Peach or Daisy?
674484	674964	Oh, Peach.
676845	677506	Why Peach?
677666	678386	Because she's hotter.
681268	683910	I'll have you know, though, whenever I play Mario Party, I always play as Peach.
684290	685551	Because she's also got attitude.
685591	687032	You know, she's like, Peach is the winner!
687593	688073	That's me.
688573	690134	I'm the winner whenever I play Mario Party.
690354	691255	So, just thought I'd share.
691875	693436	Any games you're looking forward to coming out soon?
693556	694357	Dirge of Cerberus.
695037	695178	Oh.
695618	696258	You like Vincent?
696518	697319	I love Vincent.
697339	699220	She made me.
699560	699961	Oh, Mike?
701342	703443	She actually called when she was coming down here.
703923	705685	She had me go to the GameStop and reserve it.
708466	708987	That's awesome.
709247	710648	Yeah, I'm kind of...
711961	722089	I had it reserved at my GameStop, and I realized I was going to be here, and I was like, go to the GameStop and reserve it so I can get it.
722109	724731	So you guys are going to play all night when it comes out?
725371	725672	Probably.
727575	734037	I played it a little bit, AE3, but it wasn't Final Fantasy enough for me because it's more like live action, which is cool.
734057	742179	I know there's people that are into that more action-style game, but I'll still check it out when the final game comes out, make my final decision then, but I hope you enjoy it.
742520	746381	You know the first time I played through Final Fantasy VII, I never even got Vincent because I'm so stupid.
746421	747601	I never figured out to open the safe.
747701	749862	Well, it took me forever to figure out how to get him.
751522	754043	I got him first time without the book.
754143	755323	Well, look at you.
755343	756184	Good for you.
756204	757104	And Yuffie.
758086	759727	Well, Yuffie's easy to get.
759787	760707	It's because Yuffie's easy.
761668	762648	Chris, I'm sorry.
762708	764389	Chris, anything you want to share about your gaming week?
765250	776136	Well, again, I'm a gamer in the old school sense, so I play D&D and stuff like that, but I do have Sims 2 on my Mac, and that kind of has me really, really addicted.
776456	777596	So I play a lot of that.
778737	780318	Do you like to kill your Sims?
780338	781538	Because I know that's what Loki does.
781999	784320	What are some clever death traps you come up with for your Sims?
784760	785921	My favorite one is...
786872	787613	and DarkSakura.com
812203	814026	They scream, and they scream really loud.
814146	821336	You know, I had a gay friend once who made his homo palace once on The Sims, and he put, what's the most number of Sims you can have in a house?
821356	821736	Like eight?
822017	824320	Yeah, eight, and in this game I think you can have like
824636	825957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
844277	847561	and had to do the cooking for him and she finally died of exhaustion.
847782	851988	It's so funny because she passes out in the middle of the room and the guys don't care.
852388	853910	They're still making out with each other and stuff.
853930	854992	They're like, oh, she just died.
855713	857235	It's really funny if you have them on...
858123	883939	I made the mistake of having put them on freestyle like they can pretty much if you're not paying attention they'll do whatever the heck they want and like four or five of my sims who weren't supposed to go make out with each other went and made out with each other because they've in the second game they've got like chemistry like lightning connection chemistry and they just ended up making out and then getting pissed at each other because they watched the person they just made out make out with somebody else so it's drama more Melrose Place oh yeah it was a sim soap opera
885387	887209	That's some of the fun stuff to do with the Sims, though.
887229	888350	I think that's why that game's so popular.
888450	890391	I need to find my Sims 2 disc, because I miss playing it.
890732	891693	Can you play that online?
891813	893754	No, I guess you can't, because they have the Sims online.
894895	899800	It's kind of moot anyway, because my DVD drive on my PC is busted, so I'll have to get the Mac one anyway.
899820	902062	Because I'm getting my iMac soon!
902082	904223	Yay!
904263	905645	Let's see, I'm reading chat rooms.
905665	908667	Some other folks are sharing their Sims stories here.
908747	909368	Pooeater says,
909969	913270	I had made a house with each sim in their own room with only one thing.
913591	917212	Like, one would have a TV, one would have a fridge, one would have a toilet, then enjoy the show.
917452	920013	Because they have to go to each other's houses to borrow things, I guess.
920053	921374	That's kind of interesting.
922714	926316	And PKakura88 is clearing up the DS thing on the plane for me, saying...
926869	929372	Unless it's during takeoff and landing, it really doesn't matter.
929492	932875	Yeah, because they make you turn off everything during takeoff and landing.
933055	933976	You know, I fly enough.
934036	936979	I should know that, but I just never... For some reason, I never bring my DS.
937059	938981	I do a lot of short flights to LA.
939021	943025	I had my iPod during takeoff and landing, and they didn't seem to care.
943345	943565	Really?
943826	944086	Yeah.
944246	947089	Well, either they didn't seem... The plane didn't crash, so...
950143	954727	Did you fly during all the chaos that was going on recently?
955247	958029	No, I actually totally missed all the chaos.
958049	961232	I'm just recently hearing a little bit about what's been happening.
964054	967517	Not that we're getting into CNN podcasts, but this was basically...
968141	968901	Thank you for watching!
990333	995176	All right, before we get into tonight's program, we have some housekeeping to take care of.
1019457	1021720	Unless you're smack-talking Bobby Blackwolf, then it's fine.
1022741	1025003	You know, we want to have a drama-free environment there.
1025043	1030470	So we made a whole new forum over there on OrangeMonster.com for folks to start clans and games.
1030510	1031851	It's been working out pretty well so far.
1031891	1037838	We have folks in Halo 2, and a couple folks in Guild Wars, and I noticed the Steam games are getting a lot of folks.
1038178	1040261	So check that out over on OrangeMonster.com.
1041124	1042907	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1055273	1057635	A little bit of smack leading up to this tournament.
1057755	1060537	Okay, first off, no one has consulted me on anything in this.
1060598	1063880	They nominated me to play this damn game, for one.
1064381	1068364	It's hard enough when there's freaking Dead Rising coming out, because that game is very distracting.
1068704	1073649	Especially when Chromehounds, they move really slow, there's no zombies in it, that kind of thing.
1074229	1079974	Then, for some reason, somehow, no rules were discussed at all, no ground rules, just somebody decided...
1080394	1080914	Thanks for watching!
1100686	1102748	So we need more people to do this.
1102768	1111256	So please, if you're a Chromehounds player, you want to have a little fun on Sunday about 1 o'clock Pacific time, please come to our forums and say you would like to participate.
1111336	1120645	Otherwise, I'm going to have to figure out how to get in there and I'll play as Mr. Spanky in the Chromehounds Invitational and that's going to be kind of sad.
1121158	1121798	Thanks for watching!
1134875	1139718	GamerAndy better start working out to DDR, because he's going down.
1140458	1142799	Well, here's the bad thing about Chromehounds, first off.
1143139	1147682	You have to be online in order for people to sign up for your clan, which is retarded anyways.
1148502	1153845	Because what's the point of having that clan password thing if... I don't get it.
1157413	1158294	We'll figure something out.
1158334	1162480	So please, OL Army, save us so we don't embarrass ourselves too bad one week from today.
1162500	1163481	I'm not going to embarrass myself.
1163501	1165243	I'm just saying, you know, that's kind of fucked up.
1165263	1166364	Look, you can take them all on.
1167065	1167626	Oh, yeah.
1167706	1170730	Let me just take them all on while they're attacking my base and shit.
1170770	1171131	I can't be...
1173138	1173519	Exactly.
1173899	1175441	Blaze does have a good point.
1175521	1179405	Hitstun from the OL Army has already owned Blackwolf and Tetris.
1179866	1182749	So if we lose miserably at this, at least it'll be evened up.
1182849	1184411	So there can't be a lot of shit talking.
1185332	1185592	Fine.
1185652	1186513	I'll do my best.
1186553	1186854	There you go.
1186874	1187234	You know what?
1187274	1188455	I can't speak for the rest of them.
1188475	1188856	There you go.
1190440	1191921	I won't be getting my ass handed to me.
1192122	1194624	So please, Chromehound players, we need your help.
1195084	1196725	Come to the OL Army forums immediately.
1197526	1203350	One other piece of housekeeping I want to get out there is that we actually have an addendum to a previously reported on story.
1203670	1210996	You know, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we try to report accurate information, but once in a while something's going to slip through the cracks that maybe wasn't correct.
1211136	1211396	Oops.
1211757	1219823	But this is interesting because not a lot of people know that this is not correct, but we've received a trusted anonymous tip
1220325	1222506	So I can't tell you who it's from, but it's a trusted source.
1223006	1229668	And they're telling us that that song list we announced a couple shows back to elite beat agents that's run on a lot of sites is wrong.
1230208	1232889	So that might actually be good news for some people.
1232949	1236950	So folks that were a little disappointed at some of the picks, like didn't they have like Linkin Park and stuff on that list?
1237110	1237530	I think.
1237670	1238510	Hardware store.
1238890	1241691	Yeah, which is kind of cool that, you know, Weird Al would have been okay with.
1241911	1247693	But we have received a tip that that is absolutely wrong and that only the demo songs are
1248291	1251774	are ones you can count on actually seeing in the full version, which would make sense.
1251834	1255237	But as for the rest of the song list, you'll just have to wait and see.
1255637	1261682	And also the last housekeeping thing, of course, we upped our cap on listeners.
1261762	1267827	So, yeah, instead of capping out at 50 or whatever, we've got a lot more than that.
1267887	1271510	So now you can listen without worrying about, you know,
1272082	1272843	Not being able to.
1272943	1278167	Yeah, so please come listen live to us on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on OrangeHandsRadio.com.
1278207	1281590	You shouldn't get locked out of the feed anymore because we have plenty of room now.
1282210	1285833	But of course, if you can't do it Sunday nights because you're watching, I don't know, what's on Sunday nights?
1285873	1286874	Touched by an Angel or whatever?
1287534	1288475	Oh, Desperate Housewives.
1288795	1289776	Well, all those shows suck.
1290116	1293059	So if you... Buy a TiVo.
1293179	1293779	Buy a TiVo.
1295360	1298603	So if you can't listen to us on Sunday... Okay, Magsie's making pouty faces at me.
1299244	1300305	I can't get pouty face.
1300325	1301146	I like Grey's Anatomy.
1301246	1301546	Do you?
1302006	1304628	Isn't it just a bunch of doctors having sex with each other or something?
1304649	1304909	Pretty much.
1304929	1305809	I like Desperate Housewives.
1305829	1306390	That's pretty funny.
1306510	1307231	I just sound pretty hot.
1307351	1309372	So Desperate Housewives is a pretty hot show.
1309653	1310513	I have seen a little bit of it.
1310533	1310914	It's pretty hot.
1311734	1323564	But anyway, if you have to watch your Desperate Housewives or Grey's Anatomy, you don't have a TiVo, you could always listen to the All Games Rebroadcast, which is Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.
1323624	1326026	Also a little bit earlier for you East Coast folks.
1327852	1330736	and Central like Wisconsin if you want to listen to it live.
1331316	1338066	But of course, podcast, podcast is love and we know there's lots of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed and for that we're most appreciative.
1338126	1338586	Thanks a bunch.
1339423	1349846	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news now, and we're going to start it off tonight with a story about the Wii, and I might be in trouble for that previous bet I made about how there's not going to be 20 games that Wii launch.
1350366	1367071	Well, it doesn't look like there's going to be 21st party Wii games, so I'm going to have to go back and listen to the bet for sure, but it does look like there are going to be 27 Wii games that are released on the day the Wii is out, which of course is still unknown, but we do have 27 confirmed titles.
1367351	1368612	Loki seems to think it's going to be more than 27.
1369278	1369940	I think it's more than that.
1370541	1370781	Really?
1371122	1373207	Yeah, because I know some that aren't even on that list.
1373247	1374971	Do you want me to read this list real quick for you guys?
1375292	1375793	Alright, here we go.
1376501	1405679	Avatar, The Last Airbender, Blazing Angels, Blitz the League, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors, Elebits, Excite Truck, Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, Madden NFL 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Metal Slug Anthology, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, and
1405879	1419826	Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center, Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.
1420146	1427430	So now I ask you folks in studio, if you had to buy two of those games from that list, you only have enough money to buy two of the games, which two are you getting at launch?
1427730	1427991	Loki?
1429591	1430692	I've already got them on order.
1430952	1432513	Red Steel and...
1435690	1436851	Did you mention GT?
1437511	1438472	Yes, GT Pro Series.
1438852	1440053	GT actually looks pretty good.
1441114	1441815	Red Steel and GT.
1443016	1444257	DarkSakura, you don't know?
1446539	1447199	Do our other girls know?
1447240	1448360	Megzi, which two are you going to get?
1449101	1453145	I'm number one Nintendo fangirl in the world, so I'll be getting Zelda.
1453465	1457989	And then for the second one, Red Steel, I think.
1458509	1459070	You like swords?
1459090	1459650	You like ninjas?
1460111	1461572	Yeah, I just looked it over.
1463069	1463970	DarkSakura, do you think you know?
1464210	1467893	Yeah, I'm going to get Zelda and the Metal Slug Anthology.
1469815	1471216	Chris, do you think you know which two you'd get?
1472477	1474999	Probably Zelda and Cars.
1477340	1477781	You dork.
1479802	1482344	I can tell you right now.
1482404	1483185	Which two would I get?
1483525	1485267	Oh, I'm so glad you asked.
1486127	1486768	I'm going to get three.
1486868	1487028	Three.
1492302	1494463	No, I know, but in real life I'm going to get three.
1494844	1495984	Okay, but which two?
1496144	1501227	I would say... I'm going to say Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Excite Truck.
1501928	1503449	And I don't know why I'm leaving... Excite Truck was cool.
1503509	1506090	I don't know why I'm leaving out Zelda, but I'm going to borrow yours.
1506251	1508492	Yeah, you're going to... We can trade.
1509873	1512074	I'm coming to your house and playing your Zelda.
1512474	1514854	If we all get two, then we can all play each other's.
1514974	1515795	There we go.
1516195	1517355	We will play with each other's.
1517475	1518535	There's a couple things missing.
1518615	1521576	First off, where's Super Mario Galaxy?
1522296	1526337	I noticed, but didn't Miyamoto say a while back that it may not be exactly ready at launch?
1526357	1528678	It'll be in the launch window, and that's what these are anyways.
1529898	1532920	There's also a few that I mentioned a couple weeks ago.
1533000	1536742	Rappala Trophies, which is supposed to be coming out for your fishing fans, I guess.
1538143	1544287	And there was also a couple that I'm mentioning this week that aren't on that list, and they're part of Midway's lineup.
1545067	1549670	And, of course, Midway, we announced weeks ago, Rampage Soul Destruction.
1549710	1551551	Now everybody's finally picked up on that.
1552252	1553452	Two more that are going to be added.
1553512	1555994	They're Happy Feet, which is based on that...
1556881	1559163	Really crappy movie that's coming out.
1559303	1560644	I've got happy feet.
1561665	1563067	I want to see that.
1563767	1567851	Can I take the controllers to my feet and then do tap dancing?
1568171	1568631	That would be fun.
1568651	1568932	I don't know.
1568972	1573656	But then also the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy are going to be getting in the game as well.
1574737	1577579	So those are going to be two coming from Midway.
1577719	1578500	And there's a lot more.
1578700	1582804	They're announcing seven at Let's Big in a couple weeks here.
1582864	1583424	Oh, that's true.
1583444	1583484	So...
1585265	1586407	That's definitely not the fullest.
1586427	1590793	Now, Funnydale says he's going to get a Barbie's Horse Adventure for the Wii when it comes out.
1590913	1591874	Is he going to be disappointed?
1591934	1593116	Is that a launch game or no?
1593236	1594999	I don't think they even announced anything like that.
1595740	1596481	Well, hopefully.
1596561	1597642	That would be fun with the Wii.
1599004	1599285	Alright.
1600926	1603147	Anyway, that's all I have to say on the Wii.
1603428	1605148	Well, yeah, go Wii.
1605589	1610671	But anyways, a few things that we're definitely speculating besides the launch date.
1611392	1615654	IGN's got speculation on the release date and the price point for it.
1616674	1617615	Oh, hooray!
1617675	1619816	More release date and price speculation.
1619876	1620957	Just what this show needed.
1620977	1629101	Because I was just thinking this week, gosh, we really haven't had a story on release date or price point speculation in the past week.
1629501	1630983	So we really need one tonight.
1631063	1631864	Thank you, Loki.
1631944	1633385	Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
1633725	1634406	You're welcome.
1634987	1644015	And of course, their speculation is November 2nd or November 12th, because apparently their sources can't make up their minds on which it is.
1644864	1653710	because probably because no one knows yet because they've given them a, you know, have your games ready by, you know, this time period and then we'll, you know, announce a date then.
1654030	1656391	I mean, they don't have to launch with the third-party games.
1656452	1659113	I mean, because if they come a few weeks later, it's not going to matter.
1659754	1668099	Then the price point they've announced, they said $229 is going to be the price point and that, well, I don't know where they pulled that out of.
1668779	1669640	How about their ass?
1670821	1672642	You know, I think that
1673595	1682682	I think that I have heard every single date in the fourth quarter guessed for the Wii launch at work because I work at GameStop.
1682782	1686144	I think that everybody's guessed every single date for Wii launch.
1686444	1689026	It's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter.
1691210	1694032	Folks, I have a big world exclusive for you guys.
1694112	1698474	We here at Orange Launch Radio, we are absolutely confident we know the release date of the Wii.
1698554	1699375	And I'm going to give it to you.
1699435	1702936	We have inside sources that have told us the actual release date of the Wii.
1702976	1703457	So here it is.
1703977	1707319	The Wii will be released soon.
1712199	1740110	and when it comes out soon then you can say I heard that first on Orange Lounge Radio and they were right right on Orange Lounge Radio for guessing the release date of the Wii it was indeed soon well I'm actually saying I'm still sticking with October 18th just because it's the anniversary and you know but people say oh they don't release their systems on Wednesdays they release them on Sundays who gives a fuck okay honestly I mean
1740945	1741865	They can do whatever they want.
1741885	1742545	They're Nintendo.
1743625	1744846	They can say, you know what, bitches?
1744906	1746446	We decided to release our game.
1746726	1748566	We're going to release it on Wednesday because, you know what?
1748766	1749246	Fuck you.
1749727	1751047	It starts with a W and it's Wii.
1751727	1752867	And our new mascot is Wario.
1753907	1754367	Waluigi.
1754687	1755147	Waluigi.
1755588	1756608	It's Wii Wednesdays.
1756888	1757988	Yeah, Waluigi's a pun.
1759168	1759568	I don't know.
1761268	1764849	And demonstrating the Wii live on stage will be Giggling Lesbians.
1765089	1765549	Let's hear it.
1766109	1766749	Yay!
1767470	1768170	I have to explain this.
1768250	1769850	Waluigi is a pun because...
1771571	1776715	It sort of is, but Wadoichi is because it would be sort of Wado-y, which is bad.
1777315	1780898	Yeah, that's why I thought that Wario was... Same thing, they're both the same.
1782058	1787342	Last night... Okay, no responding to things that aren't said in mics.
1787762	1788123	Sorry.
1788603	1791425	Because now they think it's something dirty that you're responding to.
1791445	1797049	And I'm trying... We got an explicit tag last week, so I'm trying to avoid it this week, please.
1797069	1798810	Oh, that's not going to happen.
1798830	1798910	Even...
1800117	1801838	The lesbians are keeping it pretty clean tonight.
1801938	1804640	They left the pillows at home, so I'm pretty excited.
1804660	1805381	We kept it for you.
1807322	1808983	Maybe during the afterbirth, we'll see.
1809403	1811825	Alright, let's keep it moving.
1811845	1824734	Speaking of Wario, and Waluigi, and the beautiful cast of the various Mario games, there is going to be a Mario Strikers sequel on the Wii.
1826295	1827276	And we have a happy Megzi.
1828986	1830488	Are you a fan of Mario Strikers?
1830508	1835573	Do you think you'll like Wii Sports though because of Miyamoto's giant head as one of the characters?
1847989	1848950	I really don't know.
1849290	1859217	I'm hoping that it'll be fun just because it's on the Wii and you actually get to do stuff as opposed to just pushing a button on a remote control and then whoever throws the football.
1860258	1866723	There's a video of me on YouTube that somebody took of playing Wii Sports and I look like I'm not having any fun at all.
1866903	1867984	It's the most depressing thing.
1868184	1870846	But I really enjoyed the game and I was just exhausted from the day.
1870986	1871746	Oh, hi, news story.
1871846	1872066	Sorry.
1872567	1873467	Yes, Rob.
1876169	1876770	Dear God.
1880373	1882474	I don't worship you, but I do adore you.
1882974	1883275	Sorry.
1883415	1883695	Sorry.
1884175	1885596	Okay, fine.
1886797	1887317	Okay, yeah.
1887557	1895483	So they actually were saying that Super Mario Strikers was supposed to, the sequel was supposed to be one of the games that was announced at the Games Convention in Germany.
1896263	1900406	And this speculation is going to be like a, you know, an online multiplayer Strikers.
1901246	1902587	So that sounds like it's a pretty good deal.
1902827	1904268	And now I'm done, Rob.
1904728	1905429	You can interrupt me.
1905851	1913116	Well, I was going to say this from chat, is that Ari Mosson of the Oil Army thinks he has the new marketing campaign for the Nintendo Wii.
1913596	1920180	So here's this giant enemy lesbian, and you attack its weak point for massive pleasure.
1920700	1922661	Massive pleasure, because it's a lesbian.
1926344	1927144	I love our chat room.
1928205	1929806	Hugs and kisses to the OLR chat.
1931610	1934032	I will check out Super Mario Strikers on the Wii.
1934212	1935173	It would be fun, I bet.
1935914	1936455	I will not.
1936735	1937195	Why not?
1937476	1938837	Because it's stupid.
1939918	1943441	The original game was stupid, and this one will be equally as stupid.
1943461	1944642	Oh, Macy's going to punch you.
1946864	1947505	All right, look.
1947765	1952009	How about a Squeenix story to break up the hate a little bit here in the room?
1952269	1954751	Squeenix are what we like to call Square Enix.
1954791	1957454	We call them Squeenix because a lot of their games make us squee.
1958778	1970878	And what's going on there is that Yoishi Wada, who is the president of Square, spoke recently about what game creators need to do for next-gen platforms and how developers will have to work together to move the industry forward.
1971899	1972661	There's a quote here.
1973453	1979035	This is one of the reasons Square Enix will collaborate with Taito, a company that produces physical hardware, he said.
1979436	1983237	In our talks with Taito, ideas for an actual physical product have come up.
1983657	1985838	In any case, we will be releasing some thing.
1986419	1990681	It's interesting in that it's not the sort of thing you would expect from Square Enix.
1991341	1994102	So they're talking about releasing a thing.
1994762	1996263	Like a hardware thing.
1996363	2000065	And I'm not talking about that sword from Dragon Quest.
2001105	2002486	Is this game console?
2002526	2002926	What is this?
2003866	2009250	It's going to be a game that does not have the word final or fantasy in the title.
2009270	2010651	It's going to be a trans vibrator.
2012012	2013333	I don't know.
2014234	2020918	Do you think maybe it's a... I think maybe something they might do is maybe a dedicated... Like, you remember those old Game & Watch type games?
2021098	2025422	Maybe something like that, but a little more souped up, but a square franchise or product.
2025982	2029104	Maybe something like a game, a standalone game, plug-and-play type.
2029124	2032226	Whatever it is, I'm sure it's going to be another sequel to Final Fantasy VII.
2033888	2034728	Do you think it's a console?
2035529	2035729	No.
2036249	2036409	No?
2036609	2037090	Too crowded?
2037470	2039971	Too crowded, and... No.
2040831	2042392	You just don't see Square Enix getting into console?
2042432	2045394	Although, you know, in Japan, they might do really well with a console.
2045554	2045714	No.
2046114	2050116	It's going to be Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie hits puberty or something.
2050136	2052517	Alright, alright.
2054418	2056819	It's going to be, okay, I like Megzy's idea.
2056840	2059641	It's going to have Aerith as a zombie, and you have to go around and shoot her.
2061076	2062858	Again and again and again.
2062878	2063758	And she keeps coming back.
2064739	2066040	You just keep killing her.
2066260	2067781	She's the holy zombie.
2067801	2070864	FireResurrected sent me a private message, and of course I read those publicly.
2072025	2073906	I'm not encouraging you to send me private messages, please.
2073946	2077029	I get inundated with them during the show, but I thought this comment was good.
2077289	2079411	Squeenix is releasing an arcade machine.
2079531	2080932	Taito makes arcade machines.
2082386	2083566	That's a good thought.
2083586	2085627	We have Puzzle Bobble featuring Cloud.
2086067	2087688	I like this idea from Firebomba.
2087808	2088768	I loved Urgeis.
2089028	2090208	How about Urgeis in the arcades?
2090409	2091709	Urgeis was in the arcades.
2091969	2093469	It was an arcade game first.
2093810	2099511	Final Fantasy 13 versus on the, you know, in the arcades.
2099992	2100412	Okay, okay.
2100432	2102852	I used to go play, the bowling alley used to play DDR.
2102872	2104853	They had an Urgeis machine there and a virtual lawn.
2105013	2105673	I lived there.
2107254	2107474	Hmm.
2108154	2108354	No.
2108714	2110455	Anyways, speaking of stuff...
2111860	2112220	I don't know.
2112520	2113040	It's kind of funny.
2114421	2118682	There's another person out there making something very interesting soon.
2118702	2124164	Apparently some fan on the internet decided they want their Madden holiday to be coming a little bit early.
2124704	2127505	So they've put out this fake Madden coupon.
2127525	2133167	A preferred customer coupon that's basically supposed to get you the game when they get it.
2133227	2136168	Which is, you know, most of the retail stores are getting it a week early.
2137429	2139029	So that they can get it before street day.
2139409	2140830	And it's hilarious because
2141817	2145659	XBOX 360, XBOX PlayStation 2, and GameCube versions available at participating stores only.
2167972	2171375	It basically entitles you to get in the game.
2171775	2172736	There's the keyword!
2176619	2178140	Participating stores only.
2180082	2181623	You still have to participate.
2183004	2189850	I still think there's going to be some employee at a Walmart, Target, Kmart type store that's going to fall for this or GameStop.
2190010	2194073	They'll go ahead and scan in said coupon or not know of it.
2194194	2195875	They don't have to sell it to this guy.
2197249	2198710	Whatever, I mean, fine.
2199130	2201512	Go ahead and try to get your free Madden game early.
2202352	2209237	It's Madden, come on, it's not that different from last year, so if you're really in a hurry to get it, go right ahead.
2209317	2215261	Actually, my understanding is the Madden fans were pretty disappointed with Madden 06 on the 360, so they're really looking forward to Madden 07.
2215621	2218824	Yeah, because something else is better than something crappy, I guess.
2219924	2220625	Whatever, but...
2221994	2222755	Alright, good luck.
2222775	2232121	Oh, and by the way, it says they forgot to run the coupon through Spellchecker because they, you know, misspelled include.
2232401	2233082	It's inclus.
2233422	2233882	Good job.
2234503	2235443	Good job, Forgers.
2237345	2246471	Speaking of EA and upcoming releases, Spore, you might need a coupon to get this early because apparently 2007, and we're not talking early 2007, but more like the...
2250750	2255232	The second half of 2007 is when you're going to be getting Spore.
2255633	2257674	This game seems to be getting pushed back and back.
2257754	2269380	I originally remembered this was going to be late 2006, but now it looks like February or mid-2007, at least online game retailers GameStop.com and EBGames.com have that list.
2270040	2273462	Will Wright seemed to say that it's not going to make it until July 2007.
2273522	2277023	Quote, we're saying the second half of next year, 2007, for now.
2278965	2281166	Wow, so this game is really getting pushed back.
2281206	2284589	But if the game looks like it did, this game is epic.
2285329	2287130	It's like Sims x 5.
2287771	2290272	I mean, it's just freaking huge, this game.
2291273	2292133	It's going to be something else.
2292453	2295775	If for nothing else than to throw aliens from your tractor beam in the ship.
2295815	2296856	That was a lot of fun.
2297216	2297917	That's pretty cool.
2298317	2300358	But we do know some games that will be coming out.
2300779	2304521	And I'll go ahead and make this mention now since I'm not going to be on the show next week.
2305485	2308726	Um, I'm going to go ahead and do the next two weeks of European release dates.
2308926	2309446	How's that sound?
2309866	2312066	Especially since there's all the crap coming out this week.
2313287	2325009	Um, on the 18th we have Pathologic, um, Premier Manager 2006-2007, Pro Shirt Golf, blah blah blah, uh, SpecNAS, Project Wolf, uh, Spinout on PSP.
2325669	2328630	On the 23rd we have Texas Hold'em, 25th, a bunch of good stuff.
2329090	2331471	Dig Dug, Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, yay.
2333544	2335765	PowerWorld, and Reservoir Dogs.
2336465	2340427	And also Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror, and World War I Aces of the Sky.
2340467	2342167	These are all European releases.
2344268	2344708	Excellent.
2345809	2351451	As far as releases go for this week, it's definitely going to be a lot better than last week, but not by much.
2352271	2355672	You've got Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service on the PlayStation 2.
2356673	2358633	Of course, 99 Nights on the Xbox 360.
2358673	2358834	Woohoo!
2362084	2362825	I'm excited about that one.
2363085	2371370	On the DS, you're getting Deep Labyrinth from Atlus and Freedom Wings, which is kind of like a pilot wings shooter type game.
2371690	2376273	Sounds like something I'd find in the women's sanitation aisle at the store, or sanitary things.
2377874	2378515	Let's see here.
2379771	2387334	The Ever Generic World Racing 2 on the Xbox, and Zonide on the Xbox, which is good for those Hikaruku fans out there.
2387954	2398558	Of course, next week we have Madden NFL 07 coming out, as well as Pac-Man World Rally, and doing a re-release of Zoo and Zookeeper on DS.
2398719	2399059	Why?
2399439	2400079	I don't know why.
2401400	2403600	You can play Zookeeper online, it's called Bejeweled.
2403881	2405701	And Rappala Trophies on the PSP.
2408715	2410136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2433294	2443237	Of course, some of the other ones I thought were interesting, Bioshock and Darkness, are both coming out on April 5th, so check those out.
2444037	2454760	And then some of my favorites, of course, would be the Konami games, and I'm sure we're going to hear more of this coming pretty soon, but DDR Universe is scheduled for December 2nd.
2455976	2457077	So that should be pretty good.
2457277	2459058	And Karaoke Revolution American Idol.
2459358	2461140	That's a big pushback for Universe, isn't it?
2461160	2464262	Because I remember Universe was originally scheduled earlier.
2464722	2470046	And Karaoke Revolution American Idol is going to be coming out, looks like, December 6th.
2470506	2473929	Also, Ultramix 4, that's going to be coming out November 15th.
2474029	2479033	And what's really interesting about it is the price for the actual game by itself, only $29.99.
2479853	2480954	So that's pretty good.
2481574	2482015	Another thing...
2483456	2488400	I was going to mention, because we're going to be talking about game prices later on, some cheap games and stuff.
2489181	2497167	One game that is out there that's probably the cheapest 360 game you're going to find, and this just dropped in price, heard it here first, Ridge Racer 6, $19.99.
2498428	2502351	You can find it now at all participating retailers out there.
2502411	2502631	So, $19.99.
2502671	2509016	And to be honest, that game is not a bad game, but for some reason, the worst selling game in the United States for the 360s, so...
2511144	2511605	Bully in Europe
2525534	2534440	Rockstar saying that the October release date was going to apply to Europe as well as the U.S.
2535781	2544026	The British Board of Film Classification said that they were having issues with the title, but they said it wasn't anywhere near ready.
2544086	2547749	However, Rockstar saying it's on its way.
2548790	2549050	Cool.
2549730	2550731	That's pretty interesting.
2551397	2551977	Lots of good stuff.
2552278	2555240	I've been looking forward to Bully after seeing the trailer this week.
2555500	2556500	The trailer looks good.
2556520	2557901	I haven't watched it yet.
2557921	2558842	I see you nodding your head.
2559082	2560683	What's exciting you about the game Bully?
2561404	2563905	Okay, so when I was a kid in school, I was a bully.
2565106	2566167	Wait, you were the bully?
2566187	2566987	I was the bully.
2567108	2567388	Okay.
2567448	2573432	And so I'm looking forward to that game and reliving my days as an evil bully in a Catholic school.
2573452	2575493	Wait, I thought it was the other way around, that you beat up the bullies.
2576234	2577855	Oh, I thought it was that you are the bully.
2579015	2581217	See, I think in a good game you get to play both ends of it.
2582043	2584725	Loki, settle this, because you've been following this game more than I have.
2584845	2586906	Are you the bully, or are you the person beating up the bully?
2587386	2593170	I think you're the person, you're just kind of a kid there, and you're being bullied, and I think you might also be the bully.
2593190	2594771	You're kind of like this kid that's just trouble.
2596012	2596893	Okay, that'll work.
2597133	2606739	It's like you're trouble, but you've gotten introduced to this, you know, basically kind of like a private school, so you're no longer, you know,
2607737	2611020	The big one on campus, you know, you're kind of, you know, getting bullied.
2611280	2613662	So you are bullied, but you're also getting bullied at the same time.
2613742	2616084	It's basically school mayhem and that kind of stuff.
2616244	2617785	Either way, it's violence.
2617805	2618666	It's violence.
2618686	2620707	It's violence, and it makes Jack Thompson angry.
2620888	2622489	So, how can you go wrong?
2622509	2626192	And it has schoolgirls making out with people, so that's awesome.
2626232	2628253	Which makes our lesbians in-house very happy.
2628354	2629354	Dude, that makes me happy.
2629515	2631836	Dude, Catholic school...
2632967	2635428	CatholicSkullGirls in those cute little outfits.
2635448	2636708	Those are hot little skirts.
2637188	2638709	I just bought a DVD that has those in them.
2639609	2639989	Whoa!
2640049	2640769	Whoa!
2640809	2640949	Whoa!
2641209	2641409	Whoa!
2641690	2642130	Whoa!
2642170	2642430	Hello!
2642630	2643970	Where have you been shopping lately?
2644710	2645691	Castro Street.
2646931	2647371	Okay.
2649952	2650232	Well.
2651164	2654405	Moving right along, let's talk about Xbox Live Arcade.
2654745	2664687	Now, Major Nelson's blog is saying that the Xbox Live Wednesday thing was over with the release of Pac-Man this week, which, by the way, I forgot to mention I did download and play this week.
2665847	2666948	It's Pac-Man, you know.
2668228	2669148	You know what you're getting into.
2669228	2675850	If you haven't played Pac-Man yet, I don't think you're really a gamer if you haven't played Pac-Man at some point in your life.
2676910	2679651	So you know what to expect from the Xbox version of Pac-Man.
2679811	2680671	There's not a lot of frills.
2681109	2682910	Sure, you get achievements, but Pac-Man is Pac-Man.
2683310	2684811	But anyway, Major Nelson says that's it.
2685092	2685492	No more.
2685812	2689935	But the official Xbox magazine seems to be begging to differ a little bit.
2689975	2698621	They have a release schedule, which includes August 16th, Texas Hold'em, August 23rd, Time Pilot, which Jamie was on the ColecoVision at one point.
2699501	2700422	Why you saw that.
2701062	2705846	August 30th, Scramble, and September 6th, Luminous Live.
2705926	2708667	And that's the one I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to there.
2709088	2712370	Time Pilot and Scramble, by the way, are old-ass Konami games, if you've never heard of them.
2712390	2713171	I like Time Pilot.
2713191	2717273	I actually played a Time Pilot arcade machine back in the day, and I wasn't half bad at it.
2717313	2722397	And for those who may remember, Nick Arcade Time Pilot was one of the games that they did play on the show.
2722477	2723097	Was it really?
2723277	2723558	Yes.
2723838	2724238	That's awesome.
2724258	2726239	It was one of the games they played frequently on the show.
2727921	2728481	That's great.
2729773	2734055	Sonic the Hedgehog, Shinobi, Phantasy Star, Golden Axe
2756013	2762658	Vector Man, Sword of Vermillion, Comic Zone, Alex Kidd, and Ristar was another one mentioned.
2764399	2766060	But those are all games that I'm all over.
2766300	2767741	Does it sound like something you're going to get?
2768061	2768902	Oh, hell yeah.
2769202	2776367	As long as I have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, I'll be really happy because it's actually... I mean, true, that wasn't necessarily a Genesis game.
2776387	2777888	It was my favorite Master System game.
2778428	2780370	And that started the whole Alex Kidd thing for me.
2781350	2781811	Very cool.
2782811	2785053	Does this collection sound like something you want to pick up, Loki?
2785073	2785153	Yeah.
2786992	2787312	Maybe.
2787612	2788132	Not for me.
2788452	2791993	Because honestly, most of them are already available on GameTap.
2792473	2798734	And I agree that there's a certain charm being able to have this stuff on the go, like on the PSP and stuff.
2799114	2802375	Which seems to me like maybe a response to all the emulation scene.
2802815	2804855	You know, all the emulators have been going on on the PSP.
2804895	2806076	Maybe this is a response to that.
2806316	2810016	I mean, honestly, if I was going to go by that standpoint, there wouldn't be any point.
2810036	2812977	Because almost all of these games I own Genesis cartridges of.
2813948	2814188	True.
2814588	2824194	So, but at the same time, it's convenient to have them on one disc so I can sit down with my controller in front of my TV and play them instead of sit in front of my computer.
2824314	2826995	If I'm going to sit in front of my computer and play a game, I'm going to be on Warcraft.
2830817	2832418	We'll keep it moving here.
2833379	2835180	I want to do a comment here in our chat room.
2835620	2841063	Nintendomaniac64 says, Sega doesn't seem to realize that a lot of the gamers into Sega stuff have GameCubes.
2841523	2842944	So, seeming to think that...
2844595	2846756	Most of the Sega fans were actually into GameCubes.
2848156	2850437	Yeah, possibly, but you know what?
2850557	2855299	The Wii and the Virtual Console thing I think will take care of most of the Sega fan stuff on there.
2855319	2857559	It shouldn't be a problem.
2858220	2861521	Alright, well, I want to go to this story about Japan.
2861681	2862541	Kind of a very...
2863277	2865939	Arcade Longevity Welcome to the arcades of Tokyo.
2865959	2868462	In Asia and particularly Japan, video game rooms not only live but thrive.
2884796	2892723	There are 9,500 arcades in the country with more than 445,000 game machines made by Japanese companies like Namco and Capcom.
2893764	2895705	In the US, of course, the story is much different.
2896066	2901750	Arcades are a rapidly dying breed with only about 3,000 in operation down from 10,000 a decade ago.
2902151	2905994	Though the popularity of home video systems like the PlayStation contributed to the decline,
2906815	2914302	Akagi says that execs at US companies like Midway and Atari simply couldn't see the future in arcades and abandoned the coin-op business.
2914662	2920588	And the article kind of goes on to make the speculation that what happened over in Japan as opposed to here is that here...
2921531	2925676	Most of the kids who used to go to arcades grew up and moved into home console gaming.
2925956	2932182	But in Japan, most of the kids that played arcades have grown up still going to arcades and still in that whole scene.
2933103	2938249	Now I know that Orange Lounge Radio was sort of born of an arcade thing.
2939130	2943034	We all met playing DDR, which was a big arcade phenomenon at the time.
2943373	2946955	I'm curious what you guys think about this story about arcades in Japan versus the U.S.
2947015	2952377	I'm going to guess that the arcades in Japan probably are better maintained than the arcades in the United States.
2953498	2954739	You think so?
2954859	2955339	Why is it?
2955659	2956079	Why is that?
2956980	2965524	Maybe because, I don't know, the American arcades out there, they just pretty much have them just to kind of fill space, it seems like.
2965804	2971387	You know, like at movie theaters, something to kill time for the little kids, you know, get out of mommy and daddy's, you know, hair.
2972556	2977999	or like in, you know, Sunsplash or something, you know, just the kill time while you're waiting for water slides or something like that.
2978079	2979200	Birthday Central.
2979220	2979960	Birthdays, yeah.
2980360	2983442	But they just let the machines go to crap, so.
2983902	2993507	I think there's also this little thing, you know, I think it especially applies to America in general, where they think you hit a certain age, you grow up, you don't do this anymore.
2994548	2998970	In your home, you can play your video game, but you don't go out, you know, as an adult and play DDR or
2999571	3001193	Which, of course, I beg to differ with, of course.
3001253	3005056	But there's still that... It's still sort of taboo, you know.
3005917	3006838	You're supposed to be grown up.
3007919	3011822	That's true, because I noticed even when we were playing DDR, we used to get a lot of funny stares.
3011882	3013564	Like, what are those guys doing?
3013624	3017407	Shouldn't they, you know, be accounting or something?
3018128	3019329	That's so gay!
3019489	3022592	And not in a good way.
3025374	3025975	I hate that.
3027064	3028024	I mean, I really hate that.
3028064	3030985	People who don't know any better, they go, DDR so gay.
3031345	3035167	It's like, so what if it has flashing pink lights and, you know, Madonna music?
3035227	3038808	I mean, it's something everybody can have fun with, right?
3039768	3043469	But it's still, though, I think it's just a whole matter of attitude, you know.
3043709	3049071	There's, you know, 40-year-old businessmen in Japan get off work and go play DDR or poppin' music or something.
3049631	3050291	And they're not gay.
3050751	3050971	No.
3051632	3052412	Well, we don't know that.
3052432	3053032	Well, they might be.
3053092	3053612	Some might be.
3053632	3054593	It doesn't matter.
3054633	3055133	It doesn't matter.
3055173	3055693	So what if they're gay?
3056846	3057746	Megzi, you have a thought on this?
3058007	3058187	What?
3058527	3059287	Do you have a thought on this?
3059787	3063009	Sorry, I see you with the mic, so I thought... Are you an arcade gamer?
3063389	3064390	Um, somewhat.
3065390	3067551	If there is an arcade, I will play in it.
3068812	3070052	Have you ever been to an arcade in Japan?
3070372	3070813	Yes, I have.
3071033	3072774	Ooh, what was it like when you were there?
3073614	3079177	Well, I was only there for a little bit because our train was leaving, but it was very well kept, from what I remember.
3079337	3080117	Maybe that's the difference.
3080697	3083579	The difference is, in Japan, they play Beatmania.
3083879	3086040	In the United States, they beat their spouse.
3090322	3090762	Wow.
3091303	3092984	Your logic is infallible.
3093264	3093864	Exactly.
3094325	3095005	I'm awesome.
3095145	3096266	That's all we need to know.
3096546	3098127	By infallible, I mean not really.
3099848	3111176	Speaking of couples not getting along here, one couple, the E3 little guys and the ESA, you know those wonderful Kensha Hall exhibitors?
3111536	3114978	They're not really getting along too well with the ESA.
3115278	3118921	And actually, the ESA sent out some letters to these
3119865	3125030	Small Kitchen Hall people kind of informing them of what's going on with E3 next year.
3125630	3141484	And basically they said, as you may have read in the press releases, the E3 Expo has officially been cancelled and it's involving and matured over the last 12 years and now the needs of the exhibitors and the key attendees has also changed.
3142228	3148950	And, you know, it should also say in, like, fine print, by the way, you're not a key attendee because you do not have, you know, booth in the bigger hall.
3149090	3150131	So, fuck you.
3151071	3154392	So the ESA essentially wrote these people a letter that says, K, thanks, bye.
3154692	3159394	It's basically, it's basically like this.
3159454	3164356	It's like, dear people from Kenja Hall, it's not you, it's us.
3164936	3167617	You know, we want to see other people.
3168357	3168437	Um...
3170240	3171601	Maybe we could be friends.
3175726	3179650	Some days, Kensha Hall, I just want to cuddle.
3180551	3182173	But you guys are so demanding.
3184515	3190401	You have to understand that my life is moving on and I need to move on too.
3190542	3191763	We just need some distance.
3193857	3200459	We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere, profound gratitude for your past support of this event.
3200779	3208781	It has been exciting and rewarding to see the growth and significance of this industry mirrored on the exhibit floor of the E3 Expo through the years.
3208881	3213143	We look forward to many years of industry growth and viability and opportunity without you.
3213403	3215783	That's basically added there on the end there.
3217444	3217944	Not really.
3219464	3220565	Not really, but that'd be funny.
3221539	3226803	And Jamie, though, Red Octane, I mean, with all due respect to Red Octane and the Guitar Heroes, it's a fluke.
3227163	3229485	Nobody expected Guitar Hero to do as well as it did.
3229625	3233107	Them being there, you know, it was a fluke.
3233127	3234448	Actually, I expected it to do well.
3234588	3238411	Well, but I'm talking about, you know, we're different because we've always loved music.
3238431	3239212	You know, we're different.
3239252	3239832	We're special.
3240233	3242574	But I'm talking about like the mainstream folks.
3242854	3249980	You know, nobody would have thought Guitar Hero would have done as well as it really did until people actually played it and found out, wow, it's actually kind of fun.
3250000	3250080	Yeah.
3251234	3252536	I think the whole Red Octane is a fluke.
3252776	3257199	And I think had there been an E3 next year, Red Octane would have graduated to the big hall.
3257660	3260843	You get to go to the big boy chair, Red Octane!
3260903	3261503	I had to laugh.
3261963	3265326	I went to Fry's this week, an electronic store that we have over here.
3265346	3266828	It's this giant.
3267388	3272212	And I was watching this woman watch her son play Guitar Hero, and she kept yelling at him.
3272733	3276636	It's almost like watching someone play DDR instead of saying, Left!
3276796	3277076	Left!
3277236	3277557	Right!
3277717	3277917	Left!
3277937	3278017	Left!
3278577	3279038	Green!
3279118	3279618	Green!
3279718	3280199	Green!
3280319	3280759	Red!
3281360	3282921	It's not helping.
3283582	3283922	Wow.
3284243	3285404	I can see that it's green.
3286705	3300638	Well, the ESA has some good news coming their way, and it has to do with the state of Illinois is being told to pay the ESA a half a million dollars for messing up.
3301298	3301759	Big time.
3303401	3318691	Basically, what happened is that, let's see, it's not just half a million, it's $510,528.64, and the reason why they have to do it is because they did an unconstitutional effort to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games.
3320432	3324155	And essentially, you know, legal fees, blah, blah, blah, it adds up.
3325809	3327411	Let's see.
3327791	3338640	Quote, if controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in promoting the positive psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly accorded to parents and families, not the state.
3339300	3342503	That coming from Judge Matthew F. Kennelly.
3342963	3343744	Good for him.
3343884	3345666	And hopefully this will set a precedence.
3345946	3350650	We've had these, what is it, in Minnesota and these other states trying to pass the same thing?
3351992	3352573	In Wisconsin?
3353033	3353754	Okay.
3353834	3360219	Yeah, this needs to really be a shining example to them of what's going to happen when they try to violate our rights.
3360680	3362301	And, of course, the ESA had a field day.
3362601	3366184	Quote, Judge Kenley's ruling sent two irrefutable messages.
3366264	3372110	Not only are efforts to ban the sale of violent video games clearly unconstitutional, they are a waste of taxpayer dollars.
3372290	3372690	Excellent.
3372710	3375813	So the taxpayers not only get to pay for them to... Yep.
3375913	3379516	The sad fact is that the state of Illinois's new... Illinois, sorry...
3379876	3382499	knew this law was unconstitutional from the beginning.
3382599	3389166	Taxpayers have a right to know that over half a million of their dollars in countless government hours were thrown away in this fruitless effort.
3389446	3397614	Probably more than half a million dollars because, you know, to actually propose this bill and stuff, you know, all those luncheons that they have to hold in order to pass this stuff.
3399284	3400745	And the lobbyists, of course.
3402006	3406168	Megzy, Macman in our chat room is also from Wisconsin and says, Wisconsin sucks.
3406229	3406729	I live there.
3406849	3408530	Do you agree, Megzy?
3408610	3409471	I see you're nodding your head.
3409491	3410511	Do you agree Wisconsin sucks?
3410551	3411512	Yeah, it does.
3411612	3412433	Not a place for gamers?
3412613	3413153	No, no.
3413293	3417176	Unless you're in Madison, then come visit my GameStop.
3417536	3417996	There you go.
3418336	3418897	I work there.
3420098	3422119	Do you get hit on by boys at the GameStop?
3422179	3422359	Yes.
3422479	3423920	Do you get hit on by girls at the GameStop?
3424120	3424280	No.
3425101	3425381	Okay.
3425981	3426922	So if we have any, you know,
3427386	3429207	Girls Who Like Girls, and Madison.
3429267	3431007	Maybe they need to be... Oh, wait, no, she's taken.
3431027	3432288	You better not... Mine!
3435809	3437090	Chris will come out there and cut you off.
3438731	3441112	And I don't mean your hair.
3442592	3447014	Anyway, when taxpayer dollars are wasted, we get angsty, don't we, DarkSakura?
3447234	3447934	Oh, hell yes.
3447994	3449515	And what happens when we get angsty?
3450875	3451876	People die!
3460552	3462993	So let's bring on the FUs of the week, DarkSakura.
3463213	3465093	My FU of the week goes toward the sun.
3466114	3468895	The bright shining orb in the sky.
3470095	3475076	For leeching all of my energy, burning my chest, my poor boots are burnt.
3476417	3479138	And making me really sleepy to where I almost fell asleep on the road five times.
3480738	3481758	Fuck you, sun!
3483059	3483339	Loki.
3484644	3485124	My F.U.
3485164	3490666	goes to people that are extremely rude when it comes to parking their cars or not being able to park in their spaces.
3491066	3499389	We had this guy today when I was going to get my smoothie and... Why is that funny?
3500550	3502530	Because I can't have a fruit smoothie?
3503391	3504171	Shall I explain?
3504811	3507732	Smoothie amongst us is a euphemism for lesbian sex.
3512694	3514034	It's a big cup of smoothie then.
3515295	3518135	Suddenly I want nothing but Frappuccinos for the rest of my life.
3521176	3522336	What's a Frappuccino mean?
3522476	3523697	Now it's gay sex.
3524577	3525257	Oh, okay.
3525277	3526617	Well, I'll take plenty of Frappuccino.
3526657	3527298	Thank you.
3527418	3528958	Actually, it's been a while since I've had a Frappuccino.
3529278	3530018	Oh, Loki, sorry.
3530638	3533779	Anyways, so there's some jackass that was sitting there.
3534079	3540101	His car had both of the doors open, wide open, and the guy was nowhere to be seen in his car.
3540521	3541441	He was just sitting down...
3542256	3545599	Enjoying, you know, a coffee or something in front of the Starbucks that happens to be next door.
3546499	3552844	But, I don't know, it's just really fucking rude when people, you know, park their cars, especially with the doors open, or especially over the line.
3552864	3558628	You know, you get those wonderful SUVs, they're like, my car's too big for one space, so I'm gonna park in two compact spaces.
3559889	3564433	But your car's not compact, so you shouldn't be parking in one compact space, let alone both of them.
3566254	3566834	Um, is that it?
3567115	3567435	That's it.
3567755	3571518	My FU of the week would have to go towards Sangria,
3572301	3581203	for having some type of unexplainable control over me because I drank a lot of it on Thursday and I drank a lot of it on Friday.
3581643	3585984	And I'm typically not a lush, but Sangria makes me want to be because it's really yummy.
3586504	3589225	But if you're under 21, you shouldn't drink Sangria.
3589785	3590665	It's not good.
3591765	3593446	Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to get out?
3593586	3594446	I do, actually.
3594466	3595946	I think it's on.
3596827	3597127	Is it on?
3597227	3597367	Yeah.
3597447	3597667	Okay.
3599396	3604580	My FU goes to homeless people in San Francisco, and I don't mean all of them.
3605481	3612587	We went to the Castro District today, which, for those of you who do not know, is the gay and lesbian district of San Francisco.
3613548	3624357	And we were walking by, and there's a homeless guy just relaxing on the side of the street where everybody and their mother were walking, and his penis was just hanging right out.
3625915	3626956	Give me a dollar!
3627376	3630038	He was just laying there, just hanging out.
3630058	3631359	It wasn't even impressive either.
3631379	3632040	No, it wasn't.
3632440	3635002	I mean, there's a store right next to us with a big dong.
3636303	3639605	Wait, so he's just lying on, I assume this is Market Street?
3639705	3640446	Or what is this?
3640786	3641226	Oh, Castro.
3641506	3647671	So he's just, well, I mean, okay, having someone's cock hanging out in the middle of Castro Street is not that uncommon, I hate to tell you.
3647891	3648872	But it wasn't impressive.
3649372	3650673	Okay, I see.
3650993	3653575	I want an impressive cock when I go down Castro Street.
3653595	3653875	Okay.
3657168	3659690	Alright, uh, Megsy, do you have any interviews of the week you'd like to get out?
3659810	3660250	Yes, I do.
3660270	3667816	Uh, I've got one, uh, me and Chris went up to, uh, Santa Cruz and went to... Oh, yeah.
3668637	3674361	And went to the boardwalk, uh, and we were sitting on the beach, um, drawing stick figure porn in the sand.
3675102	3681367	And, um, we looked over and we were commenting on how there are some people who should just not wear bathing suits.
3682348	3684009	Um, mostly old guys...
3685316	3686777	Oh, wearing, like, the Speedo suits?
3686837	3687558	It gets better, hold on.
3687638	3688559	Uh-oh.
3688599	3691582	So just as we were saying that, we look over, and there's this old guy.
3691802	3696146	He's, like, he's gotta be, like, late 40s, early 50s.
3697507	3698608	He's dark tan.
3699489	3704873	He's dark tan, balding, all hairy, he's all hairy.
3705073	3706815	He's got, like, the bling bling.
3708797	3712380	And so he's got this towel around him, and I'm just like, oh my god, there's one of them.
3713007	3717129	and when he takes the towel off, he has a bright red Speedo.
3719130	3720450	With the Brazilian wax.
3723111	3725592	We were looking and trying to determine if he was waxed or not.
3725632	3729154	We couldn't see, we were kind of far away, but I think he was.
3730815	3731155	Wow.
3731775	3732695	And it gets better.
3732735	3732896	Wait.
3734358	3734618	One more.
3735779	3745465	Then, not only did this guy have the audacity to go out of the house, but also wear a bright red Speedo on the beach, his girlfriend or his wife or something started taking pictures of him.
3746065	3747666	And he started posing for these pictures.
3749888	3751009	And adjusting himself.
3752009	3753530	And I am not making this up.
3753830	3755491	I am not exaggerating at all.
3755571	3756192	We have pictures.
3756212	3757393	It's called Pokemon Snap.
3760655	3760915	Wow.
3763891	3766792	You know, in other countries, it's okay to wear a Speedo on the beach.
3766852	3768833	And a lot of times, the people wearing them are pretty hot.
3768933	3770833	Like, you know, I've seen pictures on the internet, you know.
3771213	3772114	This guy was not hot.
3772394	3773494	I know.
3773534	3774114	He thought he was.
3774394	3774674	I see.
3775034	3775775	That was the sad part.
3775955	3776615	That's unfortunate.
3776935	3777895	Do you want to tell about the other one?
3778656	3778856	No.
3779036	3783137	No, we better get back into games or we're going to get those angry emails, you know, and those reviews.
3784611	3785972	Orange Lounge Radio.
3786012	3787493	They never talk about games.
3787513	3789254	They talk about guys in Speedos.
3790415	3791196	I hate Orange Lounge.
3791256	3793177	I hate you, DarkSakura.
3793197	3793918	You're so mean.
3794338	3794839	You know what?
3795219	3796180	Fuck a whole bunch of them.
3796860	3797721	And not in a good way.
3797801	3798842	I mean like with a pogo stick.
3799042	3800823	No frappuccinos or smoothies for them?
3800843	3803205	No frappuccinos, no smoothies.
3803285	3805947	I've decided the euphemism for straight sex is potato.
3806688	3806868	Let's
3807694	3808655	Let's go back into game news, please.
3808675	3809755	There was one, but I can't remember what it was.
3809775	3809995	Never mind.
3810015	3810496	It's Potato.
3811576	3812477	It's Potato.
3812557	3813137	Okay, Potato.
3813578	3813918	Okay.
3815679	3818580	All right, so we do have some stuff from Namco.
3819421	3821942	Namco Bondi sent out their release list.
3822663	3824684	So here's a few things coming up.
3825605	3828666	On PlayStation 2, we have Pac-Man World Rally on August 22nd.
3829027	3829287	What?
3830848	3832409	Rob's giggling like a little girl.
3833269	3833649	Sorry.
3834490	3836011	Pooeater sent me this in chat.
3836051	3836091	Ah!
3838248	3841470	And it's guys in red Speedos and Santa hats.
3842130	3842691	But they're cute.
3842711	3843791	Yeah, they're actually pretty cute.
3843811	3844952	They are kind of cute.
3844992	3845712	Thank you, Pooh Eater.
3845813	3846513	I appreciate it.
3846533	3848854	See, I appreciate the sacrifices listeners will make for me.
3849335	3849915	My amusement.

3855178	3855698	Oh, I will.
3856959	3857740	You're a lesbian!
3858400	3858720	I know.
3859220	3859801	That's all right.
3860021	3863683	I was watching a lesbian episode of Next today, and it was pretty hot.
3863763	3865624	Like, the two lesbians that got together in there, they were hot.
3865664	3866385	Like, they were just, you know...
3867506	3869907	Femi, LittleCharlie'sAngelsWannabe, it was pretty hot.
3869927	3872248	That's not real lesbian porn then.
3872488	3873108	Yeah, whatever, anyway.

3931437	3932777	I'm not being shy about it.
3933578	3936178	I gave them the whole disappointment that Sonic Adventure was.
3936198	3936959	Alright.
3937139	3938219	Rack server my ass.

3963391	3963972	Okay.
3964716	3968599	I like, in our chat room, I agree with this comment by Blackboy.
3968919	3970040	.hack, Volume 1, yay.
3970440	3972381	I played a little bit of that at E3.
3972401	3972802	It was fun.
3972842	3973862	I like the old .hack games.
3973882	3974263	They're fun.
3975183	3975644	Good times.
3975664	3977085	I like the cartoon.
3977685	3978366	Anime, excuse me.
3979066	3979426	It's fun.
3979907	3981548	I haven't seen a whole lot of it, but it's fun.
3982909	3989794	Have I ever had the chat about, you know, I don't really watch anime, even though I know a lot of our fans are really into it because of the DDR connection and what have you.
3989814	3990954	I'm not really that into it.
3991114	3991555	It's okay.
3992275	3993296	But I'm just, I don't know.
3993772	4000394	I go to an anime convention and I go, these people look like they're having fun, which is cool and all, but I just, I don't, I don't get it.
4000594	4001034	Cosplay.
4001254	4001514	Oh well.
4002274	4003615	Cosplay's cute, I guess.
4003975	4005595	Sometimes, but sometimes it's also very ugly.
4006635	4007536	Do you, what do you cosplay as?
4008536	4010556	Wait, Macy, Macy's telling us about her cosplay.
4011036	4011977	Um, let's see.
4012417	4014757	I cosplayed as Bell Dandy from Oh My Goddess.
4015978	4020559	I cosplayed, I did like a girl version of Vash the Stampede from Trigun.
4023488	4024709	Let's see, what else did I do?
4025129	4026029	Have you ever done Lulu?
4026049	4029971	Because lesbian Lulus are awesome from Final Fantasy X. You know, I was going to do a Lulu.
4029991	4030951	Ooh, that's hot.
4033512	4034853	I might turn for that, we'll see.
4035613	4038294	Alright, anyway, let's keep it moving.
4040235	4049659	Anywho, Sony's actually unveiled a brand new portable media player, as if they need another one, called the Milo.
4050726	4073039	Not Milo and Otis, but Milo, M-Y-L-O And basically, it stands for My Life Online And it's going to be also able to use Skype, Google, and Yahoo Chats So that's kind of neat It's scheduled to release in September And it's supposed to retail for about $350 It has a 940 megabytes of RAM
4079366	4080246	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4111969	4112409	Okay.
4113970	4117210	Well, you know, more bad news for Sony, honestly.
4117250	4120271	There's this blogger, and you probably have seen this around the internet.
4120311	4124072	It's gotten dug in a lot of places, just for the sheer irony of it.
4124972	4127793	It's this editor for the official PlayStation magazine.
4127873	4140116	Her name is Dana J., and she wrote this thing on her 1UP blog about how she plans on buying an Xbox 360 this November, even though she works for the official PlayStation magazine.
4140976	4146623	Basically saying that when they announced that the price would be $600, she found her enthusiasm sagging.
4147143	4147744	Here's a quote.
4178487	4184412	and most of the big guns, Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, won't be hitting for quite some time after the launch.
4185493	4187034	That's kind of a big ouch.
4187114	4189456	But people seem to love that story because of the irony.
4189636	4192138	I don't know what it is, but whatever.
4192999	4193659	What do you guys think?
4193940	4197883	Is that just more pouring salt in the wounds of Sony, or what?
4198083	4198643	They deserve them.
4199564	4201245	You're really against PS3?
4202026	4203087	Um, yeah.
4203487	4203647	Why?
4204168	4204248	Um...
4204827	4211512	Well, I have my theories about PS3, but it doesn't seem like it's worth the $600 price tag at all.
4213493	4215454	And plus, I kind of have a little vendetta against Sony.
4215915	4217055	Ooh, I want to hear about this.
4217115	4218156	What's the vendetta against Sony?
4221118	4227162	Well, okay, I'll tell you the truth, is that I get a lot of stupid Sony fanboys in my store.
4227923	4229264	I want to hear about Sony fanboys.
4229284	4229684	No, you don't.
4230723	4231263	What do they do?
4232003	4232643	What makes them stupid?
4232944	4246347	Because they'll say stuff, they'll come in and tell me how great PS3 is going to be, and I'll say, well, I'm not really looking forward to it, there's nothing I really like on it.
4246367	4251288	And they'll try to convince me why I should get a PS3, and I'm looking at this guy saying, dude, I work in the...
4252106	4254008	I think I know what I want.
4254028	4258110	Well, I'm wearing probably this Mario shirt, you know, saying I want to get a Wii, not a PS3.
4258551	4259732	I mean, I like my PS2.
4260032	4264315	It's got cool RPGs on it, but for the most part, I don't like Sony.
4266957	4272000	After having played PS3 games, you are 100% correct.
4272341	4272821	They are crap.
4273320	4276461	It's hard, because you make a good point at the end.
4276701	4277922	You love the PlayStation 2.
4278422	4279382	And I love the PlayStation 2.
4279522	4280703	I think we all love the PlayStation 2.
4280903	4286345	And I think that's why we all look at the PlayStation 3 and go, just keep putting out PS2 games, honestly.
4286385	4288085	If that's where you're going to go, just don't even bother.
4288125	4293027	What they need to understand is, look at all these other console wars that have been going on.
4293327	4296028	The Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.
4297549	4299610	The Xbox and PlayStation 2.
4301861	4306465	Have you noticed a big, giant difference between the games that come out on both platforms?
4306946	4309949	I mean, they look almost the same.
4310449	4313612	I mean, they're very much the same.
4313692	4327105	I mean, so, what makes you think that they're going to all of a sudden, you know, hey, let's develop a game for the 360, and let's just spend some extra time on making a completely different game, but it's actually the same game for the PlayStation 3 with better graphics, but...
4327952	4328252	You know what?
4328272	4331114	They're not going to spend the money to develop those games.
4331474	4332115	Because you know what?
4332135	4335276	They can port the same game over and it'll be just fine on both systems.
4335357	4337438	Let me go over to the chat room real quick for some comments.
4337498	4339119	OrangeLawnRadio.com, click on chat.
4340340	4344042	FireResurrected of the OL Army would like to say, Amen, lesbian co-host person.
4346423	4346763	Let's see.
4347504	4351406	Macman says, But the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray, it is God in writable media.
4352367	4352787	Interesting.
4352927	4355569	If by God they mean, you know, God of BCs.
4356840	4359703	Blackboy says the $500 PS3 isn't really so lame.
4360564	4361064	Yes, it is.
4362406	4364028	People are allowed to have difference of opinion.
4364608	4370855	Fireboma says, damn, I wish I could resist the PS3, but I'm just going to shell out $600 plus for it anyway.
4373183	4374383	I am a consumer whore.
4391863	4400210	I mean, and to be honest, all the other games that are out there, like even FlatOut 2, or not FlatOut 2, Full Auto 2 was the one for me.
4400230	4401531	I was like, ooh, that looks really good.
4401871	4404754	But it's coming out on the 360 later on, and so it's not a big deal.
4405555	4414842	What I think is going to be really interesting is seeing what their marketing campaign is going to be for this, and seeing how they're going to try to convince people to spend the $600 for it.
4415763	4418105	I don't think you're going to see that, because those 1080p TVs out there,
4420874	4422475	I know because I'm pricing them right now.
4422655	4424056	They're like three grand.
4425076	4429678	Now, I'm sure there's going to be some angry Sony fanboys out there that want to write angry emails.
4429778	4431379	Orange Lounge Radio, I hate you.
4431459	4432459	Loki, you're a dick.
4433640	4434720	We welcome those emails.
4434780	4438482	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and maybe we'll read some on next week.
4439082	4442004	Why are you letting that lesbian speak on your show about PlayStation?
4442044	4443284	She doesn't know what she's talking about.
4444285	4445465	Go back to munching carpet.
4445485	4445805	Alright, so...
4448459	4456943	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com So, no, if you have an intelligent rebuttal, we would happily read your emails on air.
4457403	4459564	But if you write something stupid, we're just going to forward it to Megzi.
4459584	4460144	And you know what?
4461645	4464226	I really want to see the PS3 do well.
4464466	4468948	I wanted to see them launch it with a new, like, Twisted Metal game.
4469128	4469969	That would have been awesome.
4469989	4477792	That would have sold the system for me, but, you know, to be honest, right now they seem to be a step behind everybody, and the fact that they haven't released any details about
4478635	4480796	What exactly their online service is going to be.
4481076	4484538	Because I think, to be honest, they don't know what it's going to be like right now.
4484698	4486699	I don't even think they have that stuff finalized yet.
4487139	4495003	So until I hear some more details about how wonderful this system is, based on specs and price alone, I'm not going to be buying it at launch.
4496264	4496784	All right.
4498025	4501627	Well, let's change the tune to something happier.
4502047	4503228	DarkSakura, don't you agree?
4503748	4503908	Yes.
4504207	4511812	and DarkSakura always likes to make us happy by surfing the internet and telling us about her happy place on the internet this week and sharing it with the internet.
4512192	4514934	So DarkSakura, what is your happy website of the week?
4516975	4520197	My webpage of the week is MrPinball.
4521398	4526001	It's www.xmission.com slash tilde d-a-i-n-a
4526806	4533429	slash pinball.html And basically, Mr. Pinball is a site they restore, buy, sell, trade, repair pinball machines.
4533469	4537311	They have classified ads, pricing guides, t-shirts, hats, mugs, and more!
4537811	4541713	Repair tips of the day, pinball collector registry, pinball machine photos.
4542293	4549336	It's probably one of the oldest pinball sites on the internet as far as information tips, that type of thing.
4549416	4550517	So, go check it out.
4551477	4551817	Alright.
4553138	4554859	Awesome.
4554959	4555319	Anyways...
4562643	4563023	Oh, hi.
4563744	4564384	My turn, huh?
4564444	4564784	My bad.
4566145	4567646	Moving on, I have one more.
4568347	4569207	Well, you started talking.
4569227	4570428	I thought you had the next story.
4570508	4574190	And Loki's sitting there going, I can make up a story.
4574230	4578293	He's saying that I was awesome and that my taste in websites is, yeah.
4578353	4581554	Oh, I thought, weren't we going to do Orange Lounge Lying Radio or something one week?
4581575	4583035	Because everybody calls us liars anyway.
4583236	4586738	Would you like to come up with the Orange Lounge Radio Fib Game News of the Week?
4587058	4588499	The Fib Game News of the Week?
4588579	4588799	Yes.
4589401	4590361	PlayStation 3 being good?
4590581	4591602	Oh, Megzy has one.
4591742	4594983	Okay, here's our not-true Orange Lounge Radio news story of the week.
4595263	4599284	Sony has just announced that the PS3 will also include a George Foreman grill.
4602205	4608307	The PlayStation 3 has already sold over 50 million units before its launch, making it the fastest system to ever reach that number.
4608327	4608947	Amazing.
4609307	4610948	You heard it here first on Orange Lounge Radio.
4610988	4612048	I just bought mine off eBay.
4612188	4614029	It'll also do your laundry and your homework.
4616178	4619379	and it'll suck your lollipop clean.
4619579	4624882	The ones you buy at Disneyland, the happiest place on earth because pure people like to go to Disneyland.
4626582	4628943	Moving on, here's a true article.
4629163	4629904	Wait, I got one more.
4630084	4630264	What?
4630364	4630864	Okay, yeah.
4632225	4632525	Okay.
4633545	4642389	Landfill in San Francisco this week actually started rumbling from all the dual shocks that have been buried in there causing an earthquake, you know.
4642950	4645853	Which is ironic because, you know, San Francisco gets a lot of earthquakes, so.
4648735	4649036	Wow.
4651878	4652379	Moving on.
4653119	4656242	This story's true, even though some people think it's a lie.
4656703	4660086	It really is true, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, the Burning Crusade.
4660546	4664590	Lots of people get their characters to 60, and then it's all about the endgame.
4664610	4665711	Endgame, endinggame, endgame.
4665951	4666572	Well, guess what?
4667597	4670139	Endgames have typically been 40-man raids.
4670319	4673081	Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, so on and so on.
4673201	4679827	And that's not going to change, but what's going to happen is that the new endgames in the Burning Crusade, they're going to be capped at 25 people.
4680327	4689194	So folks are going to have to get used to all new party setups and all new strategies for endgame battle because you're going to be reduced in the amount of people you can take on those raids.
4689534	4693077	So no more taking along Leroy Jenkins just for comic value anymore.
4693117	4700958	You're going to have to take along folks who definitely know what they're doing and won't run into battle before you're all ready.
4703089	4705771	But the chicken will still be good, FYI.
4706272	4709314	Anyway, that's going to do it for the end of this segment of Orange Lounge Radio.
4709674	4713477	Here on the live show, we're going to take a break, and that means our podcast is going to get split at this point.
4713777	4719021	But be sure to tune in later this week for Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.
4719382	4720763	And we'll be back right after this.
4721303	4726267	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4726727	4731031	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
