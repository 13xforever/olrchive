Tonight, August 20th, 2006.
Is 1080p really the future?
Microsoft fakes to differ.
What do Wii preview parties have in common with raves?
Whatever happened to the Phantom anyway?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Really?
Oh, that's right, you built, now long time listeners of Orange Lounge Radio remember back in the day you built your own cabinet to play, like what, a main cabinet basically, right?
Basically, yeah.
And why did you destroy it?
It's too big.
Too big?
Need the room for the 37 inch LCD TV.
So about how much money would you say ended up getting burned?
Only a couple hundred, most of it was in the buttons.
I see.
Alright, well also joining us tonight, say hello to an old friend of our show, say hello to Miklatov.
Hi.
How you doing, Miklatov?
Oh, I'm good.
Good.
Miklatov happens to work for Konami, but he's not here as an employee of Konami.
He's here as a gamer.
I don't play video games.
Which is kind of the issue.
I just saw you playing one like two minutes ago.
But that doesn't count.
I see.
I have to say that because we actually have Konami-related news tonight that's pretty big, so I have to remember to distinguish that.
I know, but I know everything about Konami, so... Oh, really?
Yes.
You can't share any of it on here?
I'm just kidding.
No.
I'm teasing.
I know.
Alright, also say hello to an old favorite of our program.
Say hello to Drew Nami.
Hey, what's up?
Not a whole lot.
How are you doing?
Uh, fair good.
Hey.
Give me a mic, dammit.
Give me that mic.
Sheesh.
Alright.
A little mic confusion.
There we go.
Alright.
How are you doing?
Uh, fair.
A little bit of gaming to speak of, but I think we'll save that to gaming weeks.
Alright, well let's get to it.
Let's start with Loki.
How was your gaming week?
My week was good.
I played Dead Rising, which is still fun, but it gets progressively harder later in the game.
Then, what else did I play?
I just got done playing the Bad Day LA demo on PC.
That's really cool looking, except I don't like the fact that I have to save a lot of people.
I'm not a fan of saving people.
I'm more a fan of beating them to death.
That's going to take a little bit of getting used to, but I am looking forward to the game.
It's supposed to be coming, I guess, later this week or next week or something.
I don't know.
So, should be cool.
That's also part of my problem with Dead Rising, really, is that I don't like saving people, I like to kill them in game.
Well, they're fucking stupid, okay?
They are fucking stupid in Dead Rising.
I tried saving these people, they were trapped in a store, and they wanted, like, to get to safety, so I'm like, you know, follow me, and they're sitting there, like, beating up a zombie, then all of a sudden, like, five zombies jump on them and eat them.
I'm like, you're a dumb idiot.
Well, fucking listen to me, or die.
Apparently, you chose death, so...
Fuck you!
So the next time I ran past that section when I reloaded the game again, I said, Fuck them!
They can die!
And that's what they did.
Or of course, I'll come by and break down the door so the zombies have an easier chance of getting them.
Alright, anything else that you played?
I want to say I played Chromehounds, but I don't think I did.
Okay.
I'll talk about my gaming week.
I played Dead Rising a little more because, you know, killing zombies is a lot of fun.
I got a little bit further.
I finally figured out the secret to kill that very first boss that kept slicing me.
Or actually, I should say shooting me because he has a gun.
And I sliced him because Loki showed me where to find the katana.
So that made me very happy because it made fighting that first boss a hell of a lot easier.
So now I'm having more fun just running around doing random things.
The game reminds me of Golden Axe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thank you for watching!
Fireboma says Sky Kingdom Hearts 2 was a button masher too, but it had a story.
Yeah, 99 Nights has a story too, though.
I mean, granted, Kingdom Hearts 2 has a really great in-depth story, and 99 Nights is a little bit, you know, kind of generic.
But it looks really pretty, and the story's not bad.
I can think of games that had worse stories.
So, I mean, I would call 99 Nights a slightly above average game.
And the only kind of genre, well, I guess there's Dynasty Warriors, but considering that's just like a straight-up port,
I'd say it's really the only kind of game of its genre really, truly available for next-gen right now.
And I think it's worth a look.
I think there's an audience of people that this game is really for.
An audience of people.
What?
An audience of people, not a audience of people.
Whatever.
Thank you, Grammar Miklatov, Professor Guy.
You're welcome.
Well, then how was your gaming week, so I can criticize the way you talk about it?
Um, well, I've been playing a couple things I'm not allowed to talk about, and one's really frustrating and I hate it.
But other than that, the only game I really play at all anymore is Suikoden II, and I play it at work on my breaks.
And I leave it on, so I've amassed about 700 hours on the game now.
So...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and that's all I play.
Now do you watch me play some of those games on 360 like Prey and Dead Rising?
What do you think of some of those ones you've been watching?
Prey's pretty cool.
It's kind of creepy.
I think I could enjoy it on a computer because I don't like using console controllers for FPSs.
99 Nights I was really excited about and then I saw it and I was really disappointed because it looks like a really bland Samurai Warriors or Dynasty Warriors game
and... That's pretty bad seeing as Dynasty Warriors is pretty bland as it is.
I like Dynasty Warriors.
I like 99 Nights and then I look at Dynasty Warriors and I go, I like 99 Nights.
The environments in 99 Nights just are so bland and you're always fighting the same enemy and you can't even tell half the time if...
There's still an enemy on screen because your stupid comrades are all grouped around it.
It's like a hundred of your friends around one enemy, so you have to wade your way through them just to find it.
You magically swing your sword and it only hits the bad guys.
I'll forgive that, though.
Again, look at games like Golden Axe, Ninja Turtles.
You never hit your friends magically.
That's what this game is to me.
It's a souped-up, old-school beat-em-up.
There were games where you could hit your friends.
There were, like Double Dragon, right?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you could do that in one of the Double Dragon games.
Double Dragon was fun to throw people in the pits.
That's what we need.
We need a Simpsons next-gen arcade game that looks like 99 Nights, but it's the Simpsons.
That would be pretty awesome.
That would be...score.
Maybe that'll be on Wii's virtual console.
You know what would be awesome?
Cardboard Tube Samurai done 99 Nights style.
That would be fucking sweet.
I guess the other game you had was Dead Rising, and zombie games actually frightened me, but it was funny at times, but I don't think I could bring myself to play it.
Did you like the part where I wore the little kid's outfit and the big teddy bear mask?
If you mean creeped out by it, then yes.
I liked it a whole lot.
My favorite was going to the women's store and getting the dress with the big bright pink flowers on it and then putting on sunglasses.
That was awesome.
That was pretty funny.
Or when you changed your hair gray in the cosmetic store.
But the greatest is that whatever costume you're wearing carries on into the cut scenes.
So it's really funny to be wearing the flowery dress in the cut scenes where he's trying to act all badass.
Yeah, when he was leaning up against the wall like he was some sort of prostitute.
That was pretty awesome.
And that part had no zombies, so I was okay with it.
Alright.
Are you afraid of zombies?
Yes, I am.
You need someone to hold your hand when you play zombie games?
I can't think of someone who works at Taco Bell.
Alright, anyway, moving on.
Going over to Drew Nami.
Drew, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
Oh, I haven't exactly been on the cutting edge lately.
I've been playing... I finished Fable as a little goody two-shoes, now I'm replaying it...
as some big, badass, evil, bisexual, screwing around, fucking around, whatever.
Which was the best part of Fable, really?
Otherwise, it was just pretty much your standard, you know.
Uh, I'd have to say the different kind of weapons that you can use, uh, and different kind of, uh, I don't know, relationship you can have with, uh, the townsfolk, which, admittedly, is not much, but, uh, it's still kind of cool.
Uh,
I've been brushing on my beat mania lately.
I haven't been doing too much of that.
I actually took the time to put my scores in on rankings.
Again, not very impressive.
Playing a little bit more Atelier Iris.
Almost beat it.
Been going back to Prey.
Finally beat it.
Ending was very cool.
You know what?
All things considered, though, Prey doesn't take that long to beat.
It's a pretty short game.
I mean, if I was a little more hardcore about it and could play games for a long time in one setting, I could have beat it in a day.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty easy too, you can't die.
Yeah, you don't ever really die.
And for some reason I picked up Mega Man X Command Mission after like two months of not playing it, and I've just been blowing through it just like five hours straight.
No reason at all.
Alright.
But it's a fairly good RPG.
Okay.
Okay.
Alright, well, that's it for everybody's gaming week, and I noticed some folks in chat are kind of talking a little bit about their gaming weeks there.
But we don't care about them.
No, I'm curious what folks are there playing.
DJ Dark Knight is playing SOCOM 3, I think.
See?
Don't care.
Well, we don't have time to play everything.
We're just, what, four people?
There's too many games.
How many new games do they release every week?
But how many of them are worth playing?
That's true.
There's like maybe one a month.
But everybody's into something different, right?
You know, if I didn't have a job, I'd be playing tons of games.
I wouldn't.
I hate video games.
Isn't that what you do all day now?
For now.
All right, anyway.
Let's go to some housekeeping stuff really quick.
We wanted to mention the Chromehounds tourney.
Remember how we were going back and forth with Bobby Blackwolf about we're going to kick your ass, you're going to kick our ass, or whatever?
We couldn't get enough people to participate in the Chromehounds thing.
I don't know if folks just, like, our listener base isn't really into this game or what, but we couldn't get enough people.
And I guess, I don't know, I wasn't really following, but I guess maybe there was shenanigans going on somewhere else in the tournament, so...
It got cancelled, so it never really happened.
So we never got to put OL Army versus Bobby to the test.
So maybe another time, I think what we'll do right now, focus on building up the presence of Orange Lounge Radio listeners in different games on the OL Army, and then we'll take people on in tournaments.
Personally, I would like to see something more along the lines of, say, Saints Row when that comes out.
Not necessarily a team deathmatch type thing, but just...
Last Man Standing, just get a bunch of people from All Games, get some of us, get some other people, and just have everyone kill each other.
I like that kind of stuff.
So it would answer the age-old classic OLR question of, if all the members of Orange Launch Radio got into a battle royale, who would survive?
You guys are just fucking lucky that they haven't put out a Grand Theft Auto yet that's online, because I would fucking kill everybody.
That sounds like the throwdown to me.
That is the throwdown.
I know that because I've been owning my peeps at work for, what, almost a year now?
Yeah, I think we could do that.
Bring it.
I've got a year on everybody.
Doesn't Rumble Roses XX have a mode like that?
The four chicks beating each other up?
Yeah, it does.
See, we can do that.
We should all get Rumble.
Rumble Roses XX will be $20 any day now.
Come on.
How many people actually bought that game?
Do you really want to waste $20, though?
I bought... Oh, no, wait.
I didn't buy the game.
I got it for free.
Thank you, Konami.
That's not worth it either.
I want to borrow that if you never play it.
I don't play it.
I want to spend some time with chick wrestlers.
Come on, it's fun.
I basically popped it in, played with the boob adjustment little dial on there and got bored of it.
That's about it.
Blackwolf's in chat right now, our old buddy Bobby Blackwolf, who also does a show Sunday nights over at allgames.com.
Loki does not play well with others.
He can't handle a team game.
That's probably about right.
Yep.
Okay, at least he admits it.
Like Zim from Invader Zim.
We need to do like a... We started destroying when we were on our own planet.
So?
I wish we could do like a World of Warcraft, like I wish we could have like a private battlegrounds.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Actually, they're going to have, they had a little meet World of Warcraft Insider that they posted up saying that in the expansion they're going to have an arena and you can field your own teams.
Hmm.

DDR Power Previews Xbox DDR Games
We're going to announce a partnership with Konami to promote upcoming Dance Dance Revolution titles on the Xbox and Xbox 360 platforms with exclusive song premieres.
Debuting in the fourth quarter of 06 on the Xbox, Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 4 will contain a new
Power Mode, accessible via a returning feature known as Party Mode.
Power Mode will allow the user to play a non-stop music course, four of which are initially available, approximately five minutes in length.
These new Power Courses not only feature a stream of non-stop dancing arrows, but seamlessly mixed non-stop music.
Longtime fans of the DDR series will recognize this feature as something similar to a non-stop mode featured in the Japanese-only arcade release
Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000 Dance Dance Revolution Universe, the first game in the DDR series for the Xbox 360 also scheduled for the fourth quarter of 06 will also contain this new power mode with a completely different lineup of courses for initially available
Speed, Sync, and Quad Modes are some of the other additional features both games will contain in the Party Mode.
Beginning Sunday, September 3rd, Orange Lounge Radio will be offering exclusive first listens of the new Power Courses each week on Sunday nights, along with bonus V-Rare track previews from the Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 4 V-Rare and the Dance Dance Revolution Universe V-Rare.
The music will be debuted during our live broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio Live right here, 6 o'clock Pacific Time.
These preview listens will be rebroadcast on the syndicated run of Orange Lounge Radio Live airing on All Games Radio the following Monday at 5 p.m.
Pacific Time and Tuesday at 9 a.m.
Pacific Time.
Now these preview listens are exclusive to the live broadcast.
As you can imagine, due to copyright reasons, they will not be available as the podcast or on the podcast.
So you have to listen live to hear it.
But we're really excited about this.
I mean, we've been covering DDR news for a long, long time.
So being able to kind of play a part in rolling out new songs for all you guys to hear is really exciting.
So we're going to be starting that in two weeks.
I've already heard them all.
Well, you're special.
That's why.
So have I, ha ha ha, but we'll be playing them for you guys pretty soon.
Very excited about it.
You guys can almost be as cool as us, that means.
I'll be blasting them in my car, ha ha ha.
Who says I already don't if I had a car?
Doesn't matter, no.
Alright, anyway, before we do this thing here, are you guys anything...
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
That's a lie.
Because I'm like, okay, usually in a 75 song list, there's got to be at least, you know, a few that you don't like, but there's a few that you love.
Somebody's muting me.
I don't even understand that.
Ah, forget it.
Yeah, I know.
All right.
So anyway.
You go, DMN.
All right, we'll be starting that on Sunday, September 3rd, right here live on Orange Lounge Radio.
We're excited about that.
Yeah, Cutters points out that they were also in solo bass mix.
Oh, that's right, true.
SoloBase had like half as many as Solo 2000.
Solo 2000 added like four more.
I keep forgetting about SoloBase.
I had only ever played Solo 2000.
I think they still have a SoloBase machine down at the Folsom bowling alley over here.
Really?
That's pretty cool.
It was awful.
Yeah, I think they had one at, what, the local Walmart for a little while.
That got taken away a long time ago.
Yeah, that got taken out.
I think it moved to the Folsom bowling alley.
That's where they got theirs from.
Anyways...
So yeah, I think we'll start off the show with some wonderful exclusive stuff that you're not going to hear anywhere else, at least not yet.
Starting off with some price drops.
Far Cry and Six Predator, yet another game on the 360s, dropped down to $39.99, so that's always good.
And also now we have a date for Dead or Alive Extreme 2, which is going to be hitting this holiday season right before Black Friday on November 22nd.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Now one thing that was mentioned on GameStop this week, they pointed out a Devil May Cry 5th Anniversary Collection coming out on the PlayStation 2.
That is going to be coming out for $39.99 retail on October 25th and it features Devil May Cry 1 through 3.
However, they missed a little bit of information on that.
There's also a Resident Evil 10th Anniversary Collection coming out on the GameCube, which will be featuring Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 4, also for $39.99, also coming out on the 25th of October.
And now for you fans of new colors for systems, you'll be happy to know that the PlayStation 2 Slim is getting a new color.
It's coming out in silver now.
I guess that way you can coordinate your PlayStation 2 Slim with your upcoming PlayStation 3.
And that will also be hitting stores October 25th.
Also coming out on the 31st, Xbox 360 is going to be getting a peripheral bundle.
No news yet on what exactly is in that.
Speaking of bundles, PSP is also getting a new bundle called the Digital Entertainment Pack.
It's coming out September 20th.
for $249.99.
It'll include the core system, a 1GB memory stick, the Lords of Dogtown UMD movie, and ATV Offroad Fury Pro Blazing Trails.
So apparently this is, you know, a great deal or something, but that's going to be coming out September 20th.
And then finally, I've got some news that'll make any DDR fan a little bit sad.
Um,
And that is information about the brand new Saturday Morning series called Dance Revolution.
And it will feature this group called the Slumber Party Girls.
Anyways, this is actually coming from an industry magazine called Home Media Retailing.
It says Dick Entertainment and Geffen Records have partnered to create Slumber Party Girls, a five-member... Is it just wrong to me that Dick Entertainment is producing this?
I mean, about Slumber Party Girls?
Yeah, exactly.
It's slightly wrong.
Anyway.
From the geniuses you brought us, Captain M. A five-member singing and dance act aimed at the tween demographic.
The group whose multi-ethnic members were chosen from more than 1,000 applicants will be the cornerstone to, and this apparently is brought to you by Kohl's, Kohl's Secret Slumber Party on CBS, which premieres September 16th.
The Slumber Party Girls will also appear on 26 half-hour episodes of Dance Revolution and of course my notes on that will be The Unholy Love Child
of DDR and Saturday Morning TV, a live-action TV series within the secret Slumber Party TV block inspired by Konami's video game franchise, Dance Dance Revolution.
A Slumber Party Girls original music signal is slated to debut on iTunes and AOL this month with a music DVD from Geffen, a division of Universal Music thereafter.
Is this the end of DDR?
Has DDR jumped the shark?
Now, I wonder if we're going to see any of their music on one of the DDR games.
Please, God.
Oh, God, this is not the American B for you, is it?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
It just struck me.
This might be the American B for you.
I'm going to have to pour acid in my eyes.
I would have loved to just walked into the boardroom that was planning this shit dogma style and stopped it from happening.
Please, no.
Don't defile our DDR anymore.
It is promotion.
Of what type?
Now, in studio, I have a picture of the Slumber Party Girls, which I will hope to get on the website at some point.
Now, Rob and Shane, you guys have seen the Slumber Party Girls.
Drew, take a look.
What do you think?
It's the fucking Mickey Mouse Club.
Yeah, pretty much the Mickey Mouse Club of DDR.
I don't know what the fuck they're going to do with this show, but it's pretty scary.
Yeah.
Cutters has a good point.
Look at it this way.
Last year it was Go West and YMCA.
This year it's Slumber Party Girls.
Do you know what I was going to say to Miklatov earlier?
There's one song in DDR you always skip.
You know what, though?
Think about this.
What has the Mickey Mouse Club done for us?
Given us a bunch of whores.
So you know what?
More power to them.
Brittany, Christina, Justin Timberlake.
That Sexy Back song is pretty hot.
I know.
It was stuck in my head the other day.
I was very sad.
Oh, anyway, yeah.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I'm thinking about Justin Timberlake.
We should get back to video games, however.
What do you think?
Is this good promotion?
Mikotov, I'm especially curious what you might think on this.
Is this good promotion or no comment?
I can have a comment.
I don't like it.
I think it's really stupid.
But that's me not speaking as a Konami employee.
That's me speaking as a normal person that can look at that article and be like,
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I wonder if we'll see more about this in a few days.
Maybe.
I don't know why.
Maybe they'll do a performance.
We'll see.
Alright, let's move on to another story.
Now, maybe if you're into that thing, maybe you'll be lucky and they'll release a Slumber Party Girls HD DVD so you can see them in all their full high definition glory.
With a free coupon for therapy.
Which hopefully you'll be able to play on your Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.
There are rumors going around out there.
According to DigiTimes, this HD DVD add-on will be retailing for $200 US.
Now, originally, I think the rumors were $100, but I think we all realized that seemed a little low.
So $200 is now the price of the add-on, they're saying.
This is only a rumor, keep in mind.
But sounds like it could be pretty legit.
What do you think, Loki?
Well, we haven't heard the official price yet.
I keep checking daily, twice daily.
But
I'm sure Microsoft, I know, is coming into our work in a few weeks.
And, well, I'm sure we'll get the information out of them then.
But that's something about right.
I mean, HD DVD players are pretty expensive.
And it's not really something that you necessarily have to buy.
So, yeah, $200 seems pretty reasonable for an HD DVD player.
But, I mean, when you think about it, all it is is really kind of just a drive anyways.
But, you know, one thing, though.
That's not what Sony says!
So pretty much, you know, we have one of the former Microsoft employees, I guess, Andre...
I can't even pronounce his last name.
Anyways, he had a blog entry entitled 1080p Meaningless This Generation.
And he discussed why the PlayStation 3 can output 1080p for both games and movies, but apparently it doesn't mean much.
And you won't see any 1080p games for the PlayStation 3 this year.
And that kind of makes sense.
I mean, it can output that high, but a lot of the games are being co-developed for both the, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But I think what they're saying is, does it matter?
Does the eye really distinguish the difference that much?
They're just saying that there's not much of a difference between the interlaced and the progressive scan on it.
Okay, so granted, I think what you'll see... I sure noticed the difference between 480i and 480p.
I would say what the main difference would probably be is it would be sharper and less blurry, especially with a lot of movement on screen, stuff like that, because it's updating faster.
But...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Possibly, but the thing is, though, is it something really... I mean, like, for example, the difference between 720 and 1080i on your TV, do you really notice a huge difference?
Not much.
I really don't.
So, I mean, you're probably not going to really notice the difference on it.
Anyways, he points out there's an analysis done by the video editor of Home Theater Magazine, who basically said there's no noticeable difference between 1080i and 1080p.
and so, I don't know, take it as you will, but remember, Sony is the one, they are trying to sell those TVs, they are trying to sell Blu-ray, and making it a big selling point because, I don't know, the games aren't that great.
Well, remember also that the next generation doesn't start until Sony says it does, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Somebody in chat reminded me of that a minute ago.
Right.
That's right, somebody else was saying, because I called 99 Nights a next-gen game, and somebody said, well, now that 360's out, isn't it current-gen?
Right.
And, you know, well, unfortunately, Sony hasn't said yet that next-gen can start.
So, you know, 360, I guess.
I don't know.
It's a little silly.
It is silly.
I really want to see, like, Reggie and Peter Moore and... What's the guy from Sony?
Kaz?
Kaz.
Yeah, that guy.
I want to see them all, like, in a Rumble Roses-style mud-wrestling match.
With bikinis?
With bikinis.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
ESRB
and of course the Entertainment Software Ratings Board is going to be launching a new public service announcement campaign.
The PSAs will explain video game ratings to parents and encourage them to check the rating every time they purchase a video game for their kids.
This campaign will be using TV, radio, throughout the state of Georgia and it's going to be running in the coming weeks.
Now, recent studies paid for by the ESRB show that 83% of parents with children who play video games are aware of the ESRB ratings, and three-quarters reference them when buying games for their family.
You know, I couldn't help but think when I read this, haven't there already been many PSAs and campaigns for this?
Because, like, when I went into Target, there's this whole, like, who wants to be a millionaire play, which I think is really funny because that whole thing is, like, you know, years old now.
Like, I think America is so over-millionaire.
But they have this whole, you know, thing with Regis, you know, selling the ratings, basically.
That's annoying sounding, but when I worked at EB... There's a baseball one, too.
Yeah, on our EB TV we had every month, they had, like,
Tiger Woods promoting the ESRB ratings, and I think Derek Jeter was on one time too.
It was, you know, I guess informative, but I think they don't give the parents enough credit, because when I worked in EB, the parents would always check the ESRB ratings.
It's like, oh, this game's T?
They would ask my opinion, they'd be like, yeah, if you're getting it for your four-year-old, that's probably not a good thing.
There's always one retard that slips through the cracks, though.
And that's the one they pay attention to.
And I mean that.
I don't mean, like, literally, okay?
I'm not totally insensitive, but I mean, like, you know, somebody who really just, something is just, you know, wrong with the parents and the kid.
There's just one, you know, parent out there that's always, you know, their kids are screaming, I want Grand Theft Auto!
I'm not gonna stop screaming and tell you Grand Theft Auto!
And, you know, fine, I gotta buy Grand Theft Auto for them.
and then, you know, kids see something on there and being a retard and his parents don't watch him, he goes and punches his sister or something.
Oh my god, he learned it from the game!
He didn't learn it because I'm not paying attention to him or anything, it's because of the game!
You bought him the damn game!
So then she goes and sues, you know, somebody over the game and then, you know, the whole thing comes down to, you know, then Jack
Jacky Pook comes in and goes, see?
See, this is what I'm talking about.
But the whole thing comes down to the parents, you know, you can put it out there, you can put it in their face, you can, you know, sell them the game and go, this is rated teen for this reason and, you know, let them know or whatever.
As you're selling them the game, and it won't matter.
It won't matter because they're stupid, and they're just hell-bent on doing something stupid and killing themselves.
Lead a horse to water.
All right.
Now, BlackWolf, since he lives in Georgia, his show's based out of Atlanta area, he says the difference here is that it is done with the assistance of the Georgia Attorney General instead of just the ESRB.
People listen to the Attorney General more.
I actually doubt the truth behind that statement.
No offense, BlackWolf.
Bobby, but I don't think the Attorney General having a hand in it is going to change things that much.
But maybe it's just a California, I don't know, because, you know, whatever.
I don't know.
Actually, don't you remember years ago the California Attorney General was like really upset about Mortal Kombat and all that stuff and got involved with that stuff?
Weren't the rating systems established in part because of him?
I want to say.
Yeah, I want to say, yeah.
Well, maybe I'm wrong then.
Who knows?
Anyways, moving on here.
There's a Spanish magazine, Nintendo Action, that is reporting that the next issue will reveal the official price, the launch date, and the game lineup for the Wii.
It says the issue is due to hit on September 15th.
So people are saying they're going to announce the official date on September 15th.
Wow, okay, I've read this on numerous sites.
Hooray, another Wii speculation story.
Hold on, hold on.
I've read this on numerous sites, and there's a whole big hole in their logic here.
For example, do you realize that, I don't know, they have to work on the magazine for a few months and go through all the editorial process and then print the magazine?
It doesn't just magically poof right there.
So they're not going to announce the date on the 15th.
I bet you anything they're announcing it next Wednesday.
They're in Let's Big.
And that's where you're going to find all your damn information.
That's where you're going to get this information that's going to be posted in the magazine.
So just wait a few more days and all the info will be there.
I don't understand, okay?
All these gaming blogs are running this speculation thing.
You know, like it's everywhere on the internet.
And I fucking told you guys last week exactly what day the Wii would be out.
And not a damn person picked up the story and said Orange Lounge Radio knows that the Wii will be out
Soon.
I'm very upset with the gaming community right now.
I've still got all my chips on the 18th of October.
Really?
Well, I think it's a risky bet at this point.
I'm starting to place my bet on soon.
I think he's in the right vicinity.
What the hell am I doing?
I'm done with speculating.
We'll know when we know.
We will know when Reggie comes out and says, Bam, here it is.
He'll just be like, Wham!
There's my junk.
This is the date.
Real credits.
By the way, earlier when we were talking about the mud wrestling fight, our chat room did seem to agree with us here.
Ari Mawson said Reggie is cool.
Zero Cool says, yeah, Reggie would kick ass and take names.
DMN says he's a big guy.
Ranma says Reggie is half black.
He will fuck everyone up.
He will get ghetto in a heartbeat.
FireResurrected says, I love how Sky calls himself a Sony fanboy and Nintendo fanboy.
I'm just a games fanboy.
I'm also a Microsoft fanboy.
I didn't used to be.
A long time ago, I used to hate Microsoft's game thing.
But, you know, things change.
People change.
Opinions change.
The Xbox was like my green kryptonite.
I just couldn't touch it.
That's the way a lot of us felt.
I refused to buy an Xbox.
But you know what?
I got tired of waiting.
And
It was a good purchase.
They finally started coming out with really good games.
PlayStation 3?
It might be a good purchase.
Later on.
I'm not going to buy it.
I think that's it too.
You know what?
You bring up a very good point.
I think the PS3 is going to suffer the same fate of the Xbox in my mind.
I think later on, the PS3 is going to be like a must-have system.
But to start... I'm just waiting for some of their great first party titles.
I mean, I want a new Twisted Metal.
God damn it.
It's going to look fucking amazing on the PlayStation 3.
That'll probably sell the system for me right there.
But...
There is no Twisted Metal at launch.
People said the Virtual Boy would be off to a slow start.
Look what happened to it.
Granted, I didn't really buy any of the Ratchet & Clank games, nor do I like the Ratchet & Clank games, but that would be a cool game to have on there.
Maybe... I don't know.
I want Jumping Flash.
Screw everything else if I could get a Jumping Flash game.
An actual...
Grand Turismo sequel You would be fucking happy with a Fantavision sequel I would really be happy Your taste in games is fucked And I think anyone who's listened to this show long enough knows that by now Your taste in games is absolutely fucked Whatever, Fantavision was really fun And Jumping Flash, yeah, best That and Mega Man 8 were the reasons I got a PS1 Because Jumping Flash was the best Never mind Symphony of the Night, Final Fantasy 7 Slide, slide, slide
Never mind, you know, any of that stuff.
It was all about fucking Jumping Flash.
The little robot bunny guy was so cool.
Well.
And somebody in the chat room said that they want an online jumping flash, GS68 or whatever.
Alright, well hooray for them.
I would play it with you because that's a great sounding game.
Can we get to the next story please?
No.
Alright, now one place that you might be able to get your hands on the Wii are these secret parties that are supposedly starting in September.
Now this is kind of interesting because Nintendo is going to be having these private parties.
What they're going to do is they're going to seek out people.
I don't know, like on the internet, MySpace, or what they're doing.
And they're going to invite 30 friends to this private party.
So it's like an underground campaign.
It's a random selection of Nintendo ambassadors.
You basically sign in.
There's like some website.
Sign me up!
Shit, I want to have an Orange Lounge Radio Wii party.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Well, technically since we're...
I've said such nice things about Reggie on this program.
I think that entitles us to a wee party.
You said you wouldn't have sex with him, though.
That's not very nice.
That's respectful.
That's not being rude.
That's being respectful.
Well, you know what?
We played it at E3.
We'll get to play it soon enough.
Hopefully.
I mean, it's just the whole thing is buzzed.
They really need to start some really serious advertising.
I've got to tell you this, though.
I mean, this is how underground it is, okay?
They know that Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver are all going to have these parties.
Supposedly, some of the news is leaking through, and a Chicago person actually emailed Kotaku and said that his friends are going to be buzzed rave style to a secret location to play games and have fun.
So they're going to have to go to this random parking lot in the ghetto side of town and get in the bus and then be shipped to the Wii.
And it's like, you know, hey man, want some X?
Want a hit?
How about that sleeping gas?
Battle Royale.
That's how the Wii's graphics are going to be 3D.
Drug influenced.
I figured it out.
Yes, indeed.
Exactly, that's awesome.
I'm a genius.
Well, speaking of L.A., American McGee.
Who has a wonderful game called Bad Day LA coming out in a couple weeks here.
He's basically on the record saying the only real next-gen is the Wii.
And his reasons for that, basically, that the only true next-gen console out there is the Wii.
Everything else is just a video card and processor upgrade, I guess, because the controls are a lot different.
He believes that, you know, I don't know, they're really not innovating, just kind of upgrading.
Better graphics and really where the games are is just better gameplay.
You need to fucking release some more games, American McGee.
That's all I got to say about that.
I don't think the Wii is next gen so much as it is I'll do what I want, gen.
That's what Nintendo's doing, essentially.
We'll do what we want.
We're just going to, you, Nintendo, Microsoft, I mean, Sony, Microsoft, you have fun over there fighting.
We'll be off on this side doing our wee thing.
Seriously.
The whole thing was, you know, pretty much, he knows, well, I wouldn't really say that he knows what gaming is, but, you know,
I think he's trying to point out, it's just like what we say on the show all the time, you know, a system is only as good as the games.
And I think just by looking at the Wii, I mean, playing some of these games using that control setup is going to be a lot of fun.
And you don't need to have, you know, superb graphics to do it.
And to be honest, a lot of the games that come out for the Nintendo system, especially a lot of the first party stuff, you don't need to render cartoons and super duper graphics.
I mean, they're just animated characters.
They're not realistic.
So...
Yeah, they can do it with that kind of technology and that kind of power.
I don't know, just play the game.
Goddamn wait.
Stop trying to guess.
We'll see who's going to be at the top pretty soon.
I mean, only a few months before these systems come out, so why do we got to speculate?
Really, is it that slow of a news week?
In a way, sadly enough.
I mean, we're all waiting for these systems to come out.
What else are we supposed to do in the meantime?
I don't know.
Nobody wants to play 99 Nights but me, so I don't know.
Yeah, so we can just point and laugh at all the hype wars.
All right.
JeremyTodd1, interesting point in chat.
Who says next-gen has to have awesome graphics?
Next-gen is really just a change of the gen before it, and the Wii certainly falls into that category.
True.
True.
Agreed.
Alright, well, this could be another random direction the Wii is going in.
You know how the DS was kind of the brain training system?
Well, the Wii may be the body training system.
There was a report published by Bloomberg that made mention of a new form of game in development at Nintendo.
It's a Wii-based diet software.
This Bloomberg report issued...
I'm sorry, this Bloomberg report showed that there was the recent strong performance of Nintendo's Japanese stock, and it made mention of the new software in passing.
Nintendo is developing diet-related and other forms of software for the Wii.
The report noted that such titles, specifically Brain Age for the DS, have been able to target new users who aren't used to standard game controllers.
Details were not given beyond this.
Well, that would kind of coincide with the registering of the domain Wii Health, so...
That would make sense.
That's what I was thinking, too, is all those Wii things we read about previously.
So, not too surprised there.
What is kind of funny and surprising, I guess, is that the Wii is going to have, or speculated to have, a voice-to-text chat.
I guess you would call this an advanced voice-to-text chat because it will actually detect, I guess, the...
DarkSakura.com
I don't even know why you would do voice-to-text chat anyways if you could just do voice chat.
I mean, what would be the point?
I don't know.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
You're playing Marble Blast.
Not to knock Marble Blast, it's a great game, but it doesn't exactly strike me as the macho, you know, stereotypical
Macho Man type of game.
My marbles are made of seal, bitch.
Exactly.
You're bound to hear that sort of stuff also in Uno.
I got fucking Uno, bitch.
Suck it.
I've never heard smack talking in Uno.
Really?
Yes, never.
We need to start it.
Play more Uno.
I don't want to get bad ratings.
I'm going to totally talk crap in like, I don't know.
Totem Ball or something.
If that's multiplayer, I'm going to fucking talk shit.
Too bad Bejeweled 2 isn't multiplayer.
That would be sweet.
FireResurrected in chat says, that's why you need to play with your listeners.
I mean, that's true.
I want to play games with listeners.
We'll set up a time or something like a, you know, hey, play games with us on Xbox Live type of night.
We'll do something like that.
Rini says, marbles are serious shit, Skye.
I can't wait to get Saints Row.
I just can't wait to get that game.
I'm going to talk so much crap.
BlackWolf says, draw four, biatch!
Exactly.
See, he's got the right... I want to have... You know what?
Didn't all games do an Uno tournament recently?
I want to have a shit-talking Uno tournament that's graded not only on how well you play, but how well you talk shit.
Remember that movie with the South Park guys years ago, Basketball?
They had the psych-outs, right?
That's what we need, is a psych-out Uno tournament.
I have no idea how we can pull that off, but we need a shit-talking Uno tournament.
Here's what we need to do.
Oh yeah?
Think you're going to win this game?
Well, suck on this reverse.
Here's what we need to do.
Your mom sucked on that reverse.
We need to film it, and we need to wait until they come out with the vision cameras.
And that will be the shit right there.
Because you'll have, you know, yelling, and it'll just be like, you know, it'll be awesome.
Alright, maybe we'll have to plan something like that.
I'll talk to Scott offline.
I'm sure he'll love that idea.
I've got a story about Reggie.
Tonight is like Reggie night on Orange Lounge Radio.
I mean, seriously, this man... Ugh.
Well this man is kicking ass.
He's like the Chuck Norris of gaming.
That's what it is.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anyway, I got sick of Chuck Norris after all my co-workers were obsessed with him and bought books about him and then it happened in WoW and I just wanted to die.
Anyway.
Reggie has said, you know, remember that way back when Peter Moore said about the Sony, tell me why you would buy a $600 PlayStation 3.
People are going to buy two machines.
They're going to buy an Xbox and they're going to buy a Wii for the price of one PlayStation 3.
Remember that was said back at E3 and everybody's eyebrows went up like, oh.
Microsoft and Nintendo might be in bed together.
Well, they are not in bed together because you know what Reggie came back and said?
There was an article in USA Today about the Wii and he said, quote, I'd much rather have the consumer buy a Wii, some accessories, and a ton of games versus buying any of my competitors' products.
See, you don't get in bed with Microsoft, you just might catch something.
It's like, yeah.
Like Windows.
Other interesting comments made in the interview.
Quote, we will offer online enabled games that the consumers will not have to pay a subscription fee for.
They'll be able to enjoy that right out of the box.
The Wii console is going to be Wi-Fi enabled, so essentially you'll be able to plug it in and go.
It won't have hidden fees or costs.
P.S.
Suck it more.
Actually, that wasn't said, but that's kind of what he was implying.
I mean, why didn't he just say, you know, suck it, Microsoft, ours thing's gonna be free.
And that, and you know what, that is a big point, I mean, I, even though I, I don't understand why you would need, you know, Wi-Fi adapter for the 360, I mean, I just run fucking Ethernet cable and go to my router, but, like, if you really want to spend $99 for fucking Wi-Fi...
I mean, that's ridiculous, but at least the Wii's going to have it out of the box.
However, it doesn't have an Ethernet cable port on there, so you actually have to have some sort of Wi-Fi connection, whether it be some USB thing or Wi-Fi router.
So that kind of sucks.
Now, FireResurrected brings up this excellent point that kind of says, you know, he's trying to put Reggie in his place a little bit here.
This is an interesting comment.
But we have to endure the fucking friend codes.
Ouch.
It's not that much of a gripe.
Damn.
It does suck.
It's a password.
You guys don't remember entering in passwords?
Yeah, I do, and I remember not liking it.
We're beyond that now.
I remember Justin Bailey, dash, dash, dash.
But no, seriously?
But put it side by side with Microsoft's system where you can add people on the web and everything.
I mean, okay, you've got to give that one to Microsoft.
They've got the more ease of communicating with your friends in a way.
Huh?
I think so.
I bet that doesn't, that's not to say, I mean, the Wii could change things, obviously.
Just trying to do the stupid friend code stuff for, like, Animal Crossing when I had that game for two weeks, that was really obnoxious, and I wished I could have just, you know, been able to maybe even go to some hub town and, like, hang out with people and be like, oh, you're really cool, well, here, I'm gonna add you as my friend or something.
Much easier.
Actdeft in our chatroom says, Friend codes, good on theory, but Nintendo didn't do it the right way.
JeremyTodd1 seems to add to that.
But they have a different password for each and every different game.
They only need one friend code for the system, and that would work fine.
Interesting comments.
Another place we always get interesting comments is our mailbag, and even though DarkSakura is not here tonight to read the mail for us, I've borrowed her hazmat suit, and I'm going to jump on into the mailbag and read some e-mails.
Do you want to read an email, Shane?
Yeah.
All right, come over here.
Read an email.
All right.
Why don't you read this email?
This one comes to us from StevenNZ, and Shane's going to read us this email here.
Okay.
Hi, I absolutely love your show.
I have been listening for about one and a half years now, but just recently registered on your site.
I heard in episode 193 that you guys may not be getting the Xbox 360 PGR3 bundle, so I would just like to tell you that over here in New Zealand, there's a... an, not a...
An Xbox 360 bundle with Project Gotham 3 in cameo, which is weird because us New Zealanders normally get things late or don't get anything at all.
Thanks for the great show, Steve in New Zealand.
Alright, well, by the way, it has since come out, I mean, the 193 was a little bit ago, so it has since come out, we are not getting that Project Gotham Racing bundle here.
No, we're not getting any bundles of any sort.
Now, my only thing, though, is that, is this an official Microsoft sanctioned bundle, or is this something like the local gaming store in New Zealand is doing, like how GameStop does here?
I think it is official.
Oh, that's cool.
Because in other countries, they're getting official bundles to help sell the system a bit more, because, you know, they're having a little trouble.
Um, so, I mean, you see some bundles here, like, I know they bundle, I've seen at, like, Fry's, our local electronics chain over here, they've got, um, a bundle with Ridge Racer 6, which, you know, as we mentioned last week, Ridge Racer 6 is only $19.99, so it's not a great deal, but still, but still though, it is pretty decent, I mean, that they're doing that, so, I don't know.
All right.
Hi, I'm a relatively new listener and I really love your show.
The format works well and the interaction between the three of you and any guests you have on definitely make the experience...
Well, because it doesn't exist.
I'm just kidding.
Make the experience all that much more enjoyable.
My question concerns Kid Icarus.
When it came out for the original NES, I truly loved the game and thought it ranked right up there with Metroid as far as playability and... I can't read it standing up like this because I'm at an angle.
An interesting concept.
Interesting concept.
Why then...
Has there never been a sequel to this potentially fun franchise?
Is there some sort of inside information, blah blah blah, that have kept this from happening, or am I one of a small minority of people who like the original game?
So there's just not enough interest to produce.
Thanks for your time, and keep up the great work, Boston Aller fan.
And, wait, I want to respond.
Okay, respond.
There was one on the GBA.
I don't remember if it's a sequel, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the same game.
Oh, not GBA, sorry, Game Boy.
Whatever, nobody cares about the GBA.
Is it just because the Game Boy version didn't sell as well, comparatively?
Did it kill off the franchise, or what?
I honestly don't think a lot of people bought it, because, I mean, Metroid got a sequel on Game Boy, and we ended up getting Super Metroid.
Yeah, Metroid 2 really did suck.
But all the future Metroids have been pretty darn good, and Super Metroid's probably one of the best video games ever made, period.
Oh yeah, definitely.
That's an amazing game.
But I guess Kid Icarus on Game Boy just really must have been horrible.
It must have suffered from Metroid 2 syndrome, where that game was really terrible too.
It just makes me cry inside, because if Super Metroid was seriously the great, great, great, great, great, great video game it was, imagine what Super Kid Icarus could have been.
I mean, it just makes me kind of sad.
I know.
I love Kid Icarus, actually.
And when I had a PSP for two weeks, I played it on that.
And that game is freaking hard, but it's awesome.
I suppose it's possible that maybe with the Wii, especially with Pit being one of the new Smash Bros.
characters...
Maybe now is the time for Kid Icarus to return finally.
Because, you know, Metroid kind of made a big return on the GameCube.
Maybe it'll make the same return and Kid Icarus will become a first-person shooter.
See, that's the problem.
I don't want them to, like, if they make a new Kid Icarus, I don't want it to be that different.
Like, I don't want them to fuck with it like they did Metroid.
I know a lot of you like the first-person Metroid, but I don't care for it.
You don't want to use the Wii controller to draw back the bowstrings?
Okay, now that might be kind of cool, depending on... But I don't want it to be first person!
If I had to, like, run around and fight an eggplant wizard in first person, I think I would cry, because that was the scariest part of that game for me when I was younger.
Because I did not want to be an eggplant with legs.
See, the eggplant... See...
Kid Icarus had so many memorable characters like that.
You know the scary Medusa looking thing and the dragon that flew.
The Grim Reaper that would yell at you if it saw you.
That was so scary.
Yeah, seriously.
I loved it though.
How can you not love Kid Icarus?
And the things that looked like noses with eyes that had a lot of nose hair coming out.
I don't remember what they were called, but they were scary too.
Legend of Zaku thinks he knows another game that ought to be making a return on the Wii.
Punch-Out! !
Super Punch Out was pretty good.
It was a little bit overlooked.
I never played that one.
It was a little bit overlooked because I think it came out late in the Super Nintendo's run.
Mike Tyson basically ruined it for everybody.
Mike Tyson doesn't... You don't need Mike Tyson.
How about George Foreman?
I realize he's long gone, but I mean, he makes the grills.
I think he's promoting the PlayStation 3.
All right, I've got to read this email.
This is a great email.
It's kind of long, but since it's well-written, I'm going to read the whole thing.
So everybody get the water and the snacks.
All right, just shut up.
No, this is a good email.
Listen to this.
This is about Sony.
This is a really good, interesting point on the whole Sony debate.
Hello, GS191 here, and just wanted to put in my two cents on one of the reoccurring topics on this show, Sony.
It's hard trying to like Sony these days.
With their failing formats, overpriced and underperforming Blu-ray format, the underwhelming PlayStation 3, the whole rootkit fiasco, and let's not forget, they're the makers of the exploding Dell and Apple laptop batteries.
Is there any redeeming quality left in Sony?
To me, I think not.
First off, why do they insist on trying to push dead formats such as the Betamax, Minidisc, UMD, etc.?
The list goes on and on.
And now comes Blu-ray.
Sure, Blu-ray has the support of over 180 companies, but the thing that gets me is where is the consumer in all of this?
I don't see the demand for Blu-ray or HD DVD now since we basically don't have the majority of the population owning HD TVs, let alone 1080p HD TVs.
This all leads up to the PlayStation 3 and Sony Computer Entertainment in general.
I think that $600 of my hard-earned money is not worth it.
Even if it was bundled with a Blu-ray disc showing 6 million ways how Aerith can die for all I care, they have in no way ever explained to me why is this plastic box full of fans, transistors, chips, silicon is worth that price tag.
They try to push how this is the next generation of gaming and it's proven in the games.
Yeah, I see some screen and game footage from the launch titles for PlayStation 3 and I was very underwhelmed.
A lot of them look like Xbox 360 and PC games.
I cannot tell the difference.
That right there says why spend $600 when I can shell out $400 or even $250 for a much better gaming experience and have enough money for the games.
Also, 8 of the games are already going to be on other consoles.
That also really doesn't give me much incentive.
I think they are really going for the action-oriented audience with this launch, but with many people not seeing that grade A title like Halo or Metal Gear at launch, why should I even bother?
My real problem is the whole PC notation.
It's not a computer, people.
If it's a computer, does this mean that I can upgrade the PS3 to a faster processor or add more RAM?
Probably not.
Even if it did, why would anybody want to upgrade?
It's like the 32X for the Genesis.
The games were there, but nobody wanted to upgrade.
The same would apply here.
Besides, you're going to need a lot of fine-tuning to text from a PC perfectly scaled on a regular SDTV.
This is what I think should have been done and can be done for SCE to turn things around.
1.
Kill off the flash card reader and leave the memory stick in.
Isn't that what you do with your Sony VAIO laptops?
If I want to look at my photos, I will put them on the computer.
It's just added costs that could, not could, definitely have dropped the price down from $600.
Hell, replace it with, I don't know, regular legacy PS2 controller ports for people who use PS2 controllers for DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, etc.
2.
Instead of getting rid of the HDMI port for the $500 version, why not disable the ability of commercially made Blu-ray movies from playing?
Sony can always release a downloadable upgrade that will enable the playback function.
This is a lot better than watching downscale Blu-ray movies because the movie has copy protection in it and you don't even have the port for full resolution playback.
If this happened, I think the $500 would be useful and great for my needs instead of being the joke that it is.
3.
Sony, it's time for Kaz, Ken, and David to make a nice long nap until November.
These three people make the PlayStation 3 more overblown than it already is.
At least get them some decent PR people to limit what they say.
Four, convince people why they should buy the PlayStation 3.
This is the most important and the hardest thing their marketing department has to do.
I would love to see Sony do an all-out blitz of great ads on why you should be even considering a PlayStation 3 for the holiday season.
All they need to do is showcase the games, do some comparisons, and especially convince people how the hell $600 is justifiable on a gaming device.
If they can do the last part, that would be great for them.
I'm doubtful if they can do that, though.
Well, that's what I think, anyway.
Keep up the great work, screw the haters, practice what you preach, and don't be a dick.
Sincerely, GS191.
Now you may speak.
Okay, so he wanted to do actual upgrades later on.
That was one of the things Kaz said, that they're looking forward to doing PC-type upgrades with more RAM, more stuff.
Then it comes down to the problem, well now you don't have a standardized system to work for, so how do you develop games?
That's not good for the consumer, or for the publishers of these games, or anybody even thinking about the system, because what the fuck do you develop for?
Now you just have to kind of figure out, okay, well what do people have?
You're always going to develop for the lowest end.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I was excited about the PlayStation 3 when I went in the E3.
I was like, holy shit, this is gonna be awesome.
There was games I saw, you know, trailers for.
I'm like, I gotta play these things.
I played them as like, so what?
This is stupid.
The games were big letdown, and I know they're not finished, but you know what?
I'm not talking about graphics either.
I'm just really saying gameplay for these games sucked, and the graphics were just like, well, I can see this on the 360, and
Big deal.
So, yeah, they are going to have a problem because basically Xbox is lining up their system and the game's coming out right now, especially all their first party stuff, to trump everything that they're going to release on the PS3.
I mean, you've got Gran Turismo HD or whatever they're calling it now.
Well, Forza 2 kicks the crap out of that.
Then they've got, you know, an actual, I guess you would kind of say almost like a Halo game.
Game coming out, Gears of War, which is going to be just fucking ginormous.
And that's coming out a week before the PlayStation 3 launch.
And to be honest, Blu-ray kind of sucks.
You don't really need the HDMI right now because you can still be able to pump out the same stuff component-wise.
Until at least, I think, like 2009.
But once they go all digital, then you will need the HDMI and you're going to be fucked because all your Blu-ray discs are only going to be able to output at 540.
So half the resolution.
Yay.
That's really worth $600.
And I agree.
One good thing, though, about HD DVD right now, though, is they're releasing all the discs with their hybrid discs.
One side DVD, one side HD DVD.
So, say, for example, that you are planning on buying an HD DVD player down the line, you can buy these hybrid discs, and you can still watch them now.
Then later on, when you get your new system, you don't have to go repurchase the actual movie.
You can just flip the disc over and watch it in a higher resolution.
So...
I don't know.
Whatever the case, they haven't done their advertising campaign yet and they're going to need one hell of an advertising campaign to get the system sold.
Alright, I'm looking in chat and lots of feedback, of course, to this email in chat.
And what's kind of funny is that the author of the email is in chat right now.
Kind of responding to comments there, or just at least kind of looking at what people are saying.
Gosh, there's a lot of stuff here.
Let's see.
I like the one that Funnydale said.
Also, let's remember the PlayStation 2 launched with Fantavision, and look at how well the PS2 did.
That's because Fantavision is a brilliant game.
Well, you know what, though?
I don't know about that.
Fantavision, I did play Fantavision when it came out.
It was one of the first games I rented because I didn't really have any games for it.
and you know what?
It was a game that had a different style of gameplay that was fun to play.
It was simple, but it was fun.
It comes down to the Geometry Wars kind of scenario there.
It's still a fun game.
It may be simple, but it was fun to play.
Granted that I got bored with it after a while, but it doesn't matter.
It's different.
I never got bored with it because of those cutscenes with the live actors.
Those were great.
Blackwolf says the PlayStation 3 would sell out in my area even if there were no games for it.
They don't care.
They want the Sony system and that's final.
That's what... You know what?
And that's what Kaz said.
He's all... People would buy this system even if we sold it with no games.
Well, good.
I hope that you're happy with your purchase.
I mean, no one's saying... No one... I'm not going to talk anyone out buying a PlayStation 3.
Go ahead and buy one if you want to, but...
I hope some good games come out for you, because so far, I'm not impressed.
Maybe down the line, it might be great.
One of those Final Fantasy XIII's and one Metal Gear Solid 4 and all that stuff.
But the way I look at it, that's about a year off.
I may look at the system in a year.
I didn't jump on board with PlayStation 1 until Final Fantasy VII.
Exactly, I didn't either.
I don't know.
Anyway, well, this is always a controversial topic.
We'd love to hear your thoughts.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com is the place to send those emails.
Just on one final note, Sony is saying that something big is coming with the announcement.
They're going to blow the roof off with something.
Can Sony dig themselves out of this hole with a big enough announcement?
Possibly, but I think we have stories later on that will just kind of, I don't know, make the hole deeper.
Hmm, alright.
Anyways, Game Fest 2006 took place recently, and some news came out of that, including some of the plans for the live Marketplace.
And of course, the Marketplace has been doing great so far.
Everybody has been downloading tons of stuff.
They're saying that 38% of all Marketplace downloads are game demos, trailers, and account for 25% of downloads.
XBOX Live
and on the marketplace, there's Gil for sale.
I can go buy Gil in like 100 pieces or whatever at a certain price and I can keep buying the same item over and over for the game.
So you're basically able to buy almost like items for a game.
And of course, beyond these consumable items, because they're trying to make tons of money off of this stuff, they're actually going to have more community stuff.
including more community videos and hopefully user-made content and stuff like that.
Especially also with the XNA thing that's going to be happening where you can actually program for live.
I think we have more information on that in the next half.
It should be interesting.
I don't know how I feel about that.
I don't know.
I don't know how I feel about the whole buying in-game currency and all that stuff.
I don't know.
When you think about it,
If you actually look, like say for example, Oblivion, and you look at all those add-ons that they have for it, because I mean, when you're buying the add-ons at like $1.25 a pop, it's not that bad.
I mean, it doesn't seem like much, but when you look back at all that you've spent on this game,
Exactly.
I don't know.
Also, look at Oblivion.
They got taunted the hell out of them for that whole horse armor thing.
And it seems to me like that's the kind of thing you're talking about.
Like, you can get this little item that you can use in your game.
Well, it didn't seem to me like the horse armor had a very big reception to it.
Yeah, no one picked up the horse armor, but everything else people picked up.
Oh, and see, Chatham agrees with me in there.
FireResurrected said, except horse armor.
Yeah, horse armor is lame.
It was an experiment, though, I guess.
That's not really the item I would... Horse armor?
Who the fuck cares about pimping out their horse?
That's stupid.
Alright, well, I'll be getting a 23rd Xbox Live Arcade game next week, and I'm sure a lot of you will too, but you better get it next week, because it's going to be free for a certain period of time here.
You will be able to log on to Xbox Live within the first 48 hours of release, and that would be August 23rd at 8am like the standard time.
What is it?
GMT.
So that translates to 1am Pacific Time.
So Wednesday, August 23rd at 1am Pacific Time for 48 hours only, you will be able to download Texas Hold'em for free.
After that, 800 Microsoft Points or 10 bucks.
So prepare for those servers to be hammered like hell on Wednesday and Thursday to get that free game.
At least those live arcade games are tiny.
I mean, it's not like trying to download a Saints Row demo.
I don't think it'll be so bad, especially now that you do the background downloadings.
I think it'll be pretty nice.
I mean, you've got 48 hours.
I mean, sure, it'll be hammered, but it's Texas Hold'em, and the downloads are going to finish pretty quick, so... Oh, well.
That's pretty awesome, though.
Yeah, I'm kind of curious to see how this game turns out.
I'm sure we will have a review next week.
And, hey, if it's free, I expect our listeners to all be grabbing this on Wednesday or Thursday, and we could have, like, a really big poker tournament.
There's no excuse that you can't grab this game, so... Exactly.
Go get it.
And you know what?
It is supporting the camera, I think, so...
Yeah, great, great.
Strip poker for reals.
Not with the listeners, please.
K, thanks.
I will send a frowny face feedback for you if I see any skin.
Anyways, this week we've got a lot more things coming out other than just that Xbox Live Arcade game.
Lots of stuff in the U.S.
Well, maybe not a whole lot in the U.S., but starting off on the Game Boy Advance, you can get a wonderful Yu-Gi-Oh!
Double Pack, number two.
whoopee um Madden NFL of course coming out on every single system and um yeah you can have a merry Madden holiday um on Playstation 2 and the GameCube you can get Pac-Man World Rally which also features the king or not the king but the prince from Katamari so uh check that out on PC um some wonderful stuff also uh Pac-Man World Rally and Madden and hopefully Bad Day LA but I hear that it might actually be delayed a week so um
That's pretty cool.
And then one that I thought was kind of funny, and I didn't even realize there was a first to this, but Prison Tycoon 2 Maximum Security.
That sounds like an awesome game.
That's pretty funny.
On PlayStation 2 and the PSP, you can actually get World Championship Poker all in.
And then, of course, on the 360, just Madden.
So it's a very Madden week.
Next week is the week after that.
Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, and Bomberman.
Are you going to pick up that new Bomberman?
I wasn't too giddy about it when I saw it.
I'll wait and see because Konami is just sending me free stuff.
Jamie's not here tonight, so allow me to help out those of you folks over in the UK with what is coming out on your neck of the woods.
You guys, of course, also can download Texas Hold'em on the 23rd, so look out for that.
On the 25th, you're going to get Dig Dug Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, 99 Nights, which isn't as bad as they all say it is if you like the slashing games.
Reservoir Dogs, World War I, Aces of the Sky, and World War II Battle Over Europe And I like this one, it's a game called Let's Make a Soccer Team Coming from Sega of Europe That should be exciting Shouldn't it be Let's Make a Football Team?
Looking forward, that's what it's called Looking forward a little further to the week of September 1st You're going to have games such as Dance Factory Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover for PSP Dungeon Siege 2 you guys are finally getting
and Saints Row is also coming out for you guys.
It's about the same time we're getting it.
Star Fox Command on the DS, Test Drive Unlimited on the Xbox 360 and for those of you folks in the UK, a game that's near and dear to our hearts, Guitar-O-Man finally makes its way to the PSP and Guitar-O-Man lives September 1st.
Enjoy.
Pretty cool.
One thing coming out probably this fall from MadCatz is an Xbox Live Arcade Stick and it looks like an old kind of Atari controller.
And people are, I guess, jumping on this saying that it's going to be pretty cool.
It's supposed to also come with 100 Microsoft Points, one month free to Xbox Live Gold, and three Xbox Live Arcade games.
It's supposed to retail for $49.99.
They said it's supposed to be releasing in October.
And one thing, though, I got to mention, though, but just looking at this,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
You're not going to be able to play Street Fighter on this controller either, if you've taken a look at it.
I mean, it's looking like an old Atari controller.
And it basically has, you know, instead of a left analog stick, it's got a giant, just kind of like Atari joystick.
And then right next to that, the four buttons.
And below that, the right analog stick.
And to the left of that, the directional pad.
So it's like a big clusterfuck of stuff with a stick on there.
SSJ100Matt says, it looks like a crappy Photoshop and DJ Janai must have something against MadCatz because he calls them mad craps.
MadCatz is really terrible at making anything.
Didn't they make Pump It Up?
No.
They distributed the dance pad and I think they had a little part in it, but you know what?
That's okay because Pump, the greatness of Pump can outweigh the crappiness of MadCatz.
But
Oh, sorry, it was Mastiff.
Well, Mastiff had brought the game over here, but Mad Catz had to do with the past.
I knew Mad Catz did something with it.
I'm not crazy.
Well, it's not a Photoshop.
It is actually a sales sheet, and it was spotted on EB Games' website, and I'm sure we'll know more about this in a few weeks or so.
All right.
Well, something I'm sure you can lay down a pre-order for now, along with this joystick if you want it, is Prey 2.
Apparently in a recent interview with 3D Realms' Scott Miller, their team is already working on a Prey 2.
There's really not a lot else to say about it, but there is a quote I have for you guys, a quote from Scott Miller, quote, Prey 2, of course, we are addressing concerns about combat as well as adding in more gameplay innovations.
Very early, not a lot of hell else to say.
I hope they speed up multiplayer.
I did try multiplayer for the first time this week, and I was really disappointed.
Even after that... Well, go ahead.
Sorry, Loki.
Well, anyways, speaking of your bad multiplayer, they are going to be putting out a patch.
As far as I remember, I think it is already available for download.
A patch came out.
I can tell you, when I put in Prey the other day, it did patch.
But I'm hearing it didn't fix a damn thing with multiplayer, and it was supposed to.
Right?
Probably, yeah.
It was supposed to be fixing... Well, the one for the PC is supposed to be fixing multiplayer weapons, exploit, crash, I guess, on some of the machines when they're reading save games, and crash...
The startup of some machines.
And I know that they were talking about later on adding content as far as new characters, including some of the females that were actually in the game.
Like Jen and stuff?
Yeah, where you had to play as them.
I don't know if that's any cool.
But yeah, the Prey version 1.1 patch, it's basically just updating multiplayer browsers to fix servers and just a lot of server stuff.
The new content though, they are going to be charging for it.
They're adding six new playable characters, including Jen, Mother, and Becky, I guess a blonde victim.
and, uh, two hunter characters.
They're putting a victim as a playable character.
There's just... Okay, Becky, unless I'm just not far enough in the story yet, Becky is just somebody that gets, like, killed in the very beginning and you never learn her name.
She just... You just watch her get... A blonde victim that you occasionally see on Slab in a single-player parade.
Are they gonna have the guy, too, that always goes, Oh, God!
Oh, God!
There's always this random guy, like, when you see the little victim.
It's about alien abduction and the aliens are killing her.
Hunter and Elite Hunter are two hunter characters that they're adding.
Interesting.
So, uh...
That's interesting.
I don't know.
Now, our chat room is making all the mandatory Prey 2 jokes, and you can guess where this is going.
RavensDolphin says, Gee, I have to wait 11 years for the next Prey.
Funnydale says, I'll be waiting for Prey 2 when it's released in 2015.
Obviously making jokes about how long Prey was in development.
DJ Janai says, No Prey 2.
They need to finish Duke Nukem forever.
Exactly.
Stop getting distracted.
Stop it.
Make Duke Nukem forever.
They're getting way too distracted with that game.
Alright, one more story for you guys, then we're going to go to a break here Dragon Quest IX, it looks like it's happening, of course, this really shouldn't be much of a surprise Dragon Quest VIII kind of revived the series in a way here in the US I mean, sure we had VII, but it kind of didn't make the waves that VIII did
8 was truly like a return to... Poor Blimey.
Did you play Dragon Quest VIII, Drew?
Yeah, it was awesome.
Wasn't it like a Super Nintendo with next-gen graphics?
Yeah, it reminded me of Dragon Quest VI.
The World of Dragon Quest The Famicom Era
and how flattered he is with the orchestra's members' appreciation of the games.
He also happened to say, It should be pointed out that Sugiyama is 75 years old, so he may have forgot about any NDAs he was under.
But at the same time, come on.
Obviously they're making a Dragon Quest IX at some point.
We're going to have a spin-off of Dragon Quest VIII, Dragon Quest Yangus.
