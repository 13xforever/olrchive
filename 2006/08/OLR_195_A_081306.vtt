00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
We're your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Mojo.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, August 13th, 2006. Is Squeenix going to get in the business of hardware?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Get ready for some retro Sega Genesis action.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
What is holding up the PSP download service anyway?

00:25.000 --> 00:36.360
Hello everybody out there on the internet, and welcome to another wonderful episode of

00:36.360 --> 00:37.640
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.400
We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gaming culture, and of course, video

00:42.400 --> 00:43.880
games that don't suck.

00:43.880 --> 00:47.680
But sometimes we have to talk about games that do suck, but only to tell you to avoid

00:47.680 --> 00:48.680
them.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.840
Right, fellow co-host, Dark Sakura?

00:50.840 --> 00:57.120
Yeah, Rob my fellow co-host and producer of orange lounge radio according to your voicemail

00:57.800 --> 01:00.760
Your your voicemail has the same thing. I know all right

01:01.280 --> 01:03.240
Cuz we're co producers in crime

01:03.240 --> 01:07.040
And it makes it sound important when our friends and family call us and it also makes

01:07.200 --> 01:11.520
Certain people in this room make fun of me when they leave me voicemail. I would never do such a thing

01:12.640 --> 01:14.220
Also say hello to

01:14.220 --> 01:15.220
Hi.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.220
Hi, Loki.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.220
How you doing?

01:17.220 --> 01:18.220
Good.

01:18.220 --> 01:19.220
Good.

01:19.220 --> 01:20.220
Hungry.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.220
Hungry?

01:21.220 --> 01:22.220
Why didn't you eat before the show tonight?

01:22.220 --> 01:23.220
Here's some beer nuts.

01:23.220 --> 01:24.220
I don't want nuts.

01:24.220 --> 01:25.220
You don't like nuts, do you?

01:25.220 --> 01:27.460
I don't like eating nuts.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.860
Tonight also we have some very special guests in the studio.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.960
We actually have some guests tonight who have never been on the show before.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.380
That's a rarity because usually we get the same old people, but tonight we have some

01:36.380 --> 01:37.380
guests.

01:37.380 --> 01:40.660
Our first guest tonight is coming to us all the way from Wisconsin.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.660
Say hello to Magsy.

01:41.660 --> 01:42.660
Hi.

01:42.660 --> 01:43.660
Hi, how you doing?

01:43.660 --> 01:47.700
You can put the mic a little bit closer your mouth. Hi. Hi. How you doing? I'm okay. Yeah

01:47.700 --> 01:49.700
I like your shirt. You have Mario on your shirt

01:50.380 --> 01:53.180
Right on are you a gamer girl? Yes, what kind of games you like?

01:55.300 --> 01:57.780
Don't be afraid to just get that microphone like right there by your mouth

02:00.780 --> 02:06.120
Let's see I like RPGs I like platformers I actually like anytime type of game

02:06.120 --> 02:09.120
As long as it's fun.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.120
What would you say is the best game you've played in the past year?

02:12.120 --> 02:14.120
In the past year?

02:14.120 --> 02:16.120
Animal Crossing.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.120
Oh no, it's another Jamie.

02:18.120 --> 02:23.120
Alright, say hello as well to Chris, who's here tonight as well.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
Hi.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.120
Hi, how are you doing?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.120
I'm alive.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.120
Alright.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.120
I'm also good.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.120
Alright, right on.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.120
And you also are a gamer girl?

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
I am also a gamer girl.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.120
What would you say is the best game you've played in the past year?

02:35.120 --> 02:39.640
No, I'm not addicted to animal crawl. I'd have to say Kingdom Hearts 2 because I'm

02:39.640 --> 02:47.040
just a Disney, insane Disney fan, so I like listening to Donald freak out and Mickey all

02:47.040 --> 02:49.880
ninja and cool, so that's my favorite so far.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.040
Very cool, very cool. Now, we should also point out tonight, first off, the girls outnumber

02:54.040 --> 03:00.080
the guys, which is a little strange for me, I don't know, but also we should point out

03:00.080 --> 03:03.420
Now Meg Z and Chris are actually together.

03:03.420 --> 03:07.040
So we have gaming lesbians on tonight's show.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
Oh baby.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.040
Oh yes.

03:09.040 --> 03:14.040
But no, that's great, it's a whole sexuality smorgasbord on tonight's program.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.880
We have a little bit of everything, so that's fun.

03:15.880 --> 03:16.880
Yes we do.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.880
We at Orange Lawns Radio, we're about the games, and you know, different types of people

03:21.880 --> 03:23.280
that play the games.

03:23.280 --> 03:28.000
So now, you two are the girls that hang out with Dark Sakura a lot on the weekend, right?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.400
Or at least I know you do, Chris.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.000
Megsy being from Wisconsin doesn't get to do that as much.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.200
But we hang out online a lot.

03:33.200 --> 03:33.700
Yeah.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.300
Now tell me the truth.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.700
Pillow fights? Are there ever pillow fights?

03:37.700 --> 03:41.000
No pillow fights, but we did have an orgy.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
We had a Mississippi orgy.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.500
What's a Mississippi orgy?

03:43.500 --> 03:47.100
It's when you get people in a room without their socks or shoes.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.400
It was really hot.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.200
It was hot.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.600
So wait, if I take off my socks right now, because all I have on are my socks.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.300
Oh, oh, Megsy's taking off her socks.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.400
And I'm taking off my socks.

03:57.400 --> 04:03.100
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, an orgy.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.100
This is fun.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.440
All right, let's get to the games.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.080
Of course, the guys in the room are now going, it's a lesbian show.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.720
Oh yes, how could I forget our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.360
Click on chat if you're listening to us live here on this lovely Sunday evening.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.400
And we'd love to hear your opinion.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.780
So and then of course, there we go, Jeremy Todd won OMG, they're having an orgy on the

04:23.780 --> 04:24.780
show.

04:24.780 --> 04:28.940
Tonight's going to be, it's a slow news week boys and girls. What can we say?

04:28.940 --> 04:31.620
This is the type of stuff that happens during slow news weeks is we have

04:31.620 --> 04:35.220
you know Mississippi orgies with lesbians. So this is

04:35.220 --> 04:39.020
a good time. Alright, let's take it to the games though. We always like to talk about how is your

04:39.020 --> 04:42.020
gaming week. So we'll start off with dark soccer. What types of games have you been

04:42.020 --> 04:42.820
playing this week?

04:42.820 --> 04:47.580
Well, I actually haven't played it yet because I'm waiting for

04:47.580 --> 04:51.500
Meg Z to play it on Wednesday at my house. I have Dead Rising.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.440
So, I'm gonna wait and then I'm gonna wait for her to come over to kill zombies, however

04:55.440 --> 05:00.440
Dan called me while I was on the road saying, where's Dead Rising, Will and I want to play?

05:00.440 --> 05:01.440
Okay.

05:01.440 --> 05:07.000
So anyway, I did play some Animal Crossing, I played Pinball!

05:07.000 --> 05:12.640
And I actually almost, I tried to hunt down the Saturn so I could play our Sega Ages collection

05:12.640 --> 05:17.600
that we got from the guy who was the man behind Working Designs, who Dan just bought the Twilight

05:17.600 --> 05:19.160
Zone Pinball from.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.660
He's really awesome.

05:20.660 --> 05:24.060
And Dan got me a monkey.

05:24.060 --> 05:26.060
Like a real monkey that blinks poo?

05:26.060 --> 05:27.060
A monkey ball monkey.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.060
Oh.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.060
Right on.

05:29.060 --> 05:30.060
Yeah.

05:30.060 --> 05:31.060
So I have a monkey.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.060
That's cool.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.060
Chris has a monkey too.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.060
I got her the monkey.

05:34.060 --> 05:35.060
I work at Gamestop.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.060
Oh, you work at Gamestop?

05:36.060 --> 05:37.060
I work at Gamestop.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.060
Very cool.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.060
We have Gamestop Pride in here.

05:39.060 --> 05:40.060
Gamestop Pride.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.460
Oh, we have a story about Gamestop tonight.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.460
Uh oh.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.020
It's up in part B. We'll talk about that later.

05:44.020 --> 05:45.020
Okay.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.020
Alright.

05:46.020 --> 05:47.020
Is that it for your games?

05:47.020 --> 05:49.620
Then we also played the game where we mess with people's heads

05:50.340 --> 05:58.140
But that that's yeah, that's that's a real-life game. I think all right my gimme week. I played Dead Rising. Which is like

05:59.220 --> 06:01.980
So cool. I don't know how to describe it

06:01.980 --> 06:06.700
It's so it's so great like zombie killing is love it really is I mean

06:06.700 --> 06:09.580
I knew I was in love with Dead Rising the minute

06:09.580 --> 06:14.580
I picked up the lawnmower and mowed over 70 zombies in a minute. I mean

06:14.580 --> 06:19.160
I mean, whoever thought of this concept for a game, I want to kiss you.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.060
I do, right on the lips.

06:21.060 --> 06:22.120
This is a beautiful game.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.720
More games should be like Dead Rising.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.000
Now, Dead Rising's not perfect.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.240
There are some things that need to be fixed for Dead Rising 2.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.560
One of them is that small-ass text size.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.900
I mean, it's really hard to read.

06:31.900 --> 06:34.040
Even on my HDTV, it's kind of hard to read the text.

06:34.040 --> 06:38.160
I know a lot of people have been bitching about this, but seriously, the text has got

06:38.160 --> 06:39.160
to be fixed.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.920
The graphical style of Dead Rising isn't for everybody.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.960
I let Mikoltov watch me play for a little bit, and he's like,

06:44.960 --> 06:46.000
this game looks like crap.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.280
And I said, what are you smoking?

06:47.280 --> 06:48.600
This game's beautiful.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.160
It's a different art style.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.920
It's a little bit cartoonish with the blood,

06:51.920 --> 06:53.000
but it's zombies.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.240
It's supposed to be cartoonish.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.920
And then the other thing that kind of annoys me is the

06:57.920 --> 07:00.680
saving, because you have to save in a

07:00.680 --> 07:02.680
bathroom or on a couch.

07:02.680 --> 07:03.680
And it's really weird.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.480
The first time you play, you're not ready for the fact

07:06.480 --> 07:08.840
that you're going to die, and you're going to die fast.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.600
And if you select the option that says Save and Quit, you

07:11.600 --> 07:16.760
literally start all over. So it's a little weird because the game's main

07:16.760 --> 07:20.280
mode is a 72 hour mode. It's not literally 72 hours.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.280
Loki was telling me before the show every hour is five minutes. I couldn't figure it out.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.600
I knew it was running faster than a real hour though. But the game was, you know,

07:28.600 --> 07:31.760
kind of interesting where you would start that over if you selected that. But

07:31.760 --> 07:35.800
that's kind of cool because you could power yourself up more and more and then

07:35.800 --> 07:40.520
you know start the game in that mode. So I like powered myself up to level 3

07:40.520 --> 07:43.480
And I was like you know what I'll start over because I was getting my ass kicked by zombies

07:43.980 --> 07:47.740
But other than that other than those little bitches. I love the game

07:47.740 --> 07:50.600
I mean, I love the fact that you can take pictures of zombies

07:50.840 --> 07:55.780
You can put like I thought it was so hilarious like I put those little uh what are those mega man guys call they can

07:55.780 --> 07:59.500
Never remember their names with the little yellow heads serve bots. Thank you

07:59.500 --> 08:03.520
I put the little serve bots head on a bunch of zombies then took pictures of them all walking around

08:03.520 --> 08:09.680
It's really funny, and then just getting to use all these weapons on zombie. It's a great aggression taking out game

08:09.680 --> 08:15.060
I just kind of wish from the start there was like a sandbox mode where it was more like the demo

08:15.060 --> 08:20.060
Where it just drops you into a sea of zombies with all the items around you start going like I could do this game without

08:20.060 --> 08:25.900
The story for fun and just like a party and also it would be nice if the game had multiplayer. I know

08:27.260 --> 08:32.580
Oblivion didn't have multiplayer and it's a great game. So it's not like the game has to have multiplayer, but it would be so cool

08:32.580 --> 08:35.060
I mean it would just make a cool thing even cooler. So

08:35.060 --> 08:39.580
So, Dead Rising, I do recommend Dead Rising, I think a lot of you guys would have fun with

08:39.580 --> 08:40.580
it.

08:40.580 --> 08:43.580
But just, those little minor complaints aside might frustrate you for a little bit.

08:43.580 --> 08:46.860
But then you take your aggression out on zombies with a lawnmower, and it's wonderful.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.780
And then that hook that lets you pull their heads right off, it's great.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
Sounds beautiful.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.520
Yeah, it's fun.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.520
Killing is love.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.520
Killing zombies is love.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.000
Let's see, so there's Dead Rising and then I also play more Prey, because I'm slowly

08:58.000 --> 09:02.660
but surely trying to make my way through Prey still, which is a great game because you never

09:02.660 --> 09:03.660
die.

09:03.660 --> 09:06.740
made for people who suck at first-person shooters like myself you just you'd

09:06.740 --> 09:10.580
never die you just go to little spirit world shoot some shoot some Medusa heads

09:10.580 --> 09:13.820
or whatever those things are and they come back to life it's beautiful love it

09:13.820 --> 09:22.060
Loki how was your gaming week it was okay just played more Grand Theft Auto

09:22.060 --> 09:26.760
Liberty City stories to tide me over until you know Vice City stories comes

09:26.760 --> 09:36.320
out. I kicked ass this week, so it was awesome. Played Dead Rising, not too much though, just

09:36.320 --> 09:42.000
during lunches. Got to play the lawnmower and chop zombies up at that, then pick up

09:42.000 --> 09:48.820
the lawnmower and just slam it into their head. And we also, I played Chromehounds,

09:48.820 --> 09:53.600
and yes I did play Chromehounds, and I have been on there and no one's joined our clan.

09:53.600 --> 10:00.560
person you know fire resurrected excellent but um whatever you know talk

10:00.560 --> 10:05.420
about the chrome hounds thing in a minute yes it's just I'm ready to go and

10:05.420 --> 10:11.480
just no one else wants to whatever and then was it I watched someone play a

10:11.480 --> 10:16.160
game that will not be named it was cool and creepy but we'll talk about that at

10:16.160 --> 10:21.560
another time all right Magsy Chris anything you guys want to say what kind

10:21.560 --> 10:27.420
games you've been playing this week? I played Animal Crossing on the plane. Yeah? Yeah.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.000
Did they let you though? I thought because the DS had the wireless, they don't like it

10:30.000 --> 10:33.360
when you play DS on the plane. I didn't have a problem with it. Oh, okay, that's good.

10:33.360 --> 10:38.160
And I tried to finish Kingdom Hearts 2. See, I was real smart and played it the first time

10:38.160 --> 10:45.740
around on proud mode. And I'm having a hard time beating it. Okay. And I played a really

10:45.740 --> 10:47.980
old-school arcade machine

10:47.980 --> 10:50.080
some of our brothers

10:50.080 --> 10:51.380
that was fun

10:51.380 --> 10:54.760
a big mario fan as i know she you know you have my own yes i am a big mario fan

10:54.760 --> 10:58.700
i'm looking looking forward to on some are galaxy on the we and um... super

10:58.700 --> 11:02.180
paper mario on the game now some people thought that mario on the we look kind of

11:02.180 --> 11:02.940
weird

11:02.940 --> 11:05.140
uh... is that only always looks weird

11:05.140 --> 11:08.600
uh...

11:08.600 --> 11:12.540
very cool now you know i need i need to get from the lesbian perspective

11:12.540 --> 11:16.740
Who's better, Peach or Daisy? Oh, Peach.

11:16.740 --> 11:20.740
Why Peach? Because she's hotter.

11:20.740 --> 11:24.180
I'll have you know though, whenever I play Mario Party, I always play as Peach.

11:24.180 --> 11:27.500
Because she's also got attitude. You know, she's like, Peach is the winner!

11:27.500 --> 11:30.620
That's me. I'm the winner whenever I play Mario Party.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.540
Just thought I'd share. Any games you're looking forward to coming out soon?

11:33.540 --> 11:38.220
Dirge of Cerberus. Oh, you like Vincent? I love Vincent.

11:38.220 --> 11:45.580
She actually called when she was coming down here, she had me go to the GameStop and reserve

11:45.580 --> 11:48.580
it.

11:48.580 --> 11:49.580
That's awesome.

11:49.580 --> 11:53.940
Yeah, I'm kind of with video games, like way over my head sometimes.

11:53.940 --> 11:54.940
Really?

11:54.940 --> 11:55.940
But yeah.

11:55.940 --> 11:59.700
I had it reserved at my GameStop and I realized I was going to be here and I was like, go

11:59.700 --> 12:02.580
to the GameStop and reserve it so I can get it.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.860
So you guys are going to play all night when it comes out?

12:04.860 --> 12:05.860
Oh, probably.

12:05.860 --> 12:07.260
I'm going to watch her play it.

12:07.260 --> 12:12.760
I played it a little bit, E3, but it wasn't Final Fantasy enough for me, because it's

12:12.760 --> 12:16.400
more like live action, which is cool, I know there's people that are into that more action

12:16.400 --> 12:20.780
style game, but I'll still check it out when the final game comes out and make my final

12:20.780 --> 12:22.560
decision then, but I hope you enjoy it.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.200
You know the first time I played through Final Fantasy VII and I never even got Vincent?

12:25.200 --> 12:27.800
Because I'm so stupid, I never figured out to open the safe.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.880
Well, it took me forever to figure out how to get him.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.280
I got him first time without the book.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.280
Well, look at you.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.280
Good for you.

12:36.280 --> 12:41.280
And Yuffie. Well, Yuffie's easy to get. Just because Yuffie's easy.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.280
Chris, I'm sorry. Chris, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

12:44.280 --> 12:50.280
Well, again, I'm a gamer in the old school sense, so I play D&D and stuff like that,

12:50.280 --> 12:56.280
but I do have Sims 2 on my Mac, and that kind of has me really, really addicted.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.280
So, I play a lot of that.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.280
Do you like to kill your Sims? Because I know that's what Loki does.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.280
Oh, hell yeah.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.280
What are some clever death traps you come up with for your Sims?

13:04.280 --> 13:06.280
My favorite one is

13:06.620 --> 13:11.620
stick like have them go inside the pool and then take away the option to get them out of the pool and they'll slowly die because

13:11.620 --> 13:16.060
They'll fall asleep and they'll drown and then another fun way is to put them

13:16.060 --> 13:22.560
This is actually old old Sims you put them in a room with a bunch of stoves

13:22.980 --> 13:28.380
Like we use one and then lock it like take away the door and a room would catch on fire

13:28.700 --> 13:31.000
And then they burn to death. It's really fun

13:31.000 --> 13:34.140
you know I'm screen and they scream really loud

13:34.140 --> 13:38.840
you know I had a gay friend once who made his homo palace once on the Sims

13:38.840 --> 13:41.880
and he put what's the most number seems you can have a house like a

13:41.880 --> 13:45.000
yeah 8 in this game I think you can have like 12

13:45.000 --> 13:49.320
okay one Sims one he had seven guys and it was like it was like Melrose place

13:49.320 --> 13:51.580
they would all make out with each other and have sex with each other

13:51.580 --> 13:55.560
and then there was one woman in the house but what she had to do she cleaned

13:55.560 --> 13:56.800
up after all the guys

13:56.800 --> 14:00.160
you know and she she finally died from exhaustion because they she forgot to

14:00.160 --> 14:05.320
put a bathroom in the house so she had to clean up all their pee and had to do the cooking

14:05.320 --> 14:09.680
for them and she finally died of exhaustion and like you know it's so funny because she

14:09.680 --> 14:13.200
passes out in the middle of the room and the guys don't care they're still making out with

14:13.200 --> 14:17.200
each other and stuff they're like oh she just died it's really funny if you have them on

14:17.200 --> 14:21.420
um I made the mistake of having put them on freestyle like they can pretty much if you're

14:21.420 --> 14:24.760
not paying attention they'll do whatever the heck they want and like four or five of my

14:24.760 --> 14:27.840
sims who weren't supposed to go make out with each other went and made out with each other

14:27.840 --> 14:31.520
because they've in the second game they've got like chemistry like

14:31.520 --> 14:35.040
lightning connection chemistry and they just ended up making out and then

14:35.040 --> 14:37.840
getting pissed at each other because they watched the person they just made

14:37.840 --> 14:45.520
out make out with somebody else hmm so it's drama more Melrose place oh yeah that's

14:45.520 --> 14:48.040
some of the fun stuff to do with the sims oh I think that's why I came so

14:48.040 --> 14:51.940
popular find my sims 2 disc cuz I miss playing it can you play that online no I

14:51.940 --> 14:55.920
guess you can't because they had the sims online huh it's kind of moot anyway

14:55.920 --> 14:59.760
because my DVD drive on my PC is busted so I'll have to get the Mac one anyway

14:59.760 --> 15:05.880
because I'm getting my iMac soon let's see I'm reading chat room some other

15:05.880 --> 15:10.560
folks are sharing their Sims stories here poo eater says I had made a house

15:10.560 --> 15:14.600
with each sim in their own room with only one thing like one would have a TV

15:14.600 --> 15:17.820
one would have a fridge one would have a toilet then enjoy the show so they have

15:17.820 --> 15:20.400
to go to each other's houses to borrow things I guess that's kind of

15:20.400 --> 15:25.880
interesting and PK Akira 88 is clearing up the DS thing on the plane for me

15:25.880 --> 15:29.580
saying unless it's during takeoff and landing it really doesn't matter yeah

15:29.580 --> 15:32.480
because they make you even make you turn off everything during takeoff and

15:32.480 --> 15:35.640
landing you know I fly enough I should know that but I just never for some

15:35.640 --> 15:40.440
reason I never bring my DS I do a lot of short flights I had my iPod and and

15:40.440 --> 15:44.540
during takeoff and landing and they didn't seem to care really yeah well they

15:44.540 --> 15:49.140
Either they didn't seem, the plane didn't crash, so.

15:49.140 --> 15:54.980
Did you fly during all the chaos that was going on recently?

15:54.980 --> 15:57.940
No, I actually totally missed all the chaos.

15:57.940 --> 15:58.940
Oh good.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.780
I'm just recently hearing a little bit about what's been happening.

16:01.780 --> 16:02.780
Yeah.

16:02.780 --> 16:08.700
Oh, there was a, not that we're getting into CNN podcasts, but this was basically, there

16:08.700 --> 16:12.820
was a big terrorist plot that was thwarted that had to do with liquid explosives, so

16:12.820 --> 16:15.080
So now, people can't bring liquids on planes right now

16:15.080 --> 16:16.880
at all, like gels, liquids, anything.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.200
That could be like toothpaste, soda, anything.

16:19.200 --> 16:19.700
Really?

16:19.700 --> 16:20.360
Isn't that weird?

16:20.360 --> 16:20.960
Yeah.

16:20.960 --> 16:23.160
They should ban all Taco Bell from the plane

16:23.160 --> 16:26.480
because that causes some liquid explicit.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.920
You're disgusting.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.280
Absolutely disgusting.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.120
All right, before we get into tonight's program,

16:33.120 --> 16:35.240
we have some housekeeping to take care of.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.640
First off, I want to point out on our website, www.orangelaunchrater.com,

16:39.640 --> 16:43.240
we have brand new forums dedicated to the O.L. Army.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.200
The O.L. Army concept, which is basically,

16:46.200 --> 16:48.540
really the people don't have to listen to this program,

16:48.540 --> 16:50.960
but it helps if you're an Orange Lounge Radio fan.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.040
The cardinal rule of the O.L. Army is don't be a dick.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.760
We just want to have fun playing the games

16:55.760 --> 16:59.440
without any of that attitude or drama or smack talking,

16:59.440 --> 17:03.080
unless you're smack talking Bobby Black Wolf, then it's fine.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.040
We want to have a drama-free environment there.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.680
So we made a whole new forum over there

17:07.680 --> 17:10.540
on OrangeLoungeRadio.com for folks to start clans and games.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.240
It's been working out pretty well so far.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.680
We have folks in Halo 2, and a couple of folks in Guild Wars,

17:15.680 --> 17:18.140
and I noticed the Steam games are getting a lot of folks.

17:18.140 --> 17:21.180
So check that out over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.680
One thing, however, we haven't been

17:22.680 --> 17:25.220
getting a lot of participation in, as Loki mentioned earlier,

17:25.220 --> 17:26.420
is ChromeHounds.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.020
Now, here's the problem.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.980
OrangeLoungeRadio somehow got talked

17:29.980 --> 17:33.900
into doing a tournament on August 20th for ChromeHounds.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.980
And we've talked a little bit of smack

17:35.980 --> 17:37.220
leading up to this tournament.

17:37.220 --> 17:43.420
No one has consulted me on anything in this, they nominated me to play this damn game for

17:43.420 --> 17:47.500
one and it's hard enough when there's freaking Dead Rising coming out because that game is

17:47.500 --> 17:52.000
very distracting especially when chrome hounds they move really slow there's no zombies in

17:52.000 --> 17:57.440
it you know that kind of thing then then for some reason somehow no rules were discussed

17:57.440 --> 18:02.040
at all no ground rules just somebody decided okay it's gonna be four on four teams and

18:02.040 --> 18:06.980
stuff I never agreed to any of that I'll take them on one-on-one I'll beat his ass one-on-one

18:06.980 --> 18:11.120
But you know what, if you're gonna get your fucking gamer friends who play all the time,

18:11.120 --> 18:12.120
fuck that shit.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.320
I will take you on one-on-one.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.920
That is the way it's going down.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.360
Well, okay, somehow we're suckered into this 4-on-4 thing, but the problem is we only have

18:18.360 --> 18:20.680
two other people so far who said they'd do it.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.760
So we need more people to do this.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.400
So please, if you're a ChromeHounds player, you want to have a little fun on Sunday about

18:26.400 --> 18:30.680
one o'clock Pacific time, please come and tour our forums and say you would like to

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
participate.

18:31.680 --> 18:36.480
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to figure out how to get in there and I'll play as Mr. Spanky

18:36.480 --> 18:39.800
in the ChromeHounds Invitational and that's gonna be kinda

18:39.800 --> 18:43.700
sad because we're really gonna get our butts kicked. First we'll get our butts kicked by

18:43.700 --> 18:44.240
Bobby

18:44.240 --> 18:47.860
then we'll get our butts kicked by Scott. We'll come in last place in the tournament and never hear the

18:47.860 --> 18:48.300
end of it.

18:48.300 --> 18:52.580
But I do seem to recall by agreeing to this I did say we get to pick the next

18:52.580 --> 18:53.060
game.

18:53.060 --> 18:58.220
So gamer Andy better start working out to DDR because he's going down.

18:58.220 --> 19:02.260
Here's the bad thing about ChromeHounds

19:02.260 --> 19:06.480
First off, you have to be online in order for people to sign up for your clan, which

19:06.480 --> 19:08.680
is retarded anyways.

19:08.680 --> 19:13.400
Because what's the point of having that, you know, clan password thing if...

19:13.400 --> 19:14.400
I don't get it.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.480
Because you have to prove them anyways, so that's kind of retarded.

19:17.480 --> 19:21.320
We'll figure something out, so please O.L. Army, save us, and so we don't embarrass ourselves

19:21.320 --> 19:22.480
too bad one week from today.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.240
I'm not going to embarrass myself, I'm just saying, you know, that's kind of fucked up.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.480
Look, you can take them all on.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.840
Oh yeah, let me just take them all on while they're attacking my base and shit, and I

19:30.840 --> 19:32.840
I got a I can't be

19:32.840 --> 19:39.300
Okay, blaze does have a good point hit stun from the ol army has already owned black wolf and Tetris

19:39.420 --> 19:44.380
So if we lose miserably at this at least it'll be evened up so there can't be a lot of shit talking

19:44.980 --> 19:48.820
Fine, I'll do my best. There we go. What I can't speak for the rest of them. There you go

19:49.660 --> 19:53.140
All right. I won't be getting my ass handed to me. So please chrome hound players

19:53.260 --> 19:58.420
We need your help come to the ol army forums immediately one other piece of housekeeping

19:58.420 --> 20:01.440
keeping I want to get out there is that we actually have an addendum to a

20:01.440 --> 20:05.200
previously reported on story. You know we here at Orange Launch Radio we try to

20:05.200 --> 20:09.120
report accurate information but once in a while something's gonna slip through

20:09.120 --> 20:14.080
the cracks that maybe wasn't correct oops but this is interesting because not

20:14.080 --> 20:18.360
a lot of people know that this is not correct but we've received a trusted

20:18.360 --> 20:22.640
anonymous tip so I can't tell you who it's from but it's a trusted source and

20:22.640 --> 20:26.560
they're telling us that that song list we announced a couple shows back to

20:26.560 --> 20:31.880
elite beat agents that's run on a lot of sites is wrong so that might actually be

20:31.880 --> 20:34.840
good news for some people so folks that were a little disappointed at some of

20:34.840 --> 20:37.040
the pick like didn't they have like Linkin Park and stuff in that list

20:37.040 --> 20:41.160
whatever store what yeah which is kind of cool that you know Weird Al would

20:41.160 --> 20:45.560
have been okay with but we have received a tip that that is absolutely wrong and

20:45.560 --> 20:50.560
that only the demo songs are ones you can count on actually seeing in the full

20:50.560 --> 20:53.920
version which would make sense but as for the rest of the song list you'll

20:53.920 --> 20:55.700
You'll just have to wait and see.

20:55.700 --> 21:01.800
And also the last housekeeping thing, of course, we upped our cap on listeners.

21:01.800 --> 21:07.960
So yeah, instead of capping out at 50 or whatever, we've got a lot more than that.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.920
So now you can listen without worrying about not being able to.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.840
Yeah, so please come listen live to us on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard

21:16.840 --> 21:18.200
Time on OrangeOnTrader.com.

21:18.200 --> 21:22.260
You shouldn't get locked out of the feed anymore because we have plenty of room now.

21:22.260 --> 21:25.180
But of course, if you can't do it Sunday nights because you're watching, I don't know, what's

21:25.180 --> 21:26.180
on Sunday nights?

21:26.180 --> 21:27.180
Touched by an Angel or whatever?

21:27.180 --> 21:28.180
Desperate Housewives.

21:28.180 --> 21:29.180
Oh, Desperate Housewives.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.180
Well, all those shows suck.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.180
So if you...

21:31.180 --> 21:32.180
No, it does not.

21:32.180 --> 21:33.180
Buy a TiVo.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.180
Buy a TiVo.

21:34.180 --> 21:39.500
So if you can't listen to us, let's say, okay, Megsy's making pouty faces at me.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.500
I can't get pouty faces.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.500
I like Grey's Anatomy.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
Do you?

21:42.500 --> 21:43.500
Yeah.

21:43.500 --> 21:44.500
Isn't it just a bunch of doctors having sex with each other or something?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.500
Pretty much.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
I like Desperate Housewives.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
That's pretty funny.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.500
That does sound pretty hot.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.500
So Desperate Housewives is a pretty hot show.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.500
I have seen a little bit of it.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.740
It's pretty hot.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.940
But anyway, if you have to watch your Desperate Housewives,

21:54.940 --> 21:57.340
your Grey's Anatomy, you don't have a TiVo.

21:57.340 --> 22:00.740
You could always listen to the All Games Re broadcast, which

22:00.740 --> 22:03.620
is Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time,

22:03.620 --> 22:06.780
also a little bit earlier for you east coast folks.

22:06.780 --> 22:07.780
And central.

22:07.780 --> 22:11.340
And central, like Wisconsin, if you want to listen to it live.

22:11.340 --> 22:13.940
But of course, podcast is love.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.540
And we know there's lots of you guys

22:15.540 --> 22:17.020
that listen to us on the podcast feed.

22:17.020 --> 22:18.600
And for that, we're most appreciative.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.420
Thanks a bunch.

22:19.420 --> 22:23.480
Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news now, and we're gonna start it off tonight

22:23.480 --> 22:27.780
with a story about the Wii, and I might be in trouble for that previous bet I made about

22:27.780 --> 22:29.940
how there's not gonna be 20 games at Wii launch.

22:29.940 --> 22:34.540
Well, it doesn't look like there's gonna be 20 first-party Wii games, so I'm gonna have

22:34.540 --> 22:39.140
to go back and listen to the bet for sure, but it does look like there are gonna be 27

22:39.140 --> 22:45.260
Wii games that are released on the day the Wii is out, which of course is still unknown,

22:45.260 --> 22:47.540
but we do have 27 confirmed titles.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.220
Loki seems to think it's gonna be more than 27.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.420
I think it's more than that.

22:50.420 --> 22:51.060
Really?

22:51.060 --> 22:53.300
Yeah, because I know some that aren't even on that list.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.220
Do you want me to read this list real quick for you guys?

22:55.220 --> 22:56.180
All right, here we go.

22:56.180 --> 22:59.900
We have Avatar, The Last Airbender, Blazing Angels,

22:59.900 --> 23:03.820
Blitz, The League, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z,

23:03.820 --> 23:07.900
Budokai Tenkashi 2, Dragon Quest,

23:07.900 --> 23:10.300
Swords, The Masked Queen, and the Tower of Mirrors,

23:10.300 --> 23:14.460
Elibits, Excite Truck, Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Final Fantasy

23:14.460 --> 23:17.420
Crystal Chronicles, The Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess,

23:17.420 --> 23:23.940
Madden NFL 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Metal Slug Anthology, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption,

23:23.940 --> 23:29.820
Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season, Rayman Raving Rabbids,

23:29.820 --> 23:34.420
Red Steel, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball Banana

23:34.420 --> 23:40.220
Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.

23:40.220 --> 23:44.420
So now I ask you folks in studio, if you had to buy two of those games from that list,

23:44.420 --> 23:47.780
have enough money to buy two of the games, which two are you getting at launch?

23:47.780 --> 23:48.780
Loki?

23:48.780 --> 23:51.020
Um, I've already got him on order.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.940
Red Steel and...

23:53.940 --> 23:55.740
You know, to be honest, there's actually...

23:55.740 --> 23:56.740
Did you mention GT?

23:56.740 --> 23:57.740
Yes.

23:57.740 --> 23:58.740
GT Pro Series.

23:58.740 --> 24:02.260
Uh, GT actually looks pretty good, so, uh, Red Steel and GT.

24:02.260 --> 24:03.260
Alright.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.260
Uh, Dark Sakura.

24:04.260 --> 24:05.260
You don't know?

24:05.260 --> 24:06.260
Okay.

24:06.260 --> 24:07.260
Anybody...

24:07.260 --> 24:08.260
Uh, do our other girls know?

24:08.260 --> 24:09.260
Magsy, which two are you gonna get?

24:09.260 --> 24:13.500
Um, I am number one Nintendo fangirl in the world, so I'll be getting Zelda.

24:13.500 --> 24:18.140
And then, uh, for the second one, um, Red Steel, I think.

24:18.140 --> 24:19.760
Red Steel, you like swords? You like ninjas?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.400
Uh, yeah. I just looked it over. Yeah.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.100
Uh, Dark Sakura, you think you know?

24:24.100 --> 24:28.200
Yeah, I'm gonna get, um, Zelda and, uh, Metal Slug Anthology.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.720
Mmm.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.820
Chris, do you think you know which two you'd get?

24:31.820 --> 24:34.380
Uh, probably Zelda and...

24:34.380 --> 24:35.580
Cars.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.280
Hahahaha!

24:37.280 --> 24:39.160
You dork. Uh, hahaha!

24:39.160 --> 24:41.580
I would- I can tell you right n- well...

24:41.580 --> 24:46.000
Alright, oh, which two would I get? Oh, I'm so glad you asked. I would get...

24:46.000 --> 24:48.240
I'm gonna get, I'm actually...

24:48.240 --> 24:52.160
I'm gonna get three.

24:52.160 --> 24:58.040
No, I know, but in real life I'm gonna get three. Okay, but which two? I would say...

24:58.040 --> 25:01.860
I'm gonna say Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Excite Truck.

25:01.860 --> 25:05.320
And I don't know why I'm... I don't know why I'm leaving out Zelda, but I'm

25:05.320 --> 25:06.200
gonna borrow yours.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.720
Yeah, you're gonna... We can trade.

25:09.720 --> 25:14.040
I come into your house and play in your Zelda. If we all get two then we can all

25:14.040 --> 25:17.400
we can all play with each other. That's right, there we go. We'll play with each other.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.680
Well, there's a couple things missing. First off, I mean, where's Super Mario Galaxy?

25:21.680 --> 25:25.480
I noticed, but didn't Miyamoto say a while back that it may not be

25:25.480 --> 25:28.840
exactly ready at launch? It'll be in the launch window and that's what these are anyways.

25:28.840 --> 25:33.960
There's also a few that I mentioned a couple weeks ago, Rapala Trophies, which

25:33.960 --> 25:36.080
is supposed to be coming out for your fishing

25:36.080 --> 25:41.860
fans, I guess. And there was also a couple that I'm mentioning this week that aren't

25:41.860 --> 25:47.840
on that list, and they're part of Midway's lineup. And of course, Midway, we announced

25:47.840 --> 25:52.800
weeks ago, Rampage Soul Destruction, now everybody's finally picked up on that. Two more that are

25:52.800 --> 25:58.700
going to be added, they're Happy Feet, which is based on that really crappy movie that's

25:58.700 --> 25:59.700
coming out.

25:59.700 --> 26:00.700
I've got Happy Feet.

26:00.700 --> 26:01.700
I want to see that.

26:01.700 --> 26:02.700
Any Happy Feet?

26:02.700 --> 26:07.940
Can I take the controllers to my feet and then do tap dancing?

26:07.940 --> 26:08.940
That'll be fun.

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
I don't know.

26:09.940 --> 26:13.220
But then also the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy are going to be getting in the game

26:13.220 --> 26:14.780
as well.

26:14.780 --> 26:18.800
So those are going to be two coming from Midway, and there's a lot more.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.020
They're announcing seven at Let's Big in a couple weeks here.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.020
Oh, that's true.

26:24.020 --> 26:26.460
So that's definitely not the fullest.

26:26.460 --> 26:30.740
Now, Funny Dale says he's going to get a Barbie's Horse Adventure for the Wii when it comes

26:30.740 --> 26:31.740
out.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.240
Is that a launch game or no? I don't think they even announced

26:35.320 --> 26:37.520
Well, hopefully that would be fun with the Wii

26:38.520 --> 26:40.520
All right

26:40.800 --> 26:45.040
Anyway, that's all I have to say on the Wii. Well the Wii yeah, you know go Wii

26:45.160 --> 26:50.560
But anyways a few things that were you know, definitely speculating besides the launch date

26:51.240 --> 26:55.640
IGN's got speculation on the release date and the price point for it

26:55.640 --> 27:01.400
Oh, hooray, more release date and price speculation, just what this show needed, because I was

27:01.400 --> 27:07.360
just thinking this week, gosh, we really haven't had a story on release date or price point

27:07.360 --> 27:11.260
speculation in the past week, so we really need one tonight.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.260
Thank you, Loki.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.820
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

27:13.820 --> 27:14.820
You're welcome.

27:14.820 --> 27:20.720
And, of course, their speculation is November 2nd or November 12th, because apparently their

27:20.720 --> 27:25.180
sources can't make up their minds on which it is.

27:25.180 --> 27:28.780
probably because no one knows yet because they've given them a, you know, have your

27:28.780 --> 27:33.680
games ready by, you know, this time period and then we'll, you know, announce the date

27:33.680 --> 27:37.220
then. I mean, they don't have to launch with the third party games, I mean, because if

27:37.220 --> 27:41.580
they come a few weeks later it's not going to matter. Then the price point they've announced,

27:41.580 --> 27:47.560
they said $229 is going to be the price point and that, well, I don't know where they pulled

27:47.560 --> 27:48.560
that out of.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.840
How about their ass?

27:50.840 --> 27:57.400
You know, I think that every, I think that I have heard every single date in the fourth

27:57.400 --> 28:02.720
quarter, uh, guessed for the, for the Wii launch at work because I work at GameStop.

28:02.720 --> 28:08.520
I think that everybody's guessed every single date for Wii launch, like, it's gonna be sometime

28:08.520 --> 28:10.320
in fourth quarter.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.160
Folks, I have a big world exclusive for you guys.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.160
Wii here at Orange Launch Radio, we are absolutely confident we know the release date of the

28:18.160 --> 28:22.100
Wii, and I'm going to give it to you. We have inside sources that have told us the actual

28:22.100 --> 28:32.880
release date of the Wii, so here it is. The Wii will be released soon. And when it comes

28:32.880 --> 28:40.380
out soon, then you can say, I heard that first on Orange Lounge Radio, and they were right,

28:40.380 --> 28:44.120
right on Orange Lounge Radio for guessing the release date of the Wii. It was indeed

28:44.120 --> 28:50.960
soon. Well, I'm actually saying, I'm still sticking with October 18th, just because it's

28:50.960 --> 28:55.800
the anniversary. And, you know, but people say, oh, they don't release their systems

28:55.800 --> 29:00.980
on Wednesdays, they release them on Sundays. Who gives a fuck? Okay, honestly, I mean,

29:00.980 --> 29:05.400
they can do whatever they want, they're Nintendo. They can say, you know what, bitches, we decided

29:05.400 --> 29:09.100
to release our game, we're gonna release it on Wednesday because, you know what, fuck

29:09.100 --> 29:13.100
It's not just a W, it's WE. And our new mascot is Wario.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.100
Waluigi.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
It's WE Wednesdays.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.100
Yeah, Waluigi is a pun.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.100
I don't know.

29:21.100 --> 29:25.100
And demonstrating the WE live on stage will be Giggling Lesbians.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.100
Let's hear it. Yay!

29:27.100 --> 29:29.100
I have to explain this. Waluigi is a pun.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.100
I thought Wario was a pun.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.100
It sort of is, but Waluigi is.

29:33.100 --> 29:37.100
It would be sort of Wariweed, which is bad.

29:37.100 --> 29:41.100
Yeah, that's why I thought that Wario was the same thing, they're both the same.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
Last night!

29:43.100 --> 29:47.100
Okay, no responding to things that aren't said in mics.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.100
Sorry.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.100
Because now they think it's something dirty that you're responding to.

29:51.100 --> 29:57.100
And I'm trying, we got an explicit tag last week, so I'm trying to avoid it this week, please.

29:57.100 --> 29:59.100
Oh, that's not even going to happen.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.100
The lesbians are keeping it pretty clean tonight.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.100
They left the pillows at home, so I'm pretty excited.

30:04.100 --> 30:06.100
We can wrap it for you.

30:06.100 --> 30:11.500
maybe maybe during the afterbirth we'll see all right let's uh let's keep it

30:11.500 --> 30:19.300
moving speaking of Wario and Waluigi and the beautiful cast of the various Mario

30:19.300 --> 30:26.660
games there is going to be a Mario Strikers sequel on the Wii and we have a

30:26.660 --> 30:34.700
Happy Megsy. Are you a fan of Mario Strikers? I loved Mario Strikers as a rule I'm not a

30:34.700 --> 30:40.020
big fan of sports games unless they have the word Mario in the title, but I really, really

30:40.020 --> 30:42.340
enjoyed Mario Strikers.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.700
Do you think you'll like Wii Sports, though, because of Miyamoto's giant head as one of

30:45.700 --> 30:47.820
the characters?

30:47.820 --> 30:49.220
I really don't know.

30:49.220 --> 30:53.720
I mean, I'm hoping that it'll be fun just because it's on the Wii and you actually get

30:53.720 --> 30:58.420
to, like, do stuff as opposed to just pushing a button on a remote control and then whoever

30:58.420 --> 31:00.460
throws the football.

31:00.460 --> 31:05.260
video of me on YouTube that somebody took of playing Wii Sports and I look

31:05.260 --> 31:08.660
like I'm not having any fun at all like it's the most depressing but I really

31:08.660 --> 31:11.660
enjoyed the game and I was just exhausted from the day oh hi new story

31:11.660 --> 31:27.000
sorry yes Rob dear God I don't worship you but I do adore you story sorry okay

31:27.000 --> 31:32.480
Yeah, so um they actually were saying that Super Mario Strikers was supposed to the sequel is supposed to be one of the games

31:32.480 --> 31:35.420
It was announced at the games convention in Germany

31:36.040 --> 31:40.340
And this speculation is going to be like a you know an online multiplayer strikers

31:40.840 --> 31:45.400
So that sounds like it's a pretty good deal, and now I'm done Rob. You can interrupt me

31:45.400 --> 31:51.240
Well, I was gonna say this from Chad is that Ari Masson of the oil army thinks he has the new marketing campaign

31:51.240 --> 31:58.160
for the Nintendo Wii. So here's this giant enemy lesbian and you attack

31:58.160 --> 32:02.640
its weak point for massive pleasure. Massive pleasure because it's a lesbian.

32:02.640 --> 32:12.200
I love our chat room. Hugs and kisses to the OLR chat. I will check out

32:12.200 --> 32:16.240
Super Mario Strikers on the Wii. It would be fun, I bet. You gonna check out mine?

32:16.240 --> 32:17.560
Why not?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.920
Because it's stupid.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.080
The original game was stupid, and this one

32:22.080 --> 32:23.680
will be equally as stupid.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.800
Maisie's going to punch you.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.120
All right, how about a Squeenix story

32:29.120 --> 32:32.160
to break up the hate a little bit here in the room?

32:32.160 --> 32:34.760
Squeenix are what we like to call Square Enix.

32:34.760 --> 32:38.520
We call them Squeenix because a lot of their games make us Sque.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.280
And what's going on there is that Yoichi Wada, who

32:42.280 --> 32:44.800
is the president of Square, spoke recently

32:44.800 --> 32:48.320
about what game creators need to do for next-gen platforms and how developers

32:48.320 --> 32:49.640
will have to work together

32:49.640 --> 32:52.840
to move the industry forward. There's a quote here,

32:52.840 --> 32:57.040
this is one of the reasons Square Enix will collaborate with Taito, a company

32:57.040 --> 32:57.760
that produces

32:57.760 --> 33:02.280
physical hardware, he said. In our talks with Taito, ideas for an actual physical

33:02.280 --> 33:03.400
product have come up.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.320
In any case, we will be releasing some thing. It's interesting

33:07.320 --> 33:10.920
in that it's not the sort of thing you would expect from Square Enix.

33:10.920 --> 33:14.360
So they're talking about releasing a thing.

33:14.360 --> 33:20.240
Like a hardware thing and I'm not talking about that sword from Dragon Quest back

33:20.240 --> 33:22.880
Yeah, is this game console? What is this?

33:23.400 --> 33:30.520
It's gonna be a games a game that does not have the word final or fantasy and it's a trans vibrator

33:31.920 --> 33:38.240
No, what do you do you think maybe it's a I think maybe something they might do is maybe a dedicated

33:38.360 --> 33:43.480
Like you remember those old like Game & Watch type games like maybe something like that, but a little more souped up, but a square

33:43.480 --> 33:48.720
franchise or product maybe something like a game a standalone game plug-and-play

33:48.720 --> 33:53.920
type whatever it is I'm sure it's gonna be another sequel to Final Fantasy 7 do

33:53.920 --> 34:01.040
you think it's a console no no too crowded too crowded and now you just

34:01.040 --> 34:03.720
don't see Square Enix getting into console although you know in Japan they

34:03.720 --> 34:08.120
might do really well with the console now it's going to be a Final Fantasy 7

34:08.120 --> 34:10.120
and then U.V. hits puberty or something.

34:10.120 --> 34:12.120
Alright, alright.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.120
It's gonna be okay.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.120
I like Meg's idea.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.120
It's gonna have Aerith as a zombie,

34:18.120 --> 34:20.120
and you have to go around and shoot her.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.120
Again and again and again.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.120
And she keeps coming back.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.120
And you just keep killing her.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.120
She's the holy zombie.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.120
Fire Resurrected sent me a private message,

34:30.120 --> 34:32.120
and of course I read those publicly.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.120
I'm not encouraging you to send me private messages, please.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.120
I get inundated with them during the show,

34:36.120 --> 34:37.220
I thought this comment was good.

34:37.220 --> 34:39.500
Squeenix is releasing an arcade machine.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.340
Taito makes arcade machines.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.300
That's a good thought.

34:43.300 --> 34:46.020
What, we have Puzzle Bobble featuring Cloud?

34:46.020 --> 34:47.740
I like this idea from Fire Bulma.

34:47.740 --> 34:49.020
I loved Urgeyes.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.460
How about Urgeyes in the arcades?

34:50.460 --> 34:51.860
Or Final Fantasy.

34:51.860 --> 34:53.580
So it was an arcade game first.

34:53.580 --> 34:59.940
Final Fantasy 13 versus in the arcades.

34:59.940 --> 35:00.460
OK, OK.

35:00.460 --> 35:02.100
I used to go play at the bowling alley.

35:02.100 --> 35:02.900
I used to play DDR.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.980
They had an Urgeyes machine there in a virtual lawn.

35:04.980 --> 35:08.660
I live there.

35:08.660 --> 35:14.340
Anyways, speaking of stuff, I don't know, it's kind of funny.

35:14.340 --> 35:18.260
There's another person out there making something very interesting.

35:18.260 --> 35:21.740
So apparently some fan on the internet decided they want their Madden

35:21.740 --> 35:22.420
holiday

35:22.420 --> 35:27.460
to be coming a little bit early. So they've put out this fake Madden coupon.

35:27.460 --> 35:31.700
The preferred customer coupon that's basically supposed to get you the game

35:31.700 --> 35:35.900
when they get it, which is, you know, most of the retail stores are getting it a week

35:35.900 --> 35:42.300
early, so that they can get it before street date, and it's hilarious because, okay, we

35:42.300 --> 35:47.580
got this email first from EA, so they're very aware of it, and they've made all the retail

35:47.580 --> 35:52.340
chains very aware of this, so it's not gonna work, and you're an idiot.

35:52.340 --> 35:57.420
You know what, I have to, so somebody made a fake coupon that says you get Madden early

35:57.420 --> 35:58.420
because you're special.

35:58.420 --> 36:04.180
preferred customer early release voucher says xbox 360 xbox playstation 2 and gamecube versions

36:04.180 --> 36:10.760
available at all at participating stores only it says basically entitles you um to getting

36:10.760 --> 36:11.760
the game

36:11.760 --> 36:12.760
i think

36:12.760 --> 36:13.760
there's the keyword

36:13.760 --> 36:14.760
dude you sit down

36:14.760 --> 36:16.480
no i don't yeah you went wait sorry

36:16.480 --> 36:18.080
participating stores only

36:18.080 --> 36:20.520
some you know what i

36:20.520 --> 36:22.800
you still have to participate

36:22.800 --> 36:27.520
i still think there's gonna be some employee at a walmart target kmart type store that's

36:27.520 --> 36:31.540
gonna fall for this or GameStop says maybe. Okay fine they'll go ahead and scan in said

36:31.540 --> 36:37.540
coupon or not you know of it. They don't have to sell it to this guy. I mean but it's whatever

36:37.540 --> 36:43.460
I mean fine. Go ahead and try to get your free Madden game early. It's Madden come on

36:43.460 --> 36:48.940
it's not that different from last year so if you're really in a hurry to get it go right

36:48.940 --> 36:52.180
ahead. Actually my understanding is the Madden fans were pretty disappointed with Madden

36:52.180 --> 36:56.960
06 on the 360 so they're really looking forward to Madden 07. Yeah because something else

36:56.960 --> 37:04.080
is better than something crappy I guess whatever but alright good luck oh and by the way it

37:04.080 --> 37:11.460
says they forgot to run the coupon through spell checker because they you know misspelled

37:11.460 --> 37:20.140
include its includes good job good job forgers speaking of EA and upcoming releases spore

37:20.140 --> 37:26.660
you might need a coupon to get this early because apparently 2007 and we're not talking

37:26.660 --> 37:31.820
early 2007 but more like this excuse me I got the hiccup suddenly the second

37:31.820 --> 37:36.540
half of 2007 is when you're going to be getting spore this game seems to be

37:36.540 --> 37:39.340
getting pushed back and back I originally remember this is going to be

37:39.340 --> 37:46.020
late 2006 but now it looks like February or mid-2007 at least online game

37:46.020 --> 37:51.420
retailers gamestop.com and EBgames.com have that list. Will Wright seemed to

37:51.420 --> 37:55.980
say that it's not going to make it until July 2007 quote we're saying the second

37:55.980 --> 38:01.140
half of next year 2007 for now wow so this game is really getting pushed back

38:01.140 --> 38:07.740
but if the game looks like a ditty this game is epic it's like Sims times five I

38:07.740 --> 38:11.980
mean it's it's just freaking huge this game it will be it's gonna be something

38:11.980 --> 38:15.540
else if for nothing else than to throw aliens from your tractor beam in the

38:15.540 --> 38:20.300
ship that was a lot of fun but we do know some games that will be coming out

38:20.300 --> 38:23.780
and just and I'll go ahead and make this mention now since I'm not gonna be on

38:23.780 --> 38:28.220
the show next week. I'm going to go ahead and do the next two weeks of European

38:28.220 --> 38:31.140
release dates. How's that sound? Especially since there's all of crap

38:31.140 --> 38:39.220
coming out this week. On the 18th we have Pathologic, Premier Manager 2006-2007,

38:39.220 --> 38:46.180
ProShirt Golf blah blah blah, Specnaz, Project Wolf, Spinout on PSP. On the 23rd

38:46.180 --> 38:50.400
we have Texas Hold'em, 25th a bunch of good stuff, Dig Dug, Digging Strike, El

38:50.400 --> 38:56.560
El Matador, Madden 2007, Yay, Para World, and Reservoir Dogs.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.560
And also Syphon Filter Dark Mirror, and World War 1 Aces of the Sky.

39:00.560 --> 39:03.520
These are all European releases.

39:03.520 --> 39:05.840
Excellent.

39:05.840 --> 39:10.360
As far as releases go for this week, it's definitely going to be a lot better than last

39:10.360 --> 39:12.360
week, but not by much.

39:12.360 --> 39:17.720
You've got Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service on the Playstation 2, of course 99 Nights

39:17.720 --> 39:21.640
on the Xbox 360.

39:21.640 --> 39:26.260
I'm excited about that one. On the DS you're getting Deep Labyrinth from Atlas

39:26.260 --> 39:27.880
and Freedom Wings

39:27.880 --> 39:32.000
which is kind of like a, almost like a pilot wings shooter type game. Sounds like

39:32.000 --> 39:35.800
something I'd find in the women's sanitation aisle at the store or sanitary

39:35.800 --> 39:37.800
things.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.500
Let's see here.

39:39.500 --> 39:45.440
The ever-generic World Racing 2 on the Xbox and Zonide on the Xbox which is

39:45.440 --> 39:51.080
good for those Hikaruuka fans out there. Of course next week we have Madden NFL 07 coming

39:51.080 --> 39:58.080
out as well as Pac-Man World Rally and doing a re-release of Zoo and Zookeeper on DS. Why?

39:59.300 --> 40:04.960
I don't know why. You can play Zookeeper online, it's called Bejeweled. And Rapala trophies

40:04.960 --> 40:11.960
on the PSP. But while I'm talking, I figured I would go over all those release dates that

40:11.960 --> 40:17.060
all those release dates that seem to make the press headlines, you know, later on that

40:17.060 --> 40:21.520
we've always mentioned, but for some reason, you know, get people else, you know, pay attention

40:21.520 --> 40:27.600
to other places. But, let's go on to the PSP Oblivion, which we have coming out on March

40:27.600 --> 40:34.320
15th, so that'll be coming. Definitely have a SKU for it. Of course, some of the other

40:34.320 --> 40:40.360
ones I thought were interesting, Bioshock and Darkness are both coming out on April

40:40.360 --> 40:47.360
5th, so check those out. And then some of my favorites of course would be the Konami

40:47.720 --> 40:52.160
Games and I'm sure you're going to hear more of this coming pretty soon, but DDR

40:52.160 --> 40:58.320
Universe is scheduled for December 2nd, so that should be pretty good. And Karaoke Revolution

40:58.320 --> 41:02.000
American Idol. That's a big pushback for Universe, isn't it? Because I remember Universe

41:02.000 --> 41:06.900
was originally scheduled earlier. And Karaoke Revolution American Idol is going to be coming

41:06.900 --> 41:10.680
out looks like December 6th.

41:10.680 --> 41:15.000
Also Ultramix 4, that's going to be coming out November 15th and what's really interesting

41:15.000 --> 41:19.920
about it is the price for the actual game by itself, only $29.99.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.720
So that's pretty good.

41:21.720 --> 41:26.600
Another thing I was going to mention because we're going to be talking about game prices

41:26.600 --> 41:29.200
later on, some cheap games and stuff.

41:29.200 --> 41:33.120
One game that is out there that's probably the cheapest 360 game you're going to find

41:33.120 --> 41:36.320
and this just dropped in price, you heard it here first.

41:36.320 --> 41:41.940
Ridge Racer 6, $19.99, you can find it now at, you know, all participating real tellers

41:41.940 --> 41:42.940
out there.

41:42.940 --> 41:47.220
So, $19.99, and to be honest, that game is not a bad game, but for some reason, the worst

41:47.220 --> 41:51.160
selling game in the United States for the 360s, so.

41:51.160 --> 41:52.160
Go check it out.

41:52.160 --> 41:53.160
That's really strange because it's a fun game.

41:53.160 --> 41:54.920
Isn't it the best seller in Japan?

41:54.920 --> 41:56.960
Yeah, it's polar opposites.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.600
It's just to show the difference in markets.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.600
Wow.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.880
But, you know, speaking of other markets, though, there is a bit of news about Bully

42:02.880 --> 42:03.880
in Europe.

42:03.880 --> 42:09.360
you're saying that it's going to hit in October as well as I'm here Rockstar was

42:09.360 --> 42:14.020
saying the October release date was going to apply to Europe as well as the

42:14.020 --> 42:19.800
US the British Board of Film Classification said that they were

42:19.800 --> 42:23.600
having issues with the the title saying but they said it wasn't anywhere near

42:23.600 --> 42:27.960
ready however Rockstar saying it's hmm on its way

42:27.960 --> 42:33.240
cool that's pretty interesting lots of guys I've been looking forward to bully

42:33.240 --> 42:36.480
after seeing the trailer this week. The trailer looks good.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.960
I haven't watched it yet. Megsy, I see you nodding your head. What's exciting you about

42:39.960 --> 42:40.720
the game Bully?

42:40.720 --> 42:43.960
Um, okay, so when I was a kid in school, I was a bully.

42:43.960 --> 42:48.880
You were the bully. I was the bully. Okay. And so I'm looking forward to that game

42:48.880 --> 42:50.200
and reliving my days

42:50.200 --> 42:55.080
as a evil bully in a Catholic school. Wait, I thought it was the other way around, that you beat up the

42:55.080 --> 42:55.600
bullies.

42:55.600 --> 43:00.160
Oh, I thought it was that you are the bully. Maybe, see, I think in a good game you get to play

43:00.160 --> 43:01.240
both ends of it.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.240
Alright.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.860
Loki, settle this, because you've been following this game more than I have.

43:04.860 --> 43:07.320
Are you the bully or are you the person beating up the bully?

43:07.320 --> 43:11.940
I think you're the person, you're just kind of a kid there and you're being bullied, and

43:11.940 --> 43:13.260
I think you might also be the bully.

43:13.260 --> 43:18.800
You're kind of like this kid that's just trouble, but it's like, you're trouble, but you've

43:18.800 --> 43:25.920
gotten introduced to this, you know, basically kind of like a private school, so you're no

43:25.920 --> 43:30.540
longer you know the big one on campus you know you're kind of you know getting

43:30.540 --> 43:33.600
bullied so you are bullied but you're also getting bullied at the same time

43:33.600 --> 43:37.720
it's basically school mayhem and that kind of stuff either way it's violence

43:37.720 --> 43:42.800
it's violence and it makes Jack Thompson angry so how can you go wrong it has

43:42.800 --> 43:47.120
schoolgirls making out with people so that's awesome which makes our lesbians

43:47.120 --> 43:55.360
in house very happy happy Catholic schoolgirls in those cute little outfits

43:55.360 --> 44:01.000
those are hot. Little skirts. I just bought a DVD that has those in them. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

44:01.000 --> 44:11.400
Whoa! Hello! Where have you been shopping lately? Castro Street. Okay. Well, moving

44:11.400 --> 44:16.840
right along. Let's talk about Xbox Live Arcade. Now, Major Nelson's blog is

44:16.840 --> 44:20.440
saying that the Xbox Live Wednesday thing was over with the release of

44:20.440 --> 44:23.640
Pac-Man this week, which by the way I forgot to mention I did download and

44:23.640 --> 44:29.860
play this week. It's Pac-Man. You know what you're getting into. If you haven't played

44:29.860 --> 44:34.900
Pac-Man yet, I don't think you're really a gamer if you haven't played Pac-Man at some

44:34.900 --> 44:39.940
point in your life. So you know what to expect from the Xbox version of Pac-Man. There's

44:39.940 --> 44:44.020
not a lot of frills. Sure, you get achievements, but Pac-Man is Pac-Man. But anyway, Major

44:44.020 --> 44:49.460
Nelson says that's it. No more. But the official Xbox magazine seems to be begging to differ

44:49.460 --> 44:54.060
a little bit. They have a release schedule, which includes August 16th, Texas Hold'em,

44:54.060 --> 44:59.580
August 23rd, Time Pilot, which Jamie was on the ColecoVision at one point, hence why

44:59.580 --> 45:06.780
you saw that, August 30th, Scramble, and September 6th, Luminous Live, and that's the one I'm

45:06.780 --> 45:10.300
sure a lot of folks are looking forward to there. Time Pilot and Scramble, by the way,

45:10.300 --> 45:13.460
are old-ass Konami games, if you've never heard of them. I like Time Pilot. I actually

45:13.460 --> 45:17.380
played a Time Pilot arcade machine back in the day, and I wasn't half bad at it.

45:17.380 --> 45:21.340
And for those who may remember, Nick Arcade Time Pilot was one of the games that they

45:21.340 --> 45:22.560
did play on the show.

45:22.560 --> 45:23.560
Was it really?

45:23.560 --> 45:24.560
Yes.

45:24.560 --> 45:25.560
That's awesome.

45:25.560 --> 45:28.060
It was one of the games they played frequently on the show.

45:28.060 --> 45:29.060
That's great.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.060
Alright.

45:30.060 --> 45:36.060
Well, we've got a little bit more news though as far as other old school stuff coming out.

45:36.060 --> 45:37.060
Oh yes?

45:37.060 --> 45:42.060
There's the Sega Genesis Collection for the Playstation 2 and PSP, a 30 game pack that

45:42.060 --> 45:43.060
will be out.

45:43.060 --> 45:51.100
um some of the games that are excuse me but there are some of the games to

45:51.100 --> 45:56.280
mention was a sonnet the hedgehog shinobi fantasy star golden axe vector

45:56.280 --> 46:02.320
man sword of vermilion comic zone Alex Kidd and rice star was another one

46:02.320 --> 46:06.880
mentioned but those are all games that I'm all over does it sound like

46:06.880 --> 46:11.320
something you're gonna get oh hell yeah as long as I have Alex Kidd and shinobi

46:11.320 --> 46:16.320
I'll be really happy because it's actually I mean true that wasn't necessarily a Genesis game

46:16.320 --> 46:20.340
It was my favorite Master System game and that started the whole Alex Kidd thing for me

46:20.980 --> 46:22.360
Very cool

46:22.360 --> 46:25.100
Does this sound like is this collection sound like something you want to pick up Loki?

46:26.640 --> 46:29.400
Maybe not for me because honestly and

46:29.920 --> 46:33.880
Most of them are already available on game tap and I agree that you know

46:33.880 --> 46:38.680
You can there's a certain charm being able to have this stuff on the go like on the PSP and stuff

46:38.680 --> 46:44.800
Which seems to me like maybe a response to all the emulation scene, you know, all the emulators have been going on on the PSP

46:44.800 --> 46:46.040
Maybe this is a response to that

46:46.040 --> 46:49.040
I mean honestly if it was gonna if I was gonna go by that standpoint

46:49.040 --> 46:52.960
There wouldn't be any point because almost all of these games I own Genesis cartridges of

46:53.640 --> 46:55.120
true so

46:55.120 --> 47:00.920
But at the same time it's convenient to have them on one disc so I can sit down with my controller in front of my

47:00.920 --> 47:05.920
TV and play them instead of sit in front of my computer if I'm gonna sit in front of my computer and play a game

47:05.920 --> 47:07.920
I'm gonna be on Warcraft

47:07.920 --> 47:11.060
So, we'll

47:11.060 --> 47:15.300
keep it moving here. I want to do a comment here in our chat room.

47:15.300 --> 47:19.180
NintendoManiac64 says, Sega doesn't seem to realize that a lot of the gamers

47:19.180 --> 47:21.180
in the Sega stuff have Gamecubes.

47:21.180 --> 47:26.260
So, seeming to think that, you know, most of the Sega fans were actually in the

47:26.260 --> 47:26.860
Gamecubes.

47:26.860 --> 47:30.460
Yeah, that's true. Possibly, but you know what?

47:30.460 --> 47:34.100
The Wii and the Virtual Console thing, I think, will take care of most of the Sega

47:34.100 --> 47:34.540
fans

47:34.540 --> 47:37.620
stuff on there. So, it should be a problem.

47:37.620 --> 47:44.460
Well, I want to go to this story about Japan, a kind of a very random tangent here, talking

47:44.460 --> 47:47.340
about arcade longevity over in Japan.

47:47.340 --> 47:51.820
There was this in-depth article that ran on MSNBC, the Newsweek section of MSNBC.

47:51.820 --> 47:56.620
It was an article, just a column that's talking about Japan's arcades, and this guy kind of

47:56.620 --> 48:00.800
sets up the scene here in his article and says, quote, welcome to the arcades of Tokyo.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.880
In Asia and particularly Japan, video game rooms not only live but thrive.

48:04.880 --> 48:10.900
There are 9,500 arcades in the country, with more than 445,000 game machines made by Japanese

48:10.900 --> 48:13.780
companies like Namco and Capcom.

48:13.780 --> 48:16.400
In the U.S., of course, the story is much different.

48:16.400 --> 48:20.980
Arcades are a rapidly dying breed, with only about 3,000 in operation, down from 10,000

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
a decade ago.

48:21.980 --> 48:26.820
Though the popularity of home video systems like the PlayStation contributed to the decline,

48:26.820 --> 48:31.100
Akagi says that execs at U.S. companies like Midway and Atari simply couldn't see the future

48:31.100 --> 48:34.740
in arcades and abandoned the coin-op business.

48:34.740 --> 48:38.740
And the article kind of goes on to make the speculation that what happened over in Japan

48:38.740 --> 48:44.260
as opposed to here is that here most of the kids who used to go to arcades grew up and

48:44.260 --> 48:48.220
moved into home console gaming, but in Japan most of the kids that played arcades have

48:48.220 --> 48:53.140
grown up still going to arcades and still in that whole scene.

48:53.140 --> 48:59.300
Now I know that Orange Lounge Radio was sort of born of an arcade thing, you know, we all

48:59.300 --> 49:04.220
met playing DDR, which was a big arcade phenomenon at the time, I'm curious what you guys think

49:04.220 --> 49:06.940
about this story about arcades in Japan versus US.

49:06.940 --> 49:11.380
I'm going to guess that the arcades in Japan probably are better maintained than the arcades

49:11.380 --> 49:13.540
in the United States.

49:13.540 --> 49:14.900
You think so?

49:14.900 --> 49:15.900
Why is it?

49:15.900 --> 49:17.180
Why is that?

49:17.180 --> 49:23.060
Maybe because, I don't know, the American arcades out there, they just pretty much have

49:23.060 --> 49:25.580
them just to kind of fill space it seems like.

49:25.580 --> 49:29.460
You know, like at movie theaters, something to kill time for the little kids, you know,

49:29.460 --> 49:34.940
out of mommy and daddy's, you know, hair, um, or like a, you know, sun splash or something,

49:34.940 --> 49:38.100
you know, just to kill time while you're waiting for water slides or something like that.

49:38.100 --> 49:39.100
Birthday central.

49:39.100 --> 49:43.820
Birthdays, yeah. But, um, they just let the machines go to crap, so.

49:43.820 --> 49:48.900
I think there's also this, uh, little thing, you know, I think it especially applies to

49:48.900 --> 49:53.220
America in general, where they think you hit a certain age, you grow up, you don't do this

49:53.220 --> 49:57.500
anymore. In your home you can play your video game, but you don't go out, you know, as an

49:57.500 --> 50:01.340
adult and play DDR in which I of course I beg to differ with of course but

50:01.340 --> 50:06.500
there's still that it's still sort of taboo you know you're supposed to be

50:06.500 --> 50:10.700
grown up that's true because I know it's even when we were playing DDR we used to

50:10.700 --> 50:14.740
get a lot of funny stairs like what are those guys doing shouldn't they you know

50:14.740 --> 50:26.260
be accounting or something that's okay and not in a good way I hate that I

50:26.260 --> 50:29.220
I mean, I really hate that. People who don't know any better, they go,

50:29.220 --> 50:34.720
DDR so gay! It's like, so what if it has flashing pink lights and, you know, Madonna

50:34.720 --> 50:35.660
music? I mean,

50:35.660 --> 50:38.860
it's something everybody can have fun with, right?

50:38.860 --> 50:43.540
Yeah. But it's still, though, I think it's just a whole matter of attitude, you know.

50:43.540 --> 50:47.380
There's, you know, 40-year-old businessmen in Japan get off work and go play

50:47.380 --> 50:50.420
DDR or pop music or something. And they're not gay.

50:50.420 --> 50:53.780
No. Well, we don't know that. Well, they might be. Some might be.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.780
Doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. So what if they're gay?

50:56.600 --> 50:58.100
Magsy, you have a thought on this?

50:58.100 --> 51:02.900
Do you have a thought on this? Sorry, I thought you, I see you with the mics. I thought, do you, are you an arcade gamer?

51:02.900 --> 51:04.900
Um, somewhat.

51:04.900 --> 51:07.520
If there is an arcade, I will play in it.

51:08.380 --> 51:12.740
Have you ever been to an arcade in Japan? Yes, I have. Ooh, what'd you, what was it like when you were there?

51:12.740 --> 51:17.740
Um, well, I was only there for a little bit because we, our train was leaving, but it was, it was very well kept,

51:17.740 --> 51:22.420
from what I remember. Maybe that's the difference. The difference is, in Japan

51:22.420 --> 51:26.220
they play Beatmania. In the United States they beat their spouse.

51:26.220 --> 51:30.900
Wow.

51:30.900 --> 51:34.020
Your logic is infallible. Exactly.

51:34.020 --> 51:38.260
I'm awesome. That's all we need to know. By infallible I mean not really.

51:38.260 --> 51:44.940
Speaking of couples not getting along here, one couple,

51:44.940 --> 51:51.620
the E3 little guys and the ESA, you know those wonderful Kencha Hall exhibitors, they're

51:51.620 --> 51:55.340
not really getting along too well with the ESA.

51:55.340 --> 52:01.500
And actually the ESA sent out some letters to these small Kencha Hall people kind of

52:01.500 --> 52:05.780
informing them of what's going on with E3 next year.

52:05.780 --> 52:12.100
And basically they said, as you may have read in the press releases, the E3 Expo has officially

52:12.100 --> 52:18.700
been canceled, and it's involving and matured over the last 12 years, and now the needs

52:18.700 --> 52:22.360
of the exhibitors and the key attendees has also changed.

52:22.360 --> 52:26.320
And you know, it should also say in fine print, by the way, you're not a key attendee because

52:26.320 --> 52:29.160
you do not have a booth in the bigger hall.

52:29.160 --> 52:31.120
So fuck you.

52:31.120 --> 52:34.960
So the ESA essentially wrote these people a letter that says, k thanks, bye.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
It's basically, it's this, we would like to-

52:35.960 --> 52:38.520
Brad, my team was hanging out in Kencha Hall.

52:38.520 --> 52:39.520
It's basically like this.

52:39.520 --> 52:45.000
It's like, dear people from Kensha Hall, it's not you, it's us.

52:45.000 --> 52:49.720
You know, we want to see other people.

52:49.720 --> 52:58.760
You know, maybe we could be friends, just, you know, some days, some days, Kensha Hall,

52:58.760 --> 53:04.580
I just want to cuddle, but you guys are so demanding.

53:04.580 --> 53:10.100
You have to understand that, you know, my life is moving on and I need to move on too,

53:10.100 --> 53:11.100
so...

53:11.100 --> 53:13.860
We just need some distance.

53:13.860 --> 53:18.660
We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere, profound gratitude for

53:18.660 --> 53:20.460
your past support of this event.

53:20.460 --> 53:24.580
It has been exciting and rewarding to see the growth and significance of this industry

53:24.580 --> 53:28.920
mirrored on the exhibit floor of the E3 Expo through the years.

53:28.920 --> 53:32.660
We look forward to many years of industry growth and viability and opportunity without

53:32.660 --> 53:33.660
you.

53:33.660 --> 53:40.660
basically added it there, at the end there, but not really, not really, but that'd be

53:40.660 --> 53:41.660
funny.

53:41.660 --> 53:46.380
And, Jamie, the Red Octane, I mean, with all due respect to Red Octane and the guitar users,

53:46.380 --> 53:47.460
it's a fluke.

53:47.460 --> 53:49.780
Nobody expected Guitar Hero to do as well as it did.

53:49.780 --> 53:53.340
Them being there, you know, it was a fluke.

53:53.340 --> 53:55.500
Actually, I expected it to do well.

53:55.500 --> 53:58.980
But I'm talking about, you know, we're different because we've always loved, you know, we're

53:58.980 --> 54:02.900
different, we're special, but I'm talking about like the mainstream folks.

54:02.900 --> 54:05.580
You know, nobody would have thought Guitar Hero would have done as well as it really

54:05.580 --> 54:10.800
did until people actually played it and found out, wow, it's actually kind of fun.

54:10.800 --> 54:15.600
So I think the whole Red Octane is a fluke, and I think had there been an E3 next year,

54:15.600 --> 54:17.260
Red Octane would have graduated to the big hall.

54:17.260 --> 54:18.260
I have to laugh.

54:18.260 --> 54:20.220
You get to go to the big boy chair, Red Octane!

54:20.220 --> 54:21.860
No, I had to laugh.

54:21.860 --> 54:27.460
I went to Fry's this week, you know, the electronics store that we have over here, which is giant,

54:27.460 --> 54:32.180
and I was watching this woman watch her son play Guitar Hero, and she kept yelling at

54:32.180 --> 54:36.980
She's like, it's almost like watching someone play DDR instead of saying, you know, left,

54:36.980 --> 54:37.980
left, right, left.

54:37.980 --> 54:43.620
She's all, green, green, green, red, you know, it's like, it's not helping.

54:43.620 --> 54:44.620
Wow.

54:44.620 --> 54:46.900
I can see that it's green.

54:46.900 --> 54:54.500
Well, the ESA has some good news coming their way and it has to do with the state of Illinois

54:54.500 --> 54:57.540
is being told to pay the ESA

54:57.540 --> 55:00.740
a half a million dollars for messing up

55:00.740 --> 55:05.260
big time. Basically what happened is that

55:05.260 --> 55:10.640
it's not just half a million, it's $510,528.64

55:10.640 --> 55:13.580
and the reason why they have to do it is because they did an

55:13.580 --> 55:18.880
unconstitutional effort to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games

55:18.880 --> 55:23.540
and essentially you know legal fees blah blah blah

55:23.540 --> 55:28.400
it adds up.

55:28.400 --> 55:32.500
If controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in promoting the positive

55:32.500 --> 55:36.700
psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly accorded

55:36.700 --> 55:39.460
to parents and families, not the state.

55:39.460 --> 55:43.140
That coming from Judge Matthew F. Kenley.

55:43.140 --> 55:44.140
Good for him.

55:44.140 --> 55:46.620
Hopefully this will set a precedent.

55:46.620 --> 55:52.020
We've had these in Minnesota and these other states trying to pass the same thing.

55:52.020 --> 55:53.020
In Wisconsin?

55:53.020 --> 55:58.740
Yeah, this needs to really be a shining example to them of what's going to happen when they

55:58.740 --> 56:00.740
try to violate our rights.

56:00.740 --> 56:05.740
And of course, the ESA had a field day, quote, Judge Kennelly's ruling sent two irrefutable

56:05.740 --> 56:06.740
messages.

56:06.740 --> 56:10.340
Not only are efforts to ban the sale of violent video games clearly unconstitutional, they

56:10.340 --> 56:12.180
are a waste of taxpayer dollars.

56:12.180 --> 56:13.180
Excellent.

56:13.180 --> 56:15.420
So the taxpayers not only get to pay for them to...

56:15.420 --> 56:16.420
Yep.

56:16.420 --> 56:22.100
The sad fact is that the state of Illinois knew this law was unconstitutional from the

56:22.100 --> 56:25.460
beginning taxpayers have a right to know that over half a million of their

56:25.460 --> 56:28.620
dollars and countless government hours were thrown away in this fruitless

56:28.620 --> 56:32.220
effort probably more than half a million dollars because you know to actually

56:32.220 --> 56:36.300
propose this bill and stuff you know all those luncheons that they have to hold

56:36.300 --> 56:41.380
and there are the past this stuff and the lobbyists of course

56:41.380 --> 56:45.740
magazine Mac man in our chat room is also from Wisconsin it says Wisconsin

56:45.740 --> 56:49.500
sucks I live there do you do you agree Maisie I see you're nodding your head

56:49.500 --> 56:53.060
you agree Wisconsin sucks yeah it does not it not a place for gamers no no

56:53.060 --> 56:58.260
unless unless you're in Madison then come visit my GameStop there you go I

56:58.260 --> 57:02.700
work there do you get do you get hit on by boys at the GameStop yes do you get

57:02.700 --> 57:07.980
hit on by girls at the GameStop no okay so if we have any you know girls who

57:07.980 --> 57:11.220
like girls and Madison maybe they need to be oh wait no she's taken you better

57:11.220 --> 57:19.340
not mine Chris will come out there and cut you off and I don't mean your

57:19.340 --> 57:26.180
hair all right uh anyway when taxpayer dollars are wasted we get angsty don't

57:26.180 --> 57:33.500
we dark Sakura oh hell yes and what happens when we get angsty people die

57:39.660 --> 57:44.220
so let's bring on the F use of the weak dark Sakura my F you of the week goes

57:44.220 --> 57:51.980
toward the sun the bright shining orb in the sky for leeching all of my energy

57:51.980 --> 57:57.660
burning my chest my poor boots are burnt and making me really sleepy to where I

57:57.660 --> 58:02.340
almost fell asleep on the road five times fuck you son

58:02.340 --> 58:08.340
Loki my a few goes to people that are extremely rude when it comes to parking

58:08.340 --> 58:12.380
their cars or not being able to park in their spaces we have this guy today when

58:12.380 --> 58:23.540
I was going to get my smoothie and why is that funny cuz I can't have a smoothie shall

58:23.540 --> 58:33.700
I explain smoothie amongst us is a euphemism for lesbian sex it's a big cup of smoothie

58:33.700 --> 58:41.920
then and I suddenly I want nothing but frappuccinos for the rest of my life why what's a frappuccino

58:41.920 --> 58:47.200
mean now it's like a sex oh okay well i'll take i'll take plenty of frappuccino thank you i need

58:47.200 --> 58:52.080
actually it's been a while since i've had a frappuccino oh loki sorry anyways um so there's

58:52.080 --> 58:58.160
some jackass that was sitting there his car had both of the doors open wide open and the guy wasn't

58:58.160 --> 59:03.760
nowhere to be seen in his car he was just sitting down enjoying you know a coffee or something in

59:03.760 --> 59:08.640
front of starbucks that happens to be next door but i don't know it's just really fucking rude

59:08.640 --> 59:12.960
when people you know park their cars especially with the doors open or especially over the line

59:12.960 --> 59:17.600
you get those wonderful suvs they're like my car is too big for one space so i'm gonna park in two

59:17.600 --> 59:23.360
compact spaces but your car's not compact so you shouldn't be you know parking in one compact space

59:23.360 --> 59:31.440
let alone both of them um is that it that's it my fu of the week would have to go towards sangria

59:32.080 --> 59:38.240
for having some type of un like unexplainable control over me because i drank a lot of it on

59:38.240 --> 59:43.840
Thursday, and I drank a lot of it on Friday. And I'm typically not a lush, but sangria

59:43.840 --> 59:48.720
makes me want to be, because it's really yummy. But if you're under 21, you shouldn't drink

59:48.720 --> 59:53.440
sangria. That's not good. Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to get out?

59:53.440 --> 01:00:01.920
I do, actually. I think it's on. Is it on? Yeah. Okay. My FU goes to homeless people

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:07.360
in San Francisco, and I don't mean all of them. We went to the Castro district today,

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:14.640
Which for those of you who do not know is the gay and lesbian district of San Francisco, and we're walking by

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.480
There's a homeless guy

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:23.480
Just relaxing on the side of the street where everybody and their mother were walking and his penis was just hanging

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.560
Give me a dollar

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.560
He was just laying there, just hanging out. It wasn't even impressive either, I mean, there was a store right next to us with a big dog.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:41.560
Wait, so he's just lying, I assume this is Market Street, or what is this? Oh, Castro.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:47.560
So he's just, well, I mean, okay, having someone's cock hanging out in the middle of Castro Street is not that uncommon, I hate to tell you.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.560
But it wasn't impressive.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560
Okay, I see.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.560
I want an impressive cock when I go down, or Castro, serious.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.560
Alright, uh, Megsy, do you have any interviews of the week you'd like to get out?

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:06.560
Yes, I do. I've got one, uh, me and Chris went up to, uh, Santa Cruz and went to...

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.560
Oh, yeah.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:14.560
And went to the boardwalk, uh, and we were sitting on the beach, um, drawing stick figure porn in the sand.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:21.560
And, um, we looked over and we were commenting on how there are some people who should just not wear bathing suits.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.560
Um, mostly old guys.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.680
Oh, wearing like the Speedo suits? It gets better, hold on.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.680
Uh oh. So just as we were saying that, we look over and there's this

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:33.740
old guy. He's like, he's gotta be like

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:37.240
late 40s, early 50s.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:40.360
He's dark tan. He's dark tan.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:45.000
Balding. All hairy. He's all hairy.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.560
He's got like the bling bling.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.520
And so he's got this towel around him and I'm just like, oh my god, there's one of them.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.840
and when he takes the towel off he has

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.480
a bright red Speedo with the Brazilian wax

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.560
yeah yeah yeah we were looking and trying to determine if he was waxed or not

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.960
we couldn't see we were kind of far away but

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.200
I think he was

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.680
and it gets better, wait, one more

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:19.920
then not only did this guy have the audacity to go out of the house but also

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.840
wear a bright red Speedo on the beach

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.600
Uh, his girlfriend or his wife or something started taking pictures of him and he started posing for these pictures

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.680
And adjusting himself

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.360
And I am not making this up. I am not exaggerating at all. We have pictures. It's called pokemon snap

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.560
Wow

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.880
You know in other countries

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.200
It's okay to wear speedo on the beach and a lot of times the people wearing them pretty hot like, you know

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.680
I've seen pictures on the internet, you know, this guy was not hot. I know I

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.280
Thought he was I see

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.560
That's unfortunate

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.620
Now we better get back into games or we're gonna get those angry emails, you know in those

01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:09.120
Happy stuff orange lounge radio. They never talk about games. They talk about guys and speedos

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.700
Yeah, I hate orange. I hate you dark Sakura. Yeah, you're so mean

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.640
You know what fuck a whole bunch of them and not in a good way

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.900
I mean like with pogo stick no frappuccinos or smoothies for them

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:29.040
All right. Well, I've decided the euphemism for straight sex is potato. Let's let's go back into game news, please

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.340
I like in our chat room, I agree with this comment by Blackboy, Dot Hack Volume 1, yay.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.820
I played a little bit of that at A3, it was fun.

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:15.280
I like the old Dot Hack games, they're fun.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280
Good times.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.140
I like the cartoon anime, excuse me.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:20.140
It's fun.

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.140
I haven't seen a whole lot of it, but it's fun.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.800
Have I ever had the chat about you know I don't really watch anime

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.740
even though I know like a lot of our fans are really into it because the DDR

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.020
connection and what have you I'm just I'm not really that into it

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:35.340
it's okay but I'm just, I don't know. I go to an anime convention and I go

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:39.060
these people look like they're having fun which is cool and all but I just I don't

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:42.820
I don't get it. Cosplay. Oh well. Cosplay. Cosplay's

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:47.620
cute I guess sometimes but sometimes it's also very ugly. Do you? What do you cosplay as?

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:50.660
Wait, Maisie's telling us about her cosplay.

01:06:50.660 --> 01:07:04.660
Um, let's see, I cosplayed as Belle Dandy from Oh My Goddess, uh, I cosplayed- I did, like, a girl version of Vash the Stampede from Trigun, uh, let's see, what else did I do?

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:08.660
Have you ever done Lulu? Because lesbian Lulus are awesome from Final Fantasy X.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.660
You know, I was gonna do a Lulu.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:18.660
Ooh, that's hot. I might turn for that, we'll see. Alright, uh, anyway, uh, well let's keep it moving.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:25.200
Anywho, Sony's actually unveiled a brand new

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.240
portable media player, as if they need another one,

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:31.780
called the Mylo, not Mylo notice,

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:35.660
but Mylo, M-Y-L-O. And basically

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:38.900
it stands for My Life Online

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:42.980
and it's gonna be also able to use

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.060
Skype, Google, and Yahoo Chats. So that's kinda neat.

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:53.060
It's scheduled to release in September, and it's supposed to retail for about $350.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:08:04.060
It has a 940 megabytes of RAM, as well as able to play most of the current music formats,

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:14.060
and also has a slide down QWERTY keyboard, unlike the PSP bastards, and a 2.4 inch screen.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.060
So, awfully tiny.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:21.620
but yeah so that's kinda interesting I guess they're trying to compete with

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.180
the Zune or something like that

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.660
but I don't know why don't you just get Blackberry

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.540
seriously okay

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:37.100
well you know more bad news for Sony honestly

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.380
there's this blogger and you probably have seen this around the internet it's

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:40.860
gotten

01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.140
dug in a lot of places just for the sheer irony of it

01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:49.140
It's this editor for the official PlayStation Magazine. Her name is Dana

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:52.900
Jay, and she wrote this thing on her 1UP blog

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:58.220
about how she plans on buying an Xbox 360 this November, even though she

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:00.220
works for the official PlayStation Magazine.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.380
Basically saying that when they announced that the price would be $600,

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.860
she found her enthusiasm sagging. Here's a quote.

01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:12.780
It's not that I find the concept of a $600 console insulting. Inflation happens

01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.780
and it's natural that, eventually, initial prices will be higher than they used to be.

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:21.520
But when I know that a console's direct competitors cost two-thirds or half that price, it becomes

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.500
harder for me to justify shelling out that kind of money, especially when I can probably

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:29.860
get the Wii and the 360 combined for the cost of a PlayStation 3.

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.780
It goes on to say, there are very few big titles that are PS3 exclusive.

01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:38.940
GTA IV and Assassins will be available for the 360 at the same time, and most of the

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.060
big guns Final Fantasy 13 Metal Gear Solid 4 won't be hitting for quite some

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:48.140
time after the launch that's kind of a big ouch but people seem to love that

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:53.300
story because of the irony I don't know what it is but whatever what do you guys

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:58.460
think is that just more pouring salt in the wounds of Sony or what they deserve

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:04.940
them you think what you're really you're really against ps3 um yeah why um well I

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:11.020
have my theories about ps3 but it doesn't it doesn't seem like it's worth the $600 price tag

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:16.700
at all um and plus i kind of have a little vendetta against sony oh i want to hear about

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:23.820
this what's the vendetta against sony um is just um well okay i'll i'll tell you the truth is that

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.740
i get a lot of stupid sony fanboys in my store i want to hear about sony fanboys no you don't

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.740
What do they do? What makes them stupid?

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:35.740
Because they'll say stuff...

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.740
Oh, sorry.

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:41.740
They'll say stuff, they'll come in and tell me how great PS3 is gonna be,

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.740
and I'll say, well, I'm not really looking forward to it.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.740
There's nothing I really like on it.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.740
And they'll try to convince me why I should get a PS3,

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.740
and I'm looking at this guy saying, dude, I work in the freaking store.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.740
I think I know what I want.

01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:55.740
Well, I'm wearing probably this Mario shirt, you know,

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:57.740
saying I want to get a Wii, not a PS3.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:03.580
I mean, I like my PS2. It's got cool RPGs on it, but for the most part, I don't like

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.060
Sony.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:13.400
After having played PS3 games, you are 100% correct. They are crap.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.500
It's hard, because you make a good point at the end. You love the PlayStation 2, and I

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.460
love the PlayStation 2. I think we all love the PlayStation 2, and I think that's why

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:26.620
we all look at the PlayStation 3 and go, just keep putting out PS2 games, honestly. If that's

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.180
That's where you're gonna go, just don't even bother.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:32.740
What they need to understand is, look at all these other console wars that have been going

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:33.740
on.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.580
The Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:41.960
The Xbox and Playstation 2.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:47.740
Have you noticed a big, giant difference between the games that come out on both platforms?

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.020
They look almost the same.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:55.180
They're very much the same.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.340
makes you think that they're gonna all of a sudden you know hey let's develop a

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:02.140
game for the 360 and let's just spend some extra time on making a completely

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:05.940
different game but it's actually the same game for the PlayStation 3 with

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:09.660
better graphics but you know what they're not gonna spend the money to

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:13.500
develop those games because you know what they can port the same game over

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:16.760
and it'll be just fine on both systems. Let me go over the chat room real quick

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:21.300
for some comments orangelanatrader.com click on chat Fire Resurrected of the

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:26.580
The O.L. Army would like to say Amen, lesbian co-host person.

01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:27.580
Let's see.

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.780
Macman says, but the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray, it is God in writable media.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.780
Interesting.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:37.060
If by God they mean, you know, God of BCs.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.660
Black Boy says the $500 PS3 isn't really so lame.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:42.660
Yes, it is.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.660
People are allowed to have difference of opinion.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:50.980
Fireboma says, damn, I wish I could resist the PS3, but I'm just going to shell out $600

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:53.900
dollars for it anyway I am a consumer

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.180
whore and how should have been the rest

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.780
of that comment no you know what I have

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.700
to know I still it despite all this I

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:00.820
kind of feel like I'm gonna end up

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.860
getting a PlayStation 3 anyway I will at

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.860
some point but I'm not gonna launch yeah

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.740
I'm not all excited about because the

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:08.660
thing is about the launch games there's

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.340
nothing that makes it really stand out

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.740
for me there's I mean and and to be

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.060
honest all the other games that are out

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.180
there like even flat out to or not flat

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:20.180
out to um full auto 2 was the one for me

01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:24.640
I was like whoo that looks really good, but it's coming out on the 360 later on and so it's not a big deal

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:32.560
What I think is gonna be really interesting is seeing what their marketing campaign is gonna be for this and seeing how they're gonna try

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.820
To convince people to spend the $600 for it

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:40.240
I don't think you're gonna be able to you're gonna see that because those 1080p TVs out there

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.840
I know because I'm pricing them right now. They're like three grand

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:48.440
I mean now I'm sure there's gonna be some angry Sony fanboys out there that want to write

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.680
you know, angry emails, Orange Lounge Radio, I hate you, Loki, you're a dick, nah nah nah.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:59.120
We welcome those emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and maybe we'll read some on next week.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.080
Why are you letting that lesbian speak on your show about PlayStation?

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.300
She doesn't know what she's talking about, nah nah nah nah.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.360
Go back to munching carpet, nah nah nah.

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:10.880
Alright, so mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:17.480
So no, if you have an intelligent rebuttal, we would happily read your emails on there.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.760
if you write something stupid we're just gonna forward it to Magsy. And you know what? I

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:28.560
really want to see the PS3 do well. I wanted to see them launch it with a new Twisted Metal

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.000
game. That would have been awesome. That would have sold the system for me, but to be honest

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
right now they seem to be a step behind everybody and the fact that they haven't released any

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.480
details about what exactly their online service is going to be, because I think to be honest

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:45.640
they don't know what it's going to be like right now. I don't even think they have that

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:50.640
stuff finalized yet. So until I hear some more details about how wonderful this system

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.640
is, based on specs and price alone, I'm not going to be buying it at launch.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:03.640
Alright. Well, let's change the tune to something happier. DarkSakura, don't you agree?

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640
Yes.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.400
And DarkSakura always likes to make us happy by surfing the internet and telling us about

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.640
her happy place on the internet this week and sharing it with the internet. So DarkSakura,

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.960
What is your happy website of the week?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.440
My webpage of the week is Mr. Pinball.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:28.760
It's www.xmission.com slash tilde d-a-i-n-a slash pinball dot html.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.480
And basically Mr. Pinball is a site they restore, buy, sell, trade, repair pinball machines.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.960
They have classified ads, pricing guides, t-shirts, hats, bugs and more!

01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:41.720
Repair tips of the day, pinball collector registry, pinball machine photos.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:48.720
It's probably one of the oldest pinball sites on the internet as far as information, tips,

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.720
that type of thing, so go check it out.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.720
Alright.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.720
Awesome.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720
Anyways...

01:15:54.720 --> 01:16:03.720
Oh, hi.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.720
My turn, huh?

01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:05.720
My bad.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.720
Moving on, I have one more...

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.720
Well, you started talking, I thought you had the next story and

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.720
Loki's sitting there going, I can make up a story.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.720
He's saying that I was awesome and that my taste in websites is, yeah.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.720
Oh, I thought, weren't we going to do Orange Lounge Lying Radio

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.720
or something one week because everybody calls us liars anyway?

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.720
Would you like to come up with the Orange Lounge Radio fib game news of the week?

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:28.720
The fib game news of the week?

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
Yes.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.720
The Playstation 3 being good?

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720
Oh, Maisie has one.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.720
Okay, here's our not true Orange Lounge Radio news story of the week.

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:42.260
the week. Sony has just announced that the PS3 will also include a George Foreman grill.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:46.160
The PlayStation 3 has already sold over 50 million units before its launch, making it

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.440
the fastest system to ever reach that number. Amazing. You heard it here first on Orange

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:56.280
Lounge Radio. I just bought mine off eBay. It'll also do your laundry and your homework.

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.740
And it'll suck your lollipop clean! The ones you buy at Disneyland, the happiest place

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:08.740
on Earth because pure people like to go to Disneyland. Moving on, here's a true article.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:15.920
Wait, I got one more. What? Okay, yeah. Okay. Landfill in San Francisco this week actually

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:21.560
started rumbling from all the dual shocks that have been buried in there causing an

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:28.560
earthquake, which is ironic because San Francisco gets a lot of earthquakes. Wow.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.560
Wow.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
Moving on.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:36.560
This story is true, even though some people think it's a lie.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:40.560
It really is true, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, the Burning Crusade.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.560
Lots of people get their characters to 60, and then it's all about the endgame.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.560
Endgame, endgame, endgame. Well, guess what?

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.560
Endgames have typically been 40-man raids.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.560
Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, so on and so on.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.560
And that's not going to change, but what's going to happen is that the new endgames in the Burning Crusade,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.840
they're gonna be capped at 25 people. So

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.600
folks are gonna have to get used to all new party setups and all new strategies

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.520
for endgame battle because you're gonna be reduced in the amount of people you

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.080
can take

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.020
on those raids. So no more taking along Leroy Jenkins just for comic value.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.400
You're gonna have to get less people to work with so you're gonna have to take along

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.080
folks who definitely know what they're doing and won't run into battle before

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080
you're all ready.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.360
But the chicken will still be good.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:26.040
FYI

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:30.320
Anyway, that's gonna do it for the end of this segment of orange lounge radio here on the live show

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.460
We're gonna take a break and that means our podcast is gonna get split at this point

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:40.700
But be sure to tune in later this week for part B of orange lounge radio and we'll be back right after this

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.200
Orange lounge radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.080
Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
