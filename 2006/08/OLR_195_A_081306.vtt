00:13.971 --> 00:19.154
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, August 13th, 2006, is Squeenix going to get in the business of hardware?

00:19.415 --> 00:21.876
[SPEAKER_00]: Get ready for some retro Sega Genesis action.

00:22.336 --> 00:25.118
[SPEAKER_00]: What is holding up the PSP download service anyway?

00:27.900 --> 00:37.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another wonderful episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.626 --> 00:43.210
[SPEAKER_03]: We are that podcast dedicated to video games and the gaming culture and of course, video games that don't suck.

00:43.803 --> 00:44.323
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10.717 --> 01:11.597
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never do such a thing.

01:11.797 --> 01:12.458
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't talking about you.

01:12.918 --> 01:14.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Loki.

01:15.278 --> 01:15.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

01:16.179 --> 01:16.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Loki.

01:16.599 --> 01:16.999
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

01:17.279 --> 01:17.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

01:17.999 --> 01:18.239
[SPEAKER_03]: Hungry.

01:18.699 --> 01:19.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Hungry?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you eat before the show tonight?

01:20.680 --> 01:21.420
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's some beer nuts.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.521
[SPEAKER_03]: I want nuts.

01:24.181 --> 01:25.642
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't like nuts, do you?

01:25.662 --> 01:26.702
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like eating nuts.

01:27.202 --> 01:29.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight also we have some very special guests in the studio.

01:29.883 --> 01:32.224
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have some guests tonight who have never been on the show before.

01:32.844 --> 01:34.664
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a rarity because usually we get the same old people.

01:34.704 --> 01:36.845
[SPEAKER_03]: But tonight we have some guests.

01:37.005 --> 01:39.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first guest tonight is coming to us all the way from Wisconsin.

01:40.612 --> 01:41.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Megzi!

01:41.353 --> 01:41.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

01:42.674 --> 01:43.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how you doing?

01:43.774 --> 01:45.316
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put the mic a little bit closer to your mouth.

01:45.556 --> 01:45.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

01:46.216 --> 01:46.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how you doing?

01:46.997 --> 01:47.417
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay.

01:47.617 --> 01:47.797
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

01:47.897 --> 01:48.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your shirt.

01:48.438 --> 01:49.339
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Mario on your shirt.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.619
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wore that specially for the show.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.

01:51.080 --> 01:51.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a gamer girl?

01:52.041 --> 01:52.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yes.

01:52.541 --> 01:53.241
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of games do you like?

01:53.902 --> 01:54.602
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

01:54.722 --> 01:55.663
[SPEAKER_05]: I like RPGs.

01:55.703 --> 01:57.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid to just get that microphone, like, right there by your mouth.

01:58.005 --> 01:58.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

01:58.465 --> 01:59.486
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.447
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

02:01.467 --> 02:02.328
[SPEAKER_05]: I like RPGs.

02:02.408 --> 02:03.429
[SPEAKER_05]: I like platformers.

02:03.929 --> 02:08.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually like any type of game, uh, as long as it's fun.

02:10.046 --> 02:11.447
[SPEAKER_03]: The Best Game You've Played in the Past Year

02:35.241 --> 02:36.262
[SPEAKER_07]: A-ha, a-ha, a-ha

02:58.473 --> 02:59.676
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:07.110 --> 03:07.390
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura

03:35.939 --> 03:36.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Pillow fights?

03:36.719 --> 03:37.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there ever pillow fights?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.921
[SPEAKER_06]: No pillow fights, but we did have an orgy.

03:40.981 --> 03:41.901
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a Mississippi orgy.

03:42.361 --> 03:43.442
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a Mississippi orgy?

03:44.202 --> 03:47.063
[SPEAKER_06]: It's when you get people in a room without their socks or shoes.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.404
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really hot.

03:49.664 --> 03:50.164
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hot.

03:50.244 --> 03:53.585
[SPEAKER_03]: So wait, if I take off my socks right now, because I'll have on my socks.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh, Megsie's taking off her socks.

03:56.066 --> 03:57.246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm taking off my socks.

03:58.827 --> 04:00.767
[SPEAKER_06]: We are now officially having a Mississippi orgy.

04:00.787 --> 04:02.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, an orgy.

04:03.028 --> 04:03.588
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fun.

04:05.149 --> 04:05.449
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

04:05.799 --> 04:06.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to the games.

04:06.759 --> 04:10.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, the guys in the room are now going, it's a lesbian show.

04:10.320 --> 04:10.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.981
[SPEAKER_03]: How could I forget our chat room?

04:12.241 --> 04:14.541
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:14.581 --> 04:17.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat if you're listening to us live here on this lovely Sunday evening.

04:18.222 --> 04:19.802
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd love to hear your opinion.

04:20.923 --> 04:21.743
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, there we go.

04:21.763 --> 04:24.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd, OMG, they're having an orgy on the show.

04:26.344 --> 04:28.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight's going to be, it's a slow news week, boys and girls.

04:28.305 --> 04:28.845
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we say?

04:28.945 --> 04:33.226
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the type of stuff that happens during slow news weeks is we have Mississippi orgies with lesbians.

04:33.626 --> 04:34.046
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is...

04:35.859 --> 04:36.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising Pinball

05:06.881 --> 05:18.388
[SPEAKER_06]: and I actually almost, I tried to hunt down the Saturn so I could play our Sega Ages collection that we got from the guy who was the man behind Working Designs who Dan just bought the Twilight Zone pinball from.

05:19.089 --> 05:19.789
[SPEAKER_06]: He's really awesome.

05:20.610 --> 05:21.630
[SPEAKER_06]: And Dan got me a monkey.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a real monkey that flings poo?

05:25.393 --> 05:26.533
[SPEAKER_01]: A monkey ball monkey.

05:27.634 --> 05:27.954
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.

05:28.374 --> 05:30.336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I have a monkey.

05:30.356 --> 05:32.177
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

05:32.257 --> 05:33.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris has a monkey too.

05:34.278 --> 05:35.019
[SPEAKER_05]: I got her the monkey.

05:35.079 --> 05:35.679
[SPEAKER_05]: I work at GameStop.

05:36.407 --> 05:37.768
[SPEAKER_03]: GameStop Pride GameStop Pride

05:59.591 --> 06:00.312
[SPEAKER_03]: So cool.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.033
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to describe it.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.774
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.

06:03.874 --> 06:05.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, zombie killing is love.

06:05.916 --> 06:06.416
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.

06:06.516 --> 06:13.702
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I knew I was in love with Dead Rising the minute I picked up the lawnmower and mowed over 70 zombies in a minute.

06:14.322 --> 06:14.663
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

06:15.785 --> 06:18.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever thought of this concept for a game, I want to kiss you.

06:19.228 --> 06:19.468
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

06:19.528 --> 06:20.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on the lips.

06:20.929 --> 06:21.950
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a beautiful game.

06:22.010 --> 06:23.371
[SPEAKER_03]: More games should be like Dead Rising.

06:23.631 --> 06:25.333
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Dead Rising's not perfect.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.835
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some things that need to be fixed for Dead Rising 2.

06:28.175 --> 06:30.056
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is that small-ass text size.

06:30.617 --> 06:31.698
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really hard to read.

06:31.758 --> 06:34.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Even on my HDTV, it's kind of hard to read the text.

06:34.059 --> 06:35.961
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have been bitching about this, but...

06:36.341 --> 06:38.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, the text has got to be fixed.

06:39.022 --> 06:41.764
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphical style of Dead Rising isn't for everybody.

06:42.684 --> 06:45.846
[SPEAKER_03]: I let Mikhail Tov watch me play for a little bit, and he's like, this game looks like crap.

06:45.986 --> 06:47.246
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, what are you smoking?

06:47.266 --> 06:48.047
[SPEAKER_03]: This game's beautiful.

06:48.667 --> 06:49.688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different art style.

06:50.228 --> 06:52.949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit cartoonish with the blood, but it's zombies.

06:53.009 --> 06:54.850
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be cartoonish.

06:56.451 --> 06:58.372
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing that kind of annoys me is the saving.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to save in a bathroom or on a couch.

07:02.734 --> 07:03.674
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really weird.

07:03.694 --> 07:04.675
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time you play, you're not...

07:05.623 --> 07:08.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Ready for the fact that you're going to die, and you're going to die fast.

07:08.826 --> 07:13.070
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you select the option that says save and quit, you literally start all over.

07:14.831 --> 07:18.414
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little weird because the game's main mode is a 72 hour mode.

07:18.454 --> 07:19.976
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not literally 72 hours.

07:20.276 --> 07:22.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki was telling me before the show every hour is 5 minutes.

07:22.618 --> 07:23.399
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't figure it out.

07:23.419 --> 07:25.461
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was running faster than a real hour though.

07:26.421 --> 07:27.162
[SPEAKER_03]: But the game was...

07:28.399 --> 07:43.506
[SPEAKER_03]: you know kinda interesting where you would start that over if you selected that but that's kinda cool because you get power yourself up more and more and then you know start the game in in that mode so I like powered myself up to level three and I was like you know I'll start over because I was getting my ass kicked by zombies

07:44.566 --> 07:47.867
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than those little bitches, I love the game.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.668
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact that you can take pictures of zombies.

07:51.648 --> 07:53.648
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was so hilarious.

07:54.368 --> 07:55.589
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those Mega Man guys called?

07:55.609 --> 07:56.549
[SPEAKER_03]: I can never remember their names.

07:56.569 --> 07:58.309
[SPEAKER_03]: With the little yellow heads.

07:58.669 --> 07:59.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Servbots, thank you.

07:59.830 --> 08:03.691
[SPEAKER_03]: I put the little Servbots head on a bunch of zombies and took pictures of them all walking around.

08:03.731 --> 08:04.591
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.

08:05.171 --> 08:05.591
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just...

08:06.055 --> 08:07.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting to use all these weapons on zombies.

08:07.915 --> 08:09.716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great aggression taking out game.

08:10.096 --> 08:18.438
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of wish from the start there was like a sandbox mode where it was more like the demo where it just drops you into a sea of zombies with all the items around you and you just start going.

08:18.458 --> 08:22.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I could do this game without the story for fun and just like a party.

08:22.358 --> 08:25.599
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, it would be nice if the game had multiplayer.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.499
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

08:27.319 --> 08:32.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oblivion didn't have multiplayer and it's a great game so it's not like the game has to have multiplayer but it would be so cool.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.521
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would just make a cool thing even cooler.

08:34.961 --> 08:35.101
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

08:36.058 --> 08:36.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead Rising.

08:36.718 --> 08:37.879
[SPEAKER_03]: I do recommend Dead Rising.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.559
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of you guys would have fun with it.

08:40.179 --> 08:43.460
[SPEAKER_03]: But just those little minor complaints aside might frustrate you for a little bit.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.502
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you take your aggression out on zombies with a lawnmower, and it's wonderful.

08:46.762 --> 08:48.742
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that hook that lets you pull their heads right off.

08:48.842 --> 08:49.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

08:49.843 --> 08:50.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds beautiful.

08:50.923 --> 08:51.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fun.

08:52.243 --> 08:52.904
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing is love.

08:53.064 --> 08:53.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing zombies is love.

08:54.664 --> 08:55.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

08:55.144 --> 08:59.826
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's Dead Rising, and then I also play more Prey because I'm slowly but surely trying to make my way through Prey still.

09:00.725 --> 09:02.847
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a great game because you never die.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.270
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's made for people who suck at first-person shooters like myself.

09:06.330 --> 09:07.251
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd never die.

09:07.571 --> 09:12.135
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go to a little spirit world, shoot some Medusa heads or whatever those things are, and then you come back to life.

09:12.476 --> 09:12.936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beautiful.

09:13.316 --> 09:13.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.

09:14.497 --> 09:16.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

09:18.180 --> 09:18.661
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

09:18.881 --> 09:26.948
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played Morgrantheth out of Liberty City Stories to tide me over until Vice City Stories comes out.

09:28.117 --> 09:30.618
[SPEAKER_02]: I kicked ass this week, so it was awesome.

09:31.598 --> 09:36.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Played Dead Rising, not too much though, just during lunches.

09:37.739 --> 09:43.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to play the lawnmower and chop zombies up with that, then pick up the lawnmower and just slam it into their head.

09:44.561 --> 09:52.843
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also, I played Chromehounds, and yes, I did play Chromehounds, and I have been on there, and no one's joined our clan.

09:53.543 --> 09:56.884
[SPEAKER_02]: One person, you know, Fire Resurrected, excellent, but...

09:59.662 --> 10:22.574
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you know talk about the chrome hounds thing in a minute yes it's just i'm ready to go and just no one else wants to but whatever um and then was it i watched someone play a game that will not be named it was cool and creepy but we'll talk about that at another time all right uh magsy chris anything you guys want to say what kind of games you've been playing this week

10:23.140 --> 10:24.861
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Animal Crossing on the plane.

10:25.301 --> 10:25.581
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

10:26.081 --> 10:27.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

10:27.341 --> 10:28.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they let you though?

10:28.062 --> 10:31.083
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought because the DS had the wireless they don't like it when you play DS on the plane.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.243
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have a problem with it.

10:32.423 --> 10:32.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's good.

10:33.203 --> 10:35.124
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried to finish Kingdom Hearts 2.

10:36.064 --> 10:39.025
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I was real smart and played it the first time around on proud mode.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.646
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm having a hard time beating it.

10:43.247 --> 10:44.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

10:44.427 --> 10:48.808
[SPEAKER_05]: And I played a really old school arcade machine Super Mario Brothers.

10:50.089 --> 10:50.509
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fun.

10:51.394 --> 10:52.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a big Mario fan?

10:52.094 --> 10:53.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I noticed you have Mario on your shirt.

10:53.635 --> 10:54.775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am a big Mario fan.

10:54.816 --> 10:59.898
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii and Super Paper Mario on the GameCube.

11:00.078 --> 11:02.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some people thought that Mario on the Wii looked kind of weird.

11:03.199 --> 11:03.499
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that okay?

11:03.519 --> 11:04.520
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario always looks weird.

11:07.681 --> 11:07.981
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

11:08.622 --> 11:08.862
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

11:09.982 --> 11:12.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I need to get from the lesbian perspective.

11:12.643 --> 11:14.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's better, Peach or Daisy?

11:14.484 --> 11:14.964
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Peach.

11:16.845 --> 11:17.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Why Peach?

11:17.666 --> 11:18.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she's hotter.

11:21.268 --> 11:23.910
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have you know, though, whenever I play Mario Party, I always play as Peach.

11:24.290 --> 11:25.551
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's also got attitude.

11:25.591 --> 11:27.032
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she's like, Peach is the winner!

11:27.593 --> 11:28.073
[SPEAKER_03]: That's me.

11:28.573 --> 11:30.134
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the winner whenever I play Mario Party.

11:30.354 --> 11:31.255
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just thought I'd share.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Any games you're looking forward to coming out soon?

11:33.556 --> 11:34.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirge of Cerberus.

11:35.037 --> 11:35.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

11:35.618 --> 11:36.258
[SPEAKER_03]: You like Vincent?

11:36.518 --> 11:37.319
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Vincent.

11:37.339 --> 11:39.220
[SPEAKER_05]: She made me.

11:39.560 --> 11:39.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mike?

11:41.342 --> 11:43.443
[SPEAKER_07]: She actually called when she was coming down here.

11:43.923 --> 11:45.685
[SPEAKER_07]: She had me go to the GameStop and reserve it.

11:48.466 --> 11:48.987
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

11:49.247 --> 11:50.648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm kind of...

11:51.961 --> 12:02.089
[SPEAKER_05]: I had it reserved at my GameStop, and I realized I was going to be here, and I was like, go to the GameStop and reserve it so I can get it.

12:02.109 --> 12:04.731
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys are going to play all night when it comes out?

12:05.371 --> 12:05.672
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

12:07.575 --> 12:14.037
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it a little bit, AE3, but it wasn't Final Fantasy enough for me because it's more like live action, which is cool.

12:14.057 --> 12:22.179
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's people that are into that more action-style game, but I'll still check it out when the final game comes out, make my final decision then, but I hope you enjoy it.

12:22.520 --> 12:26.381
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the first time I played through Final Fantasy VII, I never even got Vincent because I'm so stupid.

12:26.421 --> 12:27.601
[SPEAKER_03]: I never figured out to open the safe.

12:27.701 --> 12:29.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it took me forever to figure out how to get him.

12:31.522 --> 12:34.043
[SPEAKER_06]: I got him first time without the book.

12:34.143 --> 12:35.323
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, look at you.

12:35.343 --> 12:36.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

12:36.204 --> 12:37.104
[SPEAKER_06]: And Yuffie.

12:38.086 --> 12:39.727
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Yuffie's easy to get.

12:39.787 --> 12:40.707
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because Yuffie's easy.

12:41.668 --> 12:42.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, I'm sorry.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.389
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, anything you want to share about your gaming week?

12:45.250 --> 12:56.136
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, again, I'm a gamer in the old school sense, so I play D&D and stuff like that, but I do have Sims 2 on my Mac, and that kind of has me really, really addicted.

12:56.456 --> 12:57.596
[SPEAKER_07]: So I play a lot of that.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like to kill your Sims?

13:00.338 --> 13:01.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that's what Loki does.

13:01.999 --> 13:04.320
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some clever death traps you come up with for your Sims?

13:04.760 --> 13:05.921
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite one is...

13:06.872 --> 13:07.613
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.com

13:32.203 --> 13:34.026
[SPEAKER_03]: They scream, and they scream really loud.

13:34.146 --> 13:41.336
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a gay friend once who made his homo palace once on The Sims, and he put, what's the most number of Sims you can have in a house?

13:41.356 --> 13:41.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Like eight?

13:42.017 --> 13:44.320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, eight, and in this game I think you can have like

13:44.636 --> 13:45.957
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

14:04.277 --> 14:07.561
[SPEAKER_03]: and had to do the cooking for him and she finally died of exhaustion.

14:07.782 --> 14:11.988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so funny because she passes out in the middle of the room and the guys don't care.

14:12.388 --> 14:13.910
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still making out with each other and stuff.

14:13.930 --> 14:14.992
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, she just died.

14:15.713 --> 14:17.235
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny if you have them on...

14:18.123 --> 14:43.939
[SPEAKER_07]: I made the mistake of having put them on freestyle like they can pretty much if you're not paying attention they'll do whatever the heck they want and like four or five of my sims who weren't supposed to go make out with each other went and made out with each other because they've in the second game they've got like chemistry like lightning connection chemistry and they just ended up making out and then getting pissed at each other because they watched the person they just made out make out with somebody else so it's drama more Melrose Place oh yeah it was a sim soap opera

14:45.387 --> 14:47.209
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some of the fun stuff to do with the Sims, though.

14:47.229 --> 14:48.350
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's why that game's so popular.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.391
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to find my Sims 2 disc, because I miss playing it.

14:50.732 --> 14:51.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you play that online?

14:51.813 --> 14:53.754
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I guess you can't, because they have the Sims online.

14:54.895 --> 14:59.800
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of moot anyway, because my DVD drive on my PC is busted, so I'll have to get the Mac one anyway.

14:59.820 --> 15:02.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm getting my iMac soon!

15:02.082 --> 15:04.223
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

15:04.263 --> 15:05.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, I'm reading chat rooms.

15:05.665 --> 15:08.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other folks are sharing their Sims stories here.

15:08.747 --> 15:09.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Pooeater says,

15:09.969 --> 15:13.270
[SPEAKER_03]: I had made a house with each sim in their own room with only one thing.

15:13.591 --> 15:17.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, one would have a TV, one would have a fridge, one would have a toilet, then enjoy the show.

15:17.452 --> 15:20.013
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have to go to each other's houses to borrow things, I guess.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.374
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting.

15:22.714 --> 15:26.316
[SPEAKER_03]: And PKakura88 is clearing up the DS thing on the plane for me, saying...

15:26.869 --> 15:29.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's during takeoff and landing, it really doesn't matter.

15:29.492 --> 15:32.875
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because they make you turn off everything during takeoff and landing.

15:33.055 --> 15:33.976
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I fly enough.

15:34.036 --> 15:36.979
[SPEAKER_03]: I should know that, but I just never... For some reason, I never bring my DS.

15:37.059 --> 15:38.981
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of short flights to LA.

15:39.021 --> 15:43.025
[SPEAKER_05]: I had my iPod during takeoff and landing, and they didn't seem to care.

15:43.345 --> 15:43.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

15:43.826 --> 15:44.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

15:44.246 --> 15:47.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, either they didn't seem... The plane didn't crash, so...

15:50.143 --> 15:54.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you fly during all the chaos that was going on recently?

15:55.247 --> 15:58.029
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I actually totally missed all the chaos.

15:58.049 --> 16:01.232
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just recently hearing a little bit about what's been happening.

16:04.054 --> 16:07.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that we're getting into CNN podcasts, but this was basically...

16:08.141 --> 16:08.901
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

16:30.333 --> 16:35.176
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before we get into tonight's program, we have some housekeeping to take care of.

16:59.457 --> 17:01.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're smack-talking Bobby Blackwolf, then it's fine.

17:02.741 --> 17:05.003
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want to have a drama-free environment there.

17:05.043 --> 17:10.470
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made a whole new forum over there on OrangeMonster.com for folks to start clans and games.

17:10.510 --> 17:11.851
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been working out pretty well so far.

17:11.891 --> 17:17.838
[SPEAKER_03]: We have folks in Halo 2, and a couple folks in Guild Wars, and I noticed the Steam games are getting a lot of folks.

17:18.178 --> 17:20.261
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out over on OrangeMonster.com.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.907
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

17:35.273 --> 17:37.635
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of smack leading up to this tournament.

17:37.755 --> 17:40.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first off, no one has consulted me on anything in this.

17:40.598 --> 17:43.880
[SPEAKER_02]: They nominated me to play this damn game, for one.

17:44.381 --> 17:48.364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard enough when there's freaking Dead Rising coming out, because that game is very distracting.

17:48.704 --> 17:53.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when Chromehounds, they move really slow, there's no zombies in it, that kind of thing.

17:54.229 --> 17:59.974
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, for some reason, somehow, no rules were discussed at all, no ground rules, just somebody decided...

18:00.394 --> 18:00.914
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

18:20.686 --> 18:22.748
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need more people to do this.

18:22.768 --> 18:31.256
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, if you're a Chromehounds player, you want to have a little fun on Sunday about 1 o'clock Pacific time, please come to our forums and say you would like to participate.

18:31.336 --> 18:40.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'm going to have to figure out how to get in there and I'll play as Mr. Spanky in the Chromehounds Invitational and that's going to be kind of sad.

18:41.158 --> 18:41.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

18:54.875 --> 18:59.718
[SPEAKER_03]: GamerAndy better start working out to DDR, because he's going down.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the bad thing about Chromehounds, first off.

19:03.139 --> 19:07.682
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be online in order for people to sign up for your clan, which is retarded anyways.

19:08.502 --> 19:13.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what's the point of having that clan password thing if... I don't get it.

19:17.413 --> 19:18.294
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure something out.

19:18.334 --> 19:22.480
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, OL Army, save us so we don't embarrass ourselves too bad one week from today.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.481
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to embarrass myself.

19:23.501 --> 19:25.243
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, you know, that's kind of fucked up.

19:25.263 --> 19:26.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you can take them all on.

19:27.065 --> 19:27.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

19:27.706 --> 19:30.730
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just take them all on while they're attacking my base and shit.

19:30.770 --> 19:31.131
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be...

19:33.138 --> 19:33.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

19:33.899 --> 19:35.441
[SPEAKER_03]: Blaze does have a good point.

19:35.521 --> 19:39.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Hitstun from the OL Army has already owned Blackwolf and Tetris.

19:39.866 --> 19:42.749
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we lose miserably at this, at least it'll be evened up.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.411
[SPEAKER_03]: So there can't be a lot of shit talking.

19:45.332 --> 19:45.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do my best.

19:46.553 --> 19:46.854
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

19:46.874 --> 19:47.234
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

19:47.274 --> 19:48.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for the rest of them.

19:48.475 --> 19:48.856
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.921
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't be getting my ass handed to me.

19:52.122 --> 19:54.624
[SPEAKER_03]: So please, Chromehound players, we need your help.

19:55.084 --> 19:56.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to the OL Army forums immediately.

19:57.526 --> 20:03.350
[SPEAKER_03]: One other piece of housekeeping I want to get out there is that we actually have an addendum to a previously reported on story.

20:03.670 --> 20:10.996
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we try to report accurate information, but once in a while something's going to slip through the cracks that maybe wasn't correct.

20:11.136 --> 20:11.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

20:11.757 --> 20:19.823
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is interesting because not a lot of people know that this is not correct, but we've received a trusted anonymous tip

20:20.325 --> 20:22.506
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't tell you who it's from, but it's a trusted source.

20:23.006 --> 20:29.668
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're telling us that that song list we announced a couple shows back to elite beat agents that's run on a lot of sites is wrong.

20:30.208 --> 20:32.889
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might actually be good news for some people.

20:32.949 --> 20:36.950
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks that were a little disappointed at some of the picks, like didn't they have like Linkin Park and stuff on that list?

20:37.110 --> 20:37.530
[SPEAKER_08]: I think.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Hardware store.

20:38.890 --> 20:41.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which is kind of cool that, you know, Weird Al would have been okay with.

20:41.911 --> 20:47.693
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have received a tip that that is absolutely wrong and that only the demo songs are

20:48.291 --> 20:51.774
[SPEAKER_03]: are ones you can count on actually seeing in the full version, which would make sense.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.237
[SPEAKER_03]: But as for the rest of the song list, you'll just have to wait and see.

20:55.637 --> 21:01.682
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the last housekeeping thing, of course, we upped our cap on listeners.

21:01.762 --> 21:07.827
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, instead of capping out at 50 or whatever, we've got a lot more than that.

21:07.887 --> 21:11.510
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you can listen without worrying about, you know,

21:12.082 --> 21:12.843
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being able to.

21:12.943 --> 21:18.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so please come listen live to us on Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time on OrangeHandsRadio.com.

21:18.207 --> 21:21.590
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't get locked out of the feed anymore because we have plenty of room now.

21:22.210 --> 21:25.833
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, if you can't do it Sunday nights because you're watching, I don't know, what's on Sunday nights?

21:25.873 --> 21:26.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Touched by an Angel or whatever?

21:27.534 --> 21:28.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Desperate Housewives.

21:28.795 --> 21:29.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all those shows suck.

21:30.116 --> 21:33.059
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you... Buy a TiVo.

21:33.179 --> 21:33.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy a TiVo.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.603
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can't listen to us on Sunday... Okay, Magsie's making pouty faces at me.

21:39.244 --> 21:40.305
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get pouty face.

21:40.325 --> 21:41.146
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Grey's Anatomy.

21:41.246 --> 21:41.546
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you?

21:42.006 --> 21:44.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it just a bunch of doctors having sex with each other or something?

21:44.649 --> 21:44.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

21:44.929 --> 21:45.809
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Desperate Housewives.

21:45.829 --> 21:46.390
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty funny.

21:46.510 --> 21:47.231
[SPEAKER_03]: I just sound pretty hot.

21:47.351 --> 21:49.372
[SPEAKER_03]: So Desperate Housewives is a pretty hot show.

21:49.653 --> 21:50.513
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen a little bit of it.

21:50.533 --> 21:50.914
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty hot.

21:51.734 --> 22:03.564
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, if you have to watch your Desperate Housewives or Grey's Anatomy, you don't have a TiVo, you could always listen to the All Games Rebroadcast, which is Monday nights at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.

22:03.624 --> 22:06.026
[SPEAKER_03]: Also a little bit earlier for you East Coast folks.

22:07.852 --> 22:10.736
[SPEAKER_03]: and Central like Wisconsin if you want to listen to it live.

22:11.316 --> 22:18.066
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, podcast, podcast is love and we know there's lots of you guys that listen to us on the podcast feed and for that we're most appreciative.

22:18.126 --> 22:18.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a bunch.

22:19.423 --> 22:29.846
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news now, and we're going to start it off tonight with a story about the Wii, and I might be in trouble for that previous bet I made about how there's not going to be 20 games that Wii launch.

22:30.366 --> 22:47.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't look like there's going to be 21st party Wii games, so I'm going to have to go back and listen to the bet for sure, but it does look like there are going to be 27 Wii games that are released on the day the Wii is out, which of course is still unknown, but we do have 27 confirmed titles.

22:47.351 --> 22:48.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki seems to think it's going to be more than 27.

22:49.278 --> 22:49.940
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more than that.

22:50.541 --> 22:50.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

22:51.122 --> 22:53.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I know some that aren't even on that list.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to read this list real quick for you guys?

22:55.292 --> 22:55.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

22:56.501 --> 23:25.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Avatar, The Last Airbender, Blazing Angels, Blitz the League, Call of Duty 3, Cars, Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Dragon Quest Swords, The Masked Queen and the Tower of Mirrors, Elebits, Excite Truck, Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, Madden NFL 07, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Metal Slug Anthology, Metroid Prime 3 Corruption, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, and

23:25.879 --> 23:39.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Need for Speed Carbon, Open Season, Rayman Raving Rabbids, Red Steel, SpongeBob SquarePants, Creature from the Krusty Krab, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, Trauma Center, Second Opinion, and Wii Sports.

23:40.146 --> 23:47.430
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I ask you folks in studio, if you had to buy two of those games from that list, you only have enough money to buy two of the games, which two are you getting at launch?

23:47.730 --> 23:47.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

23:49.591 --> 23:50.692
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already got them on order.

23:50.952 --> 23:52.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel and...

23:55.690 --> 23:56.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you mention GT?

23:57.511 --> 23:58.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, GT Pro Series.

23:58.852 --> 24:00.053
[SPEAKER_02]: GT actually looks pretty good.

24:01.114 --> 24:01.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Steel and GT.

24:03.016 --> 24:04.257
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you don't know?

24:06.539 --> 24:07.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Do our other girls know?

24:07.240 --> 24:08.360
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzi, which two are you going to get?

24:09.101 --> 24:13.145
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm number one Nintendo fangirl in the world, so I'll be getting Zelda.

24:13.465 --> 24:17.989
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the second one, Red Steel, I think.

24:18.509 --> 24:19.070
[SPEAKER_03]: You like swords?

24:19.090 --> 24:19.650
[SPEAKER_03]: You like ninjas?

24:20.111 --> 24:21.572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just looked it over.

24:23.069 --> 24:23.970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, do you think you know?

24:24.210 --> 24:27.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm going to get Zelda and the Metal Slug Anthology.

24:29.815 --> 24:31.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you think you know which two you'd get?

24:32.477 --> 24:34.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably Zelda and Cars.

24:37.340 --> 24:37.781
[SPEAKER_03]: You dork.

24:39.802 --> 24:42.344
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you right now.

24:42.404 --> 24:43.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Which two would I get?

24:43.525 --> 24:45.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so glad you asked.

24:46.127 --> 24:46.768
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get three.

24:46.868 --> 24:47.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Three.

24:52.302 --> 24:54.463
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know, but in real life I'm going to get three.

24:54.844 --> 24:55.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but which two?

24:56.144 --> 25:01.227
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say... I'm going to say Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Excite Truck.

25:01.928 --> 25:03.449
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why I'm leaving... Excite Truck was cool.

25:03.509 --> 25:06.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why I'm leaving out Zelda, but I'm going to borrow yours.

25:06.251 --> 25:08.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're going to... We can trade.

25:09.873 --> 25:12.074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming to your house and playing your Zelda.

25:12.474 --> 25:14.854
[SPEAKER_05]: If we all get two, then we can all play each other's.

25:14.974 --> 25:15.795
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

25:16.195 --> 25:17.355
[SPEAKER_03]: We will play with each other's.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.535
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple things missing.

25:18.615 --> 25:21.576
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, where's Super Mario Galaxy?

25:22.296 --> 25:26.337
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed, but didn't Miyamoto say a while back that it may not be exactly ready at launch?

25:26.357 --> 25:28.678
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be in the launch window, and that's what these are anyways.

25:29.898 --> 25:32.920
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a few that I mentioned a couple weeks ago.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Rappala Trophies, which is supposed to be coming out for your fishing fans, I guess.

25:38.143 --> 25:44.287
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was also a couple that I'm mentioning this week that aren't on that list, and they're part of Midway's lineup.

25:45.067 --> 25:49.670
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, Midway, we announced weeks ago, Rampage Soul Destruction.

25:49.710 --> 25:51.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Now everybody's finally picked up on that.

25:52.252 --> 25:53.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more that are going to be added.

25:53.512 --> 25:55.994
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Happy Feet, which is based on that...

25:56.881 --> 25:59.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Really crappy movie that's coming out.

25:59.303 --> 26:00.644
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got happy feet.

26:01.665 --> 26:03.067
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see that.

26:03.767 --> 26:07.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I take the controllers to my feet and then do tap dancing?

26:08.171 --> 26:08.631
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fun.

26:08.651 --> 26:08.932
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

26:08.972 --> 26:13.656
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy are going to be getting in the game as well.

26:14.737 --> 26:17.579
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are going to be two coming from Midway.

26:17.719 --> 26:18.500
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more.

26:18.700 --> 26:22.804
[SPEAKER_02]: They're announcing seven at Let's Big in a couple weeks here.

26:22.864 --> 26:23.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's true.

26:23.444 --> 26:23.484
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

26:25.265 --> 26:26.407
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely not the fullest.

26:26.427 --> 26:30.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Funnydale says he's going to get a Barbie's Horse Adventure for the Wii when it comes out.

26:30.913 --> 26:31.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Is he going to be disappointed?

26:31.934 --> 26:33.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a launch game or no?

26:33.236 --> 26:34.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they even announced anything like that.

26:35.740 --> 26:36.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully.

26:36.561 --> 26:37.642
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fun with the Wii.

26:39.004 --> 26:39.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

26:40.926 --> 26:43.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's all I have to say on the Wii.

26:43.428 --> 26:45.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, go Wii.

26:45.589 --> 26:50.671
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, a few things that we're definitely speculating besides the launch date.

26:51.392 --> 26:55.654
[SPEAKER_02]: IGN's got speculation on the release date and the price point for it.

26:56.674 --> 26:57.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray!

26:57.675 --> 26:59.816
[SPEAKER_03]: More release date and price speculation.

26:59.876 --> 27:00.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Just what this show needed.

27:00.977 --> 27:09.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was just thinking this week, gosh, we really haven't had a story on release date or price point speculation in the past week.

27:09.501 --> 27:10.983
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really need one tonight.

27:11.063 --> 27:11.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Loki.

27:11.944 --> 27:13.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

27:13.725 --> 27:14.406
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

27:14.987 --> 27:24.015
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, their speculation is November 2nd or November 12th, because apparently their sources can't make up their minds on which it is.

27:24.864 --> 27:33.710
[SPEAKER_02]: because probably because no one knows yet because they've given them a, you know, have your games ready by, you know, this time period and then we'll, you know, announce a date then.

27:34.030 --> 27:36.391
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they don't have to launch with the third-party games.

27:36.452 --> 27:39.113
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because if they come a few weeks later, it's not going to matter.

27:39.754 --> 27:48.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the price point they've announced, they said $229 is going to be the price point and that, well, I don't know where they pulled that out of.

27:48.779 --> 27:49.640
[SPEAKER_05]: How about their ass?

27:50.821 --> 27:52.642
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that

27:53.595 --> 28:02.682
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I have heard every single date in the fourth quarter guessed for the Wii launch at work because I work at GameStop.

28:02.782 --> 28:06.144
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that everybody's guessed every single date for Wii launch.

28:06.444 --> 28:09.026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be sometime in the fourth quarter.

28:11.210 --> 28:14.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Folks, I have a big world exclusive for you guys.

28:14.112 --> 28:18.474
[SPEAKER_03]: We here at Orange Launch Radio, we are absolutely confident we know the release date of the Wii.

28:18.554 --> 28:19.375
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to give it to you.

28:19.435 --> 28:22.936
[SPEAKER_03]: We have inside sources that have told us the actual release date of the Wii.

28:22.976 --> 28:23.457
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is.

28:23.977 --> 28:27.319
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii will be released soon.

28:32.199 --> 29:00.110
[SPEAKER_02]: and when it comes out soon then you can say I heard that first on Orange Lounge Radio and they were right right on Orange Lounge Radio for guessing the release date of the Wii it was indeed soon well I'm actually saying I'm still sticking with October 18th just because it's the anniversary and you know but people say oh they don't release their systems on Wednesdays they release them on Sundays who gives a fuck okay honestly I mean

29:00.945 --> 29:01.865
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do whatever they want.

29:01.885 --> 29:02.545
[SPEAKER_02]: They're Nintendo.

29:03.625 --> 29:04.846
[SPEAKER_02]: They can say, you know what, bitches?

29:04.906 --> 29:06.446
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to release our game.

29:06.726 --> 29:08.566
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to release it on Wednesday because, you know what?

29:08.766 --> 29:09.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

29:09.727 --> 29:11.047
[SPEAKER_06]: It starts with a W and it's Wii.

29:11.727 --> 29:12.867
[SPEAKER_06]: And our new mascot is Wario.

29:13.907 --> 29:14.367
Waluigi.

29:14.687 --> 29:15.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Waluigi.

29:15.588 --> 29:16.608
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Wii Wednesdays.

29:16.888 --> 29:17.988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Waluigi's a pun.

29:19.168 --> 29:19.568
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

29:21.268 --> 29:24.849
[SPEAKER_03]: And demonstrating the Wii live on stage will be Giggling Lesbians.

29:25.089 --> 29:25.549
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.

29:26.109 --> 29:26.749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

29:27.470 --> 29:28.170
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to explain this.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Waluigi is a pun because...

29:31.571 --> 29:36.715
[SPEAKER_06]: It sort of is, but Wadoichi is because it would be sort of Wado-y, which is bad.

29:37.315 --> 29:40.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's why I thought that Wario was... Same thing, they're both the same.

29:42.058 --> 29:47.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night... Okay, no responding to things that aren't said in mics.

29:47.762 --> 29:48.123
Sorry.

29:48.603 --> 29:51.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now they think it's something dirty that you're responding to.

29:51.445 --> 29:57.049
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying... We got an explicit tag last week, so I'm trying to avoid it this week, please.

29:57.069 --> 29:58.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's not going to happen.

29:58.830 --> 29:58.910
[SPEAKER_03]: Even...

30:00.117 --> 30:01.838
[SPEAKER_03]: The lesbians are keeping it pretty clean tonight.

30:01.938 --> 30:04.640
[SPEAKER_03]: They left the pillows at home, so I'm pretty excited.

30:04.660 --> 30:05.381
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept it for you.

30:07.322 --> 30:08.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe during the afterbirth, we'll see.

30:09.403 --> 30:11.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's keep it moving.

30:11.845 --> 30:24.734
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Wario, and Waluigi, and the beautiful cast of the various Mario games, there is going to be a Mario Strikers sequel on the Wii.

30:26.295 --> 30:27.276
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a happy Megzi.

30:28.986 --> 30:30.488
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a fan of Mario Strikers?

30:30.508 --> 30:35.573
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think you'll like Wii Sports though because of Miyamoto's giant head as one of the characters?

30:47.989 --> 30:48.950
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know.

30:49.290 --> 30:59.217
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping that it'll be fun just because it's on the Wii and you actually get to do stuff as opposed to just pushing a button on a remote control and then whoever throws the football.

31:00.258 --> 31:06.723
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a video of me on YouTube that somebody took of playing Wii Sports and I look like I'm not having any fun at all.

31:06.903 --> 31:07.984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most depressing thing.

31:08.184 --> 31:10.846
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really enjoyed the game and I was just exhausted from the day.

31:10.986 --> 31:11.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi, news story.

31:11.846 --> 31:12.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

31:12.567 --> 31:13.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Rob.

31:16.169 --> 31:16.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear God.

31:20.373 --> 31:22.474
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't worship you, but I do adore you.

31:22.974 --> 31:23.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

31:23.415 --> 31:23.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

31:24.175 --> 31:25.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.317
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.

31:27.557 --> 31:35.483
[SPEAKER_06]: So they actually were saying that Super Mario Strikers was supposed to, the sequel was supposed to be one of the games that was announced at the Games Convention in Germany.

31:36.263 --> 31:40.406
[SPEAKER_06]: And this speculation is going to be like a, you know, an online multiplayer Strikers.

31:41.246 --> 31:42.587
[SPEAKER_06]: So that sounds like it's a pretty good deal.

31:42.827 --> 31:44.268
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm done, Rob.

31:44.728 --> 31:45.429
[SPEAKER_06]: You can interrupt me.

31:45.851 --> 31:53.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to say this from chat, is that Ari Mosson of the Oil Army thinks he has the new marketing campaign for the Nintendo Wii.

31:53.596 --> 32:00.180
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's this giant enemy lesbian, and you attack its weak point for massive pleasure.

32:00.700 --> 32:02.661
[SPEAKER_03]: Massive pleasure, because it's a lesbian.

32:06.344 --> 32:07.144
[SPEAKER_03]: I love our chat room.

32:08.205 --> 32:09.806
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and kisses to the OLR chat.

32:11.610 --> 32:14.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I will check out Super Mario Strikers on the Wii.

32:14.212 --> 32:15.173
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be fun, I bet.

32:15.914 --> 32:16.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not.

32:16.735 --> 32:17.195
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

32:17.476 --> 32:18.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's stupid.

32:19.918 --> 32:23.441
[SPEAKER_02]: The original game was stupid, and this one will be equally as stupid.

32:23.461 --> 32:24.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Macy's going to punch you.

32:26.864 --> 32:27.505
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, look.

32:27.765 --> 32:32.009
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a Squeenix story to break up the hate a little bit here in the room?

32:32.269 --> 32:34.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeenix are what we like to call Square Enix.

32:34.791 --> 32:37.454
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them Squeenix because a lot of their games make us squee.

32:38.778 --> 32:50.878
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's going on there is that Yoishi Wada, who is the president of Square, spoke recently about what game creators need to do for next-gen platforms and how developers will have to work together to move the industry forward.

32:51.899 --> 32:52.661
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a quote here.

32:53.453 --> 32:59.035
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the reasons Square Enix will collaborate with Taito, a company that produces physical hardware, he said.

32:59.436 --> 33:03.237
[SPEAKER_03]: In our talks with Taito, ideas for an actual physical product have come up.

33:03.657 --> 33:05.838
[SPEAKER_03]: In any case, we will be releasing some thing.

33:06.419 --> 33:10.681
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting in that it's not the sort of thing you would expect from Square Enix.

33:11.341 --> 33:14.102
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're talking about releasing a thing.

33:14.762 --> 33:16.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a hardware thing.

33:16.363 --> 33:20.065
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not talking about that sword from Dragon Quest.

33:21.105 --> 33:22.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this game console?

33:22.526 --> 33:22.926
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

33:23.866 --> 33:29.250
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a game that does not have the word final or fantasy in the title.

33:29.270 --> 33:30.651
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a trans vibrator.

33:32.012 --> 33:33.333
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

33:34.234 --> 33:40.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe it's a... I think maybe something they might do is maybe a dedicated... Like, you remember those old Game & Watch type games?

33:41.098 --> 33:45.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something like that, but a little more souped up, but a square franchise or product.

33:45.982 --> 33:49.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe something like a game, a standalone game, plug-and-play type.

33:49.124 --> 33:52.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, I'm sure it's going to be another sequel to Final Fantasy VII.

33:53.888 --> 33:54.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's a console?

33:55.529 --> 33:55.729
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

33:56.249 --> 33:56.409
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

33:56.609 --> 33:57.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Too crowded?

33:57.470 --> 33:59.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Too crowded, and... No.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.392
[SPEAKER_03]: You just don't see Square Enix getting into console?

34:02.432 --> 34:05.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, in Japan, they might do really well with a console.

34:05.554 --> 34:05.714
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

34:06.114 --> 34:10.116
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be Final Fantasy VII, Yuffie hits puberty or something.

34:10.136 --> 34:12.517
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be, okay, I like Megzy's idea.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have Aerith as a zombie, and you have to go around and shoot her.

34:21.076 --> 34:22.858
[SPEAKER_06]: Again and again and again.

34:22.878 --> 34:23.758
[SPEAKER_06]: And she keeps coming back.

34:24.739 --> 34:26.040
[SPEAKER_06]: You just keep killing her.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.781
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the holy zombie.

34:27.801 --> 34:30.864
[SPEAKER_03]: FireResurrected sent me a private message, and of course I read those publicly.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.906
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not encouraging you to send me private messages, please.

34:33.946 --> 34:37.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I get inundated with them during the show, but I thought this comment was good.

34:37.289 --> 34:39.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Squeenix is releasing an arcade machine.

34:39.531 --> 34:40.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Taito makes arcade machines.

34:42.386 --> 34:43.566
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good thought.

34:43.586 --> 34:45.627
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Puzzle Bobble featuring Cloud.

34:46.067 --> 34:47.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this idea from Firebomba.

34:47.808 --> 34:48.768
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved Urgeis.

34:49.028 --> 34:50.208
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Urgeis in the arcades?

34:50.409 --> 34:51.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Urgeis was in the arcades.

34:51.969 --> 34:53.469
[SPEAKER_06]: It was an arcade game first.

34:53.810 --> 34:59.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy 13 versus on the, you know, in the arcades.

34:59.992 --> 35:00.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.852
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to go play, the bowling alley used to play DDR.

35:02.872 --> 35:04.853
[SPEAKER_06]: They had an Urgeis machine there and a virtual lawn.

35:05.013 --> 35:05.673
[SPEAKER_06]: I lived there.

35:07.254 --> 35:07.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

35:08.154 --> 35:08.354
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

35:08.714 --> 35:10.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, speaking of stuff...

35:11.860 --> 35:12.220
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.

35:14.421 --> 35:18.682
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another person out there making something very interesting soon.

35:18.702 --> 35:24.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently some fan on the internet decided they want their Madden holiday to be coming a little bit early.

35:24.704 --> 35:27.505
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've put out this fake Madden coupon.

35:27.525 --> 35:33.167
[SPEAKER_02]: A preferred customer coupon that's basically supposed to get you the game when they get it.

35:33.227 --> 35:36.168
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, you know, most of the retail stores are getting it a week early.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.029
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they can get it before street day.

35:39.409 --> 35:40.830
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hilarious because

35:41.817 --> 35:45.659
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360, XBOX PlayStation 2, and GameCube versions available at participating stores only.

36:07.972 --> 36:11.375
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically entitles you to get in the game.

36:11.775 --> 36:12.736
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the keyword!

36:16.619 --> 36:18.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Participating stores only.

36:20.082 --> 36:21.623
[SPEAKER_06]: You still have to participate.

36:23.004 --> 36:29.850
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think there's going to be some employee at a Walmart, Target, Kmart type store that's going to fall for this or GameStop.

36:30.010 --> 36:34.073
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll go ahead and scan in said coupon or not know of it.

36:34.194 --> 36:35.875
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to sell it to this guy.

36:37.249 --> 36:38.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, I mean, fine.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.512
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and try to get your free Madden game early.

36:42.352 --> 36:49.237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Madden, come on, it's not that different from last year, so if you're really in a hurry to get it, go right ahead.

36:49.317 --> 36:55.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, my understanding is the Madden fans were pretty disappointed with Madden 06 on the 360, so they're really looking forward to Madden 07.

36:55.621 --> 36:58.824
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because something else is better than something crappy, I guess.

36:59.924 --> 37:00.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but...

37:01.994 --> 37:02.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, good luck.

37:02.775 --> 37:12.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and by the way, it says they forgot to run the coupon through Spellchecker because they, you know, misspelled include.

37:12.401 --> 37:13.082
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inclus.

37:13.422 --> 37:13.882
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.

37:14.503 --> 37:15.443
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job, Forgers.

37:17.345 --> 37:26.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of EA and upcoming releases, Spore, you might need a coupon to get this early because apparently 2007, and we're not talking early 2007, but more like the...

37:30.750 --> 37:35.232
[SPEAKER_03]: The second half of 2007 is when you're going to be getting Spore.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.674
[SPEAKER_03]: This game seems to be getting pushed back and back.

37:37.754 --> 37:49.380
[SPEAKER_03]: I originally remembered this was going to be late 2006, but now it looks like February or mid-2007, at least online game retailers GameStop.com and EBGames.com have that list.

37:50.040 --> 37:53.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Wright seemed to say that it's not going to make it until July 2007.

37:53.522 --> 37:57.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, we're saying the second half of next year, 2007, for now.

37:58.965 --> 38:01.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, so this game is really getting pushed back.

38:01.206 --> 38:04.589
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the game looks like it did, this game is epic.

38:05.329 --> 38:07.130
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Sims x 5.

38:07.771 --> 38:10.272
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just freaking huge, this game.

38:11.273 --> 38:12.133
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be something else.

38:12.453 --> 38:15.775
[SPEAKER_03]: If for nothing else than to throw aliens from your tractor beam in the ship.

38:15.815 --> 38:16.856
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of fun.

38:17.216 --> 38:17.917
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

38:18.317 --> 38:20.358
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do know some games that will be coming out.

38:20.779 --> 38:24.521
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll go ahead and make this mention now since I'm not going to be on the show next week.

38:25.485 --> 38:28.726
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm going to go ahead and do the next two weeks of European release dates.

38:28.926 --> 38:29.446
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that sound?

38:29.866 --> 38:32.066
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially since there's all the crap coming out this week.

38:33.287 --> 38:45.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, on the 18th we have Pathologic, um, Premier Manager 2006-2007, Pro Shirt Golf, blah blah blah, uh, SpecNAS, Project Wolf, uh, Spinout on PSP.

38:45.669 --> 38:48.630
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 23rd we have Texas Hold'em, 25th, a bunch of good stuff.

38:49.090 --> 38:51.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Dig Dug, Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, yay.

38:53.544 --> 38:55.765
[SPEAKER_06]: PowerWorld, and Reservoir Dogs.

38:56.465 --> 39:00.427
[SPEAKER_06]: And also Syphon Filter, Dark Mirror, and World War I Aces of the Sky.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.167
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all European releases.

39:04.268 --> 39:04.708
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

39:05.809 --> 39:11.451
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as releases go for this week, it's definitely going to be a lot better than last week, but not by much.

39:12.271 --> 39:15.672
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Final Fantasy VII Dirge of Service on the PlayStation 2.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, 99 Nights on the Xbox 360.

39:18.673 --> 39:18.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

39:22.084 --> 39:22.825
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about that one.

39:23.085 --> 39:31.370
[SPEAKER_02]: On the DS, you're getting Deep Labyrinth from Atlus and Freedom Wings, which is kind of like a pilot wings shooter type game.

39:31.690 --> 39:36.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like something I'd find in the women's sanitation aisle at the store, or sanitary things.

39:37.874 --> 39:38.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.

39:39.771 --> 39:47.334
[SPEAKER_02]: The Ever Generic World Racing 2 on the Xbox, and Zonide on the Xbox, which is good for those Hikaruku fans out there.

39:47.954 --> 39:58.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, next week we have Madden NFL 07 coming out, as well as Pac-Man World Rally, and doing a re-release of Zoo and Zookeeper on DS.

39:58.719 --> 39:59.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

39:59.439 --> 40:00.079
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.600
[SPEAKER_02]: You can play Zookeeper online, it's called Bejeweled.

40:03.881 --> 40:05.701
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rappala Trophies on the PSP.

40:08.715 --> 40:10.136
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:33.294 --> 40:43.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, some of the other ones I thought were interesting, Bioshock and Darkness, are both coming out on April 5th, so check those out.

40:44.037 --> 40:54.760
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of my favorites, of course, would be the Konami games, and I'm sure we're going to hear more of this coming pretty soon, but DDR Universe is scheduled for December 2nd.

40:55.976 --> 40:57.077
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be pretty good.

40:57.277 --> 40:59.058
[SPEAKER_02]: And Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

40:59.358 --> 41:01.140
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big pushback for Universe, isn't it?

41:01.160 --> 41:04.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember Universe was originally scheduled earlier.

41:04.722 --> 41:10.046
[SPEAKER_02]: And Karaoke Revolution American Idol is going to be coming out, looks like, December 6th.

41:10.506 --> 41:13.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Ultramix 4, that's going to be coming out November 15th.

41:14.029 --> 41:19.033
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really interesting about it is the price for the actual game by itself, only $29.99.

41:19.853 --> 41:20.954
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty good.

41:21.574 --> 41:22.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing...

41:23.456 --> 41:28.400
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention, because we're going to be talking about game prices later on, some cheap games and stuff.

41:29.181 --> 41:37.167
[SPEAKER_02]: One game that is out there that's probably the cheapest 360 game you're going to find, and this just dropped in price, heard it here first, Ridge Racer 6, $19.99.

41:38.428 --> 41:42.351
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find it now at all participating retailers out there.

41:42.411 --> 41:42.631
[SPEAKER_02]: So, $19.99.

41:42.671 --> 41:49.016
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, that game is not a bad game, but for some reason, the worst selling game in the United States for the 360s, so...

41:51.144 --> 41:51.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Bully in Europe

42:05.534 --> 42:14.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Rockstar saying that the October release date was going to apply to Europe as well as the U.S.

42:15.781 --> 42:24.026
[SPEAKER_06]: The British Board of Film Classification said that they were having issues with the title, but they said it wasn't anywhere near ready.

42:24.086 --> 42:27.749
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Rockstar saying it's on its way.

42:28.790 --> 42:29.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

42:29.730 --> 42:30.731
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty interesting.

42:31.397 --> 42:31.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good stuff.

42:32.278 --> 42:35.240
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking forward to Bully after seeing the trailer this week.

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
[SPEAKER_02]: The trailer looks good.

42:36.520 --> 42:37.901
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched it yet.

42:37.921 --> 42:38.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you nodding your head.

42:39.082 --> 42:40.683
[SPEAKER_03]: What's exciting you about the game Bully?

42:41.404 --> 42:43.905
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so when I was a kid in school, I was a bully.

42:45.106 --> 42:46.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, you were the bully?

42:46.187 --> 42:46.987
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the bully.

42:47.108 --> 42:47.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

42:47.448 --> 42:53.432
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm looking forward to that game and reliving my days as an evil bully in a Catholic school.

42:53.452 --> 42:55.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I thought it was the other way around, that you beat up the bullies.

42:56.234 --> 42:57.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I thought it was that you are the bully.

42:59.015 --> 43:01.217
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I think in a good game you get to play both ends of it.

43:02.043 --> 43:04.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, settle this, because you've been following this game more than I have.

43:04.845 --> 43:06.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the bully, or are you the person beating up the bully?

43:07.386 --> 43:13.170
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're the person, you're just kind of a kid there, and you're being bullied, and I think you might also be the bully.

43:13.190 --> 43:14.771
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of like this kid that's just trouble.

43:16.012 --> 43:16.893
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that'll work.

43:17.133 --> 43:26.739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you're trouble, but you've gotten introduced to this, you know, basically kind of like a private school, so you're no longer, you know,

43:27.737 --> 43:31.020
[SPEAKER_02]: The big one on campus, you know, you're kind of, you know, getting bullied.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.662
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are bullied, but you're also getting bullied at the same time.

43:33.742 --> 43:36.084
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically school mayhem and that kind of stuff.

43:36.244 --> 43:37.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, it's violence.

43:37.805 --> 43:38.666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's violence.

43:38.686 --> 43:40.707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's violence, and it makes Jack Thompson angry.

43:40.888 --> 43:42.489
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how can you go wrong?

43:42.509 --> 43:46.192
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has schoolgirls making out with people, so that's awesome.

43:46.232 --> 43:48.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes our lesbians in-house very happy.

43:48.354 --> 43:49.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that makes me happy.

43:49.515 --> 43:51.836
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, Catholic school...

43:52.967 --> 43:55.428
[SPEAKER_07]: CatholicSkullGirls in those cute little outfits.

43:55.448 --> 43:56.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are hot little skirts.

43:57.188 --> 43:58.709
[SPEAKER_07]: I just bought a DVD that has those in them.

43:59.609 --> 43:59.989
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa!

44:00.049 --> 44:00.769
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

44:00.809 --> 44:00.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

44:01.209 --> 44:01.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

44:01.690 --> 44:02.130
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa!

44:02.170 --> 44:02.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello!

44:02.630 --> 44:03.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Where have you been shopping lately?

44:04.710 --> 44:05.691
[SPEAKER_07]: Castro Street.

44:06.931 --> 44:07.371
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

44:09.952 --> 44:10.232
[SPEAKER_03]: Well.

44:11.164 --> 44:14.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along, let's talk about Xbox Live Arcade.

44:14.745 --> 44:24.687
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Major Nelson's blog is saying that the Xbox Live Wednesday thing was over with the release of Pac-Man this week, which, by the way, I forgot to mention I did download and play this week.

44:25.847 --> 44:26.948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pac-Man, you know.

44:28.228 --> 44:29.148
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you're getting into.

44:29.228 --> 44:35.850
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't played Pac-Man yet, I don't think you're really a gamer if you haven't played Pac-Man at some point in your life.

44:36.910 --> 44:39.651
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what to expect from the Xbox version of Pac-Man.

44:39.811 --> 44:40.671
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of frills.

44:41.109 --> 44:42.910
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, you get achievements, but Pac-Man is Pac-Man.

44:43.310 --> 44:44.811
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, Major Nelson says that's it.

44:45.092 --> 44:45.492
[SPEAKER_03]: No more.

44:45.812 --> 44:49.935
[SPEAKER_03]: But the official Xbox magazine seems to be begging to differ a little bit.

44:49.975 --> 44:58.621
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a release schedule, which includes August 16th, Texas Hold'em, August 23rd, Time Pilot, which Jamie was on the ColecoVision at one point.

44:59.501 --> 45:00.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Why you saw that.

45:01.062 --> 45:05.846
[SPEAKER_03]: August 30th, Scramble, and September 6th, Luminous Live.

45:05.926 --> 45:08.667
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the one I'm sure a lot of folks are looking forward to there.

45:09.088 --> 45:12.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Time Pilot and Scramble, by the way, are old-ass Konami games, if you've never heard of them.

45:12.390 --> 45:13.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Time Pilot.

45:13.191 --> 45:17.273
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played a Time Pilot arcade machine back in the day, and I wasn't half bad at it.

45:17.313 --> 45:22.397
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who may remember, Nick Arcade Time Pilot was one of the games that they did play on the show.

45:22.477 --> 45:23.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it really?

45:23.277 --> 45:23.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

45:23.838 --> 45:24.238
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.

45:24.258 --> 45:26.239
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the games they played frequently on the show.

45:27.921 --> 45:28.481
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

45:29.773 --> 45:34.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic the Hedgehog, Shinobi, Phantasy Star, Golden Axe

45:56.013 --> 46:02.658
[SPEAKER_06]: Vector Man, Sword of Vermillion, Comic Zone, Alex Kidd, and Ristar was another one mentioned.

46:04.399 --> 46:06.060
[SPEAKER_06]: But those are all games that I'm all over.

46:06.300 --> 46:07.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it sound like something you're going to get?

46:08.061 --> 46:08.902
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yeah.

46:09.202 --> 46:16.367
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as I have Alex Kidd and Shinobi World, I'll be really happy because it's actually... I mean, true, that wasn't necessarily a Genesis game.

46:16.387 --> 46:17.888
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my favorite Master System game.

46:18.428 --> 46:20.370
[SPEAKER_06]: And that started the whole Alex Kidd thing for me.

46:21.350 --> 46:21.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

46:22.811 --> 46:25.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this collection sound like something you want to pick up, Loki?

46:25.073 --> 46:25.153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

46:26.992 --> 46:27.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

46:27.612 --> 46:28.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for me.

46:28.452 --> 46:31.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Because honestly, most of them are already available on GameTap.

46:32.473 --> 46:38.734
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree that there's a certain charm being able to have this stuff on the go, like on the PSP and stuff.

46:39.114 --> 46:42.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Which seems to me like maybe a response to all the emulation scene.

46:42.815 --> 46:44.855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all the emulators have been going on on the PSP.

46:44.895 --> 46:46.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is a response to that.

46:46.316 --> 46:50.016
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, if I was going to go by that standpoint, there wouldn't be any point.

46:50.036 --> 46:52.977
[SPEAKER_06]: Because almost all of these games I own Genesis cartridges of.

46:53.948 --> 46:54.188
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

46:54.588 --> 47:04.194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but at the same time, it's convenient to have them on one disc so I can sit down with my controller in front of my TV and play them instead of sit in front of my computer.

47:04.314 --> 47:06.995
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to sit in front of my computer and play a game, I'm going to be on Warcraft.

47:10.817 --> 47:12.418
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep it moving here.

47:13.379 --> 47:15.180
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do a comment here in our chat room.

47:15.620 --> 47:21.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendomaniac64 says, Sega doesn't seem to realize that a lot of the gamers into Sega stuff have GameCubes.

47:21.523 --> 47:22.944
[SPEAKER_03]: So, seeming to think that...

47:24.595 --> 47:26.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the Sega fans were actually into GameCubes.

47:28.156 --> 47:30.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, possibly, but you know what?

47:30.557 --> 47:35.299
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wii and the Virtual Console thing I think will take care of most of the Sega fan stuff on there.

47:35.319 --> 47:37.559
[SPEAKER_02]: It shouldn't be a problem.

47:38.220 --> 47:41.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, I want to go to this story about Japan.

47:41.681 --> 47:42.541
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a very...

47:43.277 --> 47:45.939
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcade Longevity Welcome to the arcades of Tokyo.

47:45.959 --> 47:48.462
[SPEAKER_03]: In Asia and particularly Japan, video game rooms not only live but thrive.

48:04.796 --> 48:12.723
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 9,500 arcades in the country with more than 445,000 game machines made by Japanese companies like Namco and Capcom.

48:13.764 --> 48:15.705
[SPEAKER_03]: In the US, of course, the story is much different.

48:16.066 --> 48:21.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Arcades are a rapidly dying breed with only about 3,000 in operation down from 10,000 a decade ago.

48:22.151 --> 48:25.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Though the popularity of home video systems like the PlayStation contributed to the decline,

48:26.815 --> 48:34.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Akagi says that execs at US companies like Midway and Atari simply couldn't see the future in arcades and abandoned the coin-op business.

48:34.662 --> 48:40.588
[SPEAKER_03]: And the article kind of goes on to make the speculation that what happened over in Japan as opposed to here is that here...

48:41.531 --> 48:45.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the kids who used to go to arcades grew up and moved into home console gaming.

48:45.956 --> 48:52.182
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Japan, most of the kids that played arcades have grown up still going to arcades and still in that whole scene.

48:53.103 --> 48:58.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know that Orange Lounge Radio was sort of born of an arcade thing.

48:59.130 --> 49:03.034
[SPEAKER_03]: We all met playing DDR, which was a big arcade phenomenon at the time.

49:03.373 --> 49:06.955
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what you guys think about this story about arcades in Japan versus the U.S.

49:07.015 --> 49:12.377
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to guess that the arcades in Japan probably are better maintained than the arcades in the United States.

49:13.498 --> 49:14.739
[SPEAKER_02]: You think so?

49:14.859 --> 49:15.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it?

49:15.659 --> 49:16.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?

49:16.980 --> 49:25.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because, I don't know, the American arcades out there, they just pretty much have them just to kind of fill space, it seems like.

49:25.804 --> 49:31.387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like at movie theaters, something to kill time for the little kids, you know, get out of mommy and daddy's, you know, hair.

49:32.556 --> 49:37.999
[SPEAKER_02]: or like in, you know, Sunsplash or something, you know, just the kill time while you're waiting for water slides or something like that.

49:38.079 --> 49:39.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthday Central.

49:39.220 --> 49:39.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Birthdays, yeah.

49:40.360 --> 49:43.442
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just let the machines go to crap, so.

49:43.902 --> 49:53.507
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's also this little thing, you know, I think it especially applies to America in general, where they think you hit a certain age, you grow up, you don't do this anymore.

49:54.548 --> 49:58.970
[SPEAKER_06]: In your home, you can play your video game, but you don't go out, you know, as an adult and play DDR or

49:59.571 --> 50:01.193
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, of course, I beg to differ with, of course.

50:01.253 --> 50:05.056
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's still that... It's still sort of taboo, you know.

50:05.917 --> 50:06.838
[SPEAKER_06]: You're supposed to be grown up.

50:07.919 --> 50:11.822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, because I noticed even when we were playing DDR, we used to get a lot of funny stares.

50:11.882 --> 50:13.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are those guys doing?

50:13.624 --> 50:17.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't they, you know, be accounting or something?

50:18.128 --> 50:19.329
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so gay!

50:19.489 --> 50:22.592
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in a good way.

50:25.374 --> 50:25.975
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

50:27.064 --> 50:28.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really hate that.

50:28.064 --> 50:30.985
[SPEAKER_03]: People who don't know any better, they go, DDR so gay.

50:31.345 --> 50:35.167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, so what if it has flashing pink lights and, you know, Madonna music?

50:35.227 --> 50:38.808
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's something everybody can have fun with, right?

50:39.768 --> 50:43.469
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still, though, I think it's just a whole matter of attitude, you know.

50:43.709 --> 50:49.071
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, you know, 40-year-old businessmen in Japan get off work and go play DDR or poppin' music or something.

50:49.631 --> 50:50.291
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not gay.

50:50.751 --> 50:50.971
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

50:51.632 --> 50:52.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we don't know that.

50:52.432 --> 50:53.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they might be.

50:53.092 --> 50:53.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Some might be.

50:53.632 --> 50:54.593
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

50:54.633 --> 50:55.133
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

50:55.173 --> 50:55.693
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if they're gay?

50:56.846 --> 50:57.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzi, you have a thought on this?

50:58.007 --> 50:58.187
What?

50:58.527 --> 50:59.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a thought on this?

50:59.787 --> 51:03.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I see you with the mic, so I thought... Are you an arcade gamer?

51:03.389 --> 51:04.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, somewhat.

51:05.390 --> 51:07.551
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is an arcade, I will play in it.

51:08.812 --> 51:10.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever been to an arcade in Japan?

51:10.372 --> 51:10.813
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I have.

51:11.033 --> 51:12.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, what was it like when you were there?

51:13.614 --> 51:19.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I was only there for a little bit because our train was leaving, but it was very well kept, from what I remember.

51:19.337 --> 51:20.117
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's the difference.

51:20.697 --> 51:23.579
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is, in Japan, they play Beatmania.

51:23.879 --> 51:26.040
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, they beat their spouse.

51:30.322 --> 51:30.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

51:31.303 --> 51:32.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Your logic is infallible.

51:33.264 --> 51:33.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

51:34.325 --> 51:35.005
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm awesome.

51:35.145 --> 51:36.266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we need to know.

51:36.546 --> 51:38.127
[SPEAKER_06]: By infallible, I mean not really.

51:39.848 --> 51:51.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of couples not getting along here, one couple, the E3 little guys and the ESA, you know those wonderful Kensha Hall exhibitors?

51:51.536 --> 51:54.978
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really getting along too well with the ESA.

51:55.278 --> 51:58.921
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, the ESA sent out some letters to these

51:59.865 --> 52:05.030
[SPEAKER_02]: Small Kitchen Hall people kind of informing them of what's going on with E3 next year.

52:05.630 --> 52:21.484
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically they said, as you may have read in the press releases, the E3 Expo has officially been cancelled and it's involving and matured over the last 12 years and now the needs of the exhibitors and the key attendees has also changed.

52:22.228 --> 52:28.950
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it should also say in, like, fine print, by the way, you're not a key attendee because you do not have, you know, booth in the bigger hall.

52:29.090 --> 52:30.131
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fuck you.

52:31.071 --> 52:34.392
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ESA essentially wrote these people a letter that says, K, thanks, bye.

52:34.692 --> 52:39.394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically, it's basically like this.

52:39.454 --> 52:44.356
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, dear people from Kenja Hall, it's not you, it's us.

52:44.936 --> 52:47.617
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to see other people.

52:48.357 --> 52:48.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

52:50.240 --> 52:51.601
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could be friends.

52:55.726 --> 52:59.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Some days, Kensha Hall, I just want to cuddle.

53:00.551 --> 53:02.173
[SPEAKER_03]: But you guys are so demanding.

53:04.515 --> 53:10.401
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand that my life is moving on and I need to move on too.

53:10.542 --> 53:11.763
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need some distance.

53:13.857 --> 53:20.459
[SPEAKER_02]: We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sincere, profound gratitude for your past support of this event.

53:20.779 --> 53:28.781
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been exciting and rewarding to see the growth and significance of this industry mirrored on the exhibit floor of the E3 Expo through the years.

53:28.881 --> 53:33.143
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to many years of industry growth and viability and opportunity without you.

53:33.403 --> 53:35.783
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically added there on the end there.

53:37.444 --> 53:37.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

53:39.464 --> 53:40.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, but that'd be funny.

53:41.539 --> 53:46.803
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie, though, Red Octane, I mean, with all due respect to Red Octane and the Guitar Heroes, it's a fluke.

53:47.163 --> 53:49.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody expected Guitar Hero to do as well as it did.

53:49.625 --> 53:53.107
[SPEAKER_03]: Them being there, you know, it was a fluke.

53:53.127 --> 53:54.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I expected it to do well.

53:54.588 --> 53:58.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but I'm talking about, you know, we're different because we've always loved music.

53:58.431 --> 53:59.212
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're different.

53:59.252 --> 53:59.832
[SPEAKER_03]: We're special.

54:00.233 --> 54:02.574
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking about like the mainstream folks.

54:02.854 --> 54:09.980
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nobody would have thought Guitar Hero would have done as well as it really did until people actually played it and found out, wow, it's actually kind of fun.

54:10.000 --> 54:10.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

54:11.234 --> 54:12.536
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the whole Red Octane is a fluke.

54:12.776 --> 54:17.199
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think had there been an E3 next year, Red Octane would have graduated to the big hall.

54:17.660 --> 54:20.843
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to go to the big boy chair, Red Octane!

54:20.903 --> 54:21.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to laugh.

54:21.963 --> 54:25.326
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Fry's this week, an electronic store that we have over here.

54:25.346 --> 54:26.828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this giant.

54:27.388 --> 54:32.212
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was watching this woman watch her son play Guitar Hero, and she kept yelling at him.

54:32.733 --> 54:36.636
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like watching someone play DDR instead of saying, Left!

54:36.796 --> 54:37.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

54:37.236 --> 54:37.557
[SPEAKER_02]: Right!

54:37.717 --> 54:37.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

54:37.937 --> 54:38.017
[SPEAKER_02]: Left!

54:38.577 --> 54:39.038
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

54:39.118 --> 54:39.618
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

54:39.718 --> 54:40.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Green!

54:40.319 --> 54:40.759
[SPEAKER_02]: Red!

54:41.360 --> 54:42.921
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not helping.

54:43.582 --> 54:43.922
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

54:44.243 --> 54:45.404
I can see that it's green.

54:46.705 --> 55:00.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the ESA has some good news coming their way, and it has to do with the state of Illinois is being told to pay the ESA a half a million dollars for messing up.

55:01.298 --> 55:01.759
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time.

55:03.401 --> 55:18.691
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, what happened is that, let's see, it's not just half a million, it's $510,528.64, and the reason why they have to do it is because they did an unconstitutional effort to enact a law banning the sale of violent video games.

55:20.432 --> 55:24.155
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, you know, legal fees, blah, blah, blah, it adds up.

55:25.809 --> 55:27.411
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

55:27.791 --> 55:38.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, if controlling access to allegedly dangerous speech is important in promoting the positive psychological development of children, in our society that role is properly accorded to parents and families, not the state.

55:39.300 --> 55:42.503
[SPEAKER_03]: That coming from Judge Matthew F. Kennelly.

55:42.963 --> 55:43.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for him.

55:43.884 --> 55:45.666
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully this will set a precedence.

55:45.946 --> 55:50.650
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had these, what is it, in Minnesota and these other states trying to pass the same thing?

55:51.992 --> 55:52.573
[SPEAKER_06]: In Wisconsin?

55:53.033 --> 55:53.754
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

55:53.834 --> 56:00.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this needs to really be a shining example to them of what's going to happen when they try to violate our rights.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.301
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the ESA had a field day.

56:02.601 --> 56:06.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, Judge Kenley's ruling sent two irrefutable messages.

56:06.264 --> 56:12.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only are efforts to ban the sale of violent video games clearly unconstitutional, they are a waste of taxpayer dollars.

56:12.290 --> 56:12.690
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

56:12.710 --> 56:15.813
[SPEAKER_03]: So the taxpayers not only get to pay for them to... Yep.

56:15.913 --> 56:19.516
[SPEAKER_03]: The sad fact is that the state of Illinois's new... Illinois, sorry...

56:19.876 --> 56:22.499
[SPEAKER_03]: knew this law was unconstitutional from the beginning.

56:22.599 --> 56:29.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Taxpayers have a right to know that over half a million of their dollars in countless government hours were thrown away in this fruitless effort.

56:29.446 --> 56:37.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably more than half a million dollars because, you know, to actually propose this bill and stuff, you know, all those luncheons that they have to hold in order to pass this stuff.

56:39.284 --> 56:40.745
[SPEAKER_06]: And the lobbyists, of course.

56:42.006 --> 56:46.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Megzy, Macman in our chat room is also from Wisconsin and says, Wisconsin sucks.

56:46.229 --> 56:46.729
[SPEAKER_03]: I live there.

56:46.849 --> 56:48.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree, Megzy?

56:48.610 --> 56:49.471
[SPEAKER_03]: I see you're nodding your head.

56:49.491 --> 56:50.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree Wisconsin sucks?

56:50.551 --> 56:51.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does.

56:51.612 --> 56:52.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a place for gamers?

56:52.613 --> 56:53.153
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

56:53.293 --> 56:57.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless you're in Madison, then come visit my GameStop.

56:57.536 --> 56:57.996
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

56:58.336 --> 56:58.897
[SPEAKER_05]: I work there.

57:00.098 --> 57:02.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get hit on by boys at the GameStop?

57:02.179 --> 57:02.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

57:02.479 --> 57:03.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get hit on by girls at the GameStop?

57:04.120 --> 57:04.280
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

57:05.101 --> 57:05.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

57:05.981 --> 57:06.922
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have any, you know,

57:07.386 --> 57:09.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Girls Who Like Girls, and Madison.

57:09.267 --> 57:11.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they need to be... Oh, wait, no, she's taken.

57:11.027 --> 57:12.288
[SPEAKER_07]: You better not... Mine!

57:15.809 --> 57:17.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris will come out there and cut you off.

57:18.731 --> 57:21.112
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean your hair.

57:22.592 --> 57:27.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, when taxpayer dollars are wasted, we get angsty, don't we, DarkSakura?

57:27.234 --> 57:27.934
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hell yes.

57:27.994 --> 57:29.515
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when we get angsty?

57:30.875 --> 57:31.876
[SPEAKER_06]: People die!

57:40.552 --> 57:42.993
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's bring on the FUs of the week, DarkSakura.

57:43.213 --> 57:45.093
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes toward the sun.

57:46.114 --> 57:48.895
[SPEAKER_06]: The bright shining orb in the sky.

57:50.095 --> 57:55.076
[SPEAKER_06]: For leeching all of my energy, burning my chest, my poor boots are burnt.

57:56.417 --> 57:59.138
[SPEAKER_06]: And making me really sleepy to where I almost fell asleep on the road five times.

58:00.738 --> 58:01.758
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, sun!

58:03.059 --> 58:03.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

58:04.644 --> 58:05.124
[SPEAKER_02]: My F.U.

58:05.164 --> 58:10.666
[SPEAKER_02]: goes to people that are extremely rude when it comes to parking their cars or not being able to park in their spaces.

58:11.066 --> 58:19.389
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this guy today when I was going to get my smoothie and... Why is that funny?

58:20.550 --> 58:22.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can't have a fruit smoothie?

58:23.391 --> 58:24.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall I explain?

58:24.811 --> 58:27.732
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoothie amongst us is a euphemism for lesbian sex.

58:32.694 --> 58:34.034
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big cup of smoothie then.

58:35.295 --> 58:38.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly I want nothing but Frappuccinos for the rest of my life.

58:41.176 --> 58:42.336
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a Frappuccino mean?

58:42.476 --> 58:43.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's gay sex.

58:44.577 --> 58:45.257
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

58:45.277 --> 58:46.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll take plenty of Frappuccino.

58:46.657 --> 58:47.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

58:47.418 --> 58:48.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's been a while since I've had a Frappuccino.

58:49.278 --> 58:50.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Loki, sorry.

58:50.638 --> 58:53.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so there's some jackass that was sitting there.

58:54.079 --> 59:00.101
[SPEAKER_02]: His car had both of the doors open, wide open, and the guy was nowhere to be seen in his car.

59:00.521 --> 59:01.441
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just sitting down...

59:02.256 --> 59:05.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoying, you know, a coffee or something in front of the Starbucks that happens to be next door.

59:06.499 --> 59:12.844
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know, it's just really fucking rude when people, you know, park their cars, especially with the doors open, or especially over the line.

59:12.864 --> 59:18.628
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get those wonderful SUVs, they're like, my car's too big for one space, so I'm gonna park in two compact spaces.

59:19.889 --> 59:24.433
[SPEAKER_02]: But your car's not compact, so you shouldn't be parking in one compact space, let alone both of them.

59:26.254 --> 59:26.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is that it?

59:27.115 --> 59:27.435
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

59:27.755 --> 59:31.518
[SPEAKER_03]: My FU of the week would have to go towards Sangria,

59:32.301 --> 59:41.203
[SPEAKER_03]: for having some type of unexplainable control over me because I drank a lot of it on Thursday and I drank a lot of it on Friday.

59:41.643 --> 59:45.984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm typically not a lush, but Sangria makes me want to be because it's really yummy.

59:46.504 --> 59:49.225
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're under 21, you shouldn't drink Sangria.

59:49.785 --> 59:50.665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.

59:51.765 --> 59:53.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you have any FUs of the week you'd like to get out?

59:53.586 --> 59:54.446
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, actually.

59:54.466 --> 59:55.946
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's on.

59:56.827 --> 59:57.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it on?

59:57.227 --> 59:57.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

59:57.447 --> 59:57.667
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

59:59.396 --> 01:00:04.580
[SPEAKER_07]: My FU goes to homeless people in San Francisco, and I don't mean all of them.

01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:12.587
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to the Castro District today, which, for those of you who do not know, is the gay and lesbian district of San Francisco.

01:00:13.548 --> 01:00:24.357
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were walking by, and there's a homeless guy just relaxing on the side of the street where everybody and their mother were walking, and his penis was just hanging right out.

01:00:25.915 --> 01:00:26.956
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a dollar!

01:00:27.376 --> 01:00:30.038
[SPEAKER_07]: He was just laying there, just hanging out.

01:00:30.058 --> 01:00:31.359
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't even impressive either.

01:00:31.379 --> 01:00:32.040
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it wasn't.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.002
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's a store right next to us with a big dong.

01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:39.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so he's just lying on, I assume this is Market Street?

01:00:39.705 --> 01:00:40.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what is this?

01:00:40.786 --> 01:00:41.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Castro.

01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:47.671
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's just, well, I mean, okay, having someone's cock hanging out in the middle of Castro Street is not that uncommon, I hate to tell you.

01:00:47.891 --> 01:00:48.872
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't impressive.

01:00:49.372 --> 01:00:50.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I see.

01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:53.575
[SPEAKER_07]: I want an impressive cock when I go down Castro Street.

01:00:53.595 --> 01:00:53.875
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:00:57.168 --> 01:00:59.690
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, uh, Megsy, do you have any interviews of the week you'd like to get out?

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:00.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:07.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I've got one, uh, me and Chris went up to, uh, Santa Cruz and went to... Oh, yeah.

01:01:08.637 --> 01:01:14.361
[SPEAKER_05]: And went to the boardwalk, uh, and we were sitting on the beach, um, drawing stick figure porn in the sand.

01:01:15.102 --> 01:01:21.367
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, we looked over and we were commenting on how there are some people who should just not wear bathing suits.

01:01:22.348 --> 01:01:24.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, mostly old guys...

01:01:25.316 --> 01:01:26.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wearing, like, the Speedo suits?

01:01:26.837 --> 01:01:27.558
[SPEAKER_05]: It gets better, hold on.

01:01:27.638 --> 01:01:28.559
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

01:01:28.599 --> 01:01:31.582
[SPEAKER_05]: So just as we were saying that, we look over, and there's this old guy.

01:01:31.802 --> 01:01:36.146
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, like, he's gotta be, like, late 40s, early 50s.

01:01:37.507 --> 01:01:38.608
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dark tan.

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:44.873
[SPEAKER_05]: He's dark tan, balding, all hairy, he's all hairy.

01:01:45.073 --> 01:01:46.815
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got, like, the bling bling.

01:01:48.797 --> 01:01:52.380
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's got this towel around him, and I'm just like, oh my god, there's one of them.

01:01:53.007 --> 01:01:57.129
[SPEAKER_05]: and when he takes the towel off, he has a bright red Speedo.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.450
[SPEAKER_07]: With the Brazilian wax.

01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:05.592
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking and trying to determine if he was waxed or not.

01:02:05.632 --> 01:02:09.154
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't see, we were kind of far away, but I think he was.

01:02:10.815 --> 01:02:11.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

01:02:11.775 --> 01:02:12.695
[SPEAKER_05]: And it gets better.

01:02:12.735 --> 01:02:12.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

01:02:14.358 --> 01:02:14.618
[SPEAKER_05]: One more.

01:02:15.779 --> 01:02:25.465
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, not only did this guy have the audacity to go out of the house, but also wear a bright red Speedo on the beach, his girlfriend or his wife or something started taking pictures of him.

01:02:26.065 --> 01:02:27.666
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started posing for these pictures.

01:02:29.888 --> 01:02:31.009
[SPEAKER_05]: And adjusting himself.

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.530
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am not making this up.

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:35.491
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not exaggerating at all.

01:02:35.571 --> 01:02:36.192
[SPEAKER_03]: We have pictures.

01:02:36.212 --> 01:02:37.393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Pokemon Snap.

01:02:40.655 --> 01:02:40.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:46.792
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in other countries, it's okay to wear a Speedo on the beach.

01:02:46.852 --> 01:02:48.833
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times, the people wearing them are pretty hot.

01:02:48.933 --> 01:02:50.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I've seen pictures on the internet, you know.

01:02:51.213 --> 01:02:52.114
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy was not hot.

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:53.494
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

01:02:53.534 --> 01:02:54.114
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought he was.

01:02:54.394 --> 01:02:54.674
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

01:02:55.034 --> 01:02:55.775
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the sad part.

01:02:55.955 --> 01:02:56.615
[SPEAKER_03]: That's unfortunate.

01:02:56.935 --> 01:02:57.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to tell about the other one?

01:02:58.656 --> 01:02:58.856
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:02:59.036 --> 01:03:03.137
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we better get back into games or we're going to get those angry emails, you know, and those reviews.

01:03:04.611 --> 01:03:05.972
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:06.012 --> 01:03:07.493
[SPEAKER_01]: They never talk about games.

01:03:07.513 --> 01:03:09.254
[SPEAKER_01]: They talk about guys in Speedos.

01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:11.196
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate Orange Lounge.

01:03:11.256 --> 01:03:13.177
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate you, DarkSakura.

01:03:13.197 --> 01:03:13.918
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so mean.

01:03:14.338 --> 01:03:14.839
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

01:03:15.219 --> 01:03:16.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck a whole bunch of them.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.721
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in a good way.

01:03:17.801 --> 01:03:18.842
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean like with a pogo stick.

01:03:19.042 --> 01:03:20.823
[SPEAKER_03]: No frappuccinos or smoothies for them?

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:23.205
[SPEAKER_03]: No frappuccinos, no smoothies.

01:03:23.285 --> 01:03:25.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I've decided the euphemism for straight sex is potato.

01:03:26.688 --> 01:03:26.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's

01:03:27.694 --> 01:03:28.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back into game news, please.

01:03:28.675 --> 01:03:29.755
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one, but I can't remember what it was.

01:03:29.775 --> 01:03:29.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind.

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:30.496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Potato.

01:03:31.576 --> 01:03:32.477
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Potato.

01:03:32.557 --> 01:03:33.137
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Potato.

01:03:33.578 --> 01:03:33.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:38.580
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we do have some stuff from Namco.

01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:41.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco Bondi sent out their release list.

01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:44.684
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a few things coming up.

01:03:45.605 --> 01:03:48.666
[SPEAKER_06]: On PlayStation 2, we have Pac-Man World Rally on August 22nd.

01:03:49.027 --> 01:03:49.287
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:03:50.848 --> 01:03:52.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob's giggling like a little girl.

01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.649
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:56.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Pooeater sent me this in chat.

01:03:56.051 --> 01:03:56.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah!

01:03:58.248 --> 01:04:01.470
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's guys in red Speedos and Santa hats.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:02.691
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're cute.

01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:03.791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're actually pretty cute.

01:04:03.811 --> 01:04:04.952

[SPEAKER_03]: Like, the two lesbians that got together in there, they were hot.

[SPEAKER_03]: Like, they were just, you know...

[SPEAKER_03]: Femi, LittleCharlie'sAngelsWannabe, it was pretty hot.

01:04:29.927 --> 01:04:32.248

[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not being shy about it.

[SPEAKER_03]: .hack, Volume 1, yay.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I played a little bit of that at E3.

01:06:12.401 --> 01:06:12.802
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

01:06:12.842 --> 01:06:13.862
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the old .hack games.

01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:14.263
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fun.

01:06:15.183 --> 01:06:15.644
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

01:06:15.664 --> 01:06:17.085
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the cartoon.

[SPEAKER_05]: Anime, excuse me.

01:06:19.066 --> 01:06:19.426
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen a whole lot of it, but it's fun.

01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:29.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I ever had the chat about, you know, I don't really watch anime, even though I know a lot of our fans are really into it because of the DDR connection and what have you.

01:06:29.814 --> 01:06:30.954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really that into it.

01:06:31.114 --> 01:06:31.555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

01:06:32.275 --> 01:06:33.296
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just, I don't know.

01:06:33.772 --> 01:06:40.394
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to an anime convention and I go, these people look like they're having fun, which is cool and all, but I just, I don't, I don't get it.

01:06:40.594 --> 01:06:41.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosplay.

01:06:41.254 --> 01:06:41.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:43.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosplay's cute, I guess.

01:06:43.975 --> 01:06:45.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes, but sometimes it's also very ugly.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:47.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, what do you cosplay as?

01:06:48.536 --> 01:06:50.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, Macy, Macy's telling us about her cosplay.

01:06:51.036 --> 01:06:51.977
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see.

01:06:52.417 --> 01:06:54.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I cosplayed as Bell Dandy from Oh My Goddess.

01:06:55.978 --> 01:07:00.559
[SPEAKER_05]: I cosplayed, I did like a girl version of Vash the Stampede from Trigun.

01:07:03.488 --> 01:07:04.709
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what else did I do?

01:07:05.129 --> 01:07:06.029
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever done Lulu?

01:07:06.049 --> 01:07:09.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Because lesbian Lulus are awesome from Final Fantasy X. You know, I was going to do a Lulu.

01:07:09.991 --> 01:07:10.951
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's hot.

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:14.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I might turn for that, we'll see.

01:07:15.613 --> 01:07:18.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway, let's keep it moving.

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:29.659
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywho, Sony's actually unveiled a brand new portable media player, as if they need another one, called the Milo.

01:07:30.726 --> 01:07:53.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Milo and Otis, but Milo, M-Y-L-O And basically, it stands for My Life Online And it's going to be also able to use Skype, Google, and Yahoo Chats So that's kind of neat It's scheduled to release in September And it's supposed to retail for about $350 It has a 940 megabytes of RAM

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:00.246
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:08:31.969 --> 01:08:32.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:37.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, more bad news for Sony, honestly.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:40.271
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this blogger, and you probably have seen this around the internet.

01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:44.072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten dug in a lot of places, just for the sheer irony of it.

01:08:44.972 --> 01:08:47.793
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this editor for the official PlayStation magazine.

01:08:47.873 --> 01:09:00.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Dana J., and she wrote this thing on her 1UP blog about how she plans on buying an Xbox 360 this November, even though she works for the official PlayStation magazine.

01:09:00.976 --> 01:09:06.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically saying that when they announced that the price would be $600, she found her enthusiasm sagging.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:07.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a quote.

01:09:38.487 --> 01:09:44.412
[SPEAKER_03]: and most of the big guns, Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4, won't be hitting for quite some time after the launch.

01:09:45.493 --> 01:09:47.034
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of a big ouch.

01:09:47.114 --> 01:09:49.456
[SPEAKER_03]: But people seem to love that story because of the irony.

01:09:49.636 --> 01:09:52.138
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is, but whatever.

01:09:52.999 --> 01:09:53.659
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just more pouring salt in the wounds of Sony, or what?

01:09:58.083 --> 01:09:58.643
[SPEAKER_05]: They deserve them.

01:09:59.564 --> 01:10:01.245
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really against PS3?

01:10:02.026 --> 01:10:03.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

01:10:03.487 --> 01:10:03.647
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

01:10:04.168 --> 01:10:04.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:11.512
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have my theories about PS3, but it doesn't seem like it's worth the $600 price tag at all.

01:10:13.493 --> 01:10:15.454
[SPEAKER_05]: And plus, I kind of have a little vendetta against Sony.

01:10:15.915 --> 01:10:17.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I want to hear about this.

01:10:17.115 --> 01:10:18.156
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the vendetta against Sony?

01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:27.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, okay, I'll tell you the truth, is that I get a lot of stupid Sony fanboys in my store.

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.264
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear about Sony fanboys.

01:10:29.284 --> 01:10:29.684
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you don't.

01:10:30.723 --> 01:10:31.263
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?

01:10:32.003 --> 01:10:32.643
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes them stupid?

01:10:32.944 --> 01:10:46.347
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they'll say stuff, they'll come in and tell me how great PS3 is going to be, and I'll say, well, I'm not really looking forward to it, there's nothing I really like on it.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:51.288
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll try to convince me why I should get a PS3, and I'm looking at this guy saying, dude, I work in the...

01:10:52.106 --> 01:10:54.008
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I know what I want.

01:10:54.028 --> 01:10:58.110
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm wearing probably this Mario shirt, you know, saying I want to get a Wii, not a PS3.

01:10:58.551 --> 01:10:59.732
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I like my PS2.

01:11:00.032 --> 01:11:04.315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got cool RPGs on it, but for the most part, I don't like Sony.

01:11:06.957 --> 01:11:12.000
[SPEAKER_06]: After having played PS3 games, you are 100% correct.

01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:12.821
[SPEAKER_06]: They are crap.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, because you make a good point at the end.

01:11:16.701 --> 01:11:17.922
[SPEAKER_03]: You love the PlayStation 2.

01:11:18.422 --> 01:11:19.382
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love the PlayStation 2.

01:11:19.522 --> 01:11:20.703
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all love the PlayStation 2.

01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:26.345
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why we all look at the PlayStation 3 and go, just keep putting out PS2 games, honestly.

01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:28.085
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's where you're going to go, just don't even bother.

01:11:28.125 --> 01:11:33.027
[SPEAKER_02]: What they need to understand is, look at all these other console wars that have been going on.

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:36.028
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo.

01:11:37.549 --> 01:11:39.610
[SPEAKER_02]: The Xbox and PlayStation 2.

01:11:41.861 --> 01:11:46.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed a big, giant difference between the games that come out on both platforms?

01:11:46.946 --> 01:11:49.949
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they look almost the same.

01:11:50.449 --> 01:11:53.612
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're very much the same.

01:11:53.692 --> 01:12:07.105
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so, what makes you think that they're going to all of a sudden, you know, hey, let's develop a game for the 360, and let's just spend some extra time on making a completely different game, but it's actually the same game for the PlayStation 3 with better graphics, but...

01:12:07.952 --> 01:12:08.252
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

01:12:08.272 --> 01:12:11.114
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to spend the money to develop those games.

01:12:11.474 --> 01:12:12.115
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

01:12:12.135 --> 01:12:15.276
[SPEAKER_02]: They can port the same game over and it'll be just fine on both systems.

01:12:15.357 --> 01:12:17.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go over to the chat room real quick for some comments.

01:12:17.498 --> 01:12:19.119
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLawnRadio.com, click on chat.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:24.042
[SPEAKER_03]: FireResurrected of the OL Army would like to say, Amen, lesbian co-host person.

01:12:26.423 --> 01:12:26.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:12:27.504 --> 01:12:31.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Macman says, But the Blu-ray, the Blu-ray, it is God in writable media.

01:12:32.367 --> 01:12:32.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:12:32.927 --> 01:12:35.569
[SPEAKER_06]: If by God they mean, you know, God of BCs.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Blackboy says the $500 PS3 isn't really so lame.

01:12:40.564 --> 01:12:41.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

01:12:42.406 --> 01:12:44.028
[SPEAKER_03]: People are allowed to have difference of opinion.

01:12:44.608 --> 01:12:50.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Fireboma says, damn, I wish I could resist the PS3, but I'm just going to shell out $600 plus for it anyway.

01:12:53.183 --> 01:12:54.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a consumer whore.

01:13:11.863 --> 01:13:20.210
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and to be honest, all the other games that are out there, like even FlatOut 2, or not FlatOut 2, Full Auto 2 was the one for me.

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.531
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, ooh, that looks really good.

01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:24.754
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's coming out on the 360 later on, and so it's not a big deal.

01:13:25.555 --> 01:13:34.842
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think is going to be really interesting is seeing what their marketing campaign is going to be for this, and seeing how they're going to try to convince people to spend the $600 for it.

01:13:35.763 --> 01:13:38.105
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're going to see that, because those 1080p TVs out there,

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:42.475
[SPEAKER_02]: I know because I'm pricing them right now.

01:13:42.655 --> 01:13:44.056
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like three grand.

01:13:45.076 --> 01:13:49.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm sure there's going to be some angry Sony fanboys out there that want to write angry emails.

01:13:49.778 --> 01:13:51.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, I hate you.

01:13:51.459 --> 01:13:52.459
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're a dick.

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.720
[SPEAKER_03]: We welcome those emails.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and maybe we'll read some on next week.

01:13:59.082 --> 01:14:02.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you letting that lesbian speak on your show about PlayStation?

01:14:02.044 --> 01:14:03.284
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't know what she's talking about.

01:14:04.285 --> 01:14:05.465
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to munching carpet.

01:14:05.485 --> 01:14:05.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so...

01:14:08.459 --> 01:14:16.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeTrader.com So, no, if you have an intelligent rebuttal, we would happily read your emails on air.

01:14:17.403 --> 01:14:19.564
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you write something stupid, we're just going to forward it to Megzi.

01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:20.144
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

01:14:21.645 --> 01:14:24.226
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to see the PS3 do well.

01:14:24.466 --> 01:14:28.948
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see them launch it with a new, like, Twisted Metal game.

01:14:29.128 --> 01:14:29.969
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been awesome.

01:14:29.989 --> 01:14:37.792
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have sold the system for me, but, you know, to be honest, right now they seem to be a step behind everybody, and the fact that they haven't released any details about

01:14:38.635 --> 01:14:40.796
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly their online service is going to be.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:44.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think, to be honest, they don't know what it's going to be like right now.

01:14:44.698 --> 01:14:46.699
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think they have that stuff finalized yet.

01:14:47.139 --> 01:14:55.003
[SPEAKER_02]: So until I hear some more details about how wonderful this system is, based on specs and price alone, I'm not going to be buying it at launch.

01:14:56.264 --> 01:14:56.784
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:14:58.025 --> 01:15:01.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's change the tune to something happier.

01:15:02.047 --> 01:15:03.228
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, don't you agree?

01:15:03.748 --> 01:15:03.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:15:04.207 --> 01:15:11.812
[SPEAKER_03]: and DarkSakura always likes to make us happy by surfing the internet and telling us about her happy place on the internet this week and sharing it with the internet.

01:15:12.192 --> 01:15:14.934
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura, what is your happy website of the week?

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:20.197
[SPEAKER_06]: My webpage of the week is MrPinball.

01:15:21.398 --> 01:15:26.001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's www.xmission.com slash tilde d-a-i-n-a

01:15:26.806 --> 01:15:33.429
[SPEAKER_06]: slash pinball.html And basically, Mr. Pinball is a site they restore, buy, sell, trade, repair pinball machines.

01:15:33.469 --> 01:15:37.311
[SPEAKER_06]: They have classified ads, pricing guides, t-shirts, hats, mugs, and more!

01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:41.713
[SPEAKER_06]: Repair tips of the day, pinball collector registry, pinball machine photos.

01:15:42.293 --> 01:15:49.336
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably one of the oldest pinball sites on the internet as far as information tips, that type of thing.

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:50.517
[SPEAKER_06]: So, go check it out.

01:15:51.477 --> 01:15:51.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:15:53.138 --> 01:15:54.859
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:55.319
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways...

01:16:02.643 --> 01:16:03.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi.

01:16:03.744 --> 01:16:04.384
[SPEAKER_03]: My turn, huh?

01:16:04.444 --> 01:16:04.784
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, I have one more.

01:16:08.347 --> 01:16:09.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you started talking.

01:16:09.227 --> 01:16:10.428
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you had the next story.

01:16:10.508 --> 01:16:14.190
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki's sitting there going, I can make up a story.

01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:18.293
[SPEAKER_06]: He's saying that I was awesome and that my taste in websites is, yeah.

01:16:18.353 --> 01:16:21.554
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought, weren't we going to do Orange Lounge Lying Radio or something one week?

01:16:21.575 --> 01:16:23.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody calls us liars anyway.

01:16:23.236 --> 01:16:26.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to come up with the Orange Lounge Radio Fib Game News of the Week?

01:16:27.058 --> 01:16:28.499
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fib Game News of the Week?

01:16:28.579 --> 01:16:28.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:16:29.401 --> 01:16:30.361
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 being good?

01:16:30.581 --> 01:16:31.602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Megzy has one.

01:16:31.742 --> 01:16:34.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here's our not-true Orange Lounge Radio news story of the week.

01:16:35.263 --> 01:16:39.284
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony has just announced that the PS3 will also include a George Foreman grill.

01:16:42.205 --> 01:16:48.307
[SPEAKER_02]: The PlayStation 3 has already sold over 50 million units before its launch, making it the fastest system to ever reach that number.

01:16:48.327 --> 01:16:48.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

01:16:49.307 --> 01:16:50.948
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:50.988 --> 01:16:52.048
[SPEAKER_05]: I just bought mine off eBay.

01:16:52.188 --> 01:16:54.029
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll also do your laundry and your homework.

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:59.379
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll suck your lollipop clean.

01:16:59.579 --> 01:17:04.882
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones you buy at Disneyland, the happiest place on earth because pure people like to go to Disneyland.

01:17:06.582 --> 01:17:08.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, here's a true article.

01:17:09.163 --> 01:17:09.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, I got one more.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:10.264
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:10.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

01:17:12.225 --> 01:17:12.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:22.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Landfill in San Francisco this week actually started rumbling from all the dual shocks that have been buried in there causing an earthquake, you know.

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:25.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is ironic because, you know, San Francisco gets a lot of earthquakes, so.

01:17:28.735 --> 01:17:29.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

01:17:31.878 --> 01:17:32.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

01:17:33.119 --> 01:17:36.242
[SPEAKER_03]: This story's true, even though some people think it's a lie.

01:17:36.703 --> 01:17:40.086
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is true, and it has to do with World of Warcraft, the Burning Crusade.

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:44.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of people get their characters to 60, and then it's all about the endgame.

01:17:44.610 --> 01:17:45.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Endgame, endinggame, endgame.

01:17:45.951 --> 01:17:46.572
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?

01:17:47.597 --> 01:17:50.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Endgames have typically been 40-man raids.

01:17:50.319 --> 01:17:53.081
[SPEAKER_03]: Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, so on and so on.

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:59.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not going to change, but what's going to happen is that the new endgames in the Burning Crusade, they're going to be capped at 25 people.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:09.194
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks are going to have to get used to all new party setups and all new strategies for endgame battle because you're going to be reduced in the amount of people you can take on those raids.

01:18:09.534 --> 01:18:13.077
[SPEAKER_03]: So no more taking along Leroy Jenkins just for comic value anymore.

01:18:13.117 --> 01:18:20.958
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to take along folks who definitely know what they're doing and won't run into battle before you're all ready.

01:18:23.089 --> 01:18:25.771
[SPEAKER_03]: But the chicken will still be good, FYI.

01:18:26.272 --> 01:18:29.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's going to do it for the end of this segment of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:29.674 --> 01:18:33.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on the live show, we're going to take a break, and that means our podcast is going to get split at this point.

01:18:33.777 --> 01:18:39.021
[SPEAKER_03]: But be sure to tune in later this week for Part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:40.763
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be back right after this.

01:18:41.303 --> 01:18:46.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:51.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
