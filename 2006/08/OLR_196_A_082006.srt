1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Today, August 20th, 2006, is 1080p really the future?

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,240
Microsoft begs to differ.

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,520
What do Wii preview parties have in common with raves?

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,520
What ever happened to the Phantom anyway?

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,040
caused quite a bit of stir, but it was a good time. We had a good time on last week's show.

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,320
We're going to have a good time on this week's show, and to help us through that, as always,

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,520
say hello to Loki! Yes, I'm here.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,840
That's right. How you doing, Loki? I'm doing good.

9
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,360
Good. Anything exciting going on in your week? Uh, yeah. I destroyed the arcade cabinet.

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,960
Really? Oh, that's right, you built... Now, long time listeners of Orange on

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,880
Australia, remember back in the day, you built your own cabinet to play it,

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,120
like, what, a main cabinet, basically, right? Basically, yeah.

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,200
and why did you destroy it? It's too big. Too big?

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,680
Need the room for the 37-inch LCD TV.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,960
So about how much money would you say ended up getting burned? Only a couple

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,960
hundred. Most of it was in the buttons.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
I see. Alright well also joining us tonight say hello to an old friend of

18
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
our show. Say hello to Miklotov.

19
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
Hi. How you doing Miklotov? Oh I'm good.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,400
Good. Miklotov happens to work for Konami but he's not here as an employee

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
of Konami, he's here as a gamer.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I don't play video games.

23
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Which is kind of an issue. I just saw you playing one like two minutes ago.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
But that doesn't count.

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I see. I have to say that because we actually have Konami-related news tonight that's pretty big.

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
So, I have to remember to distinguish that.

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
I know. But I know everything about Konami, so...

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Oh, really?

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Yes.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
You can't share any of it on here?

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
No.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I'm teasing. I know.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Alright, also say hello to an old favorite of our program.

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Say hello to Drewnami.

35
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Hey, what's up?

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Not a whole lot. How are you doing?

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Uh, fair good. Hey. Give me a mic, dammit.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Give me that mic. Sheesh.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Alright.

40
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
A little mic confusion. There we go.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Alright. How are you doing?

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Uh, fair. A little bit of gaming to speak of, but I think we'll say that to gaming weeks.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Alright. Well, let's get to it. Let's start with Loki. How was your gaming week?

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,220
My week was good. I played Dead Rising which is still fun, but

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
It gets progressively harder later in the game

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,440
Then what else they play I played I just got done playing the bad day la demo on PC

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,000
That's really cool-looking except. I don't like the fact that to save a lot of people

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,720
I'm not a fan of saving people more a fan of beating them to death in the game. So

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,960
So that's gonna take a little bit of getting used to, but I am looking forward to the game.

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,620
It's supposed to be coming I guess later this week or next week or something, I don't know.

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
So should be cool.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,860
That's also part of my problem with Dead Rising, really, is that I don't like saving people.

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,460
I like to kill them in games.

54
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,140
Well they're fucking stupid, okay?

55
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,860
They are fucking stupid in Dead Rising.

56
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,380
I tried saving these people, they were trapped in a store, and they wanted to get the safety,

57
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,300
so I'm like, you know, follow me, and they're sitting there beating up a zombie, and then

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,740
all of a sudden like five zombies jump on them and eat them.

59
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,060
like you're a dumb idiot well fucking listen to me or die apparently you chose

60
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,780
death so fuck you so the next time I you know I ran past that section when I

61
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,660
reloaded the game again I said fuck them they can die and that's what they did so

62
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,820
of course I'll come by and break down the door so the zombies have an easier

63
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:06,220
chance you know getting them all right anything else that you played I want to

64
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
I was going to say I played ChromeHounds, but I don't think I did.

65
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,220
Okay.

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,220
I'll talk about my gaming week.

67
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,220
I played Dead Rising a little more because killing zombies is a lot of fun.

68
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,220
I got a little bit further.

69
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,220
I finally figured out the secret to kill that very first boss that kept slicing me.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Or actually I should say shooting me because he has a gun.

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,220
And I sliced him because Loki showed me where to find a katana.

72
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,220
So that made me very happy because it made fighting that first boss a hell of a lot easier.

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,220
So now I'm having more fun just running around doing random things.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,220
The other game I've been playing a lot of this week is 99 Nights. I decided to go out and buy it because I actually like the demo, and you know what?

75
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,220
I don't understand why all the reviews on the internet are so freaking negative of this game.

76
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,220
It's not that bad. It's not perfect, but it's not like the worst game on Xbox 360 right now, by far.

77
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:59,220
I think this game just isn't for everybody. The game is a bit of a button masher, yes, but so were a lot of old arcade games, like in the early 90s and late 80s.

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,540
The game really reminds me in a sense of golden axe you run around you swing your sword around you hit the button to hit

79
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,860
Your sword a lot you kill things except you're killing hundreds and hundreds of monsters at a time

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,700
I actually find the game to be a lot of fun, and it looks gorgeous the music is awesome

81
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,500
Now there are some problems with the game as I said it's not perfect

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,740
Um some of the interface just kind of sucks like the menus and things and I I just didn't dig it I

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,460
The save menus are a little weird and those things and the voice overs are awful, awful.

84
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,700
I mean whoever did the voices did horrible, whoever did the lip syncing did horrible.

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,900
They should have just had an option to retain the original Japanese language track because

86
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,060
I'll tell you the voice overs are awful but the game itself is quite a bit of fun.

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,300
They have that option with Enchanted Arms which is coming out and you can do the Japanese

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,740
voice track or the English voice track.

89
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,260
Good because if they butcher the English there, then that's you know gonna be what we do here

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm going over to orange lounge radio.com clicking on chat and reading what our chat room has to say

91
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:08,180
We have fire bomb. It says sky Kingdom Hearts 2 is a button masher too, but it had a story

92
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,480
Yeah, 99 nights has a story too though

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,300
I mean granted Kingdom Hearts 2 has a really great in-depth story and 99 nights is a little bit

94
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,260
You know kind of generic, but it looks really pretty and if the story is not bad

95
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,300
I can think of games that had worse stories. So I I mean I would call 99 nights a

96
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,820
Slightly above average game and the only kind of its John well, I guess there's dynasty warriors

97
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:39,700
But considering that's just like a straight-up port. I'd say it's really the only kind of game of its genre

98
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,300
Really truly available for next-gen right now, and I think it's worth a lawyer

99
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:51,220
I yeah, I think there's a audience of people that this game is really for you know an audience of people what an

100
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,980
Audience of people not a audience whatever. Thank you grammar bigletov professor guy. You're welcome

101
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,140
Well, then how is your gaming week so I can criticize the way you talk about it. Oh, well

102
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,860
I've been playing a couple things

103
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm not allowed to talk about and one's really frustrating and I hate it

104
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,460
But other than that the only game I really play at all anymore is

105
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,580
is Suikoden 2 and I play it at work on my breaks

106
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,020
and I leave it on so I've amassed about 700 hours on the game now

107
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,400
so and I just really like that game a lot

108
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,020
Are you trying to see if maybe it rolls over once you hit 999?

109
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,160
Actually yeah, we're hoping that it would happen this week because we don't know how to

110
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,560
you know, count, so we didn't realize it wasn't going to hit 999 this week

111
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,440
but I'm really enjoying it and I always enjoy it, I've played through that game a million times

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
And that's all I play.

113
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,080
Now, did you watch me play some of those games on 360, like Prey and Dead Rising?

114
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
What do you think of some of those ones you've been watching?

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
Prey is pretty cool.

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,440
It's kind of creepy.

117
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,240
I think I could enjoy it on a computer because I don't like using console controllers for

118
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
FPSs.

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,480
99 Nights I was really excited about and then I saw it and I was really disappointed because

120
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,200
it looks like a really bland Samurai Warriors or Dynasty Warriors.

121
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,760
That's pretty bad seen as dynasty warriors is pretty bland as I like dynasty warriors

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,360
I think and I like 99 nights and then I look at dynasty warriors and I go

123
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,600
Environments and 99 nights just are so bland and you're always fighting the same enemy and you can't even tell half the time if

124
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,880
There's still an enemy on screen because your stupid

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,900
Comrades are all like grouped around it. It's like a hundred of your friends around one enemy

126
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
So you have to wade your way through them

127
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,940
You know swing your sword it only hits the bad. Yeah, I

128
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,700
I'll forgive that though because the same thing again look at games like golden axe Ninja Turtles

129
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,740
You never hit your friends magically. That's that's what this game is to me

130
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,260
It's a souped-up old-school beat-em-up don't like that so you could hit your friends there were like double dragon, right?

131
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,500
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can one of the double dragon. Double dragon is fun to throw people in the pits

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,520
That's what we need. We need a Simpsons next-gen arcade game that looks like 99 nights, but it's the Simpsons

133
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Okay, awesome. That would be

134
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,200
Score maybe that'll be on Wii's virtual console

135
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
cardboard tube samurai

136
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
That would be fucking sweet

137
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,140
And I guess the other game you had was dead rising and the zombie games actually frightened me

138
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,980
But it looks it was funny at times

139
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,340
But I still I don't think I could bring myself to play it

140
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Did you like the part where I wore the little kid's outfit and the big teddy bear mask?

141
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,780
If you mean creeped out by it, then yes, I liked it a whole lot.

142
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,340
My favorite was going to the women's store and getting the dress with the big bright

143
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,740
pink flowers on it and then putting on sunglasses.

144
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
That was awesome.

145
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
That was pretty funny.

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,540
Or when you changed your hair gray in the cosmetic store.

147
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,460
But the greatest is that whatever costume you're wearing carries on into the cut scenes.

148
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,860
So it's really funny to be wearing the flowery dress in the cut scenes where he's trying

149
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,860
to act all badass.

150
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,860
Yeah, when he was leaning up against the wall, he was some sort of prostitute. That was pretty awesome.

151
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,860
And that part had no zombies, so I was okay with it.

152
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,860
Alright. Are you afraid of zombies?

153
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Yes, I am.

154
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,860
You need someone to hold your hand when you play zombie games?

155
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,860
I can't think of someone who works at Taco Bell.

156
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Alright, anyway, moving on.

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Going over to DrewNami.

158
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Drew, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

159
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Well, I haven't exactly been on the cutting edge lately.

160
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:32,860
I've been playing... I finished Fable as a little goody-two-shoes, now I'm replaying it as some big, badass, evil, bisexual screwing around, bucking around, whatever.

161
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Which was the best part of Fable, really. Otherwise it was just pretty much your standard, you know.

162
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,080
uh... i'd have to say the different kind of weapons that you can use

163
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,500
uh... and different kind of uh...

164
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,860
relationship you can have with uh... the townsfolk

165
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,880
which admittedly is not much but uh...

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,600
it's still kinda cool

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,780
uh...

168
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,580
i've been brushing up on my beatmania lately uh...

169
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
haven't been doing too much of that actually

170
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,780
took the time to put my scores in on rankings

171
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,660
again not very impressive

172
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,040
uh... playing a little bit more tell your iris almost beat it

173
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
been going back to pray finally beat it

174
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,780
ending was very cool you know what all things considered a prey doesn't take

175
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,240
that long to be it's a pretty short game i mean if i was a little more hardcore

176
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,540
about it and can play games like for a long time in one setting i could have

177
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,980
been in a day

178
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,520
yes but it's pretty easy to even can die don't you know you don't ever really die

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,000
uh... and for some reason i picked up a man x command mission after like two

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
months of not playing it

181
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
and i've just been blowing through it

182
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,680
like five hours straight

183
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,100
no reason at all

184
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,640
nine but uh...

185
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,400
it's it's fairly good rpg

186
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,400
all right well that that's it for everybody's gaming week and i know to

187
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,100
some folks in chatter uh... kind of talking a little bit about their a

188
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,160
gaming weeks there and we don't care about them no i i'm curious what folks

189
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,820
uh... their plan uh... d j dark night is playing so com three i think c don't

190
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,480
care uh...

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,240
Well, we don't have time to play everything. We're just, what, four people?

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,200
There's too many games. How many new games do they release every week?

193
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,040
But how many of them are worth playing?

194
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
That's true. I'm not going to deny that.

195
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
There's like maybe one a month.

196
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,400
But everybody's into something different, right?

197
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,040
You know, if I didn't have a job, I'd be playing tons of games.

198
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,480
I wouldn't. I hate video games.

199
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,680
Isn't that what you do all day now?

200
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,720
For now.

201
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,720
All right, anyway, let's go to some housekeeping stuff really quick.

202
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,080
We wanted to mention the ChromeHounds tourney.

203
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,200
Remember how we were going back and forth with Bobby Black Wolf about, we're gonna kick

204
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,780
your ass, you're gonna kick our ass, or whatever?

205
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,280
We couldn't get enough people to participate in the ChromeHounds thing.

206
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,140
I don't know if folks just, like, our listener base isn't really into this game or what,

207
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,480
but we couldn't get enough people.

208
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,500
And I guess, I don't know, I wasn't really following, but I guess maybe there was shenanigans

209
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,320
going on somewhere else in the tournament.

210
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
So it got cancelled.

211
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
So it never really happened.

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,000
So we never got to put O.L. Army vs. Bobby did the test.

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,980
So maybe another time, I think what we'll do right now, focus on building up the presence

214
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,160
of Orange Lounge Radio listeners in different games on the O.L. Army, and then we'll take

215
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
people on in tournaments.

216
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,180
Personally, I would like to see something more along the lines of, like, Saints Row

217
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,520
when that comes out.

218
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,980
Not necessarily a team deathmatch type of thing, but just last man standing, just get

219
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,840
bunch of people from you know you know all games get you know some of us get

220
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,620
some other people and just have everyone kill each other and you know I like that

221
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,800
kind so it would answer answer the age-old classic all our question of if

222
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,720
all the members of Orange Lawns Radio got into a battle royale who would

223
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,800
survive you guys are just fucking lucky that they haven't put out a Grand Theft

224
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,500
Auto yet that's online because I would fucking kill everybody that sounds like

225
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,520
the throwdown that is the throwdown I know that because I've been owning my

226
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,880
peep my peeps at work for what you know almost a year now yeah I think I think

227
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,000
we could do that bring it I've I've got a year on it can't you do that it

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,800
doesn't have rumble lows rumble roses double X have a mode like that the four

229
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,760
four chicks beating each other up yeah it says that we should all get rumble

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,060
rumble roses double X will be 20 bucks any day now come on how many people

231
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,220
actually want to waste $20 though I I bought oh no way I didn't buy the game I

232
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,660
I got it for free. Thank you, Konami.

233
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,460
That's not worth it, either.

234
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,700
I want to borrow that if you never play it.

235
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,380
I don't play it.

236
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,340
I want to spend some time with chick wrestlers.

237
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Come on, it's fun.

238
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,020
I basically popped it in, played with the boob adjustment

239
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,740
little dial on there, and got bored of it.

240
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,940
That's about it.

241
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,100
BlackWolf's in chat right now, our old buddy,

242
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Bobby BlackWolf, who also does a show Sunday nights

243
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,900
over allgames.com.

244
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,660
Loki does not play well with others.

245
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
He can't handle a team game.

246
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,020
That's probably about right.

247
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,420
yeah at least okay at least he admits it

248
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,420
I'm like Zim from Invader Zim

249
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,500
we need to do like a destroying when we're on our own planet

250
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,580
so I wish we could do like a World of Warcraft like I wish you could have like a private

251
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,260
Battlegrounds wouldn't that be fun

252
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,980
actually they're gonna have they had a little neat

253
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,540
World of Warcraft insider that they posted up saying

254
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,900
in the expansion they're going to have an arena and you can field your own

255
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,660
teams

256
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,000
Hmm, but does anybody on all games interactive play World of Warcraft? I don't know. Well, I somehow I don't see Scott

257
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,120
Ruben wasting his days away leveling out World of Warcraft. Hey, I resemble that remark

258
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,640
All right. Well, we'll see maybe someday. All right

259
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,340
Anyway, we're gonna get into tonight's news and we want to start it off with a piece of news that we are actually putting out

260
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,580
there

261
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,860
It has to do with an upcoming promotion coming to orange lounge radio

262
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,060
We're really excited about it

263
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,640
And this has just been posted on our website over orange lounge radio comm

264
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,640
Orange Lounge Radio is going to be bringing you a fall of DDR Power Previews.

265
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,640
This has to do with the upcoming Xbox DDR games.

266
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,640
We're going to announce a partnership with Konami to promote upcoming Dance Dance Revolution titles

267
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,640
on the Xbox and Xbox 360 platforms with exclusive song premieres.

268
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Debuting in the fourth quarter of 2006 on the Xbox,

269
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Dance Dance Revolution UltraMix 4 will contain a new Power Mode

270
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,640
accessible via a returning feature known as Party Mode.

271
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Power Mode will allow the user to play a non-stop music course,

272
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,640
four of which are initially available, approximately five minutes in length.

273
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,640
These new Power Courses not only feature a stream of non-stop dancing arrows,

274
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,640
but seamlessly mixed non-stop music.

275
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Longtime fans of the DDR series will recognize this feature

276
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,640
as something similar to a non-stop mode featured in the Japanese-only arcade release,

277
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000. Dance Dance Revolution Universe, the first game

278
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,960
in the DDR series for the Xbox 360,

279
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,640
also scheduled for the fourth quarter of 06, will also contain this new power mode

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,800
with a completely different lineup of courses, four initially available.

281
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,880
Speed, Sync, and Quad modes are some of the other additional features

282
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,400
both games will contain in the party mode. Beginning Sunday, September 3rd,

294
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,740
covering DDR news for a long long time so you know being able to kind of play

295
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,780
a part in rolling out new songs for all you guys to hear is really exciting so

296
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,300
So we're going to be starting that in two weeks.

297
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,380
I've already heard them all hahaha.

298
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,780
Well you're special, that's why.

299
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,040
So if I hahaha, we'll be playing them for you guys pretty soon.

300
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Very excited about it.

301
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,180
You guys can almost be as cool as us, that means.

302
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,460
I'll be blasting them in my car hahaha.

303
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,340
He says I already don't if I had a car.

304
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Does that matter?

305
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,340
No.

306
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,600
Alright, anyway, before we do this thing here, are you guys anything we should warn the listeners

307
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
about or anything?

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I don't know.

309
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I think it's cool. I love the idea of non-stops from Solo 2000-ish thing coming back, that whole idea.

310
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Personally, I don't like one of them.

311
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,600
But there's like, you know, there's four in each game, at least.

312
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
You don't think I know that?

313
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,600
But I'm saying, you know, so is there ever a song in DDR you don't like?

314
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,600
No! That's a lie.

315
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Because I'm like, okay, usually in a 75 song list there's got to be at least, you know,

316
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:05,880
you know a few that you don't like but there's a few that you love so

317
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,760
somebody's muting me I don't even understand that I forget it yeah I know

318
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,200
all right so anyway you go DM in all right well I will be starting that on

319
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Sunday September 3rd right here live on orange lounge radio we're excited about

320
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,440
that yeah cutress points out they were also in solo bass mix oh that's right

321
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,080
so it's had like half as many as solo 2002 doesn't add like four more I keep

322
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,640
forgetting about solo bass I was I had only ever played solo 2000. I think they still have a solo

323
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,200
bass machine down at the Folsom bowling alley over here. Really? That's pretty cool. It was awful.

324
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,880
Yeah I think they had one that uh at what the local Walmart for a little while uh that got

325
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,840
that got taken out. I think it moved to the Folsom bowling alley that's where they got theirs from.

326
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,400
Anyways um so yeah I think we'll start off the show with some wonderful exclusive stuff that

327
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,960
that you're not gonna hear anywhere else, at least not yet.

328
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,240
Starting off with some price drops.

329
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,440
Far Cry and Six Predator, yet another game on the 360s,

330
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,560
dropped down to $39.99, so that's always good.

331
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,680
And also now we have a date for Dead or Alive Extreme 2,

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,720
which is gonna be hitting this holiday season

333
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,720
right before Black Friday on November 22nd,

334
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,160
so look forward to that.

335
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,160
One bad thing though, Oblivion on the PSP has been delayed to April, so, you know, got to wait a little bit longer.

336
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Now, for you hockey fans, NHL 07 has been confirmed by the folks at EA to be having a demo coming out soon, so you can check that out on Xbox Live's Marketplace, probably in a couple weeks.

337
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:57,160
Now, one thing that was mentioned on GameStop this week, they pointed out a Devil May Cry 5th Anniversary Collection coming out on the Playstation 2.

338
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:06,160
That is going to be coming out for $39.99 retail on October 25th, and it features Devil May Cry 1 through 3.

339
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
However, they missed a little bit of information on that.

340
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,360
that, that there's also a Resident Evil 10th anniversary collection coming out on the GameCube,

341
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,240
which will be featuring Resident Evil, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 4, also for $39.99,

342
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,240
also coming out on the 25th of October. And now for you, you know, fans of, you know,

343
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,800
new colors for systems, you'll be happy to know that the PlayStation 2 Slim is getting

344
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:40,800
a new color. It's going to be coming out in silver now. I guess that way you can coordinate

345
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,440
your Playstation 2 slim with your upcoming Playstation 3 and that will also be hitting

346
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:55,440
stores October 25th. Also coming out on the 31st, Xbox 360 is going to be getting a peripheral

347
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,640
bundle. No news yet on what exactly is in that. Speaking of bundles, PSP is also getting

348
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,480
getting a new bundle called the Digital Entertainment Pack.

349
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,480
It's coming out September 20th for $249.99.

350
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,880
It'll include the core system, a one gigabyte memory stick,

351
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,480
the Lords of Dogtown UMD movie,

352
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,280
and ATV Off-Road Fury Road.

353
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
Well they're gonna have to unload those somewhere.

354
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,040
Please and trails.

355
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,020
So apparently this is a great deal or something,

356
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,040
but that's gonna be coming out September 20th.

357
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,560
And then finally, I've got some news

358
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,480
that'll make any DDR fan a little bit sad and that is information about the

359
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,360
brand new Saturday morning series called dance revolution and it will feature

360
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,040
this group called the slumber party girls anyways this is actually coming

361
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,680
from a industry a magazine called home media retailing it says dick

362
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,360
entertainment and geffen records have partnered to create slumber party girls

363
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,120
a five members is it is it just wrong to me that dick entertainment is producing

364
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,320
this I mean about slumber party girls yeah it's slightly wrong anyway from

365
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,640
the geniuses you brought us captain in a five-member singing and dance act aimed

366
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,880
at the tween demographic the group whose multi-ethnic members were chosen from

367
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,960
more than 1,000 applicants will be the cornerstone to and this is apparently is

368
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,160
brought to you by Kohl's Kohl's secret slumber party on CBS which premieres

369
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:38,240
September 16th. The Slumber Party Girls will also appear on 26 half-hour episodes of Dance Revolution,

370
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,320
and of course my notes on that will be the unholy love child of DDR and Saturday Morning TV. A live

371
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,880
action TV series within the secret Slumber Party TV block inspired by Konami's video game franchise

372
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,160
Dance Dance Revolution. A Slumber Party Girls original music signal is slated to debut on

373
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:05,160
iTunes and AOL this month with a music DVD from Geffen, a division of Universal Music

374
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Thereafter.

375
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Is this the end of DDR? Has DDR jumped the shark?

376
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,040
Now I wonder if we're going to see any of their music on one of the DDR games.

377
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,840
Please, God.

378
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Oh God, this is not the American B for you, is it? Oh God. Oh God.

379
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,400
Please, can I-

380
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,400
It just struck me. This might be the American B for you. I'm going to have to pour acid

381
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,240
in my eyes and I would have I would have loved to just walked into the boardroom

382
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,480
that was planning this shit dogma style and stopped it from happening you know

383
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,320
ease you know don't defile our DDR anymore now it is promotion now I'm of

384
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,940
what type now in studio I have a picture of the slumber party girls which I will

385
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,480
hope to get on the website at some point but now Rob and Shane you guys have seen

386
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,800
the slumber party girls uh drew take a look you know what do you think it's the

387
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,320
fucking Mickey Mouse Club yeah pretty much the Mickey Mouse Club of DDR I

388
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,240
don't know what the fuck they're gonna do with this show but uh it's pretty

389
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,400
scary so um cutters has a good point look at it this way last year it was go

390
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,080
west and YMCA this year at slumber party girls I say to make the top earlier

391
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,480
there's one song in DDR you always skip you know what though think about this

392
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,120
What is the Mickey Mouse Club done for us giving us a bunch of horse? So, you know what more power to Britney Christina Justin Timberlake

393
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,640
That one sexy back songs pretty hot. I know it was stuck in my head the other day. I was very sad. Oh anyway, yeah

394
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,400
Sorry, uh, sorry. I think thinking about Justin Timberlake. We should get back to video games. However

395
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,420
What do you think is this good promotion me go top I'm especially curious what you might think on this is this good promotion

396
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:57,420
I can have a comment. I don't like it. I think it's really stupid

397
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:04,040
All right, but that's me not speaking as a Konami employee. That's me speaking as you know a normal person that

398
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,220
Can look at that article and be like hey Rob. That's the worst thing I've ever seen

399
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
I wonder if we'll see more about this in a few days

400
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,020
Maybe I don't know why oh, yeah, maybe maybe they'll do a performance

401
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,020
We'll see. All right, let's move it. Let's move on to another story

402
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,680
Now, maybe if you're into that thing, maybe you'll be lucky and they'll release a Slumber

403
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:29,160
Party Girls HD DVD, so you can see them in all their full high-definition glory.

404
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,880
With a free coupon for therapy.

405
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,020
Which hopefully you'll be able to play on your Xbox 360 HD DVD add-on.

406
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:42,080
There are rumors going around out there, according to DigiTimes, this HD DVD add-on will be retailing

407
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,200
for $200 US.

408
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,640
Now, originally I think the rumors were $100, but I think we all realized that seemed a

409
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,200
a little low. So $200 is now the price of the add-on they're saying. This is only a

410
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,580
rumor keep in mind, but sounds like it could be pretty legit. What do you think, Loki?

411
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,780
Well we haven't heard the official price yet. I keep checking daily, twice daily. But I'm

412
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,460
sure Microsoft I know is coming into our work in a few weeks, and I'm sure we'll get the

413
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,360
information out of them then. But that sounds about right. I mean HD DVD players are pretty

414
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,120
expensive, um, and it's not really something that you necessarily have to buy. So, yeah,

415
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,680
$200 seems pretty reasonable for an HD DVD player. But, I mean, when you think about

416
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,640
it, all it is, is really kind of just a drive anyways. But, um, you know, one thing, though,

417
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,960
that what's kind of cool about it, though, is you are gonna be probably able to pump

418
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,420
out, um, 1080p with it. Well, maybe. I don't know. But, um, it doesn't really matter anyways

419
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,860
because 1080i and 1080p are pretty much the same damn thing.

420
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,220
And according to one of the Microsoft employees...

421
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,500
That's not what Sony says!

422
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,100
Well, yeah, they're the ones selling those 1080p TVs.

423
00:27:52,100 --> 00:28:01,140
So pretty much, you know, we have one of the former Microsoft employees, I guess, Andre...

424
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,900
I can't even pronounce his last name.

425
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,340
Anyways, he had a blog entry entitled 1080p Meaningless This Generation, and he discussed

426
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,580
That's why the PlayStation 3 can output 1080p for both games and movies, but apparently

427
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:22,580
doesn't mean much, and you won't see any 1080p games for the PlayStation 3 this year.

428
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
And that kind of makes sense.

429
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,300
I mean, it can output that high, but a lot of the games are being co-developed for both

430
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,900
the, you know, 360 and PlayStation 3 at the same time, so a lot of them just shoot for

431
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,020
720 anyways, so, big deal.

432
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:43,140
This is interesting what fireresurrected says in our chat room over at orangelaunchradio.com

433
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,180
click on chat, 1080i and 1080p is not the same thing.

434
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,380
And I don't think that's what they're saying in this article, I mean obviously they're

435
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,940
not interlaced progressive, but I think what they're saying is, does it matter?

436
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,160
Does the eye really distinguish the difference that much?

437
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,740
They're just saying that there's not much of a difference between the interlaced and

438
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,500
the progressive scan on it, I mean, okay, so granted, I think what you'll see-

439
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,780
I sure noticed the difference between 480i and 480p.

440
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:14,100
I would say what the main difference would probably be is it'd be sharper and less blurry

441
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,760
especially with a lot of movement on screen and stuff like that because it's updating

442
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:23,540
faster but I'm not going to go spend $3,000 on a fucking TV just to make sure that it's

443
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,500
not quite as blurry as the other thing.

444
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,440
Granted, this will be something that will be available later on.

446
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,360
Is it something that you need right now?

447
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Probably not.

448
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,480
So who cares?

449
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Are you really going to notice?

450
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,040
But if each console generation lasts about five years, then the question is, is this

451
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,160
something you're going to have in five years?

452
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,240
Possibly, but the thing is though, is it something really, I mean like for example, the difference

453
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,180
between 720 and 1080i on your TV, do you really notice a huge difference?

454
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,760
Not much, I really don't.

455
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,380
So I mean, you're probably not going to really notice the difference on it, and anyways,

456
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:07,860
He points out there's an analysis done by the video editor of Home Theater Magazine

457
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:14,180
who basically said there's no noticeable difference between 1080i and 1080p.

458
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,540
And so, I'll take it as you will, but remember Sony is the one.

459
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,420
They are trying to sell those TVs, they are trying to sell Blu-ray, and making it a big

460
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,300
selling point because, I don't know, the games aren't that great.

461
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,980
Well, remember also that the next generation doesn't start until Sony says it does, remember?

462
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:37,420
Yeah, somebody in chat reminded me of that a minute ago, so that's why somebody else was saying because I called

463
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,960
99 nights a next-gen game and somebody said well now the 360 is out isn't it current gen and you know well

464
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,020
Unfortunately Sony hasn't said yet that next-gen can start so you know 360 I guess I

465
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,900
Don't know. It's a little silly

466
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,500
I really want to see like Reggie and Peter Moore and

467
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,780
and, um, what's the guy for Sony? Kaz?

468
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,060
Kaz? Yeah, that guy. I want to see them all

469
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,700
like in a Rumble Roses style mud wrestling match.

470
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,700
With bikinis? No, without bikinis, please. Like in suits and ties.

471
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,260
You know, just kicking the crap out of each other over the, uh, different system.

472
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,900
You know Reggie would win, I'm sorry. I'm not just saying that as a Nintendo fanboy,

473
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,700
but Reggie?

474
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,180
You know he would throw down. He looks like he could

475
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,180
kick some ass. We have some talk on Reggie, but we'll get to that a little later.

476
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,180
Reggie? Oh god! You gotta love Reggie! Seriously!

477
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
You know how bad I want him on this show?

478
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,180
I would put out to get Reggie on this show. Alright, anyway.

479
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
I'm sure you would.

480
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,180
I know, I know.

481
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,180
Uh, moving on.

482
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,180
With Reggie, though?

483
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
Uh...

484
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,180
I don't know. I don't think so. I think he's happily married, isn't he?

485
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,180
Well, then you're never gonna get him.

486
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Alright, anyway.

487
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,180
Moving on.

488
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,180
Wow, this show's hit a whole new low.

489
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:59,220
And I thought last week was bad, God, I thought, you know, getting rid of the lesbians, we'd

490
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,100
have ourselves a nice serious program tonight, but I had to go screw it up.

491
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,140
Oh, this is something very serious, the ESRB, and of course the Entertainment Software Ratings

492
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,660
Board is going to be launching a new public service announcement campaign.

493
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,900
The PSAs will explain video game ratings to parents and encourage them to check the rating

494
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,420
every time they purchase a video game for their kids.

495
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,900
His campaign will be using TV, radio throughout the state of Georgia and itís going to be

496
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,060
running in the coming weeks.

497
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:34,300
Recent studies paid for by the ESRB show that 83% of parents with children who play video

498
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,980
games are aware of the ESRB ratings and three-quarters reference them when buying games for their

499
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
family.

500
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,540
I couldnít help but think when I read this, havenít there already been many PSAs and

501
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,540
campaigns for this?

502
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:53,320
When I went into Target, there's this whole who wants to be a millionaire play, which

503
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,500
I think is really funny because that whole thing is years old now.

504
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
I think America is so over-millionaire.

505
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,440
But they have this whole thing with Regis selling the ratings, basically.

506
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
That's annoying sounding.

507
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,700
But when I worked at EB... There's a baseball one, too.

508
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Yeah.

509
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,820
On our EBTV we had every month, they had Tiger Woods promoting the ESRB ratings, and I think

510
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:22,300
Derek Jeter was on one time too. It was, you know, I guess informative, but I think

511
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,380
they don't give the parents enough credit because when I worked in EB, the

512
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,000
parents would always check the ESRB ratings. It's like, oh, this game's T? They

513
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,260
would ask my opinion and be like, yeah, if you're getting it for your four-year-old,

514
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,380
that's probably not a good thing. There's always one retard that slips

515
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,420
through the cracks though. And that's the one they pay attention to. And I mean that, I don't mean like

516
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,620
literally, okay, I'm not totally insensitive, but I mean like, you know,

517
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:50,340
Somebody who really just something is just you know wrong with the parents. There's just one. You know parent out there

518
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,180
That's always you know their kids are screaming

519
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,740
You know fine

520
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,140
I got a bike around the thought of for them and then you know kids see something on there and

521
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,160
Being a retard and his parents don't watch him he goes and punches his sister or something

522
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,220
Oh my god. He learned it from the game

523
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,760
He didn't want it because I'm not paying attention to him or anything. He's because of the game you bought him the damn game

524
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,140
So then then she goes and sues, you know somebody

525
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,540
Over the game and then you know, the whole thing comes down to you know

526
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,720
Then Jack Jackie poop comes in goes see see it's what I'm talking about

527
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,460
But the whole thing comes down to the parents, you know, you can put it out there

528
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,400
You can put it in their face

529
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:39,220
You can you know sell them the game and go this is rated team for this reason and you let them know or whatever

530
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,900
oh as you're selling them the game and it won't matter it won't matter because

531
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,780
they're stupid and they're just hell-bent on doing something stupid and

532
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,340
killing themselves so lead a horse to water

533
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,740
all right now black wolf since he lives in Georgia his show is based out of

534
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,100
Atlanta area he says the difference here is that it is done with the assistance

535
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,340
of the Georgia Attorney General instead of just the ESRB people listen to the

536
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,180
Attorney General more I I actually doubt the truth behind that statement no if

537
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,720
Bobby but I don't think the Attorney General having a hand in it's gonna

538
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,360
change things that much but maybe it's just a California I don't know cuz you

539
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,320
know whatever I don't know actually don't you remember years ago the

540
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,940
California Attorney General was like really upset about Mortal Kombat and all

541
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,980
that stuff and got involved with that stuff weren't the rating systems

542
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,660
established in part because of him I want to say yeah huh no maybe I'm wrong

543
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,880
then who knows anyways moving on here there's a

544
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,660
a Spanish magazine, Nintendo Accion, that is reporting that the next issue will reveal

545
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,600
the official price, the launch date, and the game lineup for the Wii. It says the issue

546
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,100
is due to hit on September 15th. So people are saying, they're going to announce the

547
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,740
official date on September 15th. Wow! Okay, I've read this on numerous sites...

548
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,100
Hooray! Another Wii speculation story! Hold on, hold on. I've read this on numerous

549
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:09,380
sites and there's a whole big hole in their logic here for example do you

550
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,860
realize that I don't know they have to work on the magazine for a few months

551
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,860
and you know go through all that editorial process and then print the

552
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,260
magazine it doesn't just like magically poof right there so they're not gonna

553
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,660
announce the date on to the 15th I bet you anything they're announcing it next

554
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,980
Wednesday during let's big and that's where you're gonna find all your damn

555
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,500
information that's where they're gonna get this information that's gonna be

556
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,420
posted in the magazine so just wait a few more days and all the info will be

557
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,580
there I don't understand okay all these gaming blogs are running this

558
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,420
speculation thing you know like it's everywhere on the internet and I fucking

559
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,940
told you guys last week exactly what day the Wii would be out and not a damn

560
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,700
person picked up the story and said orange launch radio knows that the Wii

561
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:02,300
will be out soon I'm very upset with the gaming community right now I'm still got

562
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:08,080
my all my chips on the 18th of October really well that's that's I think it's a

563
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,960
risky bet at this point I bet on soon I think I think he's in the right

564
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,360
vicinity but what the hell am I doing I'm done with speculating we'll know

565
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,680
what we know we will know when Reggie comes out and says BAM here is is he

566
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,160
just go wow there's my junk this is the date

567
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,600
real credit by the way earlier when we were talking about the mud wrestling

568
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Our chat room did seem to agree with us here.

569
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Ari Masan said, Reggie is cool.

570
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Zero Cool says, yeah, Reggie would kick ass and take names.

571
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
DMN says, he's a big guy.

572
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Rama says, Reggie is half black.

573
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
He will fuck everyone up.

574
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,600
He will get ghetto in a heartbeat.

575
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,600
FireResurrected says, I love how Sky calls himself a Sony fanboy and Nintendo fanboy.

576
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
I'm just a games fanboy.

577
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,600
I'm also a Microsoft fanboy.

578
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
I didn't used to be.

579
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,600
A long time ago, I used to hate Microsoft's game thing.

580
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,060
But you know things change people change opinions change the Xbox was like my green kryptonite, you know

581
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,320
I just couldn't touch it. That's the way a lot of us values to buy an Xbox, but you know what?

582
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
I got tired of waiting and

583
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,120
It was a good purchase. They finally started coming out with really really good games towards the season 3

584
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,840
It might be a good purchase later on. I'm not gonna buy I think that's it, too

585
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,120
I think I you know what you have a very good point

586
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,040
I think the ps3 is gonna suffer the same fate of the Xbox in my mind

587
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,700
I think later on the ps3 is going to be like a must-have system, but to start

588
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:36,560
I'm just waiting for I'm waiting for some of their great first-party titles. I mean, I want a new Twisted Metal god damn it

589
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,520
It's gonna look fucking amazing on the PlayStation 3 that'll probably sell the system for me right there

590
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,180
But you know, there is no Twisted Metal at lunch. Yeah, people said the virtual

591
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,380
There's no we off to a slow start. Look what happened it granted

592
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,600
I didn't really buy any of the ratchet and clank games nor do I like the ratchet and clank games

593
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,480
but, you know, that would be a cool game to have on there. Maybe, um, I don't know.

594
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,720
I want Jumping Flash. Screw everything else if I could get a Jumping Flash game.

595
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,000
An actual, you know, an actual Gran Turismo sequel.

596
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,080
You would be fucking happy with a Fantavision sequel because your taste in games is fucked

597
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,040
and I think anyone that's listened to this show long enough knows that by now. Your taste

598
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,120
in games is absolutely fucked. Whatever, Fantavision was really fun. And

599
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:23,640
Jumping flash. Yeah best. That's the reason that in Megaman 8 were the reasons

600
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,480
I got a ps1 because jumping flash never mind Symphony of the Night Final Fantasy 7 slide

601
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:37,260
Never mind, you know any of that stuff. It was all about fucking jumping jumping fly little robot bunny guy was so cool

602
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,820
Well and somebody in the chat room said uh

603
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:52,820
that they want an online jumping flash, GS68 or whatever, I would play it with you because that's a great sounding game.

604
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Can we get to the next story please?

605
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
No.

606
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,820
Alright, now one place that you might be able to get your hands on the Wii are these secret parties that are supposedly starting in September.

607
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Now this is kind of interesting because Nintendo is going to be having these private parties.

608
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,820
What they're going to do is they're going to seek out people, I don't know, like on the internet, MySpace, or what they're doing.

609
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,620
And they're going to invite 30 friends to this private party, so it's like an underground campaign.

610
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,120
It's a random selection of Nintendo Ambassadors.

611
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,620
You basically sign in, there's like some websites...

612
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,220
Sign me up! Shit, I want to have an Orange Lounge Radio Wii party, wouldn't that be fun?

613
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,520
Well technically since we're...

614
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,220
I've said such nice things about Reggie on this program.

615
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,920
I think that entitles us to a Wii party.

616
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,720
You said you wouldn't have sex with him though, that's not very nice.

617
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,520
That's respectful, that's not being rude, that's being respectful.

618
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
I know.

619
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,520
Well, you know what, we played it at E3, we'll get to play it soon enough.

620
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Hopefully.

621
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
I mean, it's just the whole thing is buzzed.

622
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,520
They really need to start some really serious advertising.

623
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,520
I gotta tell you this though, this is how underground it is.

624
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,520
They know that Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver are all going to have these parties.

625
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Supposedly some of the news is leaking through and a Chicago person actually emailed Kotaku

626
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,520
and said that his friends are going to be bust rave style to a secret location to play games and have fun.

627
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,440
games and have fun so like they're gonna have to go to this you know random

628
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,360
parking lot in the ghetto side of town and get in the bus and then be shipped

629
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:20,280
to the Wii and it's like you know hey man want some X want a hit how about

630
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,560
that sleeping battle royale that's how the Wii's graphics are gonna be 3d drug

631
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,240
influenced oh I figured it out yes yes indeed exactly that's awesome I'm a

632
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:38,760
a genius. Well, speaking of L.A., American McGee, who has a wonderful game called Bad

633
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,120
Day L.A., coming out in a couple weeks here, he's basically on the record saying the only

634
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:52,340
real next-gen is the Wii. And his reasons for that, basically, that the only true next-gen

635
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,880
console out there is the Wii, everything else is just a video card and processor upgrade,

636
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,520
I guess because he's, you know, controls a lot different.

637
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,560
Says, um, he believes that, um, you know,

638
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,440
I don't know, they're really not invading, just kinda upgrading.

639
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,560
So, better graphics and really where the games are is just better gameplay.

640
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,520
You need to fuckin' release some more games, American McGee. That's all I gotta say about that.

641
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,320
I don't think the Wii is next-gen so much as it is

642
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,100
I'll do what I want, Jen. I mean, that's what Nintendo's doing.

643
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,260
essentially, we'll do what we want!

644
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,260
We're just gonna, you, Nintendo, Microsoft, I mean, Sony, Microsoft, you have

645
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,820
fun over there fighting.

646
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:38,720
We'll be off on this side doing our wee thing.

647
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,620
Seriously.

648
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:44,060
The whole thing was is, you know,

649
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,100
pretty much

650
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,260
he knows, well, I wouldn't really

651
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,740
say that he knows what, you know, gaming is, but you know,

652
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,700
I think he's trying to point out, it's just like what we say on the show all the time, you know,

653
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:00,220
system is only as good as the games. And I think just by looking at the Wii, I mean playing

654
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,300
some of these games using that control setup is going to be a lot of fun. And you don't

655
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,900
need to have superb graphics to do it. And to be honest, a lot of the games that come

656
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,660
out for the Nintendo system, especially a lot of the first party stuff, you don't need

657
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,560
to render cartoons and super duper graphics. I mean they're just animated characters. They're

658
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,980
realistic so yeah they can do it with that kind of technology and that kind of

659
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,000
power so I don't know just play the game goddamn wait stop trying to like guess

660
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,760
just we'll see who's you know gonna be at the top pretty soon I mean only a few

661
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,440
months before these systems come out so why do we gotta speculate it's really is

662
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,760
it that slow of a news week in a way sadly enough I mean we're all waiting

663
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,320
for these systems to come out what else

664
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,400
are we supposed to do in the meantime

665
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,520
nobody wants to play 99 nights but me so

666
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,700
I don't know yeah so we can just like

667
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,800
point laugh at all the hype wars all

668
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,480
right Jeremy Todd one interesting point

669
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,320
in chat who says next gen has to have

670
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,240
awesome graphics next gen is really just

671
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
a change of the gen before it and the we

672
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,520
certainly falls into that category sure

673
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,000
true agreed all right well this could be

674
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,560
another random direction the we is going

675
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:21,400
in. You know how the DS was kind of the brain training system? Well, the Wii may be the

676
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,300
body training system. There was a report published by Bloomberg that made mention of a new form

677
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:32,500
of game in development at Nintendo. It's a Wii-based diet software. This Bloomberg report

678
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,000
issued, I'm sorry, this Bloomberg report showed that there was the recent strong performance

679
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,400
of Nintendo's Japanese stock, and it made mention of the new software in passing. Nintendo

680
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,080
is developing diet-related and other forms of software for the Wii.

681
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,760
The report noted that such titles, specifically Brain Age for the DS,

682
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,340
have been able to target new users who aren't used to standard game controllers.

683
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,760
Details were not given beyond this. Well, that would kinda coincide with the

684
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,280
registering of the domain Wii Health, so... That would make sense.

685
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,400
That's what I was thinking, too, is all those, you know, Wii things we read about

686
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,540
previously, so...

687
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,580
So, not too surprised there. What is kinda funny

688
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,020
and surprising I guess is that the Wii is going to have

689
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,420
or speculated to have a voice-to-text chat

690
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,500
I guess you would call this an advanced voice-to-text

691
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,980
chat because it'll actually detect I guess

692
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,180
the kind of

693
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,860
emotion behind your voice like if you're yelling it'll be bold

694
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,140
caps and stuff like that, different colors

695
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,420
and will maybe censor out explicit speech or

696
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,500
converted to you know less explicit stuff

697
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,660
but it's interesting though I know they've had problems before with their

698
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,860
voice recognition so that'd be kind of funny talking to people

699
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,420
it reminds me of almost like that Vista demo that they showed with the voice recognition

700
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,860
it seems kinda risky to me maybe it's just me but that seems like a really

701
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,820
risky thing to implement I don't know how

702
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:08,260
how much I believe that to be honest. I don't even know why you would do voice to text chat anyways if you could just do voice chat

703
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
Mean what would be the point? I

704
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,100
Don't know. I

705
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,000
Maybe it's just supposed to be one of those things that makes the Wii so unique

706
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,020
And I like the idea of maybe that's how they will censor folks so that you don't

707
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:26,700
It's like, you know when you sign on Xbox Live my god. I was playing on Xbox Live just like two days ago

708
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,500
I was playing freaking marble blast right online

709
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,200
Okay

710
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:35,500
And these guys are in there are playing and I joined the game and like they're all yelling back and forth at each other

711
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,580
you queer stop being such a queer you're a fag fuck you fuck you I'm gonna fuck

712
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:45,980
up your marble but and I'm like dude you're playing marble blast not to knock

713
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,740
marble blast it's a great game but it doesn't exactly strike me as the macho

714
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:58,220
you know stereotypical macho man type of game my marbles are made of seal bitch

715
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:03,820
exactly you're bound to hear that sort of stuff also like uno so no I got

716
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:09,660
fucking Uno bitch. Suck it. I've never heard smack talking in Uno. Really? Yes, never.

717
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:15,980
We need to start. Play more Uno. I don't want to get bad ratings. I'm gonna totally talk crap in,

718
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:22,300
like, I don't know, totem ball or something. If that's multiplayer, I'm gonna fucking talk shit.

719
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,660
Too bad, like, Bejeweled 2 isn't multiplayer. That would be sweet.

720
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,500
FireResurrected in chat says, that's why you need to play with your listeners. I mean,

721
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,460
that's true. I want to play games with the listeners. We'll set up, like, a time or

722
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,020
something like a uh you know hey play games with us on xbox live type of night uh we'll do some

723
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,260
like that reni says marbles are serious shit sky i can't wait to get saints bro i just can't wait

724
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:52,780
to get that game i'm gonna talk so much crap black wolf says draw for biatch exactly see he he's got

725
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,340
the right i want to have you know what didn't all games do an uno tournament recently i don't know

726
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,380
i want to have like a shit talk in uno tournament that's graded not only on how well you play

727
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,800
But how will you talk shit like remember that uh, what was that movie with the South Park guys years ago basketball, right?

728
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:12,660
They have like they have the psych outs, right? Yeah, that's what we need is a psych out uno tournament

729
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,580
I have no idea how we could pull that off, but we need like a shit talking uno tournament

730
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:20,540
Here's what we need to do. Oh, yeah, I think you're gonna win this game. We'll suck on this reverse

731
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:23,340
Here's what we need to do your mom sucked on that reverse

732
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,340
we need to film it and we need to wait until they come out with the vision

733
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:34,220
cameras and that will be the shit right there because you'll have you know

734
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:39,460
yelling and it'll just be like you know it'll be awesome

735
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,080
all right maybe we'll have to plan something like that I'll talk to a Scott

736
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,020
offline I'm sure he'll love that idea I've got a story about Reggie tonight

737
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:54,100
is like Reggie Knight on Orange Lounge Radio. I mean seriously, this man, well this man

738
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,740
is kickin' ass. He's like the Chuck Norris of gaming. That's what it is. That's why I

739
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,260
love Reggie. Don't be talking about Chuck Norris. Well I don't really like Chuck Norris,

740
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,580
like you know I think World of Warcraft. Why are we talking about Chuck Norris? Okay look,

741
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:09,660
World of Warcraft ruined Chuck Norris for me, would you agree with that? Like I used

742
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,980
to love the Conan O'Brien thing, when he used to pull the lever and have to walk, come on,

743
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,980
Tell me that wasn't awesome.

744
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,980
It wasn't awesome.

745
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,980
Okay, well, you're...

746
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,980
See?

747
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,980
Your taste in everything is fucked.

748
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,980
I also have co-workers...

749
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:24,220
You eat Taco Bell like five times a weekend because you have a crush on someone that works

750
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,220
there.

751
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Something is wrong with you.

752
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,220
So that's perfectly acceptable.

753
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:32,660
Anyway, I got sick of Chuck Norris after all my co-workers were obsessed with him and bought

754
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,980
books about him and then it happened and wow and I just wanted to die.

755
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,180
Anyway, Reggie

756
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,820
has said you know remember that way back when Peter Moore said

757
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,740
about the Sony tell me why you would buy a $600 PlayStation 3

758
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,140
people are gonna buy two machines they're gonna buy an Xbox and they're

759
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,900
gonna buy a Wii for the price of one PlayStation 3

760
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:59,180
and everybody's you know remember that was said back at E3 and everybody's eyebrows went up like

761
00:49:59,180 --> 00:49:59,720
oh

762
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,380
Microsoft and Nintendo might be in bed together well

763
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,220
they are not in bed together because you know what Reggie came back and said

764
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,860
There was an article in USA Today about the Wii, and

765
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,980
he said, quote, I'd much rather have the consumer buy a Wii,

766
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,780
some accessories, and a ton of games, versus buying any of my competitors'

767
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,580
products.

768
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:24,300
See, you don't get in bed with Microsoft, you just might catch something.

769
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,900
It's like, yeah, like Windows.

770
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,100
Other interesting comments made in the interview, quote, we will offer online

771
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,780
enabled games that the consumers will not have to pay a subscription fee for.

772
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,100
they'll be able to enjoy that right out of the box. The Wii console is going to be

773
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,300
Wi-Fi enabled

774
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,060
so essentially you'll be able to plug it in and go. It won't have hidden fees or

775
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:45,700
costs.

776
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,180
P.S. suck it more. Actually that wasn't

777
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,260
said but that's kind of what he was implying. I mean

778
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:56,940
why didn't he just say, you know, suck it Microsoft, ours thing's gonna be free.

779
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,980
And you know what, that is a big point. I mean

780
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,700
I even though I I don't understand why you would need you know Wi-Fi adapter for the 360

781
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,740
I mean, I just run fucking ethernet cable and go to my router

782
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:14,860
But like if you really want to spend $99 for fucking Wi-Fi

783
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,520
Adapter I mean that's ridiculous, but at least the weeds gonna have it out of the box however

784
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,980
It doesn't have an ethernet cable

785
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:21,800
You know port on there

786
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:27,100
So you actually have to have a some sort of Wi-Fi connection whether it be some USB thing or Wi-Fi router

787
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:32,340
Okay, that kind of sucks now fire resurrected brings up this excellent point that kind of says you know try

788
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,340
He's trying to put Reggie in this place a little bit here

789
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,460
This is an interesting comment, but we have to endure the fucking friend codes

790
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,700
Ouch that that much of a gripe damn

791
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:48,940
Yeah, it does not code. It's a password. You guys don't remember entering in password, okay?

792
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:55,220
But but I do and I remember not liking it. We're beyond that now. I remember Justin Bailey dash dash dash, but no seriously

793
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:02,300
Honestly, put it side by side with Microsoft's system where you can add people on the web

794
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,300
and everything.

795
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,460
I mean, okay, you've got to give that one to Microsoft.

796
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,940
They've got the more ease of communicating with your friends in a way, huh?

797
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:11,940
I think so.

798
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,440
I mean, the Wii could change things, obviously.

799
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,140
Just trying to do the stupid friend code stuff for Animal Crossing when I had that game for

800
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:24,580
two weeks that was really obnoxious and I wished I could have just you know been

801
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,820
able to maybe even go to some hub town and like hang out with people like oh

802
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:33,740
you're really cool here I'm going to add you as my friend or something much

803
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,800
easier act deft in our chat room says friend codes good on theory but Nintendo

804
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,660
didn't do it the right way Jeremy Todd one seems to add to that but they have a

805
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,180
different password for each and every different game they only need one friend

806
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,180
code for the system and that would work fine.

807
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,900
Interesting comments.

808
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:56,280
Another place we always get interesting comments is our mailbag and even though DarkSakura

809
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:00,440
is not here tonight to read the mail for us, I've borrowed her hazmat suit and I'm going

810
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,340
to jump on into the mailbag and read some emails.

811
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,340
You want to read an email, Shane?

812
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,340
Yeah.

813
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,340
Alright, come over here.

814
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
Read an email.

815
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,340
Alright.

816
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,340
Why don't you read this email?

817
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:15,860
This one comes to us from StevenNZ and Shane's going to read us this email here.

818
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:22,860
Hi! I absolutely love your show. I have been listening for about one and a half years now,

819
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,800
but just recently registered on your site. I heard in episode 193 that you guys may not

820
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:34,440
be getting the Xbox 360 PGR3 bundle, so I would just like to tell you that over here

821
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:42,000
in New Zealand, there's a... an, not a, an Xbox 360 bundle with Project Gotham 3 and

822
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Which is weird because us New Zealanders normally get things late or don't get anything at all. Thanks for the great show

823
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,020
Steven New Zealand. All right. Well

824
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,080
By the way, it has since come out. I mean the 193 was a little bit ago. So it has since come out

825
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,880
We are not getting that project Gotham Racing bundle here. We're not getting bundles of a sort

826
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,160
No

827
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,000
My only thing though is that is this an official

828
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,720
Microsoft sanctioned bundle or is this something like the local gaming store in New Zealand is doing like how GameStop does here?

829
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,720
I think it is official.

830
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,720
Oh that's cool.

831
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,140
Because in other countries they're getting official bundles to help sell the system a

832
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,140
bit more because you know they're having a little trouble.

833
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,940
So I mean you see some bundles here like I know like bundle I've seen at like Fry's our

834
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,340
local electronics chain over here.

835
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,300
They've got a bundle with Ridge Racer 6 which you know as we mentioned last week Ridge Racer

836
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,940
6 is only $19.99 so it's not a great deal.

837
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:33,940
So yeah.

838
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:39,700
But still though it is pretty decent I mean that they're doing that so I don't know.

839
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,080
Alright, well let's go to our next email. Do you want to read another one, Shane?

840
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,320
Yeah! Alright, here we go. Can I respond to?

841
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,800
If you want. This one comes to us from Boston OLR fam. This is really long.

842
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,920
Wait until you see the next one. Alright. Hi.

843
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,800
I'm a relatively new listener and I really love your show.

844
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,060
The format works well and the interaction between the three of you

845
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,480
and any guests you have on definitely make the experience... You didn't read the

846
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,280
part that said except for Miklotov.

847
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,280
Well because it doesn't exist. I'm just kidding.

848
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,280
Make the experience all that much more enjoyable.

849
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,280
My question concerns Kid Icarus.

850
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:19,280
When it came out for the original NES, I truly loved the game.

851
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,280
And thought it ranked right up there with Metroid as far as playability and...

852
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,280
I can't read it standing up like this because I'm at an angle.

853
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,280
An interesting concept.

854
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,280
An interesting concept.

855
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:35,280
Why then, has there never been a sequel to this potentially fun franchise?

856
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,000
Is there some sort of inside information

857
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,480
uh... blah blah blah

858
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,400
that have kept this from happening

859
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,440
or am I one of a small minority of people who like the original game

860
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,480
so there's just not enough interest to produce. Thanks for your time and keep

861
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,740
up the great work

862
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,680
Boston Ullrfan

863
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,800
Wait, I want to respond!

864
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,880
There was one on the GBA

865
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,200
I don't remember if it's a sequel but I'm pretty sure it wasn't the same game

866
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:11,320
Is it just because the Game Boy version didn't sell as well comparatively?

867
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,840
Did it kill off the franchise or what?

868
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:17,680
I honestly don't think a lot of people bought it because, I mean, Metroid got a sequel on

869
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,160
Game Boy and we ended up getting Super Metroid.

870
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,200
Yeah, Metroid II really did suck.

871
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,960
All the future Metroids have been pretty darn good and Super Metroid is probably one of

872
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,000
the best video games ever made, period.

873
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,560
That's an amazing game.

874
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:34,200
I guess Kid Icarus on Gameboy just really must have been horrible.

875
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,320
It must have suffered from Metroid II syndrome where that game was really terrible, too.

876
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,800
It just makes me cry inside because if Super Metroid was seriously the great,

877
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,920
great, great, great, great, great video game it was,

878
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,680
imagine what Super Kid Icarus could have been. I mean, it just makes me kind of sad.

879
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,040
I know. I love Kid Icarus, actually, and when I had a PSP for two weeks, I played it on that,

880
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,920
And that game is freaking hard, but it's awesome.

881
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,680
I suppose it's possible that maybe with the Wii, especially with Pit being one of the

882
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,800
new Smash Bros. characters, maybe now is the time for Kid Icarus to return finally.

883
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,000
Because Metroid kind of made a big return on the GameCube.

884
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,640
Maybe it'll make the same return and Kid Icarus will become a first person shooter.

885
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:23,600
See, that's the problem, I don't want them to, like if they make a new Kid Icarus, I

886
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,480
don't want it to be that different.

887
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,200
Like, I don't want them to fuck with it like they did Metroid.

888
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,040
I know a lot of you like the first person Metroid, but I don't care for it.

889
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,600
You don't want to use the Wii controller to draw back the bowstrings?

890
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,160
Okay, now that might be kind of cool, depending on...

891
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,840
I don't want it to be first person!

892
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,200
If I had to, like, run around and fight an eggplant wizard in first person, I think I

893
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,920
would cry, because that was the scariest part of that game for me when I was younger.

894
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,920
Because I did not want to be an eggplant with legs.

895
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,920
See the eggplant?

896
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,120
See, Kid Icarus had so many memorable characters like that.

897
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,840
You know the scary Medusa looking thing and the dragon that flew that would yell at you

898
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
if it saw you?

899
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
That was so scary.

900
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
Yeah, seriously.

901
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
I loved it though.

902
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,160
Oh, how can you not love computers?

903
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,880
And the things that looked like noses with eyes that had a lot of nose hair coming out,

904
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,160
I don't remember what they were called, but they were scary too.

905
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,440
Legend of Zaku thinks he knows another game that ought to be making a return on the Wii.

906
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,500
Punch Out.

907
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,640
Super Punch Out was pretty good.

908
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
It was a little bit overlooked.

909
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
I never played that one.

910
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,240
It was a little bit overlooked because I think it came out late in the Super Nintendo's run.

911
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,280
Mike Tyson basically ruined it for everybody.

912
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,360
Mike Tyson does it.

913
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,960
You don't need Mike Tyson.

914
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,080
How about George Foreman?

915
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,080
I realize he's long gone, but I mean, he makes the grills.

916
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:36,880
I think he's promoting the PlayStation 3.

917
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,680
All right, I got to read this email.

918
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,160
This is a great email.

919
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,960
It's kind of long, but since it's well-written,

920
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,000
I'm going to read the whole thing, OK?

921
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,560
So everybody get the water and snacks.

922
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,640
All right, shut up.

923
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,440
No, this is a good email.

924
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:46,980
Listen to this.

925
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,040
This is about Sony.

926
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,200
This is a really good, interesting point

927
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,280
on the whole Sony debate.

928
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,680
Hello, GS191 here, and just wanted

929
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,840
put in my two cents on one of the reoccurring topics on the show, Sony.

930
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,540
It's hard trying to like Sony these days.

931
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,440
With their failing formats, overpriced and underperforming Blu-ray format, the underwhelming

932
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:06,840
PlayStation 3, the whole rootkit fiasco, and let's not forget, they're the makers of the

933
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:11,560
exploding Dell and Apple laptop batteries, is there any redeeming quality left in Sony?

934
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,880
To me, I think not.

935
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,240
First off, why do they insist on trying to push dead formats such as the Betamax, Minidisc,

936
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,240
UMD, etc.

937
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,480
The list goes on and on.

938
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,480
And now comes Blu-ray.

939
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,680
Sure, Blu-ray has the support of over 180 companies, but the thing that gets me is where

940
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,360
is the consumer in all of this?

941
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,800
I don't see the demand for Blu-ray or HD-DVD now since we basically don't have the majority

942
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,480
of the population owning HD-TVs, let alone 1080p HD-TVs.

943
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,400
This all leads up to the PlayStation 3 and Sony Computer Entertainment in general.

944
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,600
I think that $600 of my hard-earned money is not worth it, even if it was bundled with

945
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,920
a Blu-ray disc showing 6 million ways how Aerith can die for all I care.

946
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,600
They have in no way ever explained to me why is this plastic box full of fans, transistors,

947
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,340
chips, silicon is worth that price tag.

948
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:00,400
They try to push how this is the next generation of gaming and it's proven in the games.

949
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,160
Yeah, I see some screen and game footage from the launch titles for PlayStation 3 and I

950
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
was very underwhelmed.

951
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,160
A lot of them look like Xbox 360 and PC games.

952
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,160
I cannot tell the difference.

953
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,960
That right there says why spend $600 and I can shell out $400 or even $250 for a much

954
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,320
better gaming experience than have enough money for the games.

955
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,520
Also eight of the games are already going to be on other consoles.

956
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,960
That also really doesn't give me much incentive.

957
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,720
I think they are really going for the action-oriented audience with this launch, but with many people

958
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:33,100
not seeing that Grade A title like Halo or Metal Gear at launch, why should I even bother?

959
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,440
My real problem is the whole PC notation.

960
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,840
It's not a computer, people.

961
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,180
If it's a computer, does this mean that I can upgrade the PS3 to a faster processor

962
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,700
or add more RAM?

963
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,700
Probably not.

964
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:48,900
Even if it did, why would anybody want to upgrade?

965
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,900
It's like the 32X for the Genesis.

966
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,080
The games were there, but nobody wanted to upgrade.

967
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,380
The same would apply here.

968
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,420
Besides, you're going to need a lot of fine tuning to text from a PC perfectly scaled

969
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,720
on a regular SD TV.

970
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,940
This is what I think should have been done and can be done for SCE to turn things around.

971
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,580
One, kill off the flash card reader and leave the memory stick in.

972
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,960
Isn't that what you do with your Sony Vial laptops?

973
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,680
If I want to look at my photos, I will put them on the computer.

974
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,360
It's just added costs that could, not could, definitely have dropped the price down from

975
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,360
$600.

976
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,580
Hell, replace it with, I don't know, regular legacy PS2 controller ports for people who

977
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,520
use PS2 controllers for DDR, Beatmania, Guitar Hero, etc.

978
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
2.

979
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,800
Instead of getting rid of the HDMI port from the $500 version, why not disable the ability

980
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,360
of commercially made Blu-ray movies from playing?

981
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,960
Sony can always release a downloadable upgrade that will enable the playback function.

982
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,220
This is a lot better than watching downscaled Blu-ray movies because the movie has copy

983
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:46,020
protection in it and you don't even have the port for full resolution playback.

984
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,240
If this happened, I think the $500 would be useful and great for my needs instead of being

985
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,460
the joke that it is.

986
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,460
3.

987
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:56,860
Sony, it's time for Kaz, Ken, and David to make a nice long nap until November.

988
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,340
These three people make the PlayStation 3 more overblown than it already is.

989
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:03,540
At least get them some decent PR people to limit what they say.

990
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,540
4.

991
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,200
Convince people why they should buy the PlayStation 3.

992
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,440
This is the most important and the hardest thing their marketing department has to do.

993
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,600
I would love to see Sony do an all-out blitz of great ads on why you should be even considering

994
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,720
a PlayStation 3 for the holiday season.

995
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,580
All they need to do is showcase the games, do some comparisons, and especially convince

996
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,600
people how the hell $600 is justifiable on a gaming device.

997
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,920
If they can do the last part, that would be great for them.

998
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,360
I'm doubtful if they can do that, though.

999
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,040
Well, that's what I think anyway.

1000
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,440
Keep up the great work, screw the haters, practice what you preach, and don't be a dick.

1001
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,700
Sincerely, GS191.

1002
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:36,700
Now you may speak."

1003
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:43,020
Okay, so he wanted to do actual upgrades later on, that was one of the things Kaz said that

1004
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,700
they're looking forward to doing PC-type upgrades with more RAM, more stuff.

1005
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,140
Then it comes down to the problem, well now you don't have a standardized system to work

1006
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,980
for, so how do you develop games?

1007
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,220
That's not good for the consumer or for the publishers of these games or anybody even

1008
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,420
thinking about the system because what the fuck do you develop for?

1009
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,020
Now you just have to kind of figure out, okay, well what do people have?

1010
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:09,900
always gonna develop for the lowest end well this is stupid the whole um you

1011
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,580
know taking out the memory card slots and stuff like that they actually the

1012
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,100
stripped-down version doesn't have them and to be honest if they even did have

1013
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:23,120
them they're only like 12 bucks to install anyways so big deal and then

1014
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,580
finally yeah they do need to actually actually tell me why I need to buy this

1015
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:31,680
system because to be honest I was excited about the PlayStation 3 when I

1016
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,220
went in the E3 I was like holy shit this is gonna be awesome there was games I saw you know trailers

1017
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:43,140
for I'm like I gotta play these things I played them as like so what this is stupid the games

1018
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:48,620
were big letdown and I know they're not finished but you know what I'm not talking about graphics

1019
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:53,820
either I'm just really saying gameplay for these games sucked and the graphics were just like well

1020
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:01,340
I can see this on the 360 big deal so yeah they are gonna have a problem because basically Xbox

1021
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,700
is lining up their system and the games coming out right now especially all

1022
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,820
their first party stuff to trump everything that they're going to release

1023
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:12,980
on the ps3 I mean you've got Gran Turismo HD or whatever they're calling

1024
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:17,960
it now well Forza 2 kicks the crap out of that then they've got you know an

1025
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:23,100
actual I guess you would kind of say almost like a halo game coming out Gears

1026
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,220
of War which is gonna be just fucking ginormous and that's coming out you know

1027
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:32,180
week before the PlayStation 3 launch and to be honest blu-ray kind of sucks you

1028
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:37,620
don't really need the HDMI right now because you can still be able to pump

1029
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:42,260
out the same stuff component wise until at least I think like 2009 but once they

1030
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:46,020
go all digital then yes you will need the HDMI and you're gonna be fucked

1031
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:51,260
because all your blu-ray discs are only gonna be able to output at 540 so half

1032
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:57,100
the resolution yay that's really worth $600 and I agree the one good thing

1033
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:00,460
thing though about HD DVD right now though is they're releasing all the discs with

1034
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,940
their hybrid discs one side DVD one side HD DVD so say for example that you

1035
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:10,180
are planning on buying HD DVD player down the line you can buy these hybrid

1036
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,540
discs and you can still watch them now then later on when you get your new

1037
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,700
system you don't have to go repurchase the actual movie you can just flip the

1038
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:23,280
disc over and watch it in a higher resolution so I don't know whatever the

1039
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,020
case they haven't done their advertising campaign yet and they're gonna need one

1040
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:30,460
hell of an advertising campaign to get the system sold.

1041
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,980
Alright, I'm looking in chat and lots of feedback of course to this email in chat

1042
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:37,020
and what's kind of funny is that the author of the email is in chat right now, so

1043
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,300
kind of responding to comments there or just at least kind of looking at what people are saying.

1044
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,300
Gosh, there's a lot of stuff here. Let's see, I like the one that

1045
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,140
Funnydale said. Also, let's remember the PlayStation 2 launched with

1046
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,820
Fantavision and look at how well the PS2 did. That's because Fantavision is a

1047
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,420
brilliant game. Well, you know what? I don't know about that.

1048
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,940
To give, you know, Fan of Vision, I did play Fan of Vision when it came out.

1049
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:01,180
It was one of the first games I rented because I didn't really have any games for it.

1050
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,480
And you know what? It was a game that had a different style of gameplay that was fun to play.

1051
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:11,180
It was simple, but it was fun. It comes down to, like, the Geometry Wars kind of, you know, scenario there.

1052
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,420
It's still a fun game. It made me simple, but it was fun to play.

1053
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:18,580
Granted that I got bored with it after a while, but it doesn't matter. It's different.

1054
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,940
I never got bored with it because of those cutscenes with the live actors. Those were great.

1055
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:26,380
BlackWolf says the PlayStation 3 would sell out my area even if there were no

1056
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,860
games for it. They don't care. They want the Sony system

1057
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,820
and that's final. That's what, you know what, and that's what Kaz said. He's all

1058
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:36,240
people would buy this system even if we sold it with no games.

1059
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,420
Well good, I hope that you're happy with your purchase. I mean, no one's saying,

1060
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,820
no one, I'm not going to talk anyone out buying a PlayStation 3.

1061
01:06:43,820 --> 01:06:47,520
Go ahead and buy one if you want to, but you know what,

1062
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,820
I hope some good games come out for you because so far I'm not impressed, so

1063
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:56,700
maybe down the line. It might be great. You know, one of those Final Fantasy 13s and one, you know,

1064
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,220
Metal Gear Solid 4 and all that stuff.

1065
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,260
But the way I look at it, that's about a year off, so...

1066
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,740
I didn't even jump on board. I may look at the system in a year. I didn't jump on board with

1067
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:08,140
PlayStation 1 until Final Fantasy 7. Exactly, I didn't either.

1068
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:12,420
So, I don't know. Anyway, well, this is always a controversial topic. We'd love to hear your

1069
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:13,020
thoughts.

1070
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,300
Mailbag at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send those emails.

1071
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,500
Just on one final note, you know, Sony is saying that something big

1072
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,380
is coming and if in you know with the announcement something they're gonna

1073
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:24,500
blow the roof off or something

1074
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,940
can Sony dig themselves out of this hole with a big enough announcement

1075
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,540
possibly but I think we have stories later on that'll just

1076
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,540
kind of I don't know make the hole deeper

1077
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:39,540
all right. Anyways, Game Fest 2006

1078
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:44,140
took place recently and some news came out of that

1079
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:48,580
including some other plans for the live marketplace and of course the

1080
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:53,580
The marketplace has been doing great so far. Everybody has been downloading tons of stuff.

1081
01:07:53,580 --> 01:08:01,580
They're saying that 38% of all marketplace downloads are game demos, trailers, and account for 25% of downloads.

1082
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:06,580
While Xbox Live Arcade titles make up for 17% of the total.

1083
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:14,580
And basically, of course, they know that demos are doing really well and the sales of games are especially high when they have demos for them.

1084
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:23,080
So you're going to see a lot more demos coming soon, but one thing you're also going to see pretty soon is a new kind of Marketplace item called Consumables.

1085
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:34,580
And Consumables you may kind of think about as, say for example, I'm playing Final Fantasy XI and on the Marketplace there's Gil for sale.

1086
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:43,580
I can go buy Gil in like, you know, 100 pieces or whatever at a certain price and I can keep buying the same item over and over for the game.

1087
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:53,080
game. So you're basically able to buy almost like items for a game. And of course, beyond

1088
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,120
these consumable items, because they're trying to make tons of money off of this stuff, they're

1089
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,760
actually going to have more community stuff, including more community videos and hopefully

1090
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:08,240
user-made content and stuff like that. Especially also with, what was it, the XNA thing that's

1091
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:10,600
going to be happening where you can actually program for a live...

1092
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,040
I think we have more information on that in the next half yeah so should be interesting

1093
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,320
huh I I I don't know how I feel about that

1094
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,360
I don't know um I don't know how I feel about the whole like buying

1095
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,760
in-game currency and all that stuff I don't know

1096
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,800
well here's here's something I mean when you think about it if you actually look like

1097
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,240
say for example oblivion and you look at all those

1098
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:34,720
add-ons that they have for it and because I mean when you're buying the

1099
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,840
add-ons at like a buck 25 a pop

1100
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,940
it's not that bad, I mean it doesn't seem like much but when you look back

1101
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,240
at all that you've spent on this game, like say you actually

1102
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,480
bought all of them and spent like a hundred bucks or something. Or it's like the DER add-on

1103
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,120
packs too like five bucks for five songs but damn they make a killing on those

1104
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,280
and you know even the Xbox Live Arcade

1105
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:57,740
five, ten dollars a game doesn't seem like much but if you're buying one every

1106
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,800
week like I've been lately, I have 22 arcade games right now on my Xbox

1107
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,720
and I'm thought about it, I'm like, shit that's like a hundred and fifty bucks!

1108
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:08,280
Microsoft's been working me, but granted you know I have 22 games that are all

1109
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:14,580
you know, decent. I also look at Oblivion, they got taunted

1110
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:19,060
the hell out of them for that whole horse armor thing and that's kinda it seems to

1111
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,420
me like that's the kinda thing you're talking about like you can get this you

1112
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:21,780
know

1113
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:25,740
little item that you can use in your game well it didn't seem to me like the

1114
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,640
horse armor had a very big reception to it

1115
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,420
yeah no one picked up the horse armor but everything else people picked up

1116
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,260
Oh, and see, Chyram agrees with me in there. Fire Resurrected said, accept horse armor.

1117
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:39,180
Yeah, horse armor is lame. It was an experiment though,

1118
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:42,900
I guess. That's not really the item I would...

1119
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,580
Horse armor? Who the fuck cares about pimping out their horse?

1120
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:50,060
That's stupid. Alright, well I'll be getting a 23rd

1121
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,940
Xbox Live Arcade game next week and I'm sure a lot of you will too,

1122
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:57,660
but you better get it next week because it's going to be free for a certain

1123
01:10:57,660 --> 01:10:58,920
period of time here.

1124
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,900
you'll be able to log on to Xbox Live within the first 48 hours of release and

1125
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:04,380
that would be

1126
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:07,660
August 23rd at 8 a.m.

1127
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:13,160
like the standard time was GMT so that translates to 1 a.m. Pacific time okay

1128
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,400
so Wednesday August 23rd at 1 a.m. Pacific time

1129
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:19,040
for 48 hours only you will be able to download

1130
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,120
Texas Hold'em for free. After that

1131
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:27,640
800 Microsoft points or 10 bucks so prepare for those servers to be hammered

1132
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,420
like hell

1133
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:32,620
on Wednesday and Thursday to get that free game. At least those live arcade games are tiny

1134
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:36,300
I mean it's not like I'm trying to download Saints Road Demo or something like that. I don't think it'll be so

1135
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:38,780
bad especially now that you do the background downloadings

1136
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,100
especially I think it'll be pretty nice. It should even be, I mean you got 48 hours I mean

1137
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,100
sure it'll be hammered but

1138
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:48,620
Texas Holeman downloads are going to finish pretty quick so. Oh well

1139
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:51,700
that's pretty awesome though. Yeah I'm kinda curious to see how this game turns out

1140
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,740
I'm sure we will have a review next week and

1141
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:58,020
hey if it's free I expect our listeners to all be grabbing this on Wednesday or

1142
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:58,760
Thursday

1143
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,140
and we could have like a really big poker tournament there's no excuse that you can't

1144
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,300
grab this game so

1145
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,200
go get it. And you know what? It is supporting the camera I

1146
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:13,100
think so yeah great great strip poker for reals not with the listeners please

1147
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:13,820
k thanks

1148
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:18,660
all the more reason I will send a frowny face feedback for you if I see any

1149
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:24,380
skin. Anyways, this week we've got a lot more things coming out other than just

1150
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,180
that Xbox Live Arcade game.

1151
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:30,540
Lots of stuff in the U.S. Well, maybe not a whole lot in the U.S., but

1152
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:35,940
starting off on the Game Boy Advance, you can get a wonderful Yu-Gi-Oh! Double Pack

1153
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,140
number two. Whoopee.

1154
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:42,300
Madden NFL, of course, coming out on every single system

1155
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,660
and, yeah, you can have a Mary Madden all day.

1156
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:52,640
On PlayStation 2 and the GameCube, you can get Pac-Man World Rally, which also features

1157
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:58,140
the king, or not the king, but the prince from Katamari, so check that out.

1158
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:04,440
On PC, some wonderful stuff, also Pac-Man World Rally in Madden, and hopefully Bad Day

1159
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,880
L.A., but I hear that it might actually be delayed a week, so that's pretty cool.

1160
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,080
And then one that I thought was kind of funny, and I didn't even realize there was a first

1161
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,000
this but prison tycoon to maximum security that sounds like an awesome

1162
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,960
game that's pretty funny on a PlayStation 2 and the PSP you can

1163
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,400
actually get world championship poker all in and then of course on the 360

1164
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:37,560
just madden so it's a very madden week next week is a the week after that

1165
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:43,560
Saints Row, Enchanted Arms, and Bomberman.

1166
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,560
Are you gonna pick up that new Bomberman? I wasn't too giddy about it when I saw it.

1167
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,560
I'll wait and see, because Konami usually sends me free stuff.

1168
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:57,560
Jamie's not here tonight, so allow me to help out those of you folks over in the UK with what is coming out on your neck of the woods.

1169
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:02,560
You guys, of course, also can download Texas Hold'em on the 23rd, so look out for that.

1170
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:08,960
On the 25th you're going to get Dig Dug Digging Strike, El Matador, Madden 2007, 99 Nights,

1171
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,760
which isn't as bad as they all say it is if you like the slashing games, Reservoir Dogs,

1172
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,080
World War I Aces of the Sky, World War II Battle Over Europe, and I like this one.

1173
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:23,480
It's a game called Let's Make a Soccer Team, coming from Sega of Europe.

1174
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,480
That should be exciting.

1175
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,720
Shouldn't it be Let's Make a Football Team?

1176
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:30,220
Looking forward, that's what it's called, looking forward a little further to the week

1177
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:35,540
of September 1st, you're going to have games such as Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New

1178
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:41,740
York, The Takeover for PSP, Dungeon Siege 2, you guys are finally getting, and Saints

1179
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,100
Row is also coming out for you guys, it's about the same time we're getting it, Star

1180
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,820
Fox Command on the DS, Test Drive Unlimited on the Xbox 360, and for those of you folks

1181
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:54,480
in the UK, a game that's near and dear to our hearts, Guitaro Man, finally makes its

1182
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:59,180
way to the PSP and Guitaro Man lives, September 1st, enjoy.

1183
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:06,180
cool. One thing coming out probably this fall from mad cats is an xbox live arcade stick

1184
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:13,140
and it looks like an old kind of Atari controller and people are I guess jumping on this scene

1185
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:18,380
that's going to be pretty cool. It's supposed to also come with 100 gamer or not gamer points

1186
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:25,380
100 microsoft points. One month free to xbox live gold and 3 xbox live arcade games. It's

1187
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:30,140
Xbox Live arcade games. It's supposed to retail for $49.99.

1188
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:33,980
They said it's supposed to be releasing in October.

1189
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,580
And one thing though I gotta mention though, but just looking at this,

1190
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,260
this looks horrible. I wouldn't want to buy this thing to be honest.

1191
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:44,460
I mean, granted, it's, I guess,

1192
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:49,020
having a giant, you know, stick instead of a, you know, a left analog stick

1193
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,620
might be good for some arcade games.

1194
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:57,220
I mean, not all the arcade games out there are going to be retro, so do you really need

1195
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,220
to buy another controller?

1196
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:03,340
Yeah, but how horrible is Street Fighter II to play on that controller sometimes?

1197
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,100
You're not going to be able to play Street Fighter on this controller either, if you've

1198
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,100
taken a look at it.

1199
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,640
It's looking like an old Atari controller.

1200
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:17,660
And it basically has, instead of a left analog stick, it's got a giant, just kind of like

1201
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,340
Atari joystick.

1202
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:24,140
And then right next to that, the four buttons, and below that, the right analog stick, and

1203
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:27,660
to the left of that, the directional pad.

1204
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:32,580
So it's like a big clusterfuck of stuff with a stick on there.

1205
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:39,240
SSJ100Matt says, it looks like a crappy photoshop, and DJ Geni must have something against Mad

1206
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:41,340
Cats because he calls them mad craps.

1207
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,940
Mad Cats is really terrible at making anything, so...

1208
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,940
Didn't they make Pump It Up?

1209
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:46,940
No.

1210
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:47,940
I thought you were making Pump It Up in the US.

1211
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,300
Did they distribute in the US?

1212
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:54,140
They distributed the dance pad, and I think they had a little part in it, but you know

1213
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:55,140
what?

1214
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,540
That's okay, because Pump, the greatness of Pump can outweigh the craftiness of Mad

1215
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:00,540
Cats.

1216
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,620
Oh, sorry, it was Mastiff actually, my bad, my bad.

1217
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,500
Like, had brought the game over here, but Mad Cats had to do with the past.

1218
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,820
I knew Mad Cats did something with it.

1219
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:10,820
I'm not crazy.

1220
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:15,300
Well, it's not a Photoshop, it is actually a sales sheet, and it was spotted on EB Games'

1221
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,100
website, and I'm sure we'll know more about this in a few weeks or so.

1222
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:24,840
Alright, well something I'm sure you can lay down a pre-order for now, along with this

1223
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,940
joystick if you want it, is Prey 2.

1224
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:32,400
Apparently in a recent interview with 3D Realms' Scott Miller, their team is already working

1225
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,420
on a Prey 2.

1226
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:37,660
There's really not a lot else to say about it, but there is a quote I have for you guys,

1227
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:42,960
a quote from Scott Miller, quote, Prey 2, of course, we are addressing concerns about

1228
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,680
combat as well as adding in more gameplay innovations.

1229
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:50,200
Very early, not a lot of hell else to say.

1230
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,920
I hope they speed up multiplayer.

1231
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,860
I did try multiplayer for the first time this week and I was really disappointed.

1232
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:58,360
Even after that, that, well, go ahead.

1233
01:17:58,360 --> 01:17:59,360
Sorry, Loki.

1234
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,960
Well anyways, speaking of your bad multiplayer, they are going to be putting out a patch and

1235
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,200
I, as far as I remember, I think it is already available for download.

1236
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,080
A patch came out.

1237
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,040
I can tell you, when I put in Prey the other day, it did patch, but I'm hearing it didn't

1238
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,520
fix a damn thing with multiplayer and it was supposed to.

1239
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,520
Right?

1240
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,520
Probably, yeah.

1241
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,000
It was supposed to be fixing, well the one for the PC is supposed to be fixing multiplayer

1242
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,440
weapons exploit, crashed I guess on some of the machines when they were reading save games

1243
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:32,920
and crashed at the startup of some machines.

1244
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:37,780
And I know that they were talking about later on adding content as far as new characters

1245
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:41,780
including some of the females that were actually in the game.

1246
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:42,780
Like gen and stuff?

1247
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:44,780
Yeah, where you get to play as them.

1248
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,780
I don't know if that's any cool.

1249
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:52,780
But yeah, the Pre-Version 1.1 patch, it's basically just, you know,

1250
01:18:52,780 --> 01:18:57,780
updating multiplayer browsers to fix servers and just like a lot of server stuff.

1251
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,780
But the new content, though, they are going to be charging for it.

1252
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:09,940
They said they're adding 6 new playable characters, including Jen, Mother, and Becky, I guess

1253
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:12,900
a blonde victim, and 200 characters.

1254
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,580
They're putting a victim as a playable character?

1255
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,580
There's just, okay, Becky, unless I'm just not far enough in the story yet, Becky is

1256
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:23,140
just somebody that gets, like, killed in the very beginning, and you never learn her name.

1257
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:24,700
You just watch her get-

1258
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:28,140
A blonde victim that you occasionally see on slabs in a single-player play.

1259
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:32,140
Are they going to have the guy too that always goes, oh god, oh god!

1260
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,420
There's always this random guy like when you see the little victim.

1261
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:36,340
It's about alien abduction and the aliens are killing him.

1262
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:39,900
Hunter and Elite Hunter are two Hunter characters that they're adding.

1263
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:40,900
Interesting.

1264
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:42,540
So, that's interesting.

1265
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,540
I don't know.

1266
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:48,220
Now our chat room is making all the mandatory Prey 2 jokes and you can guess where this

1267
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:49,220
is going.

1268
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:53,260
Ravens Dolphin says, gee I have to wait 11 years for the next Prey.

1269
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:56,620
Funny Dale says, I'll be waiting for Prey 2 when it's released in 2015.

1270
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,500
making jokes about how long Prey was in development.

1271
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:03,660
DJ Genai says, no Prey 2, they need to finish Duke Nukem Forever.

1272
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:04,660
Exactly.

1273
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,460
Stop getting distracted.

1274
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,460
Stop it.

1275
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,100
Make Duke Nukem Forever.

1276
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,220
They're getting way too distracted with that game.

1277
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,260
One more story for you guys, then we're going to go to a break here.

1278
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,460
Dragon Quest IX, it looks like it's happening of course.

1279
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,460
This really shouldn't be much of a surprise.

1280
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,800
Dragon Quest VIII kind of revived the series in a way here in the US, I mean sure we had

1281
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:32,360
VII, but it kind of didn't make the waves that VIII did, VIII was truly like a return

1282
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,360
to...

1283
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,360
Poor blimey.

1284
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,480
Well didn't you, did you play Dragon Quest VIII?

1285
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,480
Yeah.

1286
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,480
Drew?

1287
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:39,480
It was awesome.

1288
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,480
Wasn't it like a Super Nintendo with next-gen graphics?

1289
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,480
It was awesome.

1290
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:43,920
Yeah, it reminded me of Dragon Quest VI, so it was old school.

1291
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,920
It's exactly what some of the hardcore gamers wanted, so on August 11th, the Tokyo Symphony

1292
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,960
Orchestra held a concert called the World of Dragon Quest.

1293
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,880
Now what basically happened in an interview before the concert on the 11th, the music

1294
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:03,400
composer Koichi Sugiyama mentioned how delighted he is that people have loved his music since

1295
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:08,000
the Famicom era and how flattered he is with the orchestra's members' appreciation of

1296
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
the games.

1297
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,120
He also happened to say, series producer Yuji Horii is really busy at the moment on Dragon

1298
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:18,000
Quest IX and I'm really looking forward to what kind of game he's making at this

1299
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,160
time as a gamer.

1300
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:25,260
It should be pointed out that Sugiyama is 75 years old, so he may have forgot about

1301
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,080
any NDA's he was under.

1302
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:33,120
But at the same time, come on, obviously they're making a Dragon Quest IX at some point.

1303
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,180
Well, we're going to have a spin-off of Dragon Quest VIII, Dragon Quest Yangas.

1304
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:44,280
I have exclusive news from Orange Onage Radio, Final Fantasy XIV coming out eventually.

1305
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:48,200
Wow, that's great, that's great, thank you for confirming that for us here.

1306
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,520
