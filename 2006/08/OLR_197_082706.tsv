14019	26569	Tonight, August 27th, 2006, Rob and Loki report on the Konami BBQ, how was that Nintendo press conference this week anyway, and how many Xbox Live points will you need to spend to play a full game of Luminous?
32335	36796	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
36856	42378	We are that independent podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
42778	43759	My name is Rob Roberts.
43779	46940	You might know me as Sky and I'm here on this journey with you every single week.
47340	52061	Also joining us in our party, say hello to our resident black mage, DarkSakura.
52441	52902	Fuego.
53142	55062	Also known as Jamie Summers.
55102	55502	Fuego.
55682	55983	Fuego 3.
56043	56383	Fern.
56563	56863	Fern.
56943	57263	Fern.
58323	59384	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
85690	89253	We had this all scheduled out like months in advance before we even realized.
89893	95438	So the baby bats came out in full force on Sunday, so we avoided Haunted Mansion.
98061	101604	I could just imagine what Haunted Mansion looks like on goth day.
101624	102545	They converged.
103145	109311	While all the baby bats, there were a few legitimate old bats, but there were a lot of baby bats, you know, Hot Topic, Wannabe...
110434	116338	I remember the old days when we used to have to shop in fetish stores and thrift shops and make our own clothes.
117599	121822	But yeah, I read Pirates a bunch of times, and the second time we decided to sing through it.
123403	128027	And we called Barbossa Dreamboat Barbie, because he was up on his boat.
128587	130028	The changes they made to Pirates were cool.
130643	131163	Really?
131183	133545	Because I thought most people have been saying they kind of suck.
133585	138067	They did the PC changes, and then they changed a few things back and added in the movie characters.
138327	138768	Oh, that's good.
138948	140789	So all the Jack stuff was like, oh, Jack.
141189	143390	And then Haunted Mansion, they actually changed part of it.
143911	158219	If you've ever been in Haunted Mansion, the attic with the bride, where she's all tragic and sad, instead now they've made her a bit more sinister, where you go by different paintings of her and her various husbands and their heads all disappear.
159048	160189	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
177099	177639	Oh yeah, it was fun.
177659	178359	I couldn't see anything.
178759	179820	The new Space Mountain is cool.
179960	183640	We've got to be careful not to become the amusement park podcast because we do want to get to games here.
183680	184281	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
184321	184941	I do play games.
184981	186481	Alright, tell us about what your gaming week was.
186501	187221	What did you play this week?
187561	189762	I played Dead Rising, which was freaking rad.
190982	191802	And I'm not any good at it.
194003	195343	Oops, I died so many times.
195923	199464	But I figured out that I like the scythe because it decapitates the undead.
200746	202448	and played Super Mario Bros.
202488	202828	finally.
202968	203749	I got a free copy.
204009	206952	Actually, technically GameStop got a free copy and it became mine.
207773	213919	So I played a bunch of that in the waiting room at the doctor's office the other day.
214785	216547	Gameboys are great to have in a doctor's office.
218409	223033	I played some DDA and I'm kind of still okay at it.
223553	230560	Sort of avoided the arcade though at Disneyland because it's like the spawn of people are hanging around.
230960	236465	And my quote from Disneyland though, best quote ever, this just totally makes me decide never to have children.
236485	240449	I want to wear the teacups!
244457	246298	Only the eh part was a lot longer.
246838	247139	Wow.
248259	249500	Did you ride the teacups?
249540	250060	Yes, I did.
250120	250720	That's my favorite.
250881	253342	And I sang a merry birthday while riding the teacups.
253422	255003	Thank you for the lollipops, by the way, from Disneyland.
255023	255383	I appreciate that.
255403	256063	Aren't they fabulous?
256083	256684	They're great.
257604	259405	One of them is shaped very phallically.
259445	260406	Let's just leave it at that.
260466	262147	I was like, that one's for Rob.
262207	262627	It's long.
262707	264308	Anyway, any other games?
265248	266789	I had lots of smoothies.
266989	267590	All right, Loki.
268670	272172	Well, I played games this week.
272312	273433	No, I played...
273823	279126	I was playing a lot of Xbox Live's demos, including Just Cause, which is awesome.
279646	284649	It's very, I don't know, it's kind of like, not really Grand Theft Auto-ish.
284709	286470	I mean, you can steal cars and stuff.
286990	296456	But it reminds me of, like, you were to take Lara Croft Tomb Raider, replace Lara Croft with Antonio Banderas, and then stick her in, like, a Grand Theft Auto game, and then...
297679	300041	I don't know, just add a bunch of stunts to it.
300221	301502	And that's pretty much the game.
301882	305866	Because you can do a lot of really cool stuff like jumping from car to car.
305926	306946	It makes it really simple.
307307	312591	Or you can steal a car, jump onto the roof, and then hit your parachute and just parasail around.
313234	314574	and just really crazy stuff.
314614	322137	And then there's a whole lot of Mexican music blaring and lots of Viva La Revolucion and stuff like that.
322257	326158	So it's pretty cool and definitely worth picking up when it comes out.
326898	328579	And the demo is also pretty cool.
328739	331080	They give you about four different people to kill.
331600	338902	And I got to the point where there were helicopters chasing after me and I blew up one of the helicopters and it exploded very fiery.
339434	341600	and it was awesome, so definitely recommend that.
342142	342723	And then of course,
344570	348273	I tried a little bit of Texas Hold'em and played like a game and just said eh.
348293	351035	And I'll play it later when it's not so buggy.
351516	354278	And then what else did I play?
354558	357901	Oh yeah, I got a retail copy of Saints Row four days early.
358321	362524	So I decided to play a little bit of that and then I'll probably play more this weekend.
363985	372012	And yeah, I think that... Oh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories because that's still fucking awesome and we're still going to be playing it until...
372768	380250	Vice City Stories comes out and then we're going to have the official switching of the game and you'll play that for a year until San Andreas Stories comes out.
382294	384235	My gaming week was kind of not that eventful.
384255	385436	I didn't actually play a whole lot.
386036	392421	As far as new stuff goes, I checked out Texas Hold'em, which was free on Xbox Live, so I downloaded that and played it.
392841	398386	It's kind of funny, I just was randomly up really late on Tuesday, so at 1am when the game was released, I actually downloaded it.
398846	405711	And of course, in not even like 10 minutes, I get an invite into an Xbox Live game, and it was actually being run by another podcaster, Godfrey.
406181	414513	Over at Gamertag So it was kind of cool that we were getting together and playing on the Xbox Live As far as Texas Hold'em goes How I like the game itself
416056	416716	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
443149	444890	Even $10 than anything else that's out there on the market.
445050	447211	I'm surprised that they put the game out now.
447571	451853	It's being that there's also two more poker games coming out, all in poker.
452693	455254	And, what was it?
455274	458816	No, World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions are both coming out.
459136	464278	Granted, they're both going to be like $39.99, but still, I mean, you have this free game for Texas Hold'em.
464638	466499	Why am I going to go buy a $40 game now?
466679	469280	I mean, and granted, it might be more polished, but
471064	471745	It's a free game.
471765	472605	It's Texas Hold'em.
472645	475287	I mean, you can't really jazz up Texas Hold'em too much.
475428	481873	I guess the nicest thing about it is that most of my friends online have it, so there's always at least one game we can play together, but I don't know.
481893	486236	I wish the pacing of the game could be sped up, especially in single player.
486516	489459	Like, if I've already folded, I just want them to run through it.
489519	491000	I don't really want to watch bad...
491431	492272	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
503740	505280	So, you know, I don't know, that was kind of neat.
505300	509461	And I do like the concept of having one bankroll that you build and build through.
509541	513142	So, like, when you make bets, you can't just restart with a brand new bank.
513182	518384	Like, if you make a bet that will impact your entire history on Xbox Live, you could bet it all away.
518724	520604	So, I like that concept.
520624	521264	That's kind of neat.
521384	522745	So, I'll give the game credit for that.
523165	524965	And I guess it looks good for an Xbox Live game.
524985	529026	But, yeah, why does it always pan up on the table, deal, and then pan back down?
529066	531167	Like, every time, I didn't get that at all.
531967	532868	Some of the weird things.
532908	534508	And I thought it was supposed to support the camera.
535389	537410	And I know Godfrey had a camera, and he said it wasn't doing anything.
537470	538870	So I don't know.
539851	540231	Whatever.
540931	541371	It's free.
541451	542812	You can't complain about free things.
543012	544012	So what can I say?
544092	545273	I mean, it was worth checking out.
545553	549155	But if you haven't already downloaded it, I don't think it's worth the $10.
549895	551516	Maybe download the demo, see if you like it.
552196	552516	I don't know.
552876	555277	Or if you're really into poker, maybe you'll like it.
555357	557338	But you probably already got it if you're really into poker.
557758	558579	I was just thinking something.
559414	564356	There's that game that's coming out or the collection of the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged that's coming out.
564776	568757	And we know that Texas Hold'em is going to be probably patched later on.
569537	573899	But Live Arcade Unplugged is for people that don't have live or don't have an internet connection.
574439	577480	So they're going to be buying this game and getting a really buggy copy.
578580	580541	But they're only playing single player anyway.
580801	582782	Yeah, but still though, it's still buggy.
583102	583382	I don't know.
584448	584948	DeathJr2 on the PSP
613742	614603	It looked a lot better.
614783	617984	Definitely rebuilt from the ground up and looks like the graphics are a lot better.
619085	624248	To be honest, I mean, I've kind of outgrown the platform games like that, so it's not really appealing to me.
624288	629631	But if anybody, you know, really is into that stuff, I think it's definitely a game that would be worth picking up.
629931	633913	Yeah, the game definitely looked more polished to me than the first game in the series that they released.
634173	637635	I know fans of the series will be really happy that they can play as Pandora now.
638676	642758	I know that they were talking about how they fixed a lot of the camera because of complaints in the first game.
643086	646929	And the camera, you know, it felt like a typical platformer to me when I played it.
646969	649630	I actually did get to put hands on on it and it was kind of nice.
649650	652552	You could do like strafing and all this other stuff too that felt really good.
653053	655675	I also thought it was neat because you can play co-op through the entire game.
656035	659277	It's not just selected levels or modes, but you can play co-op with a friend through the whole game.
659642	660742	Silent Hill Origins PSP Silent Evil 4
685854	687476	I really like what they did with it.
687537	690821	It almost seems like they're going to be going more of an action route, more Resident Evil type.
700275	704579	The game itself looks really good, even though it wasn't hardly done at all.
704619	705960	I think like 30% or something.
706460	708702	A lot of placeholder stuff, but it looked really good.
708862	712865	I was very impressed by what they were showing us on the PSP.
713105	715887	Fans of Silent Hill are actually going to be really pleased.
715927	718669	Even though we're joking a little bit about the whole over-the-shoulder camera switch,
719013	721755	It definitely has that Silent Hill feel that you guys are used to.
722156	728381	Fourteen new Akira Yamaoka songs, four of which have the vocals from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, so that's going to be awesome.
729302	735147	One third of the town comes from the original game, and then they added a new two thirds to the town, so that's pretty cool.
736269	741672	And it looked pretty cool just as far as, like, I like the weapons that you can select and stuff.
741732	745575	And how they have the automatic cameras for when you're going in different spots.
746135	750798	It will actually, you know, do the Silent Hill cameras, you know, where really high shot or low shot.
750838	752579	Yeah, that was kind of cool how, like, you could do the...
753035	754276	Thanks for watching!
774688	776769	Sledgehammer, Tire Iron, Shovel
804824	816513	I mean bludgeoning the crap out of creatures with a sledgehammer instead of maybe just a weak woman or something trying to beat up something with whatever.
816892	818653	Marvel Trading Card Game coming to DS, PSP, and the PC
837657	838818	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
858752	861553	Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007
882762	884923	What did you think of winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007?
906778	907821	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
914565	920450	And so, I love how when you paused it, you know, I'm not really super into sports games, but I do love me some soccer.
920570	921871	Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great sport.
922351	923372	I used to play it when I was a kid.
923492	924072	Little known fact.
924713	928916	I do love the fact when you pause the game, it's almost like, remember when you paused the game in Super Smash Bros.
928956	929296	Melee?
929557	932739	You could spin the camera around, like, anywhere you want and zoom in.
932999	935301	Like, it does that with the soccer.
935581	938163	And you can slowly move it forward and slowly move it back.
938423	941506	And, like, it's so detailed that you see the eyes on the people's faces.
941526	941806	Right?
941986	942867	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
972173	974134	The Gateway Soccer Game Shallon's Showdown
995513	998994	The animations are good, and it's kind of fun to play, but I don't get it.
999174	1014840	I don't get the point to it, because the way the game is set up, I mean, it's almost like Power Stone, where you're kind of fighting stuff, but I don't know if it was just a demo I was playing, but I kept killing robots, and they just kept respawning, and I did that for about 15 minutes, and nothing happened.
1015100	1018321	Was it maybe just because it was supposed to be a tech demo, or it wasn't really the game?
1018621	1019402	That's what I was thinking.
1019442	1022903	I'm like, I hope this is the case, but by reading most of the descriptions of it,
1023303	1027964	It sounds like that's not really the case, and, I mean, it's really good looking.
1027984	1029764	The game's supposed to be out November 14th.
1029864	1032505	Yeah, I mean, it's really good looking, I just, I don't get it.
1032825	1041186	I mean, maybe if, maybe this is just part of the game, and I'm not seeing, you know, I'm thinking that's probably what it was, you know, but it looks very good.
1041366	1043346	I mean, and fans of the show will definitely like it.
1043366	1052488	Yeah, if you're a fan of the show, the head writers from the show wrote all the dialogue, and there's six playable characters in the game, the four main characters to start, and you get two bad guys that are unlockable later on.
1052961	1053001	D.S.
1053021	1053181	Gameplay
1074932	1076353	Coated Arms Contingent.
1077414	1091364	I played the original Coated Arms, didn't care for it at all, and I'm liking how they're going to be actually... A couple things, they're doing more of a variety of environments, and they're actually set stages, so it's not all this random generated stuff.
1091785	1102172	I mean, granted, the random generated stuff is kind of cool, and maybe they have a mode like that or something separate from the game, but the actual game, it's not so good.
1102813	1104214	And I do like...
1104850	1105430	What was it?
1106830	1108451	Kind of the new details that they added to it.
1108651	1113032	It's a lot more polished in how you can map all your keys and stuff to your own configurations.
1113612	1114032	It's pretty cool.
1114172	1119993	Coated Arms, not my cup of tea either, but if you're a fan of the series, multiplayer is going to be up to eight players from four players.
1120594	1126055	And the game is scheduled for March 2007, which is supposedly the time the PlayStation 3 version is coming out as well.
1126335	1127455	But it is separate stories.
1127495	1130956	The PSP and the PS3 versions are separate stories in the series.
1131196	1131316	Cool.
1132530	1134531	Lunar Nights from Kojima Productions
1156587	1159509	So yeah, you have some first-person modes in there as well.
1159589	1161591	They definitely heavily use the elements in the game.
1161971	1169417	You draw on the screen, like when you're using an air element, you kind of twirl the stylus on the screen to create a tornado, which was kind of cute.
1170237	1174781	So I played through the first level of the demo, and it was pretty cool.
1175742	1176622	Awesome.
1177383	1178824	Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.
1179665	1182707	Very, very awesome to see, especially since, you know,
1183120	1191125	I don't know about a lot of people out there, but I didn't like Metal Gear Acid, didn't care for it at all, and kind of, you know, hoping that they'd put out an actual Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.
1191646	1200371	And this one looks really cool, they're doing a lot of elements, or adding a lot of things that they didn't have in the other games, like the, where you actually have a squad now of three members, that was pretty cool.
1200431	1204254	Yeah, this is the Metal Gear game that fans wanted a year ago, so...
1205000	1207721	It takes place six years after the Snake Eater story.
1208842	1215766	And it looks like... Did you notice that in the little trailer, it looks like the cutscenes are borrowed from that comic book game they put out?
1215806	1216826	Like the comic book Metal Gear?
1217126	1218267	Yeah, I thought that was really cool.
1218447	1221469	Because I love that look that the Metal Gear comic thing had.
1222349	1225191	Yeah, and then you have the whole comrade thing where you build your own team.
1225211	1226912	That seems to be kind of the niche of this game.
1227292	1231514	You build your own team of people, and then you use people together.
1231534	1233255	You switch from one character to another.
1233795	1240344	and go back and forth and that's how you can take out other guys in the area that might be hard to get to.
1240804	1244369	Sniper who's got you in his sights, maybe use somebody else to take out the sniper.
1244409	1245250	I thought that was kind of cool.
1245988	1247570	Full voiceovers in the cinematics.
1247610	1250172	The original voice actors are all back for this game.
1250673	1258180	And just an FYI, there's supposedly a ninja character that I don't know if we're supposed to mention because they wouldn't say much about it there.
1258820	1262143	But a whole lot of more information is supposed to be released on this Tokyo Game Show.
1262263	1263665	And supposedly some sort of box...
1265182	1266003	Hydeen Systems.
1280612	1280892	All right.
1281713	1283774	Now, here's one I have a ton of things to say about.
1283874	1285314	Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.
1285334	1285975	What did you think of this?
1286315	1287015	It was pretty good.
1287235	1288576	I liked the game a lot.
1288596	1289996	I actually played it quite a bit.
1290557	1293758	And, you know, typical Castlevania game, but it looks very good.
1293898	1295959	I'm very impressed with what they've done with the DS.
1296099	1299481	I mean, I was incredibly impressed that they had an anime cut...
1299881	1304043	Intro, you know, it's like... What is up with Konami Love for the handhelds this year?
1304063	1305484	That's pretty much all we saw.
1305624	1313207	Like, seriously, almost every game we saw had at least one version being made for the PSP or the DS.
1314028	1319270	Yeah, every single game we saw, except for Elebits, the Karaoke Revolution game, and the DDRs.
1319870	1321471	But, I mean, everything else had a handheld.
1321691	1325193	Why would they even bother with the PSP since the sales are kind of crap in Japan?
1325578	1338220	Well, you know, what it comes down to is, I think there was even some study out there that said that handhelds are actually more popular than console games, which, you know, the facts don't really show that, but I don't know.
1338240	1342621	I think it's just... A game like Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is going to sell PSPs.
1343501	1345161	So, you know, maybe that's part of it.
1345221	1347042	So maybe because it's got the muscle there.
1347402	1349762	And what was the other thing about Portable Ops?
1349962	1352182	It utilizes the GPS, supposedly.
1352242	1354243	Yeah, it's hot.
1354343	1355323	Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.
1356551	1357071	So cool.
1357171	1362394	I mean, I love, you can use, okay, first off, you have to understand, they've made some big changes to the basic formula.
1362854	1366295	Now, you swap between two characters at the touch of a button.
1366635	1373418	You swap between Jonathan, who's kind of a traditional Belmont-style character, and then Charlotte, who's like magic and intellect-based.
1373718	1381202	And like, I thought it was kind of cool, because you hold down the button to charge your magic, and the longer you're able to hold it down, the more powerful the attack is, and the graphics match that.
1381242	1382082	I thought that was kind of neat.
1382823	1385346	She can stop time, heal, boost stats, all that stuff.
1385787	1392614	But by a touch of another button, you bring them both on the screen at the same time to solve simple puzzles, which I thought was pretty cool.
1392914	1394456	And then here's the greatest thing.
1395036	1397499	You finally get to go outside the damn castle.
1397739	1401103	That's what the portraits are all about, is that the bad guy paints these portraits and
1401403	1403404	I don't know, it's somehow how he's cast control over the castle.
1403424	1403945	Mario did it!
1404185	1404965	So, whatever.
1405246	1410609	You go into these portraits and they take you to levels that are not inside a castle.
1410909	1414411	So you get to go to an Egyptian level that's called Sandy Grave.
1414671	1416973	You go to a town level that's called the City of Haze.
1417433	1417814	Boss Rush Mode
1436673	1440036	Also, something they weren't saying a lot of details about was the shop mode.
1440296	1445880	There's a shop mode that's going to be Wi-Fi as well, that you're going to be able to trade items across the internet.
1445900	1447942	It sounds like really sketchy details.
1449243	1456108	From what I was piecing together, it sounded like you'd be able to buy things from other people's shops that you didn't want, but kind of make trades like that.
1456128	1459931	Like if you have items or something, you can sell them almost like an auction market type thing.
1460720	1462601	More details to come at Tokyo Game Show.
1462901	1465161	Paris, by the way, seemed to be a recurring theme in this game.
1465361	1467982	Did you notice there were the vampire bad guys?
1468282	1472003	Stella and Loretta were some of these female vampire antagonist characters.
1472163	1473283	I thought that was kind of interesting.
1473603	1476404	So I think if you enjoyed last year's Castlevania, this one's going to up the ante.
1476504	1477844	I think you're going to be very, very impressed.
1478544	1480005	Karaoke Revolution American Idol.
1481605	1481965	You know...
1482608	1483849	I think this game is going to be huge.
1483869	1493376	And I don't think it's necessarily going to be the hardcore gamer crowd that gets into this game, but I just think this is going to be a very accessible game for mainstream America, especially the fact that it's based off American Idol.
1512734	1512934	PS2 Only
1542185	1545946	and I thought the Xbox with the downloadable expansions and stuff was a great idea.
1546206	1548967	So I guess if the game does well, they'll probably port it to other platforms.
1549067	1556929	Well, I think the Xbox right now, they're kind of considering not doing that because the Xbox is pretty much at the end of its cycle.
1556949	1562731	The PS2 is going to be going on for a while, but you don't want to put out a game that's pretty much, you know, who's going to really buy it?
1562751	1568813	Everyone's transitioning over to the Xbox 360 and they're not ready to put out a next-gen version of it, so...
1569457	1570377	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1590203	1597390	Did you notice how wild and crazy a lot of people at that party were, especially during that American Idol contest and things of that nature?
1597670	1604917	And did you notice the journalist from... I'm not 100% positive where he's from, so I shouldn't name it unless I have my facts proof.
1605138	1609122	But he walks in and holds up this bottle of like 40 or something and everybody's cheering.
1609422	1610443	And I'm just thinking to myself...
1611816	1613658	I was like, I didn't know what to think.
1613718	1615300	Like, you know, one part of me thinks it's funny.
1615320	1616000	How about hypocrite?
1616241	1622967	But yeah, the other part of me thinks this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever... Wasn't it weird being there, Loki?
1623327	1625269	It was weird, and here's why it's weird.
1625630	1631455	Because on the show, it's fine to fuck around every once in a while because you make it a disclaimer.
1631656	1635659	It's like, I wouldn't do that if I was on TV, maybe, because that might be a little...
1636385	1637385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1652034	1653034	A company barbecue.
1653134	1655415	You can do that at your company barbecue, but you know what?
1655515	1656835	You're going to do business here.
1656995	1657936	This is a business thing.
1657976	1659376	You're doing interviews.
1659816	1662617	You're getting information, the report to the press and stuff.
1663957	1667598	You're not supposed to be... Look, I got 40s!
1667658	1669419	Let's get wasted, man!
1669479	1672340	I know, I was like, that is so... I just was in awe.
1672460	1673380	I didn't know what to think.
1673740	1681342	I was just like, I can't believe that's... That would be funny if I was not at a professional gaming event.
1681562	1682223	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1698562	1701345	in the whole freaking building that was taking notes on a laptop.
1701705	1723046	Now, granted, some of the other journalists were doing the old-fashioned pen and paper thing, but I'm thinking to myself, you all work for dot-coms, and you're all on the tech edge of things, and I just thought it was really surprising, because I don't know, I personally, maybe it's a thing they teach you in journalist school, I don't know, but I type fast, so if I want to be able to make a ton of notes, I'm going to type them out of my laptop, I'm not going to try and write everything.
1723226	1724547	because my handwriting is god-awful.
1724807	1728989	So I was kind of surprised that I was like the only one that had a laptop there.
1730030	1733972	Something is really wrong with the mainstreaming gaming press, you guys, and I'm not afraid to say it, so whatever.
1734492	1734812	That's it.
1734972	1738474	There was a ton of people there from like IGN and 1UP and stuff.
1738534	1740695	I mean, they had like stacks of like 10 people.
1740736	1744578	It was the Ziff Davis IGN Bay Area dot-commer club.
1745418	1747319	Gosh, and you know, I do feel bad.
1747339	1752662	I'm not sure how many small press were there, but I'm sure that, you know, I don't know if they were in the same, but we were, but we were like
1753066	1753666	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1780575	1781316	and DarkSakura.
1809505	1812247	And they have some stealth stuff in there, which was pretty cool.
1812847	1813448	You know what, though?
1813608	1824275	As much as I appreciated this game a lot more, being able to see it a little closer and hands-on than I did at E3, and it was kind of cool to be next to a Wii again without having to wait in a five-hour line, I have to admit.
1825990	1833373	I don't think, like if this game came out for the same price as like Zelda, Metroid, Mario, there's no way I could justify buying it.
1833513	1838455	I'm sorry, I mean the game looked kind of fun, but it didn't look $39.99 fun to me.
1838795	1846819	I don't know, maybe it's just because we were only seeing one aspect of the game, but seriously, I hope that this game is a little bit lower of a price point.
1846919	1849960	I think it will be much more successful if they aim that way.
1850520	1851681	Well, um...
1853262	1857947	I can tell you exactly what the price is going to be on this.
1858147	1859489	If I remember correctly, I think it was $49.99.
1860249	1863773	No, see, that's too much.
1864033	1865475	Hopefully it changes.
1865595	1865875	I don't know.
1866636	1868318	Real quick housekeeping thing as well.
1868358	1870040	Is there anything else you want to say about the press event?
1870120	1870420	I'm sorry.
1871962	1875103	Um, you know, I like it.
1875123	1877343	I want to thank them first off for inviting us down there.
1877363	1882965	Yeah, thanks guys for taking a chance and inviting some of the independent press.
1883005	1883585	We appreciate it.
1884105	1886445	It was really cool to check it out and stuff.
1886825	1888226	I love going to those things.
1888766	1891266	But, yeah, I don't know.
1891546	1893147	I like Gamer's Day better, I think.
1893527	1894567	Yeah, Gamer's Day was a little more.
1894587	1896108	I was sad that DDR wasn't there.
1897228	1898068	I had to go to work.
1898951	1900492	I know, because you had the time off for Disneyland.
1901833	1903394	I would have really enjoyed Disneyland.
1904534	1906155	I did enjoy Disneyland very much.
1906716	1909077	I just want to say some real quick housekeeping things.
1909177	1910298	Tonight is a mini episode.
1910318	1911558	I should have said that at the top of the episode.
1911578	1913580	There's not going to be a Part B tonight.
1913800	1916961	And the DDR Power Previews will start next week.
1917042	1919403	And that is only on the live stream.
1919663	1926487	You have to be listening live and you'll get to hear some brand new DDR songs from the Ultramix 4 VRare and Universe VRare
1927054	1955594	and I can't say anything about it you know we're not supposed to talk about you know what we're playing and all that stuff yet but you know I can't help but say something because I got to hear some of the tracks and everything one of the songs we're playing next week like take a really dark DDR song and make it even darker like the remix so it's like oh it's so cool it's so cool so you'll hear it next week that's all I have to say I'm sorry they haven't set a price yet for Elements okay thank you for the clarification
1956821	1960062	All right, so let's get into other gaming news from around the world.
1960162	1962622	Well, there is definitely other news.
1963222	1971524	The first one up, actually, well, you realize that Nintendo has been hanging out in Germany with their fun little press conference, right?
1971904	1973244	Well, their game conference, I should say.
1973844	1984006	Well, even though they are still not giving a definite price on the Wii, there has been a slight leak.
1985265	1992867	from the head of German operations, saying they expect a price below 250 euros, which would be $321.50.
1993767	1999148	Basically, it's still more of the same.
1999809	2007770	Nintendo's still saying that they expect it to be as far as 25,000 yen in Japan, which is $223 here.
2007830	2012832	And no more than 250 in the U.S., so it's basically more of the same.
2013372	2014172	Nothing specific.
2015879	2016159	All right.
2017300	2017860	Thoughts on that?
2018860	2019820	Not a lot of surprises there.
2019840	2022421	$250 is kind of the price we're all thinking anyway.
2022601	2029244	They basically, if I think, come out and said the same thing, like no less than $250, at least in the U.S., no less than $249 or whatever.
2030706	2032388	But that was not the only news that they announced.
2032568	2035671	Well, or I should say that came from Let's Big.
2036511	2040855	They did announce two new games, Mario Strikers Charged and Battalion Wars 2.
2041796	2046020	Of course, Mario Strikers Charged is a follow-up to the GameCube game and looks pretty awesome.
2046701	2048923	Kind of a little edgy soccer game for them, I guess.
2049563	2051765	And then Battalion Wars 2 is just awesome.
2051785	2057170	And in fact, actually, they have some video footage on game trailers that I was
2058095	2086757	Saw on Link 2 on Kotaku And it looks pretty sweet I mean, I never really got into the first Battalion Wars But a very cool little game And definitely showing off some pretty good graphics for the Wii So, I'm looking forward to that stuff Of course, I like this It's kind of referring to Battalion Wars 2 as B-Wii You know, because, you know, too funny But, yeah, it's supposed to be pretty cool
2088578	2091421	The Wii is coming out soon.
2112253	2112593	Soon.
2112653	2116395	Well, soon will be answered on September 14th.
2116435	2126059	We're pretty sure this is the real deal because Nintendo has sent out special invites for a celebration of video games.
2126579	2137264	And Nintendo of America president, our dear buddy Reggie, Phil's aim, will be there in person and he's going to be promoting, quote unquote, the upcoming lineup.
2137744	2137984	Reggie?
2138424	2138624	Yep.
2139505	2140105	Where's our invite?
2140806	2142508	I don't know.
2142829	2147695	I guess we don't get 3 million unique page views a month, so we have to stay home.
2148776	2157887	I don't know how formal or informal this event is going to be, but seriously, since this is going to be a really big deal, IGN, I'd leave your 40s at home.
2158928	2159629	Oh yeah, I went there.
2159909	2160290	I went there.
2162540	2165843	I don't care anymore, we're just going to do our thing.
2189494	2190875	Who cares?
2191095	2201722	I don't know if you've looked in the forums lately, but we did start a brand new thread, thank you very much, Rob, about stuff that we report on the show that's kind of under the radar, as we like to put it.
2202062	2215892	This week, for example, they announced officially about the Xbox Live Unplugged Volume 1, as we reported weeks ago, and other things of that nature and stuff, and we're going to be continuing to add to that each week with new stuff.
2216172	2219394	By the way, I want to point out, this is not an ego thing.
2220214	2221575	We're very humble people.
2221955	2224156	We love the fact that we're independent.
2224196	2227078	We have such great listeners and folks that listen to us.
2227498	2230880	We just are keeping this list for ourselves.
2231120	2237623	When people call us liars and that we're full of shit over here, I just want it on the record somewhere.
2238403	2239464	So that's what we're doing.
2240552	2241353	So join in the fun.
2241413	2241954	Go to the thread.
2242014	2242274	Have fun.
2242635	2255034	And personally, my personal thing here is I don't like reporting something and then having another press outlet report the same thing and then it spreads like wildfire and everyone takes it as gospel as they were the first ones to have the story.
2255652	2257574	That's never happened to us ever.
2257594	2259555	It's kind of an ego-boosting thing, but it never happened.
2259996	2264919	Anywho, anywho, okay, so that never happened when 1UP picked the Konami release date story.
2264980	2265700	I don't care tonight.
2265760	2266741	I just don't care tonight.
2267101	2267421	Whatever.
2267502	2267902	Anyways.
2268442	2269123	We're independent.
2269263	2270224	I don't care tonight.
2270304	2270984	I seriously don't.
2271004	2271905	Not after Wednesday.
2271925	2273086	I was going to report a couple things.
2273226	2278911	First off, you remember there's the news of Bullet Witch being put out in the United States by Atari.
2279511	2280492	We've got a date for you.
2280936	2284398	February 21st is when you can expect that game, assuming there's no date changes.
2285119	2290262	And then, of course, a new Wii launch title, or in the launch window, I guess, as you would put it.
2291182	2292963	Shrek Smash and Crash for the Wii.
2293003	2296225	It's going to be a Mario Kart-style game featuring Shrek characters.
2296285	2296966	Whoopty shit.
2296986	2304210	Whoopty shit, yes, but it is coming out on the Wii December 15th for $39.99, so look forward to that.
2305290	2307792	But, you know, you're here first, so.
2308553	2311418	Any other US release dates that we should be aware of coming up?
2311738	2312139	Of course.
2312660	2314482	This week is actually going to be pretty awesome.
2315244	2316365	Lots of 360 stuff.
2316405	2319210	Bomberman, Act Zero is going to be coming out.
2319510	2321974	You've also got Enchanted Arms coming out on the 360.
2322555	2323617	Ooh, that's this week?
2323877	2324797	Yes, that's this week.
2324857	2325618	Ooh, I'm gonna get that.
2325918	2333300	But Enchanted Arms got... It said Enchanted Arms is good if you like RPG cliches, because the game is... I love RPG cliches!
2333320	2334420	Well, then it's for you!
2334560	2334940	Great!
2335341	2340982	And then, my personal favorite, which I already got because I'm special, of course, Saints Row.
2341963	2342563	Seriously?
2343863	2344183	Tonight?
2344403	2344804	Oh, man.
2344884	2345544	Alright, whatever.
2346204	2347564	Our egos need a lashing tonight.
2348085	2348485	Seriously.
2348905	2349985	Jamie, make fun of us, please.
2351646	2352206	You're gay.
2352708	2353328	Thank you.
2353589	2355250	Yeah, Loki, you're gay.
2356150	2358051	You're not gay.
2358712	2360253	But we won't hold that against you.
2360453	2362074	And this is another one for you, Rob.
2362654	2367437	Star Fox Command comes out this coming week, which is going to be pretty awesome.
2368523	2369144	Can I be honest?
2369304	2372187	I kind of stopped caring about Star Fox a long time ago.
2372467	2374890	Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.
2375350	2376692	Yeah, exactly right.
2376752	2378674	Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.
2378694	2382798	Did you play that abortion of a GameCube Star Fox game?
2384652	2385972	Listen, Star Fox 64.
2386373	2391234	We used to play Star Fox 64 during lunches in high school.
2391514	2393254	Multiplayer, four-player deathmatches.
2393614	2394475	That was the shit.
2394515	2397255	I'll check it out, but I'm not going to spend... I want a demo.
2397616	2400716	It's all about the Wi-Fi multiplayer deathmatches.
2401216	2409679	Of course, then again, you know Wi-Fi... You know what, Loki, why don't you buy it, and then you can let me play it, and then I'll let you borrow Enchanted Arms or something, and you can have fun with your RPG cliches.
2409999	2410399	Okay, fine.
2410539	2410719	All right.
2411851	2413812	Well, hey, there's other places in the world.
2414392	2416893	To quote Eddie, are you aware there's other countries?
2416973	2417273	Hold on.
2417693	2418393	I've still got some more.
2418874	2419494	I'm almost done.
2419934	2420194	Sorry.
2421094	2423575	Xenosaga 3 is also coming out on PlayStation 2.
2424936	2428317	Disgaea 2 is coming out this week, which is going to be pretty cool.
2429237	2433359	One Piece, Grand Adventure, if you like anime fighting games, pretty cool.
2434099	2440381	And if you're not into that kind of stuff, on the PSP, there's going to be Def Jam Fight for New York, the take
2441107	2443048	TakeOver, TakeDown, I can't remember which it was.
2443068	2445170	What are we also coming out?
2445990	2446591	Let's look for those.
2448512	2450173	They needed to do a game called Thingy.
2451975	2453436	You could author the game, I don't know.
2453956	2455177	I'll make a game.
2455317	2458299	Someone should hire me to design a game.
2459120	2459840	It'll be awesome.
2460401	2461842	It'll be called Jamie's Awesome Game.
2462882	2467586	Anyway, speaking of awesome, we have the release dates over in the UK.
2467606	2467826	Okay.
2469160	2473324	I know I already went over them the week before, but actually today.
2474304	2475565	I touched on some last week too.
2475886	2478167	Which I guess would be yesterday now in the UK.
2478348	2480449	Oh yeah, we're pre-taping this week, so it's actually Friday night.
2480469	2481470	Yeah, Friday night.
2481610	2485293	The Reservoir Dogs Madden 2007, which was a big whoopty shit in my book.
2486054	2488956	Yeah, Dan had to be there for the Madden sale.
2489556	2490357	I thought it was funny.
2491898	2494640	Let's Make a Soccer Team and Dig Dug Digging Strike.
2495041	2495181	Okay.
2496011	2499434	Also now coming out on the 1st, which is ironically my wedding anniversary.
2502916	2509281	Age of Pirates, Caribbean Tales, AND1 Streetball, Birth of America.
2509301	2515385	What was that little snort at the end there?
2515625	2515986	Nothing.
2516086	2519948	Is it funny because that game's coming out in the UK?
2520529	2521369	So it's kind of funny.
2521430	2524272	It's like, you know, hey, Revolutionary War, the game.
2524332	2524552	Wee!
2526155	2528796	Let's kick some Yankee ass!
2529436	2550162	Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New York The Takeover on PSP, Dungeon Siege 2 Broken World, Me Sneezing the Game, Guitar Man Lives, Saints Row, Star Fox Command, Test Drive Unlimited, Gangs of London.
2551983	2553403	And on the 6th, The Scramble.
2555164	2555344	Alright.
2556227	2561930	I feel very sorry for everybody over there because they don't get Dead Rising until the 8th and that makes me cry because Dead Rising is awesome.
2561990	2563091	At least they're getting it pretty soon.
2563271	2565313	But they're getting Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the 8th as well.
2565493	2567794	At least they're not getting it 28 days later.
2568455	2571217	You're so funny.
2572197	2572838	Where's a gun?
2574199	2576440	Maybe we can whack them over the head with a Guitar Hero controller.
2576480	2577301	Those things are pretty heavy.
2577861	2578061	G-H-O-U-L
2601769	2604030	Well, they kind of took that, like local DDR tournaments, right?
2604250	2606350	They kind of took that idea and applied it to Guitar Hero.
2606631	2614053	This is a set of sponsored tournaments where you will do the organizing and promoting, and then Red Octane gives you banners and prizes.
2614593	2617134	So it's like the Guitar Hero tournament in a box.
2617434	2618434	Kind of.
2618494	2621055	It makes me think of the Xbox Live Pizza Party thing as well.
2621135	2621555	Exactly.
2621695	2622776	So that's kind of neat.
2623296	2627177	Now, Red Octane, by the way, is only going to do a limited amount of sponsorships.
2628198	2629578	So, you know...
2630069	2633250	Pax is going on right now, and one of the big announcements at Pax was the Penny Arcade game.
2656685	2658467	And it looks pretty awesome.
2658947	2661289	Just they have a little teaser image that came out for it.
2661970	2669736	And the name of the game is actually... It's quite interesting because it looks like it's going to be episodic content and stuff.
2669896	2675841	And anyways, the name is Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.
2676321	2677843	And it will be a comic adventure game.
2677863	2681506	It's coming out on the PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.
2682447	2685309	And by the teaser image, it shows...
2686189	2687750	Giant Glowing Eyes I'm Coming
2707369	2709090	Fucking fruit fucker in a game.
2709750	2710390	Penny Arcade.
2710870	2711651	Oh, I gotta get this.
2712291	2714492	I am looking for this game like crazy.
2714732	2716232	Why didn't we go to Penny Arcade Expo?
2716252	2716712	Seriously.
2717753	2718433	You know what?
2718813	2721474	My respect for Penny Arcade goes like higher and higher.
2721534	2723215	Like every time we do some type of report that involves that.
2723235	2724975	To be honest, I do want to go next year.
2725416	2727096	And I do have a lot of respect for them.
2727196	2733559	They also announced what was that $10,000 scholarship for students that are looking to go into a...
2734932	2737174	Video Game Field in school and stuff.
2737454	2741258	So that's pretty, I mean, that's kind of giving back to the community.
2741318	2742339	I like that a lot.
2742999	2746242	And they've definitely kind of got a really good vibe going on with everything.
2746282	2752988	It's kind of like a fun E3 where actually people are, I don't know, this is the right kind of attitude to have in the industry.
2754189	2755230	All right, very cool.
2756731	2758213	Well, speaking of cool...
2759424	2765746	Actually, now, I don't know if this is cool, cool, or sort of, huh?
2766346	2771327	Because it's just more Xbox 360 drama, in my opinion.
2773407	2778249	You know they have their premium pricing for a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade.
2778269	2787191	Well, they're also giving Luminous the same treatment, where to play it, it's 1,200 marketplace points, which is about $14.99.
2789026	2799270	However, is that once you reach a certain number of points in mission or versus CPU modes of the game, you will be actually asked to pay another 700 points.
2799770	2813775	I hope that is a gross misinterpretation somehow of what is really intended, because it would not be a surprise if they're charging additional points for new themes and skins, but to prevent you from going further in the game in points, having to spend more money?
2814435	2815195	What is that?
2815295	2816936	That's like a demo I'm paying for.
2817870	2822515	I'm hoping there's just a gross misinterpretation of what they're charging for.
2822535	2826760	And even then, if they're charging for extra levels and skins and things, that's not a big surprise.
2826920	2832867	What it might be is that the game has downloadable songpacks or whatever in that case.
2833277	2860614	and then the single player game goes so far say you start off with like 20 songs or something when you download the game and then later on when you buy that sound pack it will go to level 20 and then continue on say with the 5 other songs that are in your song pack that would make more sense but I don't see how you would I would think it's just like the one rumor that came out and I hope it's not true where you'd have to purchase like multiplayer for the game I mean it's kind of dumb
2861172	2861552	I don't know.
2861752	2862693	Just be... You know what?
2862893	2869837	I realize Luminous is this very popular, in-demand thing, but don't shoot yourself in the foot, kids, over at Xbox Live.
2870137	2871218	I still wouldn't put it past them.
2872118	2876061	This is a good... This is a prime way to make money, and you know people will pay for it.
2876121	2879843	Yeah, and I will probably be one of them, and I will punch myself in the face for doing it.
2879963	2889369	Now, one thing to be pointed out is that they're doing all of their pricing in terms of points instead of putting the dollar point, they're putting the actual Xbox Live points to sort of...
2891720	2900928	I honestly think that it's a way, and I agree with this article because I got the information from Wired.com.
2903310	2910776	I do think that actually it's a way to subvert the overall price value of the game by giving it in terms of something abstract like points.
2911451	2916275	We do have a handful of people in our chat room right now that are listening live to us taping a little early on Friday night.
2916635	2918497	And Drew Nami's in there and makes kind of a good point.
2918817	2924481	Yeah, I'd like to purchase World 2-1 episodic content to the extreme.
2925962	2926923	Interesting comparison.
2927263	2928584	It's like a Mario Brothers style game.
2928685	2931086	There's going to be a point where people are just not going to pay for it anymore.
2931607	2936050	And, you know, I think I've kind of got to that point, you know, with Elder Scrolls 4.
2936431	2940674	Like, I'm not going to go buy all the content and everything, so...
2942799	2943099	I don't know.
2966006	2974388	They said that more than 1 billion Microsoft points have been activated, which in the current exchange rate comes to $12.5 million in revenue.
2975008	2984269	Including, they said that the average Xbox Live user has downloaded about 25 pieces of content with about 45 million overall downloads.
2985209	2994491	They were also pointing out that some of the first games to use the Xbox Live anywhere are actually going to be some of the Vista games, including Shadowrun and Halo 2.
2996069	2998132	So, that's very cool.
3000934	3006520	They didn't really specify on how it's going to use live anywhere, but it should be very interesting.
3006800	3011725	And I can't wait for the live vision camera, which they mentioned, of course, is coming out.
3012005	3012105	Why?
3012145	3013747	What are you going to do with your live camera?
3014808	3016570	What am I not going to do with my live camera?
3016870	3017231	All right.
3018628	3020371	Pink Nintendo DS Lite
3031815	3032856	I am so excited.
3032896	3033857	This is being released.
3033957	3035718	A pink Nintendo DS Lite.
3036098	3037039	Oh, and a black one too.
3037059	3037860	Black one.
3038220	3041162	Are being released on September 13th in the U.S.
3041683	3043584	It's my understanding, I believe I read somewhere the U.K.
3043704	3044985	is getting the pink one as well.
3045025	3046146	Yes, they are getting the pink one.
3046226	3047987	Our buddies over there will get that as well.
3048067	3048948	But we get a black one.
3048968	3050249	Well, they already have the black one over there.
3050529	3051070	Yes, exactly.
3051090	3052271	So now we're going to match up finally.
3052291	3052971	We'll have all the colors.
3053371	3060357	And this is one of those instances where I'm very glad I did not splurge and get the white DS because I would much prefer a black one or...
3060984	3063725	Maybe a pink one, depending on how I'm feeling on September 13th.
3063885	3085531	Well, that was not the only systems that were getting some pink makeovers, including in the UK, they are getting a PlayStation 2, the slim model, that's also going to be in pink, including they're going to have some bundles that are going to be discounted, including two pink controllers and a pink memory card and, you know,
3086198	3094542	SingStarPop is going to be bundled in there as well for the most flamboyant PlayStation 2 bundle that's out there.
3095103	3098945	It should be noted, as we mentioned last week, that the U.S.
3099005	3105508	is getting a different colored PlayStation 2 Slim model, a silver one actually, which I believe has been available in the U.K.
3105628	3105988	already.
3106869	3109871	They're also getting a pink PSP as well.
3110051	3110631	Goody, goody.
3111981	3119973	They think that's going to appeal to women gamers because the only thing stopping women gamers out there from actually purchasing consoles was the color.
3120614	3123699	DarkSakura, please explain the expression on your face because this is radio.
3124600	3127104	That's the most retarded thing I think I've ever heard.
3128086	3134028	All right, well, speaking of colorful, we certainly get e-mails every week, and hopefully they've kept the language to a minimum in the e-mails.
3134108	3137749	I don't know, DarkSakura, did you have to suit up the asbestos this week for the e-mail bag?
3138069	3139669	You know, it wasn't bad enough for the asbestos.
3139729	3143030	I just went in with a gas mask and some hand sanitizer.
3143050	3151693	All right, well, you can e-mail us with your colorful thoughts at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura will dip in there and pull out some e-mails like she's going to do right now.
3158206	3165392	Well, given the sort of short week for right now, and by the way, thank you for taking care of mail for me while I was at Disneyland.
3165452	3166253	No problem.
3166413	3166893	It was fun.
3166953	3168675	We actually let Miklatov read.
3168915	3169475	Oh, fun.
3169996	3170576	Oh, fun.
3170676	3174540	We tried to give him the illusion of that he was an actual full-fledged co-host for a night.
3174560	3174980	It was fun.
3175100	3177122	Why don't we downgrade him to dwarf host?
3177322	3179564	I don't know, because he might bite you in the ankle.
3179784	3180404	No, no, no.
3180524	3182306	Pluto was downgraded.
3182706	3185168	She made a sci-fi joke.
3185228	3185589	I get it.
3185889	3187070	So Miklatov's our dwarf host.
3187392	3188172	Okay, that's cool.
3188592	3189553	We can call him Xena.
3190253	3192614	We can call him Mini DarkSakura.
3192674	3193634	I'm pissed off about that.
3193834	3195415	Okay, I'll get into that during the FUs.
3195575	3195675	Okay.
3195695	3197175	Because I wanted a planet named Xena.
3197195	3197895	That's fine, that's fine.
3197935	3202817	Anyway, first one is from GrinWithoutACat, who I think is uber cool.
3204838	3207058	I like that name because it makes me think of Alice in Wonderland.
3208079	3208359	That's all.
3209079	3211120	Don't get me started on the whole Alice Mad Hatter thing.
3211500	3211720	Okay.
3212812	3219155	Hey Orange Challenge Crew, you probably already heard of this one, but I've just discovered Rhythm Tengoku on the GBA from Nintendo.
3219215	3221596	In fact, it's the same people who did WarioWare and it shows.
3222056	3223496	If you haven't heard of it, there's some videos.
3223576	3228178	It's actually on Nintendo.co.jp, so search for it there.
3228998	3238702	It looks great fun to me, and I'm thinking of importing it, but wanted to check on what you guys thought about the game and the possibility of it getting an English language release before I did, since you were the expert on music games.
3240223	3240763	Well, um...
3242287	3244069	I haven't heard of it getting an English release at all.
3244109	3245130	I don't think it's coming out here.
3245410	3250014	But I bet you it will if another certain Japanese import game does very well over here.
3250461	3259766	Yeah, I think that if Owendon, or Elite Beat Agents, I should say, does well over here, then... I think it's going to open the floodgates for music games on the handhelds.
3260606	3264428	So support Elite Beat Agents, and I'll bet you anything you're going to see a ton.
3264709	3267090	Hopefully not cheap knockoff clones, but some good stuff.
3268491	3273393	One music title that's kind of often overlooked is Electroplankton, because it was kind of a harder one to get.
3273413	3274854	You had to get it on Nintendo Store and everything.
3275374	3277095	Electroplankton was cool from the demo.
3277295	3277495	Right.
3277535	3279375	It's not a rhythm game per se.
3279415	3280496	It's a music creation game.
3280736	3286738	But I think a lot of people that are into music and rhythm games are into it because of the fact that it feels like you're making music.
3286778	3291760	At least that's why I love Beatmania and 2DX and all that stuff is I feel like I'm actually making music.
3292200	3294320	So definitely check out Electroplankton.
3294340	3295141	I think you'll get a kick out of it.
3295421	3296441	There's a little bit more to this email.
3296701	3297041	Oh, sorry.
3297802	3298262	Rob.
3299122	3299422	Hey, Rob.
3299722	3300403	What?
3300563	3301363	Just read the damn email.
3301983	3302383	Hi.
3303203	3304704	I missed you, but my aim's improving.
3307062	3315409	This would probably make a boring question for the show, as I expect many of the listeners to be pretty knowledgeable on the whole music genre, but I was wondering if you could help me out.
3315790	3321254	I'm over in the UK, and we don't get the choice in rhythm action genre that you guys in North America get.
3321835	3332144	We do get quite a few of these games, Space Channel 5, Guitar Man, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Hero, for example, but we still miss out on things such as Beatmania and Drum Master.
3332164	3333465	I guess that would be Taiko...
3334826	3341312	Thankfully, both the DS and PSP are region-free, so I've been able to import great games such as Daigaso, Band Brothers, Osu!
3341352	3343994	Tatakai Oendan, and Drum Master Portable.
3345215	3351261	I was wondering if you could recommend any music games that are available on either the GBA, DS, or PSP.
3351861	3355945	I don't really know any Japanese, but I haven't had any problems working my way around the ones already mentioned.
3356245	3356986	Keep up the great work.
3357046	3357726	It's appreciated.
3357786	3358447	Grin without a cap.
3358715	3359695	What a very humble email.
3359735	3360636	I really appreciate that.
3360696	3361996	Very humble attitude, that email.
3363836	3365837	I think I just kind of recommended one there.
3365857	3369898	We had the Electroplankton was my suggestion there.
3370618	3372179	Actually, you kind of named most of the big ones.
3372219	3375060	There's not a whole lot that we get that you guys don't get.
3375100	3377420	I mean, honestly, most of the ones you named, we also have.
3378220	3380561	Handhelds, there's not a lot of music games on handhelds.
3380921	3383162	The DDR games on handheld were poopy.
3383262	3383962	You don't want those.
3384162	3387323	Well, I would say the only one I can think of that he didn't mention...
3387763	3388224	and DJ Maxx.
3404088	3418295	I would say that if you're, honestly, there's not a good Beatmania for a handheld, except for the WonderSwan one, which actually, I mean, I don't know if you have a WonderSwan, but it actually has a little scratch pad that you attach to it, and all the sound effects were digitized.
3419164	3419544	TigerToyGames
3447674	3451478	They have Beatmania and DDR Portable.
3451498	3452659	There's even a Hello Kitty one.
3452959	3455261	And it's just like the size of a Pokemon Pikachu.
3455542	3455802	Cute.
3456423	3462448	I'm not actually saying this to actually plug a site, but it is the one site I know that you can order them.
3462548	3467734	NCSX has them, and Toys and Joys, if you're interested in that type of thing.
3467994	3471217	I'd say look through any of the importers list except for Buy Right, because they suck.
3471932	3473392	But let's do any of the importers lists.
3473412	3474573	Didn't Byright go out of business?
3474993	3478354	Byright got shut down by the Better Business Bureau.
3478374	3479314	Alright, next email.
3479754	3481055	Ha ha ha, I was so happy.
3481435	3482895	Okay, it's actually the last one.
3483556	3491338	It's from SurunojiSama91 from our chat.
3491378	3494499	He was the phantom caller that didn't pick up for the music because his phone battery died.
3495001	3497643	Aw, I got to miss out on a fun contest last week.
3497683	3500085	Which, by the way, we will do again because I got a really good reception.
3500105	3503448	And by the way, we had Jamie play tonight the game from last week.
3503488	3506150	If you're not sure what we're talking about, download Part B of last week's show.
3506491	3507231	Jamie got six.
3507912	3509593	So, not too shabby.
3509833	3511234	I'll write more down next time.
3512095	3512996	I didn't write anything down.
3513636	3514917	Yeah, she just named them off the top of her head.
3514937	3515578	So that was pretty good.
3515678	3516098	That was pretty good.
3516219	3517159	As I'm hardcore.
3517560	3520042	Okay, Dear OLR, I'm afraid.
3520762	3522704	I'm afraid for a lot of consumers.
3523749	3527753	Afraid that they're going to be screwed over by Sony during this next-gen console war.
3528314	3531677	I've been a loyal Sony fan over the years, maybe a little too loyal.
3532077	3534560	I own both an import PS2 and an American PS2.
3534600	3537462	I also happen to own a Japanese PSP, which I ordered at launch.
3537923	3543829	I'm afraid of the future of Sony with their release of the PS3 because of the possible slip in sales due to the price tag.
3544069	3548113	Many people are going to buy the PS3, and it's obvious that they're going to sell out at launch.
3548713	3563644	But with their questionable market strategy, releasing the PS3 under two SKUs at sky-high prices, charges for useless game content, and the loss of sales with the UMD, Sony may be in deep doo-doo this go-round.
3564124	3570829	I would like to know what your thoughts are about purchasing the PS3, and also if it will be a good investment, or a possible quote, dreamcast.
3571029	3572090	Thanks, loyal fan.
3572390	3572630	Ricky.
3572878	3573458	You know what's funny?
3573478	3575019	We had a very similar email last week.
3575039	3579122	There's been a lot of Sony questioning going on lately, which isn't much of a surprise.
3579842	3587467	I'm going to stick by something I said kind of similar last week, is that, you know what, I don't think it's something that I want to get on launch day.
3587915	3591499	But then again, the PlayStation 2 wasn't really something I needed on launch day either.
3591899	3597224	So give it time, see where it goes, but for right now, I don't see any need to run out and buy it.
3597284	3604852	I realize there's been a lot of hype recently, you know, because the Xbox 360 had this huge launch thing, and that's been like the big thing lately is launch day, launch day.
3605232	3607234	But you don't have to buy into that hype.
3607595	3607835	Wait.
3608175	3608596	It's fine.
3609116	3611739	Wait for the game you want to come out, and then make a decision.
3612199	3616982	Like me, I'm waiting for Final Fantasy XIII or something else that will grab my attention in that same style.
3617322	3618163	Then I will make a decision.
3618363	3621365	I still stand by what I have always said since day one.
3621725	3623746	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
3624186	3625947	And from what I played, it's crap.
3626788	3627788	Even Sonic Avenger.
3628329	3635793	As for comparing it to the Dreamcast, I don't think that nothing is ever going to be... Yeah, because the Dreamcast is kind of the other way around where it's just horribly underrated.
3636694	3639576	But the system itself was so versatile.
3640156	3641717	I mean, hello, Bleemcast.
3642466	3644567	You had a system that could run Playstation games.
3645107	3648828	Did you notice the news that was this week that they were talking about?
3648848	3653350	Remember Gran Turismo HD as a work, it was basically a tech demo?
3653870	3654930	No, actually it's the full game.
3655410	3656471	That's actually going to be coming out.
3656631	3663353	It is, they have said it, it is a port of Gran Turismo 4.
3664053	3666134	All they did was upscale the graphics.
3666674	3667254	That is it.
3667654	3670195	So yay, you can pay $59.99 for a
3672642	3674283	HD, DVD, Outnumbers, Blu-ray, 2 to 1
3698069	3699390	I don't understand how can it fail?
3719364	3719684	Beta.
3720926	3722087	Exactly, that's what I'm saying.
3722127	3724849	Remember the Betamax.
3724949	3726570	And that was also Sony's format, too.
3726651	3732416	Even though the Betamax was technologically a superior format, it still failed against VHS.
3732996	3743165	I could see Ken going, you know, if the PlayStation 3 does not sell, I'll go door-to-door and punch people in the face and make them buy it at gunpoint or whatever.
3743686	3746188	To quote Junami, inconceivable!
3746909	3747930	You keep using that word.
3747970	3749690	I do not think it means what you think it does.
3749751	3753933	We need some good males that hate on Nintendo and Microsoft, to be fair.
3754293	3754573	No.
3754653	3757935	So send some Microsoft and Nintendo hate, if you're feeling it.
3757955	3758775	It should be obvious.
3758875	3760276	Over to Mailbag and OrangeHunter.com.
3760376	3769621	Our listeners, I hope I'm not assuming for all of you, mind you, but our listeners in general, I've seen more support for Nintendo followed by Microsoft.
3770293	3774255	I honestly am seeing... Truthfully, I do feel the same way, but I want to hear from the other side.
3774315	3778216	I actually am having that same warm feeling in my heart for the Wii that the Dreamcast gave me.
3778996	3779477	You know what?
3780217	3781817	I'll give you some hate news right here.
3782578	3787420	The Wii is not going to have... The third-party Wii titles will not be online at launch.
3788240	3796763	And that's because Nintendo is not giving out the actual libraries to build online for the third-party titles until 2007.
3796803	3797423	And the theory is that
3799164	3799625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3814384	3815004	Not gonna happen.
3815405	3817526	Please don't make the same mistake you made with the GameCube, Nintendo.
3817546	3818246	That's all I have to say.
3818526	3819787	Please do not make the same mistake.
3820127	3825270	But I don't think they are, but I just kind of wish they would go online, but whatever.
3825430	3826630	Okay, it's their call.
3826650	3829632	They're releasing 2007, so... At least it's on the horizon.
3830553	3834174	DS didn't start online, and it turned out okay, so I'm gonna give it to them.
3834274	3834915	And you know what?
3834935	3839137	99%... Most systems out there didn't start off online, the only exception would probably be in the 360.
3839197	3839257	Hmm.
3841738	3845301	To say so, though, the Dreamcast did actually come with a dial-up modem.
3847042	3847643	That's awesome.
3848123	3850805	We paid for the broadband that only worked on Quake 3.
3853227	3853508	All right.
3853888	3856590	Yeah, there's other people in this world who need oven mitts and a helmet.
3858011	3862275	If you would like to email us, send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
3862315	3864196	Send DarkSakura your oven mitts and helmets.
3864436	3865417	I do take worship, too.
3865697	3865978	All right.
3866558	3867559	Well, anyways...
3868264	3869985	There's some interesting news coming out.
3870186	3880093	I remember we talked about it, I think, a little bit last week about how some of the Toys R Us stores were actually selling the Xbox Live camera early.
3881213	3887738	In fact, a few weeks early, because it's not supposed to come out until around the 19th or 20th of September.
3888399	3891901	Well, some interesting news about that, actually.
3893202	3895324	One of the apparent readers of...
3899247	3910930	Xbox360.qj.net read the headline on their site and actually went down to a South Miami, Florida store and purchased one of the cameras.
3911190	3917692	He was speaking to the clerk there and asked them why they were selling it two weeks early.
3918332	3922333	He was told by Microsoft that they're releasing a limited number for selective sales.
3923473	3925594	His assumption was, I can only assume that
3926195	3927696	This was to start buzz.
3928097	3933982	In other words, some sort of viral campaign to basically get the buzz out there about the brand new camera.
3934643	3938446	For all those people that play UNO online, OMG, I'm starting to see people with cameras.
3938767	3939908	Ooh, look, naked people.
3940874	3946537	Well, anyways, if you are looking for some information about the camera, it is going to be coming out in two different SKUs.
3947237	3958702	There's going to be a cheaper one for $39.99, which is the camera, a live headset, in case you don't have one, a free month of live gold, and Uno, a card for the full game of Uno.
3959022	3962844	And supposedly later on, they're going to allow a free download for Totem Ball, because not only is it
3963484	3990594	Playable through the camera Then there's one also for $79.99 And that also includes the camera, the headset, a full year of Xbox Live Gold And of course a free month Uno, the full game A to-be-announced third game for the camera and 200 Microsoft points So, very interesting Too bad I already bought Uno Yeah, same
3991202	3991603	Thanks, Microsoft.
3991624	3993109	They should have just given us Microsoft points.
3993130	3995117	Yeah, give us Microsoft points instead.
3995158	3995780	Let's buy something else.
3996302	3996664	Jerks.
3997557	4002898	Well, yeah, the one thing you could have bought would be these new Xbox Live Arcade games that are being developed.
4003518	4008599	They're tabletop European game favorites that are being ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.
4009139	4012500	The Settlers of Catan is one game that's coming over to Xbox Live.
4012980	4016460	And forgive me if I'm horribly mispronouncing these.
4016480	4018101	I've never heard of these games before in my life.
4018981	4021661	Carcassonne is another game that's coming over.
4022041	4024822	And Alhambra are some games that are coming over to Xbox Live Arcade.
4024922	4025682	Don't they bottle water?
4026794	4028835	Maybe in this country, but over there it's a board game.
4029655	4031055	So that should be interesting.
4031075	4032036	Where's Axis and Allies?
4032316	4032896	That's one of those.
4032956	4035256	And Risk.
4035717	4038117	Imagine online multiplayer Risk.
4038957	4039918	You think Uno's bad.
4040018	4041298	Draw four, bitch!
4042538	4043159	Or Monopoly.
4044299	4045519	Monopoly would be ridiculous.
4046320	4047840	Why can't they give us chess?
4048615	4051776	Can you imagine how hardcore Risk would be online?
4051956	4053477	I just took Russia, bitch!
4054017	4059359	Or just like some, just a board game collection, like Connect Four, or like Battleship.
4059719	4061440	I suck your battleship, bitch!
4063601	4065121	You have sunk my battleship!
4066022	4067702	Go back to start, bitch!
4069303	4071224	Do not pass the show!
4071264	4072864	Go directly to go, bitch!
4072904	4074945	Do not collect $200, or I kick your ass!
4076026	4076666	For great justice.
4077478	4080321	or as Drunami says in chat, I call the thimble, bitch.
4081422	4082444	He used the thimble?
4083645	4085427	You gotta fucking shoot, bitch.
4085707	4087229	Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's the puppy.
4088711	4091193	It's on with chutes and ladders, MF-er.
4091334	4091874	Your mom.
4092315	4092855	Alright, anyway.
4093536	4098762	By the way, the reason why we do that is if you've ever actually played on Xbox Live and listened to people, like, seriously.
4099758	4100979	They trash talk and everything.
4101200	4101900	Everything.
4102501	4103923	This is why we play with the thing turned off.
4103943	4106065	They need to put out like a strawberry shortcake happy game.
4106085	4107486	I leave feedback on everyone.
4107526	4109208	I'm like, you know, I don't care.
4110109	4112552	This person is an ass.
4112952	4114394	I wish you could type things in.
4114714	4115475	Like eBay.
4116256	4117417	Was fun to play with.
4117597	4118699	A++++.
4118779	4119880	Would deathmatch again.
4120674	4121515	You know what I want?
4121775	4124577	I really want some multiplayer in Viva Pinata.
4125058	4126819	I killed your pinata, bitch!
4127760	4130462	Now give me candy, bitch!
4130882	4136127	The cutest fucking game they need to just have an online deathmatch for.
4136147	4137688	It'd be hilarious.
4137768	4139009	Loco Broco deathmatch.
4140430	4141411	Alright, whatever.
4141431	4142732	Let's keep it moving.
4143363	4157265	Well, as far as movements, and this sort of makes me think more of bowel movements, that Louisiana game law business that we've been hearing so much about, hence the results of bowel movements making me think of, actually, it got stopped.
4158058	4161120	The unstoppable law got stopped.
4161761	4170707	Yeah, basically Jack Thompson was going around saying the law is constitutional as it addresses all of the complaints raised by federal courts which have struck down other state video game laws.
4170847	4172108	That's what he's quoted as saying.
4172768	4175030	Yeah, I know you're still a dumbass, Jackie Poo.
4176131	4183756	So it was basically shot down by a federal judge said it was unconstitutional and
4184389	4185410	Stop wasting our tax money.
4208059	4222782	Seriously, well, the bill's sponsor was basically saying that he hoped testosterone would, quote, have the additional adrenaline and testosterone needed in the upcoming cockfight over the constitutionality of this bill.
4223562	4237585	Anything that's going to attack our right to express ourselves, or even, it's still somebody's creative work, and you're trying to censor how they are expressing themselves.
4238394	4238874	Their work.
4239495	4244859	It's still somebody sat and thought this idea up and you were suppressing this idea.
4245199	4246781	Now tell me what's constitutional about that.
4248982	4250623	DarkSakura lay off the SmackDown.
4252225	4252905	Interesting.
4253325	4255167	Well, I thought this was kind of funny.
4255327	4258610	When I read this story, I know we joked about this on another show.
4259050	4264094	Like, goddammit, I'm not buying that PlayStation 3 unless, you know, it cures cancer.
4264234	4264454	Well,
4265060	4267061	They're going to be helping to cure cancer at the PlayStation 3.
4267901	4282546	And the way they're doing that is kind of been like a project that's been going on PCs right now with the Folding at Home project, basically using distributing power while your system is idle.
4282806	4287668	You can download a program or whatever, and that will basically kind of compute.
4287728	4292690	I believe this is looking at some of the proteins or whatever make up
4293052	4293352	I don't know.
4293832	4307096	It's computing something to basically help cure cancer and they're going to be supposedly expecting to get 100 gigaflops with 10,000 PS3s churning away with this project.
4307176	4311057	So that's a lot of processing power towards a very good cause.
4312257	4316198	Hopefully I don't actually have to run this no matter what.
4316678	4319419	So is this how they justify the $600 price tag?
4319459	4321380	Is that if you buy one of these then you won't get cancer?
4321580	4322360	I mean, is that...
4324653	4325274	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4340606	4341526	Ring, Spiral, and Loop.
4341807	4355993	This makes me think a lot of Loop, because the premise of that one is that they were building a society, but it got infected like a virus and they're trying to... Basically, yeah, they're crunching the math of folding proteins that hold the secret to curing cancer.
4356153	4358414	This is also like that old project study at home.
4358434	4363536	One of the things I thought was really funny, it was kind of a comment in this article, it says, but mom, it cures cancer.
4363576	4366397	If you don't buy it for me, granny will die.
4367278	4368418	So I thought that was kind of funny.
4368798	4369459	Ha ha ha.
4370799	4378202	Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, DarkSakura mentioned earlier that the lineup E3 for the PlayStation 3 left a lot of people unimpressed.
4378562	4381424	Well, there's going to be a whole lot more shown at Tokyo Game Show.
4381464	4382524	Sony's going to up it.
4382764	4383765	Will they actually have systems?
4384545	4387746	Supposedly, they're going to have more stuff, and they're going to be showing a whole lot of games.
4388186	4389327	Here's some stuff they're going to be showing.
4389507	4391788	Armored Core 4, Bladestorm...
4392368	4409099	Haikunen Sensu, Coated Arms Assault, Devil May Cry 4, The Eye of Judgment, Fatal Inertia, Formula One World Championship, Genji, Working Title, Gran Turismo, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Working Title, Mahjong Takai 4, which probably won't come out here.
4409119	4411020	Have we ever gotten a Mahjong game actually come out in the U.S.?
4411080	4412861	We've had a couple of Mahjong games.
4415141	4428224	Minono Golf 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, Target in Sight, Motorstorm, Railfan, Resistance, Fall of Man, Ridge Racer 7, and Warhawk are all going to make appearances at the Tokyo Game Show.
4430065	4434626	Minono Golf actually sounds very cute, so it means everybody's golf.
4435290	4436150	Isn't that just hot shots?
4436430	4436630	Yeah.
4436711	4436951	Over there?
4436971	4437751	Yeah, that's what I thought.
4437791	4443913	Heavenly Sword reminds me of like a female, it's almost like crossing God of War with Blood Rain.
4444433	4445353	Yeah, pretty much.
4446394	4447574	I'm looking forward to Devil May Cry 4.
4447694	4449035	Yeah, see now, see?
4449555	4450655	I need to get my Dante on.
4450755	4455977	If Devil May Cry 4 is made of awesome and win, will you maybe find some love for PlayStation 3 in your black heart?
4456157	4461019	Like I said, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4461179	4461499	Yes, ma'am.
4461519	4463840	They need to fix Sonic Adventure, the bastards.
4463880	4464320	Yes, ma'am.
4464994	4465274	DarkSakura.com
4499711	4501531	FUs of the week time, DarkSakura.
4502512	4505672	A big FU goes toward the astrological community.
4506933	4511614	And not really... I understand why Pluto was downgraded.
4511874	4516395	Now, for anyone who doesn't know, I love my geek science so much.
4517175	4521936	And I understand the logic behind downgrading Pluto's status to a dwarf planet.
4523677	4528238	It was like a couple weeks ago that they were about to announce the 10th planet, planet Xena.
4529438	4530319	I want Planet Xena!
4530339	4531260	Will the moon be Planet Gabrielle?
4531320	4531821	It should be.
4552938	4561548	Zena and Gabriella Leave it to the astronomy community to name planets after Zena Warrior Princess characters.
4561568	4562429	That would be awesome.
4563130	4566875	But anyway, there's people who are saying, oh, that's so stupid.
4567055	4567515	You know what?
4568477	4568677	Look,
4569702	4580632	Before, you know, first of all, there was another planet before that that existed in the 1800s that was actually downgraded to, um, I believe it was actually figured out to be a comet instead of a planet.
4581333	4582874	It was downgraded in the 1800s.
4582894	4586037	We didn't get Pluto until 1930 when it was just found.
4586077	4587538	And then they argued about it then, too.
4588018	4592903	And then now that it's Pluto, they're saying, uh-oh, you know what, we changed our minds again, you know.
4594160	4594641	60 years later.
4595242	4595642	70 years later.
4595682	4598105	You know, this news makes Walt Disney roll in his grave.
4598505	4599967	Some days I feel like Pluto.
4600607	4602289	I wonder what's going to happen to Sailor Pluto.
4602309	4605933	Is she going to shrink?
4605953	4606814	Because she was really tall.
4607555	4608416	Next FU, please.
4608436	4608656	No, no, no.
4608676	4609757	I have more on this.
4609777	4610318	I have more on this.
4611508	4619409	Well, the whole reason being is that one of the primary things is that the orbit of Pluto is elliptical and not circular in general, like most of the other planets.
4619670	4625270	It actually intersects with Neptune, which even when I was a little kid, I was like, that's weird.
4626071	4627371	So I agree with it.
4627511	4627991	I understand.
4628031	4639013	I just wish people would just, you know, freaking understand that these new criteria that they have for judging celestial bodies is actually sort of good and smart and should have been enacted a long time ago.
4639813	4639973	So...
4641687	4642047	Yeah.
4643408	4643768	Loki.
4644248	4645289	I don't care what you all say.
4645309	4646249	The world's flat.
4646829	4647390	Anyways.
4648690	4649711	As flat as your ass.
4651131	4651572	Thank you.
4651892	4652932	I take that as a compliment.
4653472	4654433	No, anyways.
4654973	4666178	So, F you to drivers, because as I was leaving here yesterday, see, we were supposed to be doing some important work, interviewing a certain somebody, and the somebody decided to quit his company.
4667379	4667679	But anyways,
4668044	4678871	So as I was leaving here, freaking crazy Asians in a goddamn little Suzuki SUV thing, one of those mini SUVs, blew through a goddamn stop sign.
4678952	4682194	I honked my horn and they're like, what happened?
4682294	4682834	I don't know.
4683435	4686817	So stupid drivers, I swear to God, they're trying to kill me out there.
4687580	4689701	It's just, you know, you need to watch where you're going.
4689721	4693663	I mean, as I mentioned... Are you ever going to have a week when you have an FU for something other than drivers?
4693863	4699705	I've had plenty of weeks where I've had things, you know... I actually did have an email received that was an FU toward Loki's FUs.
4701106	4702046	What the hell are those people?
4702086	4702987	What is their problem?
4703747	4705908	Why do they get to choose what I'm angry at?
4705948	4706688	I don't understand.
4706768	4708129	That doesn't make any sense whatever.
4708149	4708869	Alright.
4708889	4711850	You know, FUs are the damn TV at work.
4711890	4714632	Because I took my TV to work, since I don't have a place to put my old TV.
4715332	4715452	So...
4716192	4717633	I have a sub-FU to male drivers.
4719133	4721915	As in, people with small penises that drive big trucks.
4723135	4728397	Like the ones that tried to go past me until me with my faster Lancer got in front of them and flipped them off hardcore.
4729958	4734000	My FU of the week, I don't have a lot, I'm not very angsty this week, so I suppose my FU of the week would go to Jamie.
4735000	4735621	You bitch!
4736281	4737862	Because, well, because you went to Disneyland.
4738162	4738422	I know.
4738462	4739202	And you didn't take me.
4740123	4741063	It was girl trip.
4742284	4742584	So...
4745920	4749842	I will petition next time that Rob gets to come on our next big gay trip.
4749963	4750343	Thank you.
4751043	4752684	I want smoothies too some days, you know.
4753785	4754605	Do you really?
4754905	4755045	No.
4756706	4761609	By the way, Robway in the chatroom, yeah, you did give me a smoothie today, thank you.
4761669	4768193	Robway in the chatroom says, on the astronomy, after declaring Pluto not a planet, they voted on Goofy not a dog.
4770494	4771354	I thought it was funny.
4771635	4772876	I thought it was funny.
4773216	4774697	I got to hug Goofy.
4774757	4776278	I meant Goofy's not funny.
4776538	4777439	I got to hug Goofy.
4777779	4783484	Actually, no, what was funny was Goofy at Goofy's Kitchen, we went to a character breakfast, teasing Alice about having an affair with Mad Hatter.
4786106	4786887	It was funny.
4787367	4788488	Have you ever played Toontown?
4789269	4789849	No, I haven't.
4789869	4791050	Kind of seems like something you'd like.
4791130	4793252	Anyway, I saw advertisements for that on TV.
4793292	4795173	I got my picture with the princesses.
4796354	4797195	Back to gaming.
4799758	4804180	Yes, back to gaming I know there's some really interesting news from SNK
4805117	4809639	Yes, there was if people would give me a chance to freaking pull up my thing.
4810020	4810860	Okay, you guys.
4811080	4811400	All right.
4811841	4818444	Today's fake news is host of Orange Nails Radio, DarkSakura, goes crazy and kills her co-host with a tray.
4818684	4819044	Thank you.
4819144	4821986	No, actually, she doesn't do that because she was distracted by the pretty princesses.
4822186	4825088	Can we get through tonight's show in like under two hours?
4825468	4826668	It's a mini show tonight, right?
4826968	4827549	I wasn't sure.
4827609	4831991	Okay, I'm going to put the pictures up on our forums because the Ariel was so pretty.
4832091	4833532	I was like I wanted to follow her around.
4834654	4835094	Okay.
4836676	4837616	SNK!
4837716	4841059	I could walk to Disneyland by the time she gets to our next fucking story.
4841740	4842220	You know what?
4843000	4843221	Rob.
4843401	4843621	What?
4843981	4844241	Huh?
4844622	4850546	I'm gonna take this lollipop that's shaped phallically and shove it up your ass if you don't get to the next story.
4852208	4857151	Because the next story is about one of my sleeper favorite games ever, so you really need to get to it.
4857772	4859693	Okay, so shut up so I can.
4859713	4860053	Alright.
4860714	4861314	I'm shutting up.
4861395	4863116	Mr. He of Big Mouth.
4864542	4866103	Let's talk shit about everybody today.
4866424	4866604	Ooh.
4867685	4868045	Okay.
4870147	4875131	So SNK is coming to Live Arcade and everybody goes, Yay!
4877332	4883878	So guess what's going to be showing up on Xbox Live Arcade since Capcom decided to give a Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.
4884618	4887901	We will be getting Garou Densetsu Special, a.k.a.
4887961	4888842	Fatal Fury Special.
4889605	4896691	That's badass because I can play, what was his name, Tung Fu Ru on Xbox Live.
4896992	4897792	That makes me all kind of happy.
4897812	4898473	I was a Mai player.
4899374	4900575	Mai is awesome.
4900935	4905600	Mai is so... Mai freaking would kick Chun-Li's ass any day.
4906260	4906701	Seriously?
4906721	4910684	Just fucking take her out and beat her ass up and then go, me bouncy, when she wins.
4911305	4912706	No, she says me bouncy.
4912806	4913947	No, she says me bouncy.
4914107	4914568	That's what she says.
4914588	4915048	She just bounces.
4915549	4915809	Actually...
4916659	4921825	Now, they're saying that on PS2 they had a non-playable demo of King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match.
4922763	4925824	with a playable demo of Garou Densetsu Battle Archives 2.
4927185	4930666	They're also talking about Metal Slug Complete for PSP.
4930886	4938729	Actually, even more than having Fatal Fury Special, I really want to see one of the old school KOF games.
4940409	4942770	I'll tell you how hardcore of a KOF fangirl I am.
4943110	4948032	We went out and bought King of Fighters 2000 for the Neo Geo.
4949512	4951353	As in the cartridge Neo Geo.
4953015	4953415	Jamie.
4953735	4953976	What?
4954296	4954876	Duck King.
4956097	4956197	Ah!
4956317	4956897	So awesome.
4957938	4958979	Sorry.
4959419	4960980	So what's your major KOF team?
4961820	4962941	I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters.
4963201	4964722	I pretty much quit at Fail Fury Special.
4965683	4966263	Ah, sad.
4966423	4967584	I played it a couple times.
4967644	4969125	I'm pretty sure whatever team Mai was on.
4969445	4975689	Mai, Leona, and then my alternating ones of either Athena or Kim Kephwan.
4975869	4978511	I was going to say, Kim Kephwan, actually, I would play more than Mai.
4978711	4979852	I guess I love his moves.
4979892	4980932	He's an awesome fighter.
4980992	4981533	Or Iori.
4982073	4982133	Oh.
4983166	4984047	Whatever.
4984588	4985749	Typical fangirl.
4986150	4987232	Typical fangirl.
4987252	4987892	You know what?
4988974	4993380	I also used the little boy with the big hat.
4994322	4994622	Alright.
4996324	4997286	Well, that's pretty cool.
4998323	5001446	Anyways, I'm sorry, I'm getting... LokiFound sounds so enthusiastic!
5001806	5005089	Hmm, little boy, sounds like fun!
5005109	5009013	Listen, okay, I wasn't really a huge fan of Fatal Fury.
5009273	5014718	I mean, I think I may have played it once at like a supermarket when they had those, you know, the Neo Geo with the four games on there.
5015194	5016115	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5045677	5046397	God damn it.
5047378	5055461	Okay, I don't know if these people were nominated, but it says Brain Age beat out cult hits like Guitar Hero and Oindun and Amp 3.
5057883	5061484	Dragon Quest VIII, Electroplankton, Indigo Prophecy, and Killer7.
5061544	5063465	Okay, here's my couple problems here.
5063725	5065226	Amp 3, first of all, is a sequel.
5066047	5066968	To a snowboarding game.
5067288	5070931	I mean, I guess cutscenes were kind of different, so I guess that would be something.
5071512	5073133	But it's a snowboarding game.
5073333	5073794	Come on.
5074094	5075455	And Dragon Quest, you know, 8?
5077677	5077957	I don't know.
5077977	5079338	Was that the original of the game?
5079458	5079879	But whatever.
5080119	5080980	Anyway, so it won.
5081280	5082100	So that's awesome.
5082781	5093270	And, you know, the comment here made by Nintendo UK General Manager David Yarton is, Only Nintendo could make arithmetic fun.
5096839	5106143	Well, we all know Konami made Dancing Fun, and DDR Supernova had its track list revealed earlier this week, and some controversial songs showing up in the game.
5106183	5111565	The fan community has their panties in a bunch that Fallout Boy is showing up with Dance Dance in the game.
5111985	5114546	But, you know, some old fan favorites are coming to the game.
5114786	5119768	Freckles, which you guys remember from DDR Max, and let's see, we also have some other songs.
5119808	5122610	Of course, Since You've Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson was already announced before.
5123070	5124030	I love this song.
5124070	5126191	If you haven't heard this song yet, you really should.
5126610	5129571	It's called The Other Side by Paul Van Dyke featuring Wayne Johnson.
5129591	5130291	That's a really good one.
5130752	5132772	Franz Ferdinand would do you want to.
5132853	5135714	Full song list is available over at orangelaunchradio.com.
5135794	5136514	Jamie, get this.
5137074	5138895	Battle without honor or humanity.
5139795	5140576	Waka Laka Raining Men
5167154	5168997	is in the game as well, some old fan favorites.
5169457	5173122	And some really good contemporary hits as well showing up in the game.
5173883	5177068	I know we had a Don't Ya by the Pussycat Dolls, a remix showing up there.
5177668	5180552	We had Free by Blue October, the Liberation mix.
5181193	5181293	And...
5182114	5192657	Juno Reactor with Masters of the Universe, Prodigy with No Good, Start the Dance, Oblivion by Never Rocka did that song.
5193057	5194838	I'm sorry, no, no, Real Life did Oblivion.
5194878	5195838	It was the Never Rocka mix.
5196038	5198039	Stray Cats with Rock This Town.
5198719	5199319	That's cool.
5199339	5200220	That is very cool.
5200680	5201520	And get this.
5201580	5202400	This is so cool.
5202920	5205881	I know you can appreciate this too, DarkSakura.
5206141	5208022	Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo.
5208042	5208102	Wow.
5210976	5211716	Isn't that cool?
5212357	5212877	I know.
5213718	5214078	I know.
5214498	5216519	Jamie has like her mouth wide, like jaw on floor.
5216919	5217219	I know.
5217419	5217900	What a cool.
5218200	5218640	Rad.
5219421	5221181	Ultramix 4 is made of awesome and win.
5221201	5224683	And we'll be playing some of these tracks that perhaps you have not heard yet.
5224703	5227185	I can't tell you which ones because then I'd be telling you what's on the viewer.
5227465	5231627	But pretty soon we're going to be playing some of these tracks here on Orange Launch Radio live.
5232307	5233268	Not during the podcast though.
5233308	5235089	See orangelaunchradio.com for the details.
5235789	5237070	That is pretty cool.
5237264	5245186	Well, speaking of other things that are cool, the cast of Family Guy has signed up to do Voices for a Game.
5246727	5251188	2K actually said that the entire cast was signed to do a game that's based on the series.
5251788	5256350	It's supposed to be out in the fall, and of course, since it's Family Guy, it will be based on the series.
5259091	5263995	I'm still... Given how some of the Simpsons games have looked out, I'm not sure.
5264656	5272982	But as it was described, you'll be able to switch back and forth between three characters, which is Peter Griffin, Stewie, and Brian.
5273503	5273723	Really?
5273743	5280168	Because I would have thought that you could have switched back and forth between the plot and really obscure pop culture references.
5281309	5281869	That's our show.
5282230	5285732	I think there's actually more characters than that, because I remember seeing a screenshot with...
5287549	5289671	Oh god, I'm drawing blanks now.
5290132	5292634	Their fucking neighbor, the guy with sex craze.
5292674	5293435	Yeah, I can't remember.
5293455	5294556	Chasing after the nurses.
5295657	5298160	I think that they're going to be characters you interact with.
5298861	5301683	Well, I'm not sure, but it's freaking sweet.
5302024	5304366	I know it's coming out actually in October.
5305307	5306128	October 18th.
5306929	5308190	So that's actually pretty sweet.
5309159	5311241	But, you know, to be honest though, the game didn't look that good.
5311562	5312823	I mean, really, it didn't look that good.
5313544	5323454	But, if that might not be the game for you, you may be a fan of, say, import games such like Disgaea, and I mentioned Disgaea 2 was actually coming out this coming week.
5324135	5328199	However, though, if you may want something a little bit more portable, well, fear not.
5329127	5337012	Well, if you live in Japan, at least, Disgaea 2, or Disgaea is actually heading to the PSP, so you can check that out.
5337433	5355345	It's actually set to release in Japan on November 30th, and they're going to be offering two packages, one for 4,800 yen, which will be the standard package, and 6,800 yen for a limited edition version, and they haven't really announced yet what's going to be coming out in the limited version, so...
5356508	5360969	Maybe an import, since the PSP is fully region-free.
5361609	5364510	Now, it's not uncommon for games to be remade for other systems.
5364890	5372592	So, one other interesting quote that has people buzzing this week regards GameCube games possibly being remade for the Wii.
5373132	5381014	A quote from Miyamoto in Nintendo Dream Magazine, quote, I'm also thinking I can remake some of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote.
5381554	5388919	Of course, you can wander into a second-hand shop and buy a lot of these games still, so I don't think we can release these Wii Makes at a full price.
5389500	5395044	Since a lot of the development cost has already been accounted for, we'd be able to release these at a much more affordable price.
5395384	5401868	And if others also take advantage of this and release Wii Makes, there's a high possibility of a lot of software from third parties as well.
5401888	5409253	Can you imagine if, say, for example, I don't know, maybe release Mario Kart Double Dash for the Wii...
5410034	5411055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5425134	5432822	But still, though, if they could release something, you know, say even just like some of the Luigi's Mansion or something would be perfect for the Wii.
5433342	5437686	Maybe something like that for like, you know, even 1999 would be pretty cool.
5438027	5441029	I actually think that game would be pretty cool with the Wii.
5442191	5446895	I would think they would probably do a sequel to Luigi's Mansion, more like first person or something.
5447115	5449097	Luigi's Mansion 2, the non-sucky version.
5449117	5449798	Yeah.
5450339	5451900	All right, well, we'll see what happens with that.
5453080	5462485	Speaking of things that don't suck, DarkSakura likes to surf the web up and down and back and forth every single week and find a website that she loves and adores that she wants to share with you, the listener.
5462825	5465586	We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week, and here it is.
5469848	5478772	Today's Website of the Week is... OtterPops.com Dude, Alexander the Grape!
5479433	5479793	I know!
5481056	5490762	Okay, when I was in middle school in the 80s, we could go by Otter Pops on Friday after P.E.
5491703	5497586	You realize that pretty much all Otter Pops are is like a double-strength Kool-Aid that's frozen?
5497806	5499127	I know, it's so good.
5499347	5502249	With those stupid little characters on them, like Alexander the Grape?
5502269	5503810	Dude, I love them.
5504010	5504670	I know, who doesn't?
5504710	5508733	But the site is pretty cool because it has music from the Otter Pop stars.
5509671	5512493	and you can meet the band and fun stuff.
5512513	5514114	You can actually get Otter Pop t-shirts.
5515075	5516536	I want to go on an Otter Pop diet.
5517876	5519718	Do you think I'd lose weight on an Otter Pop diet?
5519978	5520598	Actually, yes.
5521098	5524160	Could Sir Isaac Lime help me lose weight?
5524341	5527443	Keep in mind that I think an Otter Pop is, what, 100 calories?
5527903	5529264	For you to get...
5530100	5530861	Thanks for watching!
5558027	5560549	I want to have a flat ass like Loki, I need to go on the Otter Pop Diet
5583447	5601705	whatever, I don't have a flat ass I know, that's why I said the earth is as flat as your ass alright, um but no, Otter Pops especially the blue raspberry I really don't know how to do a segment and Otter Pops is all about Pudding Pops Pudding Pops are back!
5602950	5603470	Pudding Pops.
5603930	5605050	I miss Pudding Pops.
5605170	5609291	Look, I really don't know how to transition from Otter Pops to this, so I'm just going to say it.
5609611	5617953	Final Fantasy III came out in Japan, and basically it was sold out within 30 minutes of when shops opened for business there.
5618213	5623054	There were lines early in the morning going around the block waiting for this game.
5623094	5626735	It's a beloved game in the series, Final Fantasy III, so why are you smiling?
5627035	5630476	It sold out faster than an Otter Pop melting in the summer heat.
5632282	5633823	That's a good connection!
5652839	5657384	Yeah, people line up for all those movies and stuff, but you don't really have that same crate.
5657404	5659285	Well, I guess there was Xbox 360.
5659325	5660046	That was pretty nutty.
5660086	5661387	Wait for Halo 3.
5661688	5662629	Oh, Jesus.
5662749	5666593	On September 9th, 1999, I was in line for a Dreamcast.
5666713	5668014	With nine other people?
5668394	5668554	No.
5669415	5670356	Thank you for watching!
5690987	5692648	Dear Blizzard!
5718623	5720917	Please put Pandarins in the next expansion.
5721179	5722044	Love, Skye.
5722523	5722823	Thank you.
5723184	5723684	Hugs and kisses.
5724605	5727247	I almost quit World of Warcraft.
5749687	5751388	So Jamie's going to quit World of Warcraft.
5751408	5751949	Yeah, you know what?
5751989	5754531	Yeah, fuck Final Fantasy XI, Phantasy Star Universe for a little while for me.
5754551	5759234	And Phantasy Star Universe, no cost to you as far as online goes because it's going to be over live.
5759835	5761376	Oh, I love you, Sega.
5761876	5762296	Yay.
5762436	5764378	Sega is still our friend.
5764698	5765379	Oh, Sega.
5765919	5767180	At least I assume it's no cost.
5767340	5769962	I'm assuming because they have dedicated servers and stuff.
5770142	5773785	I could be wrong, but I'm assuming it's no cost because it's over live and stuff like that.
5774165	5775745	Actually, I think I'm going to go back to playing Blue Burst.
5775765	5776626	Don't hold me to that.
5777146	5777686	Alright, alright.
5777886	5779867	I think in the interim I am going to go back to playing Blue Burst.
5780647	5785468	But, um, yeah, I guess there is the PC version and they're not dedicated servers.
5785488	5791510	Thank you for the, again, because now when Miklatov tries to pressure me to go back to Final Fantasy XI, I'm just going to say, look, Phantasy Star, look, I can't, I can't.
5791550	5792750	You'll quit too when Phantasy Star comes out.
5792770	5793670	You'll have to go back to PS Opium.
5793890	5794631	At least for a month.
5796042	5799184	I can't wait to start the OL Army Guild on Phantasy Star Universe.
5799204	5800785	That's going to be tons of fun.
5800925	5804808	And if you want to join the OL Army on any, a variety of games, it's growing and growing.
5804828	5805789	It's going to be Saints Row.
5805809	5807189	I'm starting a gang in Saints Row.
5807350	5808991	Yeah, Saints Row is going to be fun as well.
5809991	5813173	And Saints Row is a game that I fucking own at, so you know what?
5813313	5813734	No.
5813754	5813974	I can't.
5813994	5814494	Them's fighting.
5814694	5818857	Oh, you're going to throw down the challenge to Scott and actually play this time?
5818977	5819638	Fuck that.
5819778	5824601	I'll do death matches by myself because I can guarantee that I will be there, but I can't guarantee a team...
5825021	5825702	Thanks for watching!
5844975	5845155	RoboTron
5872797	5873998	is the thought here.
5874158	5877459	And that comes from actually Xbox 365.
5877999	5880440	So I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks.
5881481	5883061	Now here's something very interesting.
5883222	5889444	If you pre-order Elebits, one of the fun little prizes that you're going to get is a stuffed Elebit.
5890325	5892025	So a little plushy thing for you.
5894656	5900601	Yeah, that was pretty much my... Oh, I wanted to mention real quick, actually, I got a few more, I forgot.
5900821	5904584	Crackdown, that game's going to be coming out, actually, November 1st.
5905405	5910329	And they've got some pretty cool stuff that they're going to be offering as downloadable content.
5910949	5916234	One thing that they're talking about is an instant replay, kind of...
5917765	5918325	Thank you for watching!
5933850	5936913	and because they built the game with that kind of stuff in mind.
5937974	5956749	Some other things, if you aren't getting cracked down and happen to pick up a box of cereal, Kellogg's is packing some really crappy Xbox minigames that you can check out, including Spaceship Blaster, Motorcycle Madness, Disco Mania, Robo Blast, and Mystic Castle, which I'm sure...
5957219	5958040	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5972572	5992807	including, of course, Richard Lotax from Something Awful, and Cool News writer Jeff Snyder, Horror Magazine, Rue Morgue writer Chris Alexander, and a fifth opponent who, it says, and this is from GameSpot, has a reason to believe is a minor.
5993328	5995169	So, Uwe Boll is beating up children.
5995389	5995909	Excellent.
5997411	5998171	Still a loser.
5999052	5999112	Um,
6000293	6002595	Now, I actually have a couple of stories.
6002875	6011121	As they applied to our European listeners, Microsoft actually cut the Xbox 360 core unit to 199 pounds.
6013283	6015024	Oh, nice.
6015444	6016285	Nice.
6017246	6019608	That actually was effective as of today.
6020108	6021509	I should say yesterday.
6021529	6022610	10 pounds lighter.
6023711	6024371	It's on a diet.
6024571	6025332	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
6026779	6031022	So yeah, they've dropped the retail price so that it would sell a little bit better, I suppose.
6031983	6036927	Also, I believe that I read this right, is that Eurogamer.de has launched.
6039049	6044313	So for our German friends, there's some good info there.
6044333	6047956	They actually have pictures of Silent Hill Origins up there as well.
6048456	6051799	Unfortunately, I can read German, but I do not understand it.
6052780	6054181	I know what an estet is, though.
6055618	6064379	The little B thing, it goes... But I took German for three weeks and then had to change classes.
6066341	6069964	I have one last piece of news, and it's actually regarding Phantasy Star Universe.
6070004	6070865	It's coming from the chat room.
6071846	6075168	John F. is in chat right now, and he's like a guru on Phantasy Star Universe.
6075849	6077070	He's saying about the pricing.
6077530	6078731	It's unknown right now about the 360.
6079152	6083275	It's rumored that Sega's trying to work it out with Microsoft right now on the pricing.
6083555	6089721	There will be a monthly payment for the PS2 and Windows version, but if you just want to play story mode and extra mode, there's no fee there.
6090301	6091202	So, just an FYI.
6091222	6094845	That was actually how PSO was, though, on Xbox.
6095693	6099654	Until their billing messed up and a lot of people got their accounts for free.
6099694	6100074	Very cool.
6100954	6105776	Actually, Kasumi19, Julie, she didn't pay for PSO for three years.
6106216	6107696	Nice.
6108756	6110837	Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
6111117	6111957	That's going to do it.
6111997	6113638	Remember, no Part B this week, folks.
6113938	6115578	It's a mini-episode because we're pre-taping.
6115618	6118099	We will see you back here with a full episode next week, though.
6118119	6118939	It should be a fun time.
6118979	6120119	Power previews start next week.
6120139	6120679	It's going to be fun.
6121099	6121940	Loki, final thought.
6122060	6123560	I've got to play lots of Saints Row this weekend.
6124882	6127863	My final thought is I need to hurry up and schedule my next Street Fighter 2 match.
6128084	6131245	I forgot I was in that tournament until like two seconds ago when Arcade came up.
6131725	6132686	DarkSakura, your final thought.
6132926	6138008	I've been telling everybody give me money for Christmas so that I can buy a premium annual pass for Disneyland.
6139128	6139389	Alright.
6139489	6140889	That's what I want for Christmas from everybody.
6141469	6141730	Alright.
6141930	6142930	We'll see if she gets it.
6143590	6144291	Till next time.
6144331	6145251	And reject false icons.
6145731	6146412	Till next time.
6146512	6148773	Thank you guys so much for downloading us and tuning in to us.
6149093	6152114	We really appreciate you guys listening to us and supporting Independent Radio.
6152134	6153035	You guys are awesome.
6153055	6154055	See you next time.
6154551	6158252	Stay great throughout the week and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
