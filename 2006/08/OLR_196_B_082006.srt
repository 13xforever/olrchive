[SPEAKER_08]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:19,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:25,275
[SPEAKER_09]: This is episode number 196 for this, August the 20th of 2006.

6
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:29,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're in part B of our podcast.

7
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for downloading us on iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo Podcast or whatever podcast program you decided to use to check us out.

8
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:38,343
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.

9
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:42,666
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supporting independent radio and that is quite awesome.

10
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:43,647
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys very much.

11
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:48,010
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here to celebrate the gamer lifestyle and gaming culture.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:01:12,022
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know anybody can just repeat what you read on gamer blogs but you know when it's real people and real gamers been doing this for a while talking about it we like to think it puts a different angle on everything so thank you guys for checking us out so we're gonna get right back into the news and kind of along with independent gaming I guess this kind of fits into that whole thing doesn't it Loki exactly because if you want to make an independent game and have it on live then you're in luck

13
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:17,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft is actually releasing a new package called XNA that will help you do that.

14
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:25,951
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be some development tools and libraries to help develop a game and actually eventually get it onto live arcade or something like that.

15
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,872
[SPEAKER_07]: It is going to cost you though to get it actually onto live and all that stuff.

16
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: $99 I believe.

17
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:38,475
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can develop it free and at least be able to upload it to your own Xbox or whatever.

18
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:38,975
[SPEAKER_07]: But

19
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:40,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it should be pretty cool.

20
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:51,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Details on it are a bit scarce right now, but they are going to be adding some info coming up in the next couple weeks here when it actually launches.

21
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's actually pretty cool though.

22
00:01:54,222 --> 00:02:08,431
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, like I said, the $99 subscription or whatever per year allows you to become part of this Creators Club, which will offer you downloadable samples of games to help you get your stuff created.

23
00:02:08,572 --> 00:02:08,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, um,

24
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:11,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

25
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,803
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is a neat idea.

26
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:41,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I really like the idea of, you know, some of these games that we see created could graduate to Xbox Live, essentially, and really buff up the Xbox Live community.

27
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:48,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's kind of a smart response, in a way, to Nintendo's Virtual Console, which will have many, many, many games on it to start.

28
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,254
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a way for Xbox Live Arcade to sort of buff up, so to speak.

29
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:58,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And this also says that they're going to... The subscription also gets you a copy of the runtime libraries for...

30
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:01,730
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why some people like it

31
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:25,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Well said.

32
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:32,683
[SPEAKER_09]: BlackWolf says, you can't send a game you wrote for the 360, send to someone who does not pay that $99 a year.

33
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:41,872
[SPEAKER_09]: True, but hypothetically, games made with this, what I was saying is that games made with this could, like the cream of the crop, could graduate to regular Xbox 360, right?

34
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:42,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

35
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,794
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the idea, I hope.

36
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:44,975
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be kind of neat.

37
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,997
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that's kind of what they're hoping for, at least.

38
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:48,478
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

39
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:49,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Devil May Cry, Sins Remembered

40
00:04:16,296 --> 00:04:24,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Evil Unleashed is a gaming site that has an interview with the director in which he talks about how it's been challenging to bring Devil May Cry to the screen.

41
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:32,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, did not want to see a film that was completely from their own writers as it would not be a pure representation of what I could offer them as a filmmaker.

42
00:04:33,586 --> 00:04:39,190
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only going to be a 50 minute picture and it's basically kind of being used to sort of promote R.L.

43
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Scott as a filmmaker, but hey, it's Devil May Cry.

44
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:43,953
[SPEAKER_09]: He has worked on some other...

45
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:50,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Hollywood Productions as well, including The Legend of Bagger Vance and Underworld.

46
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:51,787
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

47
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: He's going to be using this promo to try and sell a full-length feature called Devil Hunter.

48
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see how good this movie actually is.

49
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:00,674
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like it's going to be shown at DragonCon.

50
00:05:00,694 --> 00:05:02,615
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be interesting for those of you folks that are attending.

51
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:08,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand our good buddy Bobby Blackwell is actually going to be on a podcasting panel there, kind of similar to what we did at Fonamay.

52
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the whole thing is airing on all games.

53
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:13,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So check that out, a little closer to DragonCon.

54
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:15,185
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty cool.

55
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:42,778
[SPEAKER_07]: and especially if you're looking for the game movies probably the biggest game movie you're going to be looking for forward to I should say well maybe not the biggest game movie there is going to be a Hitman movie script that's actually leaked out and Latino Review of course the usual suspect for reviewing those types of scripts since they actually reviewed I think the Halo 3 script maybe I can't remember I know they've gotten their hands on like Transformers and stuff but anyways

56
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:49,075
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a review of the Hitman script, and they said that it's actually going to be pretty good as far as the movie goes.

57
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:59,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether this is going to be one of the better adaptations out there right now, of course, I think the mark's going to be set by Halo 3, whenever the hell that gets out.

58
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:03,424
[SPEAKER_07]: The mark will definitely not be set by Dead or Alive, the movie, because that's going to suck.

59
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:04,925
[SPEAKER_07]: But lots of TNA, I hope.

60
00:06:06,206 --> 00:06:11,689
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, moving on, we've got some stuff for Chromehounds.

61
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

62
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:49,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you can actually go to the online store in Chromehounds once you've purchased them and buy an infinite amount of them.

63
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:54,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really played enough Chromehounds to really tell, so why don't you answer that question because you've actually played Chromehounds.

64
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:57,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it going to be worth the points?

65
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:58,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

66
00:06:58,354 --> 00:07:10,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think 100 points for all of them would be good, but it's like 160 points for each one, and there's about, you know... Well, if people buy horse armor, I mean...

67
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:12,845
[SPEAKER_09]: There's gonna be somebody that buys this.

68
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:13,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what, though?

69
00:07:14,366 --> 00:07:19,609
[SPEAKER_07]: A horse armor's... I don't know, unless you're really hardcore in the armored core, then maybe.

70
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:24,812
[SPEAKER_07]: But the only thing I don't like about it is you don't really know what the parts are until you actually buy them.

71
00:07:25,352 --> 00:07:27,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you don't know what the stats are on them.

72
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:28,154
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little different.

73
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:34,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's kind of one thing that, you know, maybe the PlayStation 3 will have an advantage of over, like, say, the marketplace...

74
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:43,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And on live right now, you actually get to see, you know, say if you're going to purchase tracks or whatever, you can see it in the game and see the specs for it.

75
00:07:43,613 --> 00:07:51,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Then use your Microsoft points to buy, you know, well, Sony points, whatever you're going to call them, to buy those items.

76
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas this, it's kind of like Light Arms 1.

77
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm, well, what the hell is that, you know, so.

78
00:07:58,513 --> 00:07:59,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll probably buy them.

79
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:01,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm a sucker for that crap.

80
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:31,212
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't too much of a surprise when you consider we had a story about six months ago or so when Guitar Hero was first getting big that said they wanted to do a variety of sequels to Guitar Hero.

81
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:32,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

82
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this going to be oversaturation?

83
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:37,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if they'll make a sequel and the game will actually be good.

84
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,317
[SPEAKER_09]: You're like the one person that doesn't like Guitar Hero.

85
00:08:40,357 --> 00:08:41,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you like Guitar Hero?

86
00:08:41,658 --> 00:08:43,699
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fun and I hate the music.

87
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,080
[SPEAKER_09]: But you like Guitar Freaks, right?

88
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I like it just a little more, which means I still don't like it.

89
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh.

90
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to ask, I had to ask.

91
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:14,798
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they need the hat.

92
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:16,118
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have Madonna Hero.

93
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody in the chatroom agrees with me.

94
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Saikun says Guitar Hero blows.

95
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,681
[SPEAKER_10]: That's two people.

96
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:26,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure that there is going to be a backlash against Guitar Hero because of the uber popularity the game has had.

97
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:29,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Guitar Hero.

98
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:30,626
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great game.

99
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,789
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that ruffles my feathers is when people say it's this original new concept that's never been done before.

100
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That bugs me too.

101
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:40,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Or when people say that Beatmania was a copy of Guitar Hero.

102
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:42,212
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, uh, no.

103
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:48,338
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say it before, I'll say it again Guitar Hero made music games like that accessible

104
00:09:48,868 --> 00:09:49,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

105
00:09:49,468 --> 00:09:50,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Made it mainstream.

106
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,089
[SPEAKER_06]: That's absolutely right.

107
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there are the people who are going to hate it because they're into you now because it made it into mainstream.

108
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:02,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Sad but true, it's a game where people are going to look at it and they're not inclined to go, that's gay.

109
00:10:02,974 --> 00:10:11,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, when people are playing DDR, you have the, you know, stupid a-holes that walk by the machine and look at the people playing DDR and go, that's gay.

110
00:10:11,097 --> 00:10:15,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet, for some reason, playing a plastic guitar in the middle of your living room is not gay.

111
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:18,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's funny because we have one of my...

112
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Boss is at work.

113
00:10:19,901 --> 00:10:20,722
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a guitarist.

114
00:10:21,342 --> 00:10:32,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we did the interview with the local news station here, and I got a copy of the game finally, I showed him it, and he's all pretty much, that's gay.

115
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:36,055
[SPEAKER_07]: It kind of is funny when you think about it.

116
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:37,055
[SPEAKER_07]: He's all, that's crap.

117
00:10:38,056 --> 00:10:38,957
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a real guitar.

118
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:39,738
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a toy.

119
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,121
[SPEAKER_09]: How about with all these Guitar Hero sequels, we get Guitar Hero gay?

120
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,043
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, SingStar did it, right?

121
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

122
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:51,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We already have Karaoke Revolution for that.

123
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,275
[SPEAKER_06]: The Karaoke Revolution is cool!

124
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,718
[SPEAKER_10]: And they have the country one, which would totally not be gay.

125
00:10:56,878 --> 00:11:01,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Karaoke Revolution American Idol, I don't know, sounds pretty gay to me.

126
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:03,005
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know the song list.

127
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:24,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm assuming the song list is probably... Since it is licensed through American Idol, I'm assuming we've got Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia, Ruben... You can assume all you want, but just hold your reservations.

128
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:25,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fine.

129
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll hold my reservations for a few more days, and then... Once it gets fully announced with the song list, then you can say...

130
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:34,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's a terrible game.

131
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I say, but until then, you're not allowed to say that.

132
00:11:40,104 --> 00:11:42,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Harry K. Ames sums it up very well in our chatroom.

133
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:44,488
[SPEAKER_09]: People who use gay as an insult are gay.

134
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:47,951
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't use it as an insult.

135
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:49,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob probably does.

136
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:51,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

137
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:52,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Loser.

138
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:55,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine, but now I want to be like, that's homosexual.

139
00:11:56,943 --> 00:11:59,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you're from the Midwest.

140
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:00,508
[SPEAKER_09]: But gay, no, look, look.

141
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay means two things.

142
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:10,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay means happy and gay means likes to, is a man that likes to date other men or a woman who likes to date other women.

143
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,502
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a dual meaning thing.

144
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:12,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you know what?

145
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,646
[SPEAKER_10]: This is off topic, so why don't you get back on topic?

146
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:15,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

147
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,867
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, one thing that is definitely not gay is Epix.

148
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:21,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember Epix?

149
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:24,388
[SPEAKER_09]: They were a big company on the Commodore 64.

150
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,429
[SPEAKER_09]: No, okay, how about Impossible Mission?

151
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know any of these games.

152
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,530
[SPEAKER_09]: California Games?

153
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember California Games.

154
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:31,671
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go, thank you.

155
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:35,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, look, Epix has been dormant for a long, long time.

156
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:48,065
[SPEAKER_09]: System 3 is the development house that changed its name to Studio 3 and then back to System 3, and they are bringing back the Epyx name as well as Epyx Games.

157
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:55,012
[SPEAKER_09]: In January, System 3 is going to release Impossible Mission for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS.

158
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:58,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay a while, stay forever!

159
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,001
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've ever played Impossible Mission, you'll get that.

160
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh god, that was my favorite Commodore 64 game.

161
00:13:06,623 --> 00:13:10,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my, yes, that's what that does for me, is nostalgia squee all over, definitely.

162
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:17,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it's better than the Impossible Mission 2 that was on the Genesis, I think?

163
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:18,289
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty bad.

164
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:19,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pretty bad translation.

165
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, there's also going to be California Games coming to both systems in May.

166
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,094
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't be remakes of the original titles.

167
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:30,834
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't be 3D either.

168
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:37,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Quote, you gotta keep the gameplay mechanics the same or else it ceases to be the original game and you're only using the game brand to sell games.

169
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:41,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It ceases to be Impossible Mission or California Games or what have you.

170
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:46,663
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're doing is we're incorporating the original gameplay and mechanics and bringing the gameplay up to date.

171
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:47,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this guy.

172
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I like this guy.

173
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:52,607
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not update a game like you update, say, NARC.

174
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:54,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That isn't the way you do it.

175
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't put Bill Bellamy in anything.

176
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,739
[SPEAKER_09]: This guy has got it.

177
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:01,160
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they produce.

178
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,000
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

179
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,341
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to write him a letter and try to get him on the show.

180
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,002
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to talk to this guy.

181
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:05,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the way he thinks.

182
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:11,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I'm kind of on a completely different subject.

183
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:16,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking of updating things, the Phantom console is back.

184
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,930
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually going to be re-emerging the console as a PC download service.

185
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,564
[SPEAKER_07]: and, um, yeah.

186
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll actually be able to, um, download Phantom games to your PC.

187
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Which it was anyways.

188
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was basically a PC.

189
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Will they disappear as soon as I download them?

190
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:35,754
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

191
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:41,339
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there's official relaunts going on over at the website, phantom.net.

192
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

193
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:44,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we care?

194
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:53,016
[SPEAKER_10]: You gotta give these guys credit because they just keep trying and trying and eventually something will happen.

195
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:54,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Shane, what have they done?

196
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,423
[SPEAKER_10]: They've tried.

197
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,224
[SPEAKER_09]: They had a fun little booth at E3.

198
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:00,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I really liked their booth at E3.

199
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:01,985
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a nice booth to sit in.

200
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:07,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, literally, I could have set money on fire, and that would have been fun, too.

201
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:09,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But you wouldn't want to sit on that.

202
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:17,650
[SPEAKER_07]: They have an interesting little Flash video, and I might add, they probably spent more time on the Flash video than they did the actual, I don't know, Phantom.

203
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I don't know how to spin this a nice way.

204
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:24,496
[SPEAKER_09]: What have they done that I can touch and play with?

205
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're obviously not good people.

206
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can touch and play with the Phantom Lapboard.

207
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, no, no, no.

208
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:31,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying the reverse.

209
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't blame the people.

210
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:37,687
[SPEAKER_09]: I blame the management behind this whole thing and the marketing, obviously.

211
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:38,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some poor-ass decisions were made.

212
00:15:38,928 --> 00:15:42,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it's nice that they think that somebody still cares and they're still trying...

213
00:15:43,172 --> 00:15:43,773
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, though?

214
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:56,627
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested in checking out The Phantom, you can either check it out in Germany next week during Leipzig, or you can check it out at Digital Life coming October 12th through the 15th.

215
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Blackwolf says they should put out a game called Phantom Vision.

216
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:04,756
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't play that.

217
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:15,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what it boils down to is they can't make vaporware systems anymore, so they're just going to offer vaporware over the internet, stuff that's never going to ever be released.

218
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:22,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look, if anyone from Phantom is listening and thinking we're giving you guys a bad rap, seriously, you are cordially invited to come on the show and defend yourself.

219
00:16:22,337 --> 00:16:23,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, I got it, I got it.

220
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Freedom of speech.

221
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:25,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't matter.

222
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,642
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to release Duke Nukem Forever on Phantom Online.

223
00:16:30,543 --> 00:16:31,163
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be hilarious.

224
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:42,465
[SPEAKER_10]: They might be trying to put out something eventually, but you still give them credit for putting money into something that's not going to work.

225
00:16:42,686 --> 00:16:45,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I like DJ Jani's thought in chat here.

226
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Fast and the Furious, Oregon Trail Drift Remix.

227
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:51,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's a Phantom game that's going to come out.

228
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:58,429
[SPEAKER_10]: If they released something that had an organ trail in it, you know it would sell like 20 copies to the people that still care.

229
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Wang Gang Midnight Organ Trail Tune.

230
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, look, Phantom, you're not alone in taking a lot of heat for being a console.

231
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:07,293
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation 3.

232
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:09,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Some more news about the PlayStation 3.

233
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:18,897
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a report that was released this week that basically said, quote, By the time third-generation consoles reach market maturity in 2011...

234
00:17:20,598 --> 00:17:23,141
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation 3 will once again be the market leader.

235
00:17:23,762 --> 00:17:25,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, I wish I could be an analyst.

236
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I get paid to talk out of my ass.

237
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:29,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, maybe.

238
00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:30,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

239
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe, but based on what's there right now, I don't see it happening.

240
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,917
[SPEAKER_06]: According to the nation, you talk out of your ass for free.

241
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this going to take them to 2011?

242
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:41,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

243
00:17:42,204 --> 00:17:53,026
[SPEAKER_09]: But by then we'll all be rich, and that's why... Another thing that should be noted, PlayStation 3s have still not gone into production, and we're not that far away from the launch date.

244
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:58,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we get further and further out here, shortages become more and more likely.

245
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:01,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I love that.

246
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,068
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 3 will dominate it all.

247
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, we haven't started making them yet.

248
00:18:07,489 --> 00:18:08,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't worry.

249
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:09,709
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll stay up late.

250
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,300
[SPEAKER_07]: The Night Before.

251
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,221
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get them all then.

252
00:18:44,712 --> 00:18:47,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to start off tonight since DarkSakura isn't here.

253
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:57,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to give an F you to my bad grammar skills and give a big giant F you to Loki for making fun of them and laughing in my ear which throws me off even further.

254
00:18:57,723 --> 00:18:58,383
[SPEAKER_09]: You dick.

255
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Shane's a dick too and he likes Fantavision.

256
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:03,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's a bad thing.

257
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:05,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your F you's of the week.

258
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:11,154
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to stupid people who can't fucking pull up to the goddamn stoplight or the line.

259
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,936
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen people with like six car lengths

260
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:17,188
[SPEAKER_07]: before the stop sign or stoplight or whatever.

261
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:18,669
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just stopped there.

262
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking on their cell phones, of course, because they're jackasses and not paying attention to where they need to be.

263
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:31,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the people that drive in the goddamn bike lane because they're not paying attention or driving over the lanes and all over the place.

264
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,921
[SPEAKER_07]: They should really ban cell phone use while driving.

265
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Nico Tavi.

266
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I got two FUs for short.

267
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:44,812
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to eating rabbit, because rabbit actually ended up not tasting that great.

268
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:46,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I was very disappointed.

269
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:51,717
[SPEAKER_10]: However, lamb is... Lamb is worse than rabbit, so... Lamb.

270
00:19:52,418 --> 00:19:56,902
[SPEAKER_10]: It tastes like dirty meat, and I actually like my meat not...

271
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, what is your other FU, Mr. Jumping Flash is the best game ever?

272
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,483
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the best game ever, it's just really far up there.

273
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:12,607
[SPEAKER_10]: My other FU goes to myself for not learning a certain Taco Bell employee's work schedule so I can stalk him effectively.

274
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:16,469
[SPEAKER_10]: FU to the fact he's probably under 18 and this is all being documented.

275
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:17,649
[SPEAKER_10]: He's so not under 18.

276
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,451
[SPEAKER_10]: And if he is, I can delete this.

277
00:20:25,028 --> 00:20:26,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Drew, you're FU.

278
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:33,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, FU to having a clean house, kind of a realization that, yeah, he does the forest pretty well, but Mr. Clean's a dick.

279
00:20:34,472 --> 00:20:37,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Parks off all the allergies I ever had and some I didn't know I had.

280
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:44,256
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to obligatory stupid drivers, especially in the country called Lanes area.

281
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:46,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Learn how to fucking park, would ya?

282
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:51,719
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to get in, out, no fucking about, and these people are just blocking the driveway.

283
00:20:53,217 --> 00:20:54,018
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

284
00:20:54,618 --> 00:20:55,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

285
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:03,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, speaking of stupid, there's a stupid idea going around on Kotaku here.

286
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:07,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently people have been emailing them saying, Hey!

287
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:10,190
[SPEAKER_07]: You know that awesome movie, Snakes on a Plane?

288
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there going to be a video game?

289
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:12,132
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

290
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:13,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's not.

291
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:15,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, well, why the hell not?

292
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:17,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So they propose that

293
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:33,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I'm like the only person my age who hasn't seen Snakes on a Plane yet I haven't seen it No You two are lame, go see it Why?

294
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:43,017
[SPEAKER_10]: If I was ten years older and closer to your age Which is a lie, you are not that much younger than me, I'm sorry to say I would still not go see it, I am too No you're not How old are you?

295
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Old enough to be 10 years younger than you.

296
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:50,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you would be 18, and it would be okay for you to be stalking the...

297
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:54,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Taco Bell guy who's probably not an agent.

298
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:55,469
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I've been saying.

299
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

300
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew, you actually saw the movie, right?

301
00:21:58,411 --> 00:21:58,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I saw the movie.

302
00:21:58,831 --> 00:21:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it worth the hype?

303
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,492
[SPEAKER_09]: It kicked ass.

304
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

305
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

306
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:06,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at that point where I'm like, I feel like Snakes on a Plane jumped the shark before it ever came out.

307
00:22:06,176 --> 00:22:15,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It lived up to the hype in the sense that we knew it was going to be cheesy, we knew it was going to be a bad movie, but it has the Rocky horror appeal.

308
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:17,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's best when it's seen in a theater.

309
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:19,586
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have the audience participation.

310
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,168
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to have the audience participation.

311
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it a try, but see, now I'm worried that I missed opening weekend because no one will go see it with me, that I'm going to just kind of miss out on everything.

312
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:44,246
[SPEAKER_09]: You threw snakes?

313
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:47,568
[SPEAKER_09]: You went with some of the Something Awful kids?

314
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I went with a pair of goons.

315
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:54,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We had rubber snakes around our necks at random points.

316
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,552
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just throwing snakes down into the crowd, and the people were enjoying it.

317
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:02,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone was heckling and riffing and throwing the snakes back and forth.

318
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:09,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time, but the movie itself will probably just lose its appeal when it's not in a theater.

319
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:13,891
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what movie was underappreciated for audience participation value?

320
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:15,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Showgirls.

321
00:23:16,794 --> 00:23:17,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely frightening.

322
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up.

323
00:23:21,258 --> 00:23:22,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty funny.

324
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:23,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Showgirls.

325
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to something that...

326
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,091
[SPEAKER_09]: could be only popular as a cult phenomenon.

327
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:32,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The PlayStation 3, oh, we're so, we pick on them so much, I feel bad.

328
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I really tried not, I tried to find positive stories.

329
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:36,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, I do too.

330
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:38,819
[SPEAKER_09]: But then they go and say we're not making it.

331
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:54,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is, I mean, okay, so the PlayStation 3 hasn't gone into development yet, but what happened recently is Sega had a PlayStation 3 day, and there was a demo of Full Auto 2 Battle Lines, and IGN got to take a peek at this, and basically, to make a long story short, you know, obviously the dev kits are there,

332
00:23:55,673 --> 00:24:20,790
[SPEAKER_09]: The controller was smart enough to realize what system and what player it's connected to And the PlayStation Network appears to be up and running at this time So the PlayStation Network platform appears to be up and running Because these folks were demoing the game on there And so the developers were able to use it So something's ready So I guess that's a good sign Full Auto 2 wasn't bad I remember playing it at E3, it wasn't bad I like Full Auto It was okay

333
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was okay.

334
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:23,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

335
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:28,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of think there'll be other driving games that'll make me go, wow, a little more, but... Like, uh... Never mind.

336
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:28,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

337
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:29,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Like...

338
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:31,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say it.

339
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God I'm not going to say it.

340
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:34,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish they could do like a Mario Kart.

341
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:43,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean it's inevitable we'll have a Mario Kart on the Wii, but like a Mario Kart in like super high def 720 and all that because obviously the Wii is not going to support that.

342
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:45,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to see a very pretty Mario Kart.

343
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:48,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get in contact with Square and have them do Rad Racer 3.

344
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,936
[SPEAKER_09]: How about Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation?

345
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocobo Racing 2 on the PlayStation 3.

346
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:53,517
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'd like to see.

347
00:24:53,677 --> 00:24:54,078
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd work.

348
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:54,638
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

349
00:24:55,178 --> 00:24:55,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine by me.

350
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:56,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We can agree on that.

351
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:57,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of the Wii.

352
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:57,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

353
00:24:57,972 --> 00:25:14,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking about the Wii and online, kind of the repeat of something we were talking about earlier with Reggie, and talking about how the online service is going to be free, and basically kind of enhancing the way you're going to be playing games, which, you know, you've probably already been doing that on Xbox Live.

354
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:24,786
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's basically, it's going to be massive amounts of hands-on activity, as well as showcasing exactly how the Wii games are different.

355
00:25:24,806 --> 00:25:25,707
[SPEAKER_07]: They're talking about the...

356
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: of course their brand new games and how they're going to market them and stuff and of course we're going to create advocacy and we're going to make it so that everyone who tries the Wii experience talks to their friends and neighbors so of course they're going to do that because they're not showing it to the press they're showing it to secret parties of ravers laughing

357
00:25:51,164 --> 00:25:54,845
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get my pacifier and candy bracelets ready for the Wii bus to come by.

358
00:25:54,885 --> 00:25:57,325
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but their online service is going to be okay.

359
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:58,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get my Darude CD.

360
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the... I mean, here's the thing, too.

361
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:15,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you look about it, the DS Wi-Fi Connect service, you know, we hear people talking about that and stuff, but we forget that PSP actually has their infrastructure mode that, you know, is Wi-Fi online, too.

362
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,671
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, you don't really see them pushing that very much, which I find very interesting.

363
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:30,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony's not even trying to say, hey, by the way, our games are also connected over the internet as well, but they don't really have a service provided.

364
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they actually use Sony's servers or anything.

365
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:34,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of like the PlayStation 2 does.

366
00:26:35,941 --> 00:26:36,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought that was interesting.

367
00:26:38,144 --> 00:26:38,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

368
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Star Trek Legacy

369
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:00,284
[SPEAKER_09]: E3, E3, E3, E3

370
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:26,345
[SPEAKER_09]: They are trying to encapsulate everything.

371
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:35,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's basically a ship strategic command fighting game, which I think a lot of people are going to be really into, especially the Star Trek kind of fans.

372
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:36,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that kind of is a natural fit.

373
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:41,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And in seeing the early demo, it looks really, really good.

374
00:27:41,816 --> 00:27:43,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The game graphically is really well.

375
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:45,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kind of thought it was cool what they did in the demo.

376
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was all real time when they did it.

377
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,764
[SPEAKER_09]: They kind of duplicated the big fight from the end of Star Trek II, Wrath of Khan.

378
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:53,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Rayhound

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,823
[SPEAKER_07]: RayHound is actually pretty cool.

380
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:30,705
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually don't shoot any weapons in this game.

381
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:40,171
[SPEAKER_07]: What you have is these turrets that are shooting at you, these lasers, and you can pull up a shield that causes the laser to spin around you in an orbital fashion.

382
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:45,814
[SPEAKER_07]: You use that to throw the lasers back into the actual turrets themselves.

383
00:28:46,275 --> 00:28:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Each level, as it progresses, more and more turrets are on the screen and it gets more crazy.

384
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:56,147
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's the kind of simple gameplay that's fun, and what's great is you can actually download it for free.

385
00:28:56,707 --> 00:29:02,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what you need to do is definitely check out the game, because I did, and it's awesome.

386
00:29:02,428 --> 00:29:16,191
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find it at www.18.big.or.jp, and then the little ampersand symbol, hikoza.prod, and then

387
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:18,425
[SPEAKER_07]: That should pull it up for you.

388
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:22,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just basically search for Warning Forever and Rayhound and you'll find it in any search engine.

389
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:24,561
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's pretty sweet.

390
00:29:24,982 --> 00:29:25,884
[SPEAKER_07]: So check it out.

391
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Beat the Host

392
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,379
[SPEAKER_09]: with a stick.

393
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll play.

394
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,800
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to take a caller.

395
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,261
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because tonight you and Miklatov count as hosts.

396
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:00,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might get beaten with a stick.

397
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:04,124
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's go to the phones and get a caller for tonight's game.

398
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:05,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

399
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:06,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

400
00:30:06,645 --> 00:30:07,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, I got picked.

401
00:30:08,046 --> 00:30:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is this?

402
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:10,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's Dolphin!

403
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,968
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Raven's Dolphin!

404
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:12,948
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing tonight?

405
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:14,509
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing fine.

406
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, now... Sounds really fine.

407
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's happy he got pictures.

408
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:19,772
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to be a fun game.

409
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:25,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's Dolphin, how would you say your knowledge is on old school video games?

410
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:29,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Nintendo to NES, I guess.

411
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:30,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess pretty good.

412
00:30:30,257 --> 00:30:39,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, would you be willing to challenge one of our hosts tonight in exactly who's got more skill in identifying songs from old school video games?

413
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:40,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, you know you want to throw down.

414
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I'll try.

415
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure I know old school video games.

416
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Raven's Dolphin, there's three people you can challenge tonight.

417
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:53,757
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't challenge me because I wrote the damn thing, but you can challenge Drunami, Miklatov, or Loki.

418
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:54,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's it going to be?

419
00:30:55,117 --> 00:30:58,460
[SPEAKER_09]: RavensDolphin, I have to ask you to leave our chat room.

420
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I see you logged in there right now.

421
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:03,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I'm just going to go ahead and kick you from chat because we can't have them helping you out.

422
00:31:03,484 --> 00:31:05,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kicking both those names from chat right now.

423
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you ready to play?

424
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:24,453
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not yet.

425
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:26,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I still haven't closed the chat client yet.

426
00:31:38,268 --> 00:31:39,128
[SPEAKER_09]: 8-Bit Video Games

427
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:58,623
[SPEAKER_09]: and whoever gets more wins.

428
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:08,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you actually win tonight's game, we will let you do something very special in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio regarding the DDR premieres we announced earlier this evening, alright?

429
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:10,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

430
00:32:10,494 --> 00:32:10,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Sound good?

431
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:12,707
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll try my best.

432
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't guarantee anything.

433
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well try your best.

434
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:16,190
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we can ask.

435
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, chat room, feel free to play along.

436
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:23,976
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys will actually get to hear this twice because you'll get to hear it again when Loki comes back and folks playing on the podcast as well.

437
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:28,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of folks out there that I know think they could do really well on this, so see how well you do.

438
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you ready, Raven's Dolphin?

439
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get to hear it once.

440
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:32,003
[SPEAKER_09]: You ready?

441
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:33,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

442
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:34,048
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Raven's Dolphin, you have 30 seconds to name back 10 games.

443
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:34,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Go.

444
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid.

445
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:37,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:38,152
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight Club.

447
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:38,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant fight.

448
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Punch Out.

449
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:40,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Punch Out.

450
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:40,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

451
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:40,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario 3.

452
00:33:41,495 --> 00:33:41,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

453
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:42,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice Climber.

454
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:43,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

455
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:44,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy.

456
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:45,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

457
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:48,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the other ones.

458
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:52,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say Excitebite, but I'm sure that's wrong.

459
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:53,645
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

460
00:33:57,006 --> 00:33:59,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure heard, what was it?

461
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget.

462
00:34:00,108 --> 00:34:00,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you.

463
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:03,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Five seconds.

464
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:04,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I forget.

465
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:05,991
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

466
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:06,831
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, time's up.

467
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:08,292
[SPEAKER_09]: You got five out of ten.

468
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:08,972
[SPEAKER_09]: You got half of them.

469
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:09,693
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not that bad.

470
00:34:09,753 --> 00:34:14,015
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Metroid, Punch-Out, Mario 3, Final Fantasy, and Ice Climber, okay?

471
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:14,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

472
00:34:15,235 --> 00:34:17,957
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see if Loki does any better.

473
00:34:18,197 --> 00:34:20,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunami, if you'd be so kind, run out and get Loki for us.

474
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:23,941
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Raven's Dolphin, stay on the line and see how it does.

475
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:24,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you bet.

476
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

477
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:31,225
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

478
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:32,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back, Loki.

479
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:33,827
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

480
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: And Loki's getting situated here back in studio.

481
00:34:36,749 --> 00:34:38,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, here's how it's going to work, Loki.

482
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:45,553
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to hear a one-minute clip of ten old-school 8-bit Nintendo games music all strung together.

483
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:52,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you're going to have 30 seconds after you hear the clip to repeat back to me the ten songs that you heard in the clip.

484
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:52,756
[SPEAKER_09]: In order?

485
00:34:53,296 --> 00:34:53,456
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

486
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:54,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Any way you want.

487
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:54,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

488
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:55,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

489
00:34:55,517 --> 00:34:56,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so you ready?

490
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

491
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,091
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get to hear this once.

492
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, you can actually make notes or make notes there if you want, okay?

493
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:05,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we let him write, but he wasn't allowed to be in the chat room to do that.

494
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't be in chat either, Loki.

495
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm not even watching chat.

496
00:35:09,035 --> 00:35:10,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just... All right.

497
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:10,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

498
00:35:10,495 --> 00:35:11,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to kick you from chat anyway.

499
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:12,316
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

500
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:13,356
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a bastard.

501
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:14,177
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

502
00:35:14,477 --> 00:35:14,797
[SPEAKER_07]: You ready?

503
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:15,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

504
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:16,017
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

505
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:16,978
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

506
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:19,836
[SPEAKER_09]: He's bringing up Notepad here.

507
00:35:20,176 --> 00:35:20,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am.

508
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:24,400
[SPEAKER_09]: We are playing Beat the Host here on Orange Lounge Radio.

509
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you feel pretty confident about how you did Raven's Dolphin?

510
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell him the score, but do you think you feel confident with your score?

511
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:31,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel pretty.

512
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:32,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

513
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:33,969
[SPEAKER_09]: You feel pretty?

514
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel pretty too.

515
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:37,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you ready, Loki?

516
00:35:38,332 --> 00:35:38,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

517
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:39,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Quit wasting time here.

518
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:39,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.

519
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:36,743
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, that was the clip.

520
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:38,244
[SPEAKER_09]: You have 30 seconds to say them back.

521
00:36:38,324 --> 00:36:38,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Go.

522
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:39,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Bros.

523
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:39,746
3.

524
00:36:40,266 --> 00:36:40,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

525
00:36:40,626 --> 00:36:41,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy.

526
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:41,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

527
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:42,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice Climber.

528
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:42,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

529
00:36:43,148 --> 00:36:43,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Goonies 2.

530
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

531
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:45,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Metroid.

532
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:45,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

533
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And, oh, crap.

534
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:50,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I should write down more of these.

535
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:52,815
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I got.

536
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:55,078
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

537
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:07,650
[SPEAKER_09]: And time's up!

538
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,990
[SPEAKER_09]: He tied with me, didn't he?

539
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, yep, it tied up!

540
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Raven's Dolphin got five and Loki got five, so it's all tied up.

541
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:20,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And since I wasn't creative enough to think of a tiebreaker, it will just have to be a stalemate, okay?

542
00:37:21,295 --> 00:37:22,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine by me.

543
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so Raven's Dolphin, you know what, we could be nice.

544
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:25,496
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, Loki?

545
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:26,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we just give him the prize anyway?

546
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,851
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, RavensDolphin, we'll see you back here in two weeks.

547
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:32,631
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to help us out with the DDR Power Preview, okay?

548
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, can't wait.

549
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,872
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sounds good.

550
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:37,032
[SPEAKER_09]: That's genuine excitement.

551
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:40,033
[SPEAKER_09]: But, RavensDolphin, I bet you're dying to know what the correct answers were.

552
00:37:40,873 --> 00:37:41,393
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm dying.

553
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:42,074
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here we go.

554
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:43,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Here they are, chat room.

555
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:44,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Metroid.

556
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:49,095
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe Noah got the next one.

557
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:51,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!

558
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I forgot the way down.

559
00:37:53,556 --> 00:37:54,337
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why.

560
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:54,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario Bros. 3.

561
00:37:57,816 --> 00:38:14,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Willow Shadowgate Final Fantasy Ice Climber Goonies 2

562
00:38:30,836 --> 00:38:36,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Gyruss, which you DDR people should know, Gyruss And lastly, Ninja Gaiden

563
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:39,460
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the 10.

564
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,723
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be lucky that you did not pick me, because I got 6.

565
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:45,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank god.

566
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:50,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would have had 6 too, had I wrote down all the titles instead of saying, I'll remember the first two.

567
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:53,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I would have got like 3, so I was the easy kill.

568
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,234
[SPEAKER_09]: So you could have won flat out if you told me.

569
00:38:55,274 --> 00:38:58,197
[SPEAKER_10]: But I told the chatroom I knew a lot of them, so I saved face.

570
00:38:58,457 --> 00:39:01,100
[SPEAKER_10]: But now that I admitted it, I lost the saving face.

571
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:07,476
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, chat room once posted there, so I will post the list there on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

572
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:08,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on chat.

573
00:39:08,477 --> 00:39:09,818
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the list for you folks in chat.

574
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,040
[SPEAKER_09]: RavensDolphin, thanks so much for playing our dumb little game with us.

575
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry you did not get to beat the host tonight, but maybe next time.

576
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,703
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to push him a little bit.

577
00:39:16,743 --> 00:39:17,284
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a push.

578
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:19,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was fun.

579
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:22,928
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, anything else you want to share with the listeners before we let you go and get back to the news?

580
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:25,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Snakes on a Plane looks funny.

581
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:27,106
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

582
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:48,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

583
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:51,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to see how well the chat room did there.

584
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:52,465
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like some folks really like the game.

585
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:53,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see that again.

586
00:39:53,406 --> 00:39:54,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll do that.

587
00:39:54,366 --> 00:39:56,728
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like Willow is the big stumper for most people there.

588
00:39:57,008 --> 00:40:00,530
[SPEAKER_07]: For what it's worth, I thought the last one was Double Dragon, not Ninja Gaiden.

589
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:01,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very close.

590
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:06,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I know for next time to write down everything I hear instead of just saying, oh, I'll remember those and not to go back.

591
00:40:06,915 --> 00:40:07,455
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tough.

592
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:12,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I figured folks in chat would really like that game and the folks listening on the podcast because you kind of get to play longer.

593
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,781
[SPEAKER_10]: You should have done more random games like throwing Kickle Cubicle or something like that.

594
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:16,121
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

595
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:16,862
[SPEAKER_09]: If we do it again...

596
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:19,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it'll be Super Nintendo, maybe Arcade.

597
00:40:19,444 --> 00:40:22,486
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if I wanted to be really mean, I'd do Commodore 64 games.

598
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:23,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Do Virtual Boy games.

599
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:24,387
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

600
00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe some other time we'll do Beat the Host with a stick, but for now we're going to get back into the gaming news.

601
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:41,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, there is a rumor going around this week that Walmart had stopped selling Bully because of pressure from a certain somebody, and we'll call him J...

602
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:47,367
[SPEAKER_07]: T, and rhymes with Fuck Omsen

603
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:15,480
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was funny though because Walmart spokesperson John Simley, he made a comment and he said, I'd like to give credit to Jack Thompson but there are a lot of Jack Thompsons out there and we are just listening to our customers.

604
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he means there are a lot of Jackoffs out there.

605
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:29,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says the decision has not been made on whether the chain which sells 127 million customers a day will carry Bully once it is rated and available for sale.

606
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:34,195
[SPEAKER_07]: If it comes out as adults only, we think that's something that we're not going to carry.

607
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,735
[SPEAKER_07]: I think first we look at the rating.

608
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:39,756
[SPEAKER_07]: More likely it's going to be mature.

609
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:47,357
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart anyway, because indirectly you're supporting their electronics department, which would be the music as well.

610
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hate, hate, hate the fact they censor music the way they do.

611
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:55,179
[SPEAKER_09]: They refuse to sell CDs in the store unless there's a clean version available.

612
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:03,704
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, here at Walmart we're going to sell the statue of David, but we've put, you know, tighty-whities on it.

613
00:42:03,844 --> 00:42:07,026
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's like, that's not, you've ruined the art.

614
00:42:07,226 --> 00:42:12,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I don't, anyway, this is kind of getting a little bit outside, but I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart.

615
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:19,293
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realize some folks feel they have no other choice living in a remote area, you know, where maybe Walmart is the only big game retailer you have, but...

616
00:42:20,094 --> 00:42:21,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Online, my friends.

617
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:27,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, I would rather buy my, even if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would rather buy my games online than buy them at Walmart.

618
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,702
[SPEAKER_09]: And this show will never be carried at Walmart, thanks to my little rant there, but that's alright.

619
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:33,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

620
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:38,247
[SPEAKER_06]: We're too far off the radar for Big Bad Walmart.

621
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:49,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I will admit I bought my copy of 99 Nights at Target, which probably isn't much better, but the other place I wanted to go to first was out of it, and I really wanted 99 Nights.

622
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Target got a mention in a Freeze Pop song.

623
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:52,653
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes them okay by me.

624
00:42:53,473 --> 00:42:54,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Call me a hypocrite if you want.

625
00:42:54,434 --> 00:42:54,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care.

626
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:55,895
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

627
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,632
[SPEAKER_09]: XBOX LIVE VISION CAMERA

628
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,511
[SPEAKER_09]: and Freeverse, who made Toy Sight for the Apple iSight.

629
00:43:17,791 --> 00:43:19,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Was this the game we played at E3 for a little bit?

630
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:20,592
[SPEAKER_09]: I seem to remember.

631
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:22,773
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was on, like, the PC camera, wasn't it?

632
00:43:22,993 --> 00:43:25,454
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was the Vision camera.

633
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:34,758
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that it sucked because there's people walking behind you, so you had to raise, like, one hand to... You used your hands, like, think of iToy, basically.

634
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:41,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like trying to play iToy with the Today Show behind you, that whole set where they have all the people moving and it just throws everything off.

635
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:41,821
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't do it.

636
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,522
[SPEAKER_07]: However, though, there is some...

637
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:49,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumors, though, actually I should say that that might not exactly be true, that Totem Ball's coming with it.

638
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:58,008
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason being is that some of the live vision cameras have actually sneaked out in Toys R Us lately, and some people have already purchased them.

639
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:08,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said that it's included one month of Xbox Live Gold, as well as a registration key for Uno, as I previously said on a podcast.

640
00:44:09,198 --> 00:44:09,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

641
00:44:11,434 --> 00:44:19,082
[SPEAKER_07]: But what you might end up finding out a little bit later on, as I think I mentioned before, there is two bundles that they're going to be having.

642
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:22,365
[SPEAKER_07]: One that's for $39.99 and one that's $79.99.

643
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:26,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And the $79.99 one might come with Totem Ball.

644
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,713
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's supposed to come with a year of Xbox Live Gold as well.

645
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:31,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

646
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:36,383
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, well, we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take your calls.

647
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:46,028
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to call our show, you can hit us up on the Skype line at InteractWithUs over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, or you can pick up the phone and call us, 916-226-9067.

648
00:44:47,108 --> 00:44:52,311
[SPEAKER_09]: But remember, that is not an 800 number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, you best be getting some permission.

649
00:44:52,391 --> 00:44:53,212
[SPEAKER_09]: We already have a call.

650
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to the line.

651
00:44:54,612 --> 00:44:55,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

652
00:44:55,713 --> 00:44:56,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

653
00:44:57,234 --> 00:44:58,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Rob.

654
00:44:58,454 --> 00:44:59,555
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the other Drew.

655
00:45:00,185 --> 00:45:01,245
[SPEAKER_09]: The other Drew.

656
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:04,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this the Drew that goes by Cutress online?

657
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:06,147
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be it.

658
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:07,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, how you doing?

659
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:13,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey Shane.

660
00:45:14,009 --> 00:45:14,370
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

661
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Kick him off right now.

662
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,351
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no.

663
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:20,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta let him plug the site he works for.

664
00:45:21,832 --> 00:45:23,492
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're good buddies with this site.

665
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:25,473
[SPEAKER_09]: So Cutress, where do you work?

666
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:28,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it's more of a hobby, but so is what we do.

667
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:34,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, it's not like I was just calling in to plug DDR Freak, but yeah, there you go.

668
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:36,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I wanted to let you plug DDR Freak, though.

669
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are you calling in about tonight?

670
00:45:40,428 --> 00:45:44,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first off, I had to make sure that everyone knew that Sui Koden sucks.

671
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you letting him still talk?

672
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:48,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's funny.

673
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:50,290
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, he's saying lies.

674
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:52,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take a quick vote.

675
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,710
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people think Cutris is funny in the room?

676
00:45:58,683 --> 00:45:59,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

677
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:00,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we got two.

678
00:46:01,044 --> 00:46:03,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And how many people think Cutress is not funny?

679
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:04,366
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have two.

680
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:06,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and I break ties.

681
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:14,511
[SPEAKER_09]: No, actually, the two full-time hosts here voted that he is funny, and the two peon guests voted that he wasn't funny.

682
00:46:14,712 --> 00:46:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to delete a lot of stuff off your computer tonight.

683
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:18,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutress, please.

684
00:46:18,574 --> 00:46:19,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop poking me.

685
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:20,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, let's stop taking up his time.

686
00:46:20,955 --> 00:46:24,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Cutress, please, whatever you want to say on your mind besides the fact that Suikoden sucks.

687
00:46:26,262 --> 00:46:32,884
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, for one thing, next time you do the music game, you need to have Mega Man music in there because that's sort of mandatory.

688
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:35,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, I have to save something for next time.

689
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:38,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't blow the Blaster Master wad on the first go, okay?

690
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:40,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mega Man and all that other stuff.

691
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:45,668
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I love me some Mega Man and some Blaster Master, but I have to wait.

692
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:49,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, if you had gotten me in, I would have gotten seven of ten.

693
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:53,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, looks like I do have some competition.

694
00:46:53,374 --> 00:46:57,056
[SPEAKER_06]: A little Drew vs. Drew action, huh?

695
00:46:58,276 --> 00:46:59,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a porno, be quiet.

696
00:47:00,837 --> 00:47:01,757
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the intent.

697
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:03,658
[SPEAKER_09]: What games have you been playing lately, Drew?

698
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just finished Dragon Quest a couple days ago.

699
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:16,843
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm pretty much wrapping up all the rest of the endgame stuff in that, and pretty much everything I have is packed up.

700
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:20,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, I kept out Front Mission 4 and Curse of Darkness.

701
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:23,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

702
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:30,126
[SPEAKER_11]: That's basically all I've got until I move into my new house and unpack everything again.

703
00:47:30,646 --> 00:47:34,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I just quit FFXI so that I could finally start playing my console games again.

704
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:39,473
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember quitting Final Fantasy XI to free myself to play other video games.

705
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:40,974
[SPEAKER_09]: You come back, you always do.

706
00:47:41,735 --> 00:47:46,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when I quit also, which didn't happen last night or today.

707
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:53,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, by the way, Miklatov signed back up for Final Fantasy XI last night because he's weak, everybody.

708
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:53,646
[SPEAKER_09]: He's weak.

709
00:47:54,066 --> 00:47:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, real quick.

710
00:47:57,209 --> 00:47:58,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to ask this real quick.

711
00:47:59,966 --> 00:48:00,226
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Freak

712
00:48:19,912 --> 00:48:31,875
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I've gotten to play it only once, and I only played two games of it, and basically I was just so out of shape and out of whack that I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore because I was taking up too much time from other people.

713
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:37,197
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people are complaining about the sync and everything, but I haven't noticed any problems myself.

714
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:38,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm enjoying it.

715
00:48:38,157 --> 00:48:38,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fun.

716
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all there really is to it.

717
00:48:40,658 --> 00:48:53,460
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I didn't notice the sync problems either, I have a life, but I agree with you on the fact that we all got out of shape, because Konami didn't put out a new game for forever, we all got burned out on Extreme, and now we're all fat and don't want to play DDR again.

718
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, sync?

719
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:56,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Get it?

720
00:48:56,381 --> 00:48:59,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up!

721
00:48:59,421 --> 00:49:01,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there two in one thread on the forums?

722
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:08,543
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm not the sort of guy that runs vertex squared through my head when I'm having sex, so I don't notice these sync issues.

723
00:49:09,105 --> 00:49:10,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and the group sucks.

724
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:10,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

725
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:14,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Cutris, anything else you want to share with our listeners so we can take more calls?

726
00:49:16,426 --> 00:49:19,967
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just thanks for having me on the show again, and I wish I could hang out with you guys more.

727
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:20,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a problem.

728
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:22,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Come visit the bay.

729
00:49:22,107 --> 00:49:25,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real bummer about E3, but maybe there'll be something.

730
00:49:25,148 --> 00:49:26,908
[SPEAKER_09]: We should have a DDR con or something fun.

731
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:28,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, hopefully.

732
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:30,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to hang out with you guys again.

733
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:30,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

734
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:31,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good one, Cutris.

735
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:32,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

736
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:32,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

737
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:34,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye-bye.

738
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:35,269
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

739
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:36,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Cutris, for being on the program tonight.

740
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's take another call.

741
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew, real quick.

742
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,013
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that for new low?

743
00:49:40,253 --> 00:49:41,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually making get it jokes on the air.

744
00:49:41,814 --> 00:49:42,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, be quiet.

745
00:49:42,674 --> 00:49:43,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to another call.

746
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:44,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

747
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:44,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

748
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:46,335
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Ranma.

749
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:47,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you think it is?

750
00:49:47,936 --> 00:49:49,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, Ranma.

751
00:49:49,496 --> 00:49:51,497
[SPEAKER_09]: God, you have a way of getting through every week.

752
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:52,077
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

753
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:53,738
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting hammered tonight, too, and you get through.

754
00:49:53,998 --> 00:49:54,458
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

755
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:57,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have three things I want to talk about.

756
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:58,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Three things.

757
00:49:58,719 --> 00:49:59,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Make them quick.

758
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one.

759
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:05,350
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, this whole high def versus standard def mission, fuck it.

760
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:10,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a nice 20 inch TV, it's standard def, it looks great.

761
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about this high def live stream, it's just a concept.

762
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just don't get it, you know?

763
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:20,806
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... Ranma, surely you've heard this old saying, okay?

764
00:50:20,826 --> 00:50:21,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever heard this old saying?

765
00:50:22,448 --> 00:50:24,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you go black, you never go back?

766
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:26,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because we won't let you go free.

767
00:50:26,932 --> 00:50:27,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

768
00:50:27,673 --> 00:50:27,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Same.

769
00:50:28,814 --> 00:50:30,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Apply that thought to an HDTV.

770
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:31,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

771
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:36,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like, once I bought an HDTV, I can't watch Standard anymore.

772
00:50:37,364 --> 00:50:48,972
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I used to play my PSU on a 55 inch high definition TV, but when I moved I had a 20 inch SD, standard deaf television, to me it just looks the same, I enjoy both of it, you know?

773
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:56,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, you know, I can appreciate that because that tells me that you are about the game first, the graphics second.

774
00:50:57,158 --> 00:50:58,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.

775
00:50:58,459 --> 00:51:00,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what's the second thing you wanted to call in about?

776
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:05,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of tired of the DDR fanboys in chat.

777
00:51:06,093 --> 00:51:06,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

778
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:08,375
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a game.

779
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:10,237
[SPEAKER_09]: What were they saying in chat?

780
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:10,698
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed it.

781
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was about your announcement about DDR.

782
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:17,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody said, you guys sold out the Kanaan.

783
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:20,260
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the hell, you know?

784
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Better than selling out to Roxor.

785
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,284
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't sell out to anybody.

786
00:51:24,304 --> 00:51:25,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't seen any of this money.

787
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:28,609
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not getting any money for this, so tell me how we're selling out.

788
00:51:28,649 --> 00:51:33,114
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing this because we like DDR and we like this, you know.

789
00:51:33,454 --> 00:51:40,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Hmm, let's see, we are a radio station, and on radio stations they play music, DDR of which has a lot of music.

790
00:51:41,118 --> 00:51:43,119
[SPEAKER_09]: This partnership makes a lot of sense to me.

791
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:44,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about the rest of you.

792
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,242
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that we would have done for Konami three years ago, but whatever, it's finally happening now, it's great.

793
00:51:50,642 --> 00:51:52,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, number three.

794
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:56,025
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing is the whole thing about the PS3, it's $400, $500.

795
00:51:56,665 --> 00:52:03,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are forgetting about another console that came out that was just as expensive.

796
00:52:04,212 --> 00:52:04,575
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

797
00:52:05,602 --> 00:52:06,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Neo Geo

798
00:52:08,066 --> 00:52:15,669
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, the Neo Geo wasn't exactly... You know, the Neo Geo was like the rich kid system, you know what I mean?

799
00:52:15,729 --> 00:52:18,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, everybody knew some rich kid who actually had a Neo Geo.

800
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:22,392
[SPEAKER_09]: And the difference is, it had games that kicked major amounts of ass.

801
00:52:22,512 --> 00:52:32,457
[SPEAKER_09]: It did, but it also, towards at least the end of the run... Like, you know, the first wave of games was pretty cool, but towards the end of the run, it was all Bust a Move, King of Fighters, you know, 99, all that stuff.

802
00:52:32,497 --> 00:52:34,578
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's all it ever was, in the end.

803
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is kind of sad.

804
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:37,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something wrong with King of Fighters?

805
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:40,786
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I'm just saying I wouldn't buy a console just for King of Fighters.

806
00:52:40,986 --> 00:52:41,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't get me wrong.

807
00:52:41,808 --> 00:52:44,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciated the Neo Geo, but I wouldn't have spent that much money on it.

808
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:46,092
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Madden?

809
00:52:46,152 --> 00:52:46,792
[SPEAKER_01]: What is Madden?

810
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,173
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same game over and over with little upgrades.

811
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:11,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

812
00:53:11,962 --> 00:53:14,164
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I don't play men.

813
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:15,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I play Tecmo Bowl.

814
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:16,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

815
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:17,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Tecmo Bowl for life.

816
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:18,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Ranma, we gotta let you go.

817
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:19,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Take more calls.

818
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:20,450
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.

819
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Rat Racer 3, PS2.

820
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:22,171
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want.

821
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:22,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

822
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:23,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it.

823
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:25,995
[SPEAKER_09]: With the 3D glasses, I hope.

824
00:53:28,618 --> 00:53:46,148

[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you should call us sometime Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

826
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:55,053
[SPEAKER_09]: It's DMN Hi DMN, what's on your mind?

827
00:53:56,479 --> 00:53:57,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Not much.

828
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:01,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to comment about the whole BDR TV show thing, too.

829
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:07,285
[SPEAKER_05]: But first, I want to congratulate you guys on getting that association with Konami.

830
00:54:07,325 --> 00:54:09,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited about hearing the new music.

831
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:10,266
[SPEAKER_09]: We're excited about it, too.

832
00:54:10,306 --> 00:54:11,407
[SPEAKER_09]: We think it's going to be a fun time.

833
00:54:11,427 --> 00:54:11,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

834
00:54:13,047 --> 00:54:14,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

835
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:16,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Now let's bag on the TV show a little bit.

836
00:54:16,949 --> 00:54:18,430
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

837
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:19,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the thing.

838
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:23,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be a bit of a devil's advocate about this whole slumber party gang thing.

839
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:24,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough.

840
00:54:24,213 --> 00:54:24,573
[SPEAKER_09]: We need it.

841
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:54,809
[SPEAKER_05]: um you've got to look whenever you're at the arcade being the seasoned DDR veterans that all of us are who do you see that annoys the ever loving shit out of you on those machines the target audience is number party girls birthday party girls yeah alright yeah so I think Konami is targeting that demographic I think they're doing it right I think it's going to be a laughing stock fest for the rest of us but I think it'll

842
00:54:55,804 --> 00:55:23,199
[SPEAKER_09]: whoever watches Saturday Morning TV and it'll sell more copies and that's what Konami wants right and to play devil's advocate to devil's advocate I understand what Konami's trying to do with that and you know you do make a good point but you can't help but as a long time DDR fan before there were little girls everywhere you can't help but cringe a little bit inside because this doesn't help the whole people walking behind the machine going that's gay thing that I was talking about earlier you know

843
00:55:24,028 --> 00:55:27,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well no, I cringe at the thought too, but I see where they're going from a business standpoint.

844
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:35,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I kind of wish if they're going to do this, that they would also do a DDR Macho show on Spike TV as well or something.

845
00:55:36,152 --> 00:55:39,553
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't know, I just... You know, I think...

846
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:49,628
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't let society, and this goes with anything, you can't let society tell you what to do, essentially, and if you enjoy something, you should wear it proud, you know what I mean?

847
00:55:49,889 --> 00:56:03,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though we joke about, you know, we don't like the people that come behind the machine and go, that's gay, that's gay, I think that you should have enough confidence in yourself to be able to do whatever you want, you know what I mean?

848
00:56:04,477 --> 00:56:12,901
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if you do, and DDR is a very social game, a friendly game, and I remember some kid once did this to me when I was on the machine, and Jamie tore him a new asshole.

849
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:15,943
[SPEAKER_09]: He was like, do you want to challenge him on the game?

850
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:16,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to fight?

851
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:20,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Here, I will pay for you to play against Rob, and we'll see who does better on the game.

852
00:56:22,506 --> 00:56:24,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That situation has happened with all of us.

853
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:29,250
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why Jamie's on this program, by the way, because she has her moments of gold like that, which you just gotta love.

854
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,170
[SPEAKER_09]: You just gotta love.

855
00:56:30,618 --> 00:56:34,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should look on the bright side of this whole slumber party girls though.

856
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:39,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It might appeal to the 20-something female demographic who thinks it's oddly cute.

857
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:42,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Might get more of a turnout in the arcades there.

858
00:56:42,368 --> 00:56:44,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

859
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:49,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to PAX and the Wii's coming soon.

860
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thank you very much.

861
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,315
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate that.

862
00:56:51,336 --> 00:56:52,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, bye-bye.

863
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:52,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, guys.

864
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:58,688
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's do at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio, and then we'll probably go and tie up the show.

865
00:56:59,068 --> 00:57:00,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

866
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:00,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's this?

867
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:02,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this is Bobby.

868
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:03,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Bobby.

869
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,331
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean Bobby Blackwolf?

870
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:06,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

871
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:07,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yes.

872
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:12,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby Blackwolf, who does a show on AllGames.com Sunday nights, 5 o'clock Pacific.

873
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:13,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Hint, hint.

874
00:57:14,015 --> 00:57:14,535
[SPEAKER_09]: What's on your mind?

875
00:57:16,327 --> 00:57:18,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share my opinion on something real quick.

876
00:57:19,029 --> 00:57:19,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Lies.

877
00:57:19,509 --> 00:57:21,350
[SPEAKER_10]: These are lies that he's going to be talking about.

878
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:22,251
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about this game.

879
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Suikoden.

880
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:25,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, yes, Suikoden.

881
00:57:25,353 --> 00:57:26,154
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard of this game.

882
00:57:26,574 --> 00:57:28,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we hang up on him, please?

883
00:57:28,095 --> 00:57:31,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov, didn't you get your name from a character in Suikoden 2?

884
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:33,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, he's the best character ever.

885
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:35,221
[SPEAKER_09]: An ambiguously gay character in Suikoden.

886
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:35,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Ambiguous.

887
00:57:36,622 --> 00:57:37,242
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

888
00:57:37,342 --> 00:57:39,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Bobby, I'd love to know your thoughts on Suikoden.

889
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:41,436
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it sucked.

890
00:57:42,036 --> 00:57:43,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you suck.

891
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:46,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, why does Suikoden suck?

892
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:48,778
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's mainly just to piss Miklatov off.

893
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:49,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

894
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:49,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And it works.

895
00:57:50,018 --> 00:57:51,738
[SPEAKER_10]: You actually think it's a good game, deep inside?

896
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the first and the third one.

897
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:55,079
[SPEAKER_10]: What about two?

898
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:56,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Besides the translation?

899
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:58,680
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so hard to find.

900
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't played it.

901
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,280
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't even find it.

902
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, because it's like $250.

903
00:58:02,301 --> 00:58:04,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not going to pay $250.

904
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:05,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Play five.

905
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:07,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I wrote that game really well.

906
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:08,662
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

907
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby, anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

908
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:13,979
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was it.

909
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:15,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing this for the chat room.

910
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I appreciate it.

911
00:58:17,002 --> 00:58:18,122
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we call quality radio.

912
00:58:18,142 --> 00:58:18,943
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, Bobby.

913
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Comedy gold.

914
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:23,587
[SPEAKER_09]: You can hear little gems like that on his program every week.

915
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:25,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how people call in to make me whine.

916
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:27,650
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you're here.

917
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,611
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really fun.

918
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:30,172
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you're here, because you're a whiner.

919
00:58:30,653 --> 00:58:35,777
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, any last-minute stories, folks, on Orange Lounge Radio tonight?

920
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:36,597
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course.

921
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:37,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

922
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:38,659
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

923
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:08,691
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's still in development, so look forward to more stuff from that.

924
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:19,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, if you're looking for a nice clone, in fact, I think a lot of people got in trouble for the Grid Wars.

925
00:59:19,675 --> 00:59:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they have Trigonometry Wars, the final version, out for the PSP.

926
00:59:24,017 --> 00:59:25,838
[SPEAKER_07]: You can download it on PSP Updates.

927
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:29,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely something fun if you like Geometry Wars.

928
00:59:30,717 --> 00:59:33,479
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard about all the scandal going around there with Geometry Wars.

929
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

930
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,161
[SPEAKER_09]: The clones, at least.

931
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And people getting sued and stuff.

932
00:59:37,643 --> 00:59:39,524
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one quick last minute story, if you're done with that one.

933
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:45,809
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say real quick, with Madden 07 coming out, Slashdot ran a recent piece.

934
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:46,991
[SPEAKER_09]: E.A.

935
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:47,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Online Account

936
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:10,797
[SPEAKER_09]: and Granting Electronic Arts the ability to collect your name, address, and credit card information as well as a variety of demographic information about how you use their products.

937
01:00:11,237 --> 01:00:15,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, they explicitly say that they may tie these demographics to your personal information.

938
01:00:16,382 --> 01:00:17,643
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not anonymous here.

939
01:00:18,424 --> 01:00:24,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, a site called Gamers With Jobs actually cornered EA and Microsoft about these issues and they were met with silence.

940
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:26,470
[SPEAKER_09]: The multiplayer version of FEAR, FEAR Combat

941
01:00:48,272 --> 01:00:49,814
[SPEAKER_06]: has been released to the public for free.

942
01:00:50,335 --> 01:00:53,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You can sign up for a free CD key and a download of the game.

943
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the link offhand, but I know we have a link to it in our OL Army Clan section.

944
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:02,268
[SPEAKER_09]: There's already an OL Army Clan building up for this.

945
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely want to check out the game next week.

946
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:06,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I just finished downloading and installing it.

947
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:08,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be checking it out tonight.

948
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:08,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

949
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:12,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I'm so scared of this game, I just saw.

950
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:12,715
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

951
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:16,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember how I mentioned last week Happy Feet's coming out on the Wii?

952
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:18,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got Happy Feet!

953
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:24,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Happy Feet, for those who don't know, is kind of like a spoof of... Will they have Happy Wii?

954
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:25,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

955
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:27,762
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, get this.

956
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:33,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Happy Feet, basically, as you might know or not know, it is...

957
01:01:34,156 --> 01:01:36,957
[SPEAKER_07]: A movie kind of spoofing the whole March of the Penguins thing.

958
01:01:36,997 --> 01:01:38,217
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got penguins doing stuff.

959
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:42,539
[SPEAKER_07]: However, Happy Feet the game is going to be like DDR.

960
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And with arrows and all.

961
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:51,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I said you could strap the Wii controller to your feet, I wasn't exactly too far off, was I?

962
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:52,542
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you were not.

963
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:53,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

964
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:54,623
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of interesting.

965
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:59,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Some other fun stuff, especially when we get into the speculation area here.

966
01:02:00,506 --> 01:02:04,668
[SPEAKER_07]: The PSP being redesigned, kind of almost like a PSP Lite.

967
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:07,669
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be coming out in March.

968
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:08,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Gee, I wonder where they got that idea.

969
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it says it's supposed to be like the PSP Lite.

970
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,211
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't call it the PSP Lite.

971
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:15,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, PSP 2 or whatever.

972
01:02:16,712 --> 01:02:26,476
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to include 8 gigs of flash memory for storing your wonderful movies and stuff on, as well as they're getting rid of

973
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,918
[SPEAKER_07]: GS68 in our chatroom says, Please fix the D-pad, Sony.

974
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:30,838
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally...

975
01:02:56,929 --> 01:02:58,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, gotta mention this.

976
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:05,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of speculation, the Xbox 360 is supposed to get another skew.

977
01:03:05,773 --> 01:03:21,101
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, rumor for now, it's gonna be a black Xbox 360 with a built-in HD DVD drive, an HDMI AV out, 250 gig hard drive, and PVR functions, like Xbox Live slash DirecTV or that kind of stuff.

978
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:21,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Planned for $600 US.

979
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:26,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's a brilliant idea.

980
01:03:26,246 --> 01:03:28,507
[SPEAKER_07]: This is in the official Xbox magazine.

981
01:03:28,987 --> 01:03:30,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, rumor for now.

982
01:03:32,628 --> 01:03:37,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, you had me going bullshit until you said it was in the official Xbox magazine?

983
01:03:37,729 --> 01:03:38,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's rumor, though.

984
01:03:38,909 --> 01:03:39,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably.

985
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:40,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I don't know.

986
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,170
[SPEAKER_09]: A black Xbox 360, huh?

987
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:43,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Something for the emo kids.

988
01:03:43,411 --> 01:03:44,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, I don't know.

989
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:48,272
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds a little weird, but I don't know.

990
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:53,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And finally, I thought I'd mention the lineup since Arcade Wednesdays is still going on.

991
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:58,865
[SPEAKER_07]: and, of course, we had Texas Hold'em coming out free of charge, as we mentioned, for 48 hours.

992
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:05,091
[SPEAKER_07]: The week after that, though, we'll be seeing some more stuff, including, I know, what was it?

993
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:05,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Time Pilot.

994
01:04:05,752 --> 01:04:06,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Time Pilot.

995
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:06,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

996
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:08,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Time Pilot and then Scramble.

997
01:04:08,874 --> 01:04:09,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can do without Scramble.

998
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

999
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:12,858
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1000
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:14,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Huh, interesting.

1001
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:16,802
[SPEAKER_10]: As somebody mentioned in the chat room, and it's true, the...

1002
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:22,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Xbox 360 isn't that special because those are the dev kits also.

1003
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:24,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have the faceplates too, right?

1004
01:04:24,464 --> 01:04:24,664
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1005
01:04:25,044 --> 01:04:28,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you could make your Xbox 360 black looking with the new faceplates.

1006
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:33,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm just saying, we already have 360s in existence that are black, so it's not like...

1007
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:34,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1008
01:04:54,656 --> 01:04:57,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I guess it's about time to wrap up the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1009
01:04:57,878 --> 01:05:00,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us this week.

1010
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:04,821
[SPEAKER_09]: But we do have one more story for you guys tonight, Loki.

1011
01:05:05,921 --> 01:05:08,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We saved this for the end because this is just one of those WTF stories.

1012
01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:19,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you were a high school student and, of course, in a math class, you probably were playing with a TI calculator or TI-83 in this case.

1013
01:05:20,689 --> 01:05:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there's somebody creating a homebrew calculator

1014
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:24,371
[SPEAKER_07]: and more.

1015
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,951
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 50% done so far and it looks pretty cool.

1016
01:05:43,351 --> 01:05:47,913
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember correctly, they actually did port Link's Awakening 2 at TI83 back in the day.

1017
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:52,675
[SPEAKER_06]: A completely original Zelda game on a calculator?

1018
01:05:52,935 --> 01:05:59,318
[SPEAKER_09]: The only good thing about the old graphing calculators was that you could type letters into them.

1019
01:05:59,778 --> 01:06:02,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I used to do this for calculus tests all the time.

1020
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:05,520
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd put in the notes in my calculator and cheat.

1021
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:06,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1022
01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:07,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I was smart.

1023
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:20,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I remember with, like, the TI-83, you know, big thing when I was just going in high school is they actually, you know, finally got it to run assembly on there and then you could do grayscale and just, like, crazy shit on a calculator.

1024
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:22,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1025
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:29,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that's why I had to drop my calculus class because I was programming games in it instead of listening.

1026
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:31,957
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of TI-83 love in the chat room.

1027
01:06:31,997 --> 01:06:35,640
[SPEAKER_09]: GS68 says, I use my TI-83 Plus to play FireTrack.

1028
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:37,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of a crappy shmup.

1029
01:06:38,122 --> 01:06:42,066
[SPEAKER_09]: And some folks are saying, yay, Zelda game, and so on and so forth.

1030
01:06:42,926 --> 01:06:45,568
[SPEAKER_09]: EvilCheese666, OMG, I love those calculators.

1031
01:06:46,349 --> 01:06:48,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of love for the old graphing calculators.

1032
01:06:49,335 --> 01:06:54,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, that's about the end of the program, but of course we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1033
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:00,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure if DarkSakura were here, she would say reject false icons, but she'll be back next week.

1034
01:07:00,644 --> 01:07:02,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I should point out about next week.

1035
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:06,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Next week's show will not be taped live on Sunday night.

1036
01:07:06,768 --> 01:07:09,010
[SPEAKER_09]: This is because, I know this is going to sound hella lame,

1037
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:36,618
[SPEAKER_09]: I have concert tickets on Sunday that I got for my birthday and the person didn't realize that I would have Orange Lounge so of course I gotta go because it's a birthday gift and I'm going to see Journey how cool is that I'm hoping they'll have the old school game there but yeah so we're going to pre-tape next week more news to come to the LiveJournal community we'll probably pre-tape live earlier in the week we'll let you know when as soon as we work it out between the three of us let's go around and get everybody's final thought now Miklatov your final thought

1038
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:42,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope my ticket to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour comes pretty soon through the mail.

1039
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I want it really bad.

1040
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,501
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1041
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,643
[SPEAKER_10]: My ticket to the So You Think You Can Dance Tour.

1042
01:07:48,984 --> 01:07:49,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Loser!

1043
01:07:49,925 --> 01:07:50,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever!

1044
01:07:50,706 --> 01:07:51,807
[SPEAKER_10]: That show's awesome!

1045
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:54,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow, that is almost as lame as Suikoden.

1046
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:56,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate everybody.

1047
01:07:57,671 --> 01:07:58,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, um...

1048
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:01,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Drew, thank you for being on the show again.

[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

1050
01:08:02,755 --> 01:08:04,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I go a whole night without calling you 23rd Magus?

1051
01:08:04,796 --> 01:08:05,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I did.

1052
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:06,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you did.

1053
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:07,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, very good.

1054
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:09,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Then your name transition is about complete.

1055
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:10,659

01:08:17,362 --> 01:08:17,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Correction.

1059
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:20,483
[SPEAKER_09]: That was almost as lame as Suikoden.

1060
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:25,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, do you have an actual final thought?

1061
01:08:25,899 --> 01:08:26,079
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1062
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:26,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1063
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And my final thought is Easy Cheese, for no real reason.

1064
01:08:32,003 --> 01:08:33,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking about Easy Cheese right now.
