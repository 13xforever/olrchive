Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,760
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,240
This is episode number 196 for this, August the 20th of 2006, and we're in part B of our

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
podcast.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,640
Thank you guys so much for downloading us on iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,000
Podcast or whatever

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,440
podcast program you decided to use to check us out. We really appreciate it.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,220
You're supporting independent radio and that is quite awesome so thank you guys

13
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:43,720
very much.

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,200
We're here to celebrate the gamer lifestyle and gaming culture

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,280
and you know anybody can just repeat what you read on gamer blogs but

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,040
you know when it's real people and real gamers who have been doing this for a while talking

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,880
about it, we like to think it puts a different angle

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,640
on everything so thank you guys for checking us out. So we're going to get right back into the

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,680
news and

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,120
kind of along with independent gaming I guess this kind of fits into that whole

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,960
thing doesn't it Logie?

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,360
Exactly because if you want to make an independent game

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,440
and have it on live then you're in luck. Microsoft is actually releasing a new

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,240
package called

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,280
XNA that'll help you do that. It's going to be some development tools and libraries to help

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,840
develop a game and actually eventually get it onto

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,040
live arcade or you know something like that.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:41,040
It is going to cost you, though, to get it actually onto Live and all that stuff, $99 I believe, but you can develop for free and at least be able to, I think, upload it to your own, you know, Xbox or whatever, but yeah, it should be pretty cool.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Details on it are a bit scarce right now, but they are going to be adding some info coming up in the next couple weeks here when it actually launches, so it's actually pretty cool, though.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:08,380
And basically, like I said, the $99 subscription or whatever, per year, allows you to become part of this Creators Club, which will offer you downloadable samples of games to help you get your stuff created.

31
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:16,140
Also, well, unfortunately the games are not going to be outside the service, so it's pretty much, you know, to help you out with developing games.

32
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,020
That might be kind of a fun thing to get into if I, you know, was more of a programmer.

33
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,940
I hate programming, personally, nothing against you guys that love to program.

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,980
I have a lot of respect for you guys because I found it to be tedious and boring as shit

35
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,940
when I did it in college, but this is a neat idea.

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,780
I really like the idea of, you know, some of these games that we see created could graduate

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,620
to Xbox Live, essentially, and really buff up the Xbox Live community.

38
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,020
I think it's a kind of a smart response in a way to Nintendo's Virtual Console

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,780
which will have

40
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,920
many many many games on it to start. It's kind of a way for Xbox Live Arcade to

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,380
sort of buff up, so to speak.

42
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,380
This also says that they're gonna, the subscription also gets you a copy of the

43
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,300
runtime libraries for

44
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,380
basically the 360, so

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,580
yeah, pretty much you're gonna need those

46
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,420
to make the games. But at least you can start designing, and I know there's a lot of creative

47
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,220
people out there.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,140
It is going to be available, beta release of it, on August 30th.

49
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
So look for those.

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,540
Alright, going to comments from our chat room there.

51
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,180
Cutris in our chat room says, it is tedious and boring as shit, referring to programming,

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,300
and that's why some people like it.

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Well said.

54
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,860
Black Wolf says, you can't send a game you wrote for the 360, send to someone who does

55
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,420
not pay that $99 a year.

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,900
True, but hypothetically, games made with this, what I was saying is that games made

57
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,780
with this could, like the cream of the crop, could graduate to regular Xbox 360, right?

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Yeah.

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
That's the idea.

60
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
I hope.

61
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
So that would be kind of neat.

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,380
Yeah, so that's kind of what they're hoping for, at least.

63
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
All right.

64
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,980
Well, speaking of things that are fan-made, and sometimes these can be better than the

65
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,580
ones that are Hollywood-made, that's right, I'm talking about movies.

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,800
And there is a Devil May Cry fan movie being made.

67
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,560
It's called Devil May Cry Sins Remembered, and it's something that Capcom execs are supposed

68
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,960
to watch at Dragon Con in Atlanta later this year.

69
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,600
It's being produced by an independent company called Shadow Motion Pictures in Atlanta and

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,160
being directed by R.L. Scott.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
Evil Unleashed is a gaming site that has an interview with the director in which he talks

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,640
about how it's been challenging to bring Devil May Cry to the screen.

73
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,280
Quote, I did not want to see a film that was completely from their own writers as it would

74
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,640
not be a pure representation of what I could offer them as a filmmaker.

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,280
It's only going to be a 50-minute picture and it's basically kind of being used to sort

76
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,740
of promote R.L. Scott as a filmmaker, but hey, it's Devil May Cry.

77
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,800
He has worked on some other Hollywood productions as well, including The Legend of Bagger Vance

78
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,900
and Underworld, so we'll see.

79
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,380
He's going to be using this promo to try and sell a full-length feature called Devil Hunter,

80
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,220
so we'll see how good this movie actually is.

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,660
It sounds like it's going to be shown at Dragon Con.

82
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,020
It should be interesting for those of you folks that are attending.

83
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,520
And I understand our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf is actually going to be on a podcasting panel

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,520
there, kind of similar to what we did at Fonami, and I think the whole thing is airing on all

85
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
games.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
So, check that out a little closer to Dragon Con.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Hmm, that's pretty cool.

88
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,260
And especially if you're looking for the game movies, probably the biggest game movie you're

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,960
going to be looking forward to I should say, well maybe not the biggest game movie, there

90
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,360
is going to be a Hitman movie script that's actually leaked out and Latino review of course,

91
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,280
the usual suspect for reviewing those types of scripts, since they actually reviewed,

92
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,480
I think, the Halo 3 script, maybe, I can't remember. I know they've gotten their hands

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,900
on like Transformers and stuff. But anyways, they have a review of the Hitman script and

94
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,200
they said that it's actually going to be pretty good as far as the movie goes. You know, whether

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,900
this is going to be one of the better adaptations out there right now. Of course, I think the

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,440
mark's going to be set by Halo 3, whenever the hell that gets out. The mark will definitely

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,320
not be set by Dead or Alive, the movie, because that's gonna suck. But, lots of DNA, I hope.

98
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:13,320
But anyways, moving on, we've got some stuff for ChromeHounds, actually getting some more

99
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,940
content. In fact, they had some more downloadable parts. Unlike the last one, though, these

100
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:25,380
cost you money. And 100 Microsoft Points for some of the weapons, and I believe the other

101
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,980
ones were for 60 Microsoft points. They add weapon spacers and whatnot, and I think a

102
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:38,220
new camo package. But I don't know, do you guys think that actually buying parts for

103
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,020
ChromeHounds is kind of a good thing? I like downloading the free parts because I know

104
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:47,240
you can actually go to the online store in ChromeHounds once you've purchased them and

105
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,680
like buy an infinite amount of them. I haven't really played enough ChromeHounds to really

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,500
tell so why don't you answer that question because you've actually played

107
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,960
crow mounds as well is it gonna be worth is it gonna be worth the points I don't

108
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,640
know I mean I think a hundred points for like all of them would be good but it's

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,040
like a hundred and sixty points for it each one and there's about you know well

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,120
if people buy horse armor I mean there's gonna be somebody that buys this but you

111
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,560
know what though a horse armors I don't know unless you're really hardcore in

112
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,040
the armored core then maybe but the only thing I don't like about it is you don't

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,000
really know what the parts are until you actually buy them so I mean you don't

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,040
know what the stats are on them that's a little different and I think that's kind

115
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,880
of one thing that you know maybe the PlayStation 3 will have an advantage of

116
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
over like say the marketplace and on live right now you actually get to see

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,740
you know say if you're gonna purchase tracks or whatever you can see it in the

118
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,600
game and see the specs for it then use your Microsoft points to buy you know

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,480
well, Sony points, whatever you're gonna call them, to buy those items, whereas this, it's

120
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:58,720
kind of like, Light Arms I. Hmm, well what the hell is that? You know, so. Yeah, I'll

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,280
probably buy them. Alright. Because I'm a sucker for that crap. Yeah, you are a sucker

122
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,400
for that crap. Alright, well, one thing a lot of us is a sucker for is Guitar Hero II,

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,880
and earlier this week, Joystiq reported that Red Octane is doing three new sequels to Guitar

124
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,440
Hero and we've got Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero Encore, and Guitar Hero

125
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,640
Axe Grinder are all titles that are under consideration. This isn't too much

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,480
of a surprise when you consider we had a story about six months ago or so when

127
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,740
Guitar Hero was first getting big that said they wanted to do a variety of

128
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,680
sequels to Guitar Hero so I don't know is this gonna be over saturation? I

129
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,600
wonder if they'll make a sequel and the game will actually be good. You're like

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,800
the one person that doesn't like Guitar Hero. Why don't you like Guitar Hero? It's not fun and I

131
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,640
hate the music but you like guitar freaks right I like it just a little

132
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,820
more which means I still don't like it huh I just think that if I wanted to

133
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,660
play frequency or amplitude I could play frequency or amplitude to have better

134
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,040
songs but you were you ever the type as a kid like at any point in your life did

135
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,260
you you know pretend to do the air guitar and I'll tend that you were a rock

136
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,300
guitar guy no or did you pretend you were Madonna no I would have killed my

137
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,700
I had to ask, I had to ask.

138
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,060
No, they need the hat.

139
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,880
They should have Madonna Hero. Somebody in the chat room agrees with me, Psycoon says

140
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,260
Guitar Hero blows. That's two people. I'm sure that there is going to be a

141
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,580
backlash against Guitar Hero because of the uber popularity the game has had.

142
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,180
I like Guitar Hero, it's a great game. The only thing that

143
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,780
ruffles my feathers is when people say it's this original new concept that's

144
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,740
never been done before and I'm like... Well, that bugs me too. Or when people say that Beat

145
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,460
Mania was a copy of Guitar Hero, I'm like, uh, no.

146
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,880
I'll say it before, I'll say it again, Guitar Hero

147
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,140
made music games like that accessible. Yeah.

148
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,460
Made it mainstream. That's absolutely right. And of course there are other people who are gonna hate it

149
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,620
because they're into Year of the Now because it made it into mainstream.

150
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,940
Sad but true, it's a game where people are gonna look at it and they're not

151
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,180
inclined to go,

152
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,380
that's gay. Like, you know, when people are playing DDR you have the, you know,

153
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,840
stupid a-holes that

154
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,640
walk by the machine and look at the people playing DDR and go,

155
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,000
that's gay.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,640
Yet, for some reason, playing a plastic guitar in the middle of your living room is not gay.

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,080
Actually, that's funny because we have one of my bosses at work, he's a guitarist,

158
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,120
and he, you know, when we did the interview with the local news station here,

159
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,240
and I got a copy of the game finally, I showed him it and he's all pretty much,

160
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
that's gay.

161
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,880
So it kind of is funny when you think about it.

162
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,880
That's crap. That's not a real guitar. That's a toy.

163
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,880
How about with all these Guitar Hero sequels, we get Guitar Hero Gay?

164
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I mean, SingStar did it, right?

165
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Oh, God.

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
We already have Karaoke Revolution for that.

167
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I don't know. The Karaoke Revolution is cool.

168
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
And they have the country one, which would totally not be gay.

169
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Now, Karaoke Revolution American Idol...

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
I don't know. Sounds pretty gay to me.

171
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
You don't know the song list.

172
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm just wait for a song list. Okay. All right, right, but no no, that'd be that's clay. I'm

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,540
You're an idiot. I'm assuming the song list is probably since it is like licensed through American Idol

174
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,560
I'm assuming we've got Kelly Clarkson Clay Aiken Fantasia Ruben

175
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,900
You can assume all you want but just hold your reservation

176
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,200
All right

177
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,440
Fine, I'll hold my reservations for a few more days and then once it gets like fully announced with a song list

178
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,640
Then you can say well, it's a terrible game like I say, but until then you're not allowed to say that

179
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,360
Harry K. Ames sums it up very well in our chat room people who use gay as an insult are gay

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,800
But I don't use it as an insult Rob probably does I

181
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,080
Do loser fine, but I wanna leave you like that's homosexual

182
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:01,000
Then, you're from the Midwest.

183
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,760
Gay means two things.

184
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,800
Gay means happy, and gay is a man that likes to date other men, or a woman who likes to

185
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
date other women.

186
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
It's like a dual meaning thing.

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Hey, you know what?

188
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,080
This is off topic, so why don't you get back on topic?

189
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Great!

190
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,400
Alright, one thing that is definitely not gay is epics.

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Remember epics?

192
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,480
They were a big company on the Commodore 64.

193
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Who?

194
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
No.

195
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Okay.

196
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
How about Impossible Mission?

197
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
I don't know any of those games.

198
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
California Games?

199
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I remember California Games.

200
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Never mind.

201
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
There you go.

202
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Thank you.

203
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Okay, look.

204
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,280
Epix has been dormant for a long, long time.

205
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,000
System 3 is the development house that changed its name to Studio 3 and then back to System

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,080
3, and they are bringing back the Epix name as well as Epix Games.

207
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,440
In January, System 3 is going to release Impossible Mission for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo

208
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
O.D.S.

209
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Stay wild.

210
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Stay forever.

211
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,080
If you've ever played Impossible Mission, you'll get that.

212
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,720
Oh god, that was like my favorite Commodore 64 game.

213
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,640
That's what that does for me is nostalgia squee all over, definitely.

214
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,600
Hopefully it's better than the Impossible Mission 2 that was on the Genesis, I think.

215
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
It was pretty bad.

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
It was a pretty bad translation.

217
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Anyway, there's also going to be a California Games coming to both systems in May.

218
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,320
They won't be remakes of the original titles, they won't be 3D either.

219
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Quote, you got to keep the gameplay mechanics the same or else it ceases to be the original game

220
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
and you're only using the game brand to sell games.

221
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
It ceases to be Impossible Mission or California Games or what have you.

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,320
What we're doing is we're incorporating the original gameplay and mechanics and bringing the gameplay up to date.

223
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
I like this guy.

224
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I like this guy.

225
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I like this guy.

226
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,760
You do not update a game like you update, say, NARC.

227
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
That isn't the way you do it.

228
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,000
You don't put Bill Bellamy in anything.

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,160
This guy has got it.

230
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,680
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they produce.

231
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
You know what?

232
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm going to write him a letter and try to get him on the show.

233
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,000
I want to talk to this guy.

234
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,240
I like the way he thinks.

235
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,640
Anyways, I'm kind of on a completely different subject.

236
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,480
And speaking of updating things, the FENTOM!

237
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,120
is back. Um, they're actually going to be re-emerging the console as a PC download service.

238
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,440
And um, yeah, so you'll actually be able to, um, download Phantom games to your PC. Which

239
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,680
it was anyways, I mean, it was basically PC. Will they disappear as soon as I download

240
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:41,680
them? No. But yeah, there's official relaunch going on over at the website phantom.net.

241
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,200
yay do we care

242
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,760
no you gotta give these guys credit because they just keep trying

243
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,360
and trying and eventually something will happen

244
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
what have they done they've tried they had a fun little booth at E3

245
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
I really like their booth at E3 that was a nice booth to sit in

246
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,160
I mean literally I could have set money on fire

247
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,000
and that would have been fun too but you wouldn't want to sit on that

248
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,240
interesting little flash video and I might add

249
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,840
they probably spent more time on the flash video than they did the actual I

250
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,760
don't know phantom

251
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm sorry I don't know how to spin this a nice way

252
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm not saying they're good people because they're obviously not good people

253
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,520
well you can touch and play with the phantom lap board

254
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,860
look no no no I'm saying the reverse I mean I don't blame the people I blame

255
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,920
the management behind this whole thing in the marketing

256
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,640
Obviously, I mean, I just think we're asked nice made that they think that somebody still cares and they're still trying

257
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,200
You know what though if you're interested in checking out the phantom you can either check it out in Germany next week during

258
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
Leipzig or

259
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,480
You can check it out at digital life coming in October 12 through the 15th

260
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,000
Blackwolf says they should put out a game called phantom vision. I

261
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,200
Wouldn't play that

262
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Now what it boils down to is they can't make vaporware systems anymore

263
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,480
So they're just gonna offer vaporware over the internet stuff. That's never going to ever be released

264
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,660
I want to hey look if anyone from Phantom is listening and thinking we're giving you guys a bad rap

265
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,040
Seriously, you are accordingly invited to come on the show and defend yourself

266
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,040
I got it freedom of speech doesn't matter. They're going to release Duke Nukem forever on

267
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
phantom online

268
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I've been Larry's

269
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,400
you know they might be like trying to put out something eventually

270
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,760
but you still give them credit for putting money into something that's not

271
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,600
gonna work

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,560
I like DJ Jinai's thought in chat here

273
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,600
Fast and the Furious Oregon Trail Drift remix

274
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,560
I guess that's a phantom game that's gonna come out

275
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,560
If they released something that had an Oregon Trail in it you know it would sell like

276
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,520
20 copies to the people that still share

277
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,520
gang midnight Oregon Trail tune. Well look, Phantom, you're not alone in taking a lot

278
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,320
of heat for being a console. The PlayStation 3! Some more news about the PlayStation 3.

279
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,440
There was a report that was released this week that basically said, quote, by the time

280
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,120
third generation consoles reach market maturity in 2011, the PlayStation 3 will once again

281
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,420
be the market leader. Boy, I wish I could be an analyst. I get paid to talk out of my

282
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:33,680
ass. I mean, maybe, I don't know, maybe, but based on what's there right now, I don't see

283
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,760
it happening. According to the nieces, you talk out of your ass for free. Is this going

284
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:45,920
to take them until 2011? But by then we'll all be rich, and that's why... Another thing

285
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,320
that should be noted, PlayStation 3s have still not gone into production, and we're

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,220
not that far away from the launch date. So as we get further and further out here, shortages

287
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,980
become more and more likely.

288
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,340
Please say you should three will dominate all.

289
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,660
Oh, we haven't started making them yet.

290
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Don't worry.

291
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:15,780
We'll stay up late the night before, we'll get them all then.

292
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:23,740
Stories like these that just make no sense to all with us, I just learned how to talk

293
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,740
tonight.

294
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:33,740
that make no sense at all to us, make us angsty, or make us laugh, and brings on the FUs of

295
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:44,740
the week.

296
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,740
I'd like to start off tonight since Dark Sakura isn't here.

297
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,820
I would like to give an FU to my bad grammar skills and give a big giant FU to Loki for

298
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,580
for making fun of them and uh... laughing in my ear which throws me off

299
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,580
a further that you

300
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,480
will change the dick to any like span of vision

301
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,660
i think that's a bad thing

302
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,300
uh... low-key reviews the week

303
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,340
after you stupid people who can't fucking pull up to the god damn stoplight

304
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,420
or line

305
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,300
i've seen people like six car length

306
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
before the stop sign

307
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,520
stoplight whatever

308
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,380
there just stop there

309
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,780
Talking on their cell phones, of course, because they're jackasses and not paying attention to where they need to be.

310
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:32,080
Or the people that drive in the goddamn, like, bike lane, because they're not paying attention, or driving over the lane, all over the place.

311
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,780
They should really ban cell phones while driving.

312
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,180
Meagletob.

313
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,980
Okay, I got two FUs for short.

314
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,480
FU to eating rabbit, because rabbit actually ended up not tasting that great.

315
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,680
I was very disappointed.

316
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,040
however lamb is lamb is is worse than rabbit so lamb it tastes like dirty

317
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:00,020
meat and I actually like my meat not from next to it. okay what is your other F.U. of Mr. Chumming

318
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,520
Flash is the best game ever it's not the best game ever it's just really far up

319
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,200
there my other F.U. goes to myself for not learning a certain toggle bell

320
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,560
employees work schedule so I can stalk him effectively. F.U. to the fact he's

321
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:20,640
probably under 18 and this is all being documented. He's so not under 18, and if he is, I can

322
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:29,640
delete this. Drew, you're FU. Alright, FU to have a clean house, unrealization that

323
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,660
yeah, he does the forest pretty well, but Mr. Clean's a dick. Before I saw all the allergies

324
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:42,320
I ever had, and some I didn't know I had. FU to obligatory stupid drivers, especially

325
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,680
in the country called Lanes area. Learn how to fuckin' park, would ya? I'm just tryin'

326
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,680
to get in, out, no fuckin' about, and these people are just blocking the driveway. Yeah,

327
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,080
that's about it. Alright.

328
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Anyway, speaking of stupid, there's a stupid idea going around on Kotaku here. Apparently

329
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,160
people have been emailing them saying, Hey! You know that awesome movie Snakes on a Plane?

330
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,700
Is there gonna be video game? No, no, there's not and they're like, well why the hell not so they propose that

331
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:24,280
They make the snakes on play video game snakes in a game. I think I think it's stupid boo. I

332
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,040
Feel like I'm like the only person my age who hasn't seen snakes on a plane. I haven't seen it

333
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,000
No, you two are lame. Go see it

334
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,340
Why if I was 10 years older and closer to your age is a lie

335
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,880
You are not that much younger than I was are you saying I'll go see it. I am too. No, you're not. How old are you?

336
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,620
old enough to be ten years younger than you would be 18 and it would be okay for you to be stalking the

337
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,380
Taco Bell guy who's probably saying all right

338
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,380
True you actually saw the movie right? Yeah, I was it worth the hype it kicked ass really. Yeah

339
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,420
I'm at that point where I'm like

340
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,220
I feel like Snakes on a Plane jumped the shark before it ever came out.

341
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:11,020
It lived up to the hype in the sense that we knew it was going to be cheesy, we knew

342
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,980
it was going to be a bad movie, but it has like the Rocky Horror appeal.

343
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,720
It's best when it's seen in a theater.

344
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,540
You have to have like the audience participation.

345
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,480
For those that don't know, the show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio was Under Sedation

346
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,020
Live which was born of a Rocky Horror thing, like this was born of a DDR thing.

347
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,660
So I know very well the audience participation thing in and out.

348
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,280
have to have the audience participation all right I'll give it a try but see now

349
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm worried that I missed opening weekend because no one will go see it

350
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,700
with me that you know I'm gonna just kind of miss out on everything do you

351
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,320
know you threw snakes at the but you went with yeah we know some of the

352
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,820
something something awful kids yeah I went with a pair of goons we had rubber

353
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,200
snakes around our necks who were at random points were just throwing snakes

354
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,720
down into the crowd and the people are enjoying it everyone was heckling and

355
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,460
riffing and throwing the snakes back and forth.

356
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,840
It was a good time, but the movie itself will probably just lose its appeal when it's not

357
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,600
in a theater.

358
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,320
You know what movie was underappreciated for audience participation value?

359
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Showgirls.

360
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,000
Ugh, absolutely frightening.

361
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,400
Next up, that's pretty funny, Showgirls.

362
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,940
Moving on to something that could be only popular as a cult phenomenon, the PlayStation

363
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,940
3.

364
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,160
Oh, we pick on them so much.

365
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
I feel bad.

366
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
I've really tried not to.

367
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,520
I try to find positive stories.

368
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
I do.

369
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
I do too.

370
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
But did they go and say we're not making them the other day?

371
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Well, this is good.

372
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,920
I mean, okay, so the PlayStation 3 hasn't gone into development yet, but what happened

373
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,940
recently is Sega had a PlayStation 3 day and there was a demo of Full Auto 2 battle lines

374
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,900
and IGN got to take a peek at this and basically, to make a long story short, you know, obviously

375
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,940
the dev kits are there the controller was smart enough to realize what system

376
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,100
and what player it's connected to and the PlayStation Network appears to be up

377
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,380
and running at this time so the PlayStation Network platform appears to

378
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,940
be up and running because these folks were demoing the game on there and so

379
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,100
the developers are able to use it so something's ready so I guess that's a

380
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,380
good sign. Full Auto 2 wasn't bad I remember playing it at E3 it wasn't bad

381
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,140
I like full auto. It was okay.

382
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,060
It was okay. I don't know, I kinda think they'll be other driving games that'll make me go,

383
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,580
wow, a little more, but you know.

384
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,500
Like, uh, never mind.

385
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,140
I don't know.

386
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,660
Like, I wish... I'm not gonna say it, I swear to God I'm not gonna say it. I wish they could do like a Mario Kart,

387
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,740
I mean it's inevitable we'll have a Mario Kart on the Wii, but like a Mario Kart

388
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,760
in like super high def, 720 and all that, cause you know, obviously the Wii's not

389
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,620
gonna support that. I would like to see a very pretty Mario Kart. We need to get in contact with Square and have him do

390
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,060
Rad Racer 3. How about Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation, Chocobo Racing 2 on the

391
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,680
PlayStation 3, that's what I'd like to see.

392
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,700
That'd work. Alright, fine by me, we can agree on that.

393
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,820
Speaking about the Wii and online,

394
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,100
kind of the repeated something we were talking about earlier with Reggie

395
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,060
and talking about how the online service is going to be free

396
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,140
and basically kind of enhancing the way you're

397
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,860
playing games, which you know, you've probably already been doing that on Xbox Live.

398
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:24,860
But yeah, it's basically, it's gonna be massive amounts of hands-on activity as well as showcasing exactly how the Wii games are different.

399
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,860
They're talking about the, of course, their brand new games and how they're gonna market them and stuff.

400
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:40,860
And of course, we're gonna create advocacy and we're gonna make it so that everyone who tries the Wii experience talks to their friends and neighbors.

401
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,660
So, of course they're gonna do that because they're not showing it to the press.

402
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,860
They're showing it to secret parties of ravers.

403
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,940
I'll get my pacifier and candy bracelets ready for the

404
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,220
Wii bus to come by. No, but their online service is gonna be okay.

405
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,020
I'll get my Darude CD. Look at the, I mean, here's the thing too.

406
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,140
I mean, if you look about it, the

407
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,740
DS Wi-Fi connect service, you know, we hear people talking about that and stuff,

408
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,740
But we forget that PSP actually has their infrastructure

409
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,740
mode that, you know, is Wi-Fi online too, but,

410
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,140
I mean, you don't really see them pushing that very much,

411
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,940
which I find very interesting that Sony's not even trying to say, hey,

412
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,300
by the way, our games are also connected over the Internet

413
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,140
as well, but they don't really have a service

414
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,780
provided. I don't think they actually use Sony's servers or anything. Kind of like the PlayStation 2 does.

415
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,500
So, I thought that was interesting.

416
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,660
Well one new game that folks are going to be playing online and you know there's going to be some

417
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,460
hardcore nerds that are going to be into this game

418
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,100
And it's actually dark soccer and I got to check out this game at E3 and like a little behind the scenes thing and it's

419
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,380
Pretty cool at Star Trek Legacy is going to be coming out and what was announced this week

420
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,500
Is that all five original captains will be reprising their voices inside the game at E3

421
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,940
They wouldn't really tell us like they said they couldn't comment on the voice acting but that they were trying to get some big names

422
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Well, it looks like they pulled it off

423
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:13,120
Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Scott Bakula, Avery Brooks, and Kate Mulgrew have all stepped

424
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,780
up to be in the game.

425
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,220
That's right, Star Trek Legacy is kind of like a Star Trek fan's wet dream.

426
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:22,340
You basically can command any of the spaceships in the Star Trek.

427
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:29,460
When they say legacy, they are trying to encapsulate everything, and it's basically a ship strategic

428
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,940
command fighting game, which I think a lot of people are going to be really into, especially

429
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,020
the Star Trek fans, I think that kind of is a natural fit.

430
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,820
And you know, in seeing the early demo, it looks really, really good.

431
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,260
The game graphically is really well, and I kind of thought it was cool what they did

432
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,620
in the demo, and this was all real time when they did it, they kind of duplicated the big

433
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,740
fight from the end of Star Trek II Wrath of Khan, like the big Klingon fight at the end

434
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,500
there, so that was kind of neat, to kind of watch that being recreated in this game.

435
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,620
So if you're a Star Trek fan, you can't miss this one, you're gonna, especially with no

436
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,700
show on right now. You can spend your Saturday and Sunday afternoons instead of watching

437
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,620
the reruns. You can play some Star Trek Legacy and online.

438
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:17,220
It's pretty awesome. One cool game that's also coming out here, or I should say is already

439
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,900
out, by the creator of Warning Forever, you know, a fun game that I like to play, Rayhound.

440
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:30,300
And Rayhound is actually pretty cool. It requires, you actually don't shoot any weapons in this

441
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:40,300
What you have is these kind of turrets that are shooting at you, these lasers, and you can pull up a shield that causes the laser to basically spin around you in kind of an orbital fashion.

442
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,300
And you use that to throw the lasers back into the actual turrets themselves.

443
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,300
And each level as it progresses, more and more turrets are on the screen and gets more crazy.

444
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
You know, it's the kind of simple gameplay that's fun.

445
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,300
And what's great is you can actually download it for free.

446
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:03,120
So what you need to do is definitely check out the game because I did and it's awesome. You can find it at

447
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,680
www.18.big.or.jp and then the little

448
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,360
ampersand symbol

449
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,360
hiccoza.prod

450
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
and then

451
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,920
That should pull it up for you or just basically search for a warning forever in Rayhound and you'll find it in any search engine

452
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,920
But it's pretty sweet. So check it out.

453
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Alright. Well, I said earlier

454
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,440
during the bonus segment, which can only be heard live, but you folks on the

455
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,800
podcast don't know it yet,

456
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,160
we're going to be playing a game tonight in studio. The feedback to the match game

457
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,840
last week was pretty...

458
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,060
you guys seem to like that. So we want to do more of that here on the program.

459
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,600
So we're going to do another game tonight, and this is a new game that we

460
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,560
haven't done here on Orange Lounge Radio.

461
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,560
and it's called beat the host with a stick

462
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,240
K so we're gonna take a caller no because you might eat tonight you and

463

Yeah, he's happy. He got pictures. This is gonna be a fun game Ravenstaufen

470
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,160
How would you say your knowledge is on old-school video games?

471
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,920
Super Nintendo finesse, I guess I guess pretty good. Okay, would you be willing to challenge one of our hosts tonight in?

472
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,080
Exactly who's got more skill in identifying songs from old-school video games. Come on, you know, you want to throw down? Yeah

473
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,280
Yeah, I'll try. All right, I'm pretty sure I know old-school video games. All right, Ravenstaufen

474
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,960
And there's three people you can challenge tonight, you can't challenge me because I

475
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
wrote the damn thing, but you can challenge Drunami, Miklotov, or Loki, who's it going

476
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
to be?

477
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,720
Oh my god, I want Loki.

478
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Alright!

479
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,960
Raven's Dolphin is going to challenge Loki, Loki, I'm going to have to ask you to leave

480
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,360
the studio, because you're going to have to come in second, so please go to our isolation

481
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,440
room there, and you can come on back a little later.

482
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,180
Raven's Dolphin, I have to ask you to leave our chat room.

483
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,160
I see you logged in there right now, so I'm going to, actually I'm just going to go ahead

484
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,960
kick you from chat cuz we can't have them helping you out.

485
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,720
I'm kicking both those names from chat right now.

486
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,760
Alright, you ready to play? No, I still haven't closed the

487
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,120
chat client yet. Alright, that's right. I've booted you from the room so that you can't see.

488
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,700
Now our chat room can play along here. Here's how it's gonna work.

489
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,360
What we have is we have a one minute long

490
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,440
clip of songs strung together from

491
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,880
10 old 8-bit video games.

492
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,560
now you're gonna hear this one minute clip and it feel free if you have a pen

493
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,600
and pencil whatever you can start writing if you want

494
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,620
K at the end of this you're gonna have 30 seconds to tell me

495
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,680
what 10 games were in that clip

496
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,560
K and whoever gets more wins and if you actually win tonight's game we will let

497
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,120
you

498
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,640
do something very special in a couple weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio

499
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,800
regarding the DDR premieres we announced earlier this evening all right

500
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,120
all right sound good I'll try my best I can't

501
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,440
I can't guarantee anything.

502
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,520
All right, well try your best.

503
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,240
That's all we can ask.

504
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,200
And of course, chat room, feel free to play along.

505
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,560
You guys will actually get to hear this twice,

506
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,280
because you'll get to hear it again when

507
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,040
Logie comes back, and folks playing on the podcast as well.

508
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,880
We have a lot of folks out there that I know

509
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,760
think they could do really well on this, so see how well you do.

510
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,260
All right?

511
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,600
All right, you ready, Rafe and Dolphin?

512
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,680
You only get to hear it once.

513
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,200
You ready?

514
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,700
All right.

515
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,000
All right, here we go.

516
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Alright Ravenstaufen, you have 30 seconds to name back 10 games.

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,400
I don't know the other ones. I was gonna say a site fight, but

520
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I'm sure that's wrong

521
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
No

522
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,680
Uh, I sure I heard of what was it forget I told you

523
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,680

524
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,000
I'll forget it. Alright time's up

528
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,160
Drunami if you'd be so kind run out and get Loki for us

529
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,080

530
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,840
all right

531
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,960
all right

532
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,520
welcome back, Loki

533
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,680
alright, and Loki's getting situated here back in studio

534
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,860
okay here's how it's gonna work, Loki

535
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,140
you're gonna hear a one-minute clip of ten

536
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,800
old-school 8-bit Nintendo games music all strung together

537
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,460
then you're gonna have 30 seconds after you hear the clip

538
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,220
to repeat back to me

539
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,180
the ten songs that you heard in the clip, alright?

540
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,180
No. Any way you want, okay?

541
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,680
Okay.

542
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
Alright, so you ready?

543
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,180
Yeah.

544
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Here we go, you only get to hear this once.

545
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,680
Now you can feel free, you can actually make notes, or make notes there if you want, okay?

546
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,180
Because we let him write, but he wasn't allowed to be in the chat room to do that.

547
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,680
Well, hold on.

548
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,180
So you can't be in chat either, Loki.

549
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,680
I'm not, well I'm not even watching chat, I'm just...

550
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,180
Alright.

551
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,680
Hold on, hold on.

552
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,680
I want to kick you from chat anyway.

553
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Alright.

554
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,680
You're a bastard.

555
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,680
Alright. You ready?

556
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Hold on.

557
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Alright.

558
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I don't...

559
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,180
He's bringing up Notepad here.

560
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Yes I am.

561
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,480
We are playing Beat the Host here on Orange Lounge Radio.

562
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,520
Do you feel pretty confident about how you did Raven's Dolphin?

563
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,340
Don't tell him the score, but do you think you feel confident with your score?

564
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,420
I feel pretty.

565
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,540
You feel pretty?

566
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,100
I feel pretty too.

567
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,100
You ready, Loki?

568
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
I am.

569
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
Quit wasting time here.

570
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,100
Here we go!

571
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:47,500
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

572
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:36,820
All right, Loki, that was the clip.

573
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,580
You have 30 seconds to say them back.

574
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,580
Go.

575
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,580
Yes.

576
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Final Fantasy.

577
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
Yes.

578
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,580
Ice Climber.

579
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Yes.

580
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
Goonies 2.

581
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
Yes.

582
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Uh, Metroid.

583
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Yes.

584
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
And...

585
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,580
Aw, crap.

586
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,580
Um...

587
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,580
I should write down more of these.

588
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,580
That's all I got.

589
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,580
You sure?

590
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,580
You have 20 more seconds.

591
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
I'm thinking.

592
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,180
I only wrote down like half of them.

593
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,020
Just start naming titles, you might get it.

594
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Time's almost up!

595
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
No.

596
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Five seconds.

597
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
That's true.

598
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,020
And...

599
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Time's up!

600
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,780
All right, yep, it's tied up.

601
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:14,740
Ravenstaufen got five and Loki got five.

602
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,380
So it's all tied up.

603
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,740
And since I wasn't creative enough

604
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,460
to think of a tiebreaker, it will just

605
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,340
have to be a stalemate, OK?

606
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,100
That's fine by me.

607
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,060
All right, so Ravenstaufen, you know what?

608
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,020
We could be nice.

609
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,580
What do you think, Loki?

610
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,140
Should we just give him the prize anyway?

611
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:27,540
Sure.

612
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,100
All right, Ravenstaufen, we'll see you back here in two weeks.

613
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,100
You're going to help us out with the DDR Power Preview, OK?

614
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,540
Ooh, can't wait.

615
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,900
All right, sounds good.

616
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,260
That's genuine excitement.

617
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,820
But Ravenstaufen, I bet you're dying to know what the correct answers were.

618
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
I'm dying.

619
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
Alright, here we go.

620
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Here they are, chat room.

621
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Metroid.

622
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,820
I can't believe no one got the next one.

623
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!

624
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,660
I forgot to write it down, that's why I did it by memory.

625
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,660
Super Mario Bros. 3.

626
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,660
Willow.

627
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,660
Shadowgate.

628
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
I should remember that.

629
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:06,660
Shadow Gates.

630
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,260
Final Fantasy.

631
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:22,180
Ice Climber.

632
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Goonies 2

633
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,100
Gyruss, which you DDR people should know. Gyruss.

634
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,300
And lastly, Ninja Gaiden.

635
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,740
That was the 10.

636
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,480
You should be lucky that you did not pick me because I got 6.

637
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,860
Oh, thank god. Well, I would have had 6 too had I wrote down all the titles instead of saying,

638
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,220
I'll remember the first two.

639
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,260
I think I would have got like three, so I was the easy kill.

640
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,140
So you could have won flat out if you tried to do that.

641
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,380
But I told the chatroom I knew a lot of them, so I saved face.

642
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,820
But now that I admitted it, I lost my saving face.

643
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,020
All right, chatroom once posted there,

644
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,460
so I will post the list there on orangelaundraider.com.

645
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,340
Click on Chat.

646
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,940
There's the list for you folks in chat.

647
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,760
Ravenstaufen, thanks so much for playing our dumb little game

648
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,260
with us.

649
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,500
Sorry you did not get to beat the host tonight,

650
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,540
but maybe next time.

651
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,880
You got to push him a little bit.

652
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,500
It was a push.

653
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,020
yeah that was fun all right anything else you want to share with listeners before we uh let you

654
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:28,420
go and get back to the news snakes on a plane looks funny the way you said that was funny i

655
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:34,100
have to say and it is funny in a very dark sort of way all right it's like a dark comedy it's

656
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:38,900
great all right take care ravens dolphin have a good one bye that was really weird how he said

657
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:45,060
that yeah he got really excited about that one he kind of sounded like um god what's that ashtin

658
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,440
Kuchar when he said that a little bit anyway I was trying to see how well the

659
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,860
chat room did there looks like some folks really like the game I want to see

660
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,280
that again so we'll do that so it looks like willow is the big stumper for most

661
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,760
people there but for what it's worth I thought the last one was double dragon

662
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,320
not Ninja Gaiden I know very close for next time to write down everything I

663
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,320
hear instead of just saying oh I'll remember those and not to go it's tough

664
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,600
I figured folks in chat would really like that game and the folks listening

665
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,280
on the podcast because you kind of get to play you should have done more random

666
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,400
games like throwing a pickle cubicle or something like that. You know what, if we do it again,

667
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,320
maybe it'll be Super Nintendo, maybe we'll be arcade. You know, if I wanted to be really

668
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,560
mean, I'd do Commodore 64 games. Do Virtual Boy games. Alright. Maybe some other time

669
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,760
we'll do Beat the Host with a stick, but for now we're going to get back into the gaming

670
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,400
news. Anyways, there is a rumor going around this week that Walmart had stopped selling

671
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:46,720
bully because of pressure from a certain somebody and we'll call him J.T. and rhymes with Fuck

672
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:56,160
Omsen. Anyways, it's not. It didn't have anything to do with him and it says, it's actually

673
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,180
because they decided as a company policy not to take pre-orders on titles that aren't rated

674
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:08,900
yet and it was funny though because Walmart spokesperson John Simley he made

675
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,380
a comment he saw I'd like to give credit to Jack Thompson but there are a lot of

676
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:16,380
Jack Thompson's out there and we are just listening to our customers I think

677
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,260
he means there are a lot of jack offs out there and it says the decision has

678
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:26,740
not been made on whether the chain will which sells 127 million customers a day

679
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,740
will carry boldly once it is rated and available for sale it says if it comes

680
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,900
out as adults only. We think that's something that we're not going to carry. I think first

681
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,740
we look at the rating, but more likely it's going to be mature.

682
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart anyway because indirectly you're supporting

683
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,660
their electronics department, which would be the music as well, and I hate, hate, hate

684
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,840
the fact they censor music the way they do. They refuse to sell CDs in the store unless

685
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:59,540
there's like a clean version. It's like, you know, here at Walmart we're going to sell

686
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:05,380
the statue of David, but we've put, you know, tighty-whities on it, you know, it's like,

687
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,780
that's not, you've ruined the art, you know, I don't, anyway, this is kind of getting a

688
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,860
little bit outside, but I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart, and I realize

689
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,540
some folks feel they have no other choice, living in a remote area, you know, where maybe

690
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:22,180
Walmart is the only big game retailer you have, but, online, my friends, seriously,

691
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,140
I would rather buy my, even if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would rather buy

692
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,440
my games online than buy them at Walmart.

693
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,460
And this show will never be carried to Walmart, thanks to my little rant there, but that's

694
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,460
alright.

695
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,460
I don't care.

696
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,140
Oh, we're too far off the radar for Big Bad Walmart.

697
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,380
I will admit I bought my copy of 99 Nights at Target, which probably isn't much better,

698
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,620
but the other place I wanted to go to first was out of it, and I really wanted 99 Nights.

699
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:53,540
Hey, Target got a mention in a Freezepop song that makes them okay by me.

700
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,500
Call me a hypocrite if you want, I don't care.

701
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,420
All right, this is some pretty interesting news

702
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,420
here regarding the Xbox and the Xbox Live Vision camera.

703
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,100
The Xbox Live Vision camera is going

704
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,540
to come out with a game called Totem Ball.

705
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,580
And when the Vision camera launches in September,

706
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,180
this will be included with it.

707
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,860
Totem Ball was developed by UK studio Strange Flavor

708
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,780
and Freeverse, who made Toy Sight for the Apple Eye Sight.

709
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,980
Was this the game we played at E3 for a little bit?

710
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,740
I seem to remember.

711
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,940
But it was on the PC camera, wasn't it?

712
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,700
No, it was the Vision Camera.

713
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:31,700
It just, it sucked because there's people walking behind you, so you had to raise like one hand to...

714
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,740
It was, you used your hands, like think of Itoy, basically.

715
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,940
It was like trying to play Itoy with the Today Show behind you,

716
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,140
that whole set where they have all the people moving and it just throws everything off.

717
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:41,860
You couldn't do it.

718
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,020
However, though, there is some rumors, though.

719
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,780
Actually, I should say that that might not exactly be true, that Totem Ball's coming with it.

720
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:58,280
The reason being is that some of the Live Vision cameras have actually sneaked out in Toys R Us lately, and some people have already purchased them.

721
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:08,780
And they said that it's included one month of Xbox Live Gold, as well as a registration key for UNO, as I previously said on a podcast.

722
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:19,280
But, what you might end up finding out a little bit later on, as I think I mentioned before, there is two bundles that they're going to be having.

723
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,380
one that's for $39.99 and one that's $79.99 and the $79.99 one might come with totem ball

724
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,240
and I think it's supposed to come with a year of Xbox Live Gold as well.

725
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Interesting.

726
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,520
All right, well we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take your calls.

727
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,660
If you want to call our show, you can hit us up on the Skype line at interact with us

728
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:47,160

729
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,300
But remember, that is not an 800 number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, you best

730
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,420
be getting some permission.

731
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,420
We already have a call.

732
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:54,420
Let's go to the line.

733
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Hello?

734
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,420
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

735
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,420
Who's this?

736
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
Hey, Rob.

737
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,200
It's the other Drew.

738
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,880
The other Drew.

739
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,640
Is this the Drew that goes by Cutress online?

740
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,640
That would be it.

741
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,640
Hey, how you doing?

742
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,640
Hey, it's Cutress.

743
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Hey, Shane.

744
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
What's up?

745
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,640
And Suikoden sucks.

746
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,640
What?

747
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,640
Kick him off right now.

748
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,640
No, no, no.

749
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,640
No, no, no. I gotta let him plug the site he works for.

750
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Shouldn't I boot in?

751
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,640
No, we're good buddies with this site. So, Cutrus, where do you work, quote-unquote?

752
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
I guess it's more of a hobby, but so is what we do.

753
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,640
Oh, well, it's not like I was just calling in to plug DDRFreak, but yeah, there you go.

754
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:39,640
All right, I wanted to let you plug DDRFreak, though. So, what are you calling in about tonight?

755
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,640
Well, first off, I had to make sure that everyone knew that Sui Godin sucks.

756
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,280
Why are you letting him still talk?

757
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,280
Because it's funny.

758
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,280
It's not.

759
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,560
He's saying lies.

760
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
Let's take a quick vote.

761
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
How many people think...

762
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Me!

763
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,560
And that's all I...

764
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,560
No.

765
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,560
Shh.

766
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,560
How many people think Cutress is funny in the room?

767
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,560
Let's see.

768
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Oh.

769
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
Well, we got two.

770
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Oh.

771
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
And how many people think Cutress is not funny?

772
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
And we have two.

773
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,560
Me.

774
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,560
Oh, and I break ties.

775
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
No.

776
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,780
Actually, the two full-time hosts here voted that he is funny and the two peon guests voted

777
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,360
that he wasn't funny. I'm going to delete a lot of stuff off your

778
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,820
computer tonight. Cutress, please stop poking me.

779
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,320
Look, let's stop taking up his time. Cutress, please, whatever you want to say on your mind

780
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:28,940
besides the fact that Suikoden sucks. Well, for one thing, next time you do the

781
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,100
music game, you need to have Mega Man music in there because that's sort of mandatory.

782
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,680
Look, I have to save something for next time. I couldn't blow the Blaster Master wad on

783
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,180
the first go, okay? And Mega Man and all that other stuff.

784
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,180
You know I love me some Mega Man and some Blaster Master, but I have to wait.

785
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:50,180
Yeah, if you had gotten me in, I would have gotten seven of ten.

786
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:54,180
Oh, looks like I do have some competition.

787
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:58,180
A little Drew vs. Drew action, huh?

788
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,180
That sounds like a porno, be quiet.

789
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,180
That was the intent.

790
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,180
What games have you been playing lately, Drew?

791
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,180
Well, I just finished Dragon Quest a couple days ago.

792
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm pretty much wrapping up all the rest of the endgame stuff in that, and pretty much

793
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:23,500
everything I have is packed up right now. I kept out Front Mission 4 and Curse of Darkness.

794
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,500
Very cool.

795
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,420
So that's basically all I've got until I move into my new house and unpack everything again.

796
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:35,020
I just quit FF11 so that I could finally start playing my console games again.

797
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,040
uh... i remember quitting final fantasy eleven to free myself to play other video

798
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,640
games you come back you always do

799
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,300
i remember when i quit also

800
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,240
didn't happen last night or today

801
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,820
yet by the way i think that's fine backup from has eleven last night

802
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,460
because he's weak you we everybody he's weak

803
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,660
we're going to see why

804
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,900
that

805
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,860
i've got to have this real quick

806
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,740
he said is why you like secret

807
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,620
i like sweet sweet cones

808
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,380
Suikoden's good, it's not as good as Phom Pants. He's not getting this mic again as long as you're on the

809
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,380
pipeline. Before, okay, before Miggletov cries and we have a scene, Cutress, I have to ask you, since you

810
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,500
are, you know, the forum guy on DDR Freak,

811
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,020
anybody who's on DDR Freak knows you, I gotta know, what do you think about

812
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,140
DDR Supernova?

813
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,820
You know, I've gotten to play it only once and I only played

814
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,500
two games of it and basically I was just so out of shape and

815
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,900
out of whack that I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore

816
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:32,900
because I was taking up too much time from other people. I know people are

817
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,220
complaining about the sink and everything, but I haven't noticed any problems myself.

818
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,540
I'm enjoying it. It's fun. That's all there really is to it.

819
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,100
No, I didn't notice the sink problems either. I have a life. But I agree with you on the

820
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,060
fact that we all got out of shape because Konami didn't put out a new game for forever.

821
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,780
We all got burned out on Extreme and now we're all fat and don't want to play DDR again.

822
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,660
Wait, sink? Get it?

823
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,500
Shut up!

824
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:07,060
I'm not the sort of guy that runs vertex squared through my head when I'm having sex, so I

825
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,700
don't notice these sync issues.

826
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,220
Oh, and the group sucks.

827
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,220
Wow.

828
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,220
Okay.

829
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,300
Cutress, anything else you want to share with our listeners so we can take more calls?

830
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,580
No, just thanks for having me on the show again, and I wish I could hang out with you

831
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,580
guys more.

832
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Not a problem.

833
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,580
Come visit the Bay.

834
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,180
It's a real bummer about E3, but maybe there'll be something.

835
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,740
We should have a DDR con or something fun.

836
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,660
Yeah, hopefully.

837
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,300
I can't wait to hang out with you guys again.

838
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:30,960
Sounds good.

839
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,740
Have a good one, Cutrus.

840
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,260
Take care.

841
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,540
Bye.

842
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,620
Bye-bye.

843
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:36,860
All right, thank you, Cutrus, for being on the program tonight.

844
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,860
Let's take another call.

845
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,860
Drew, real quick.

846
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,140
Yeah, how's that for new low?

847
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,980
I'm actually making get it jokes on the air.

848
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,620
Be quiet.

849
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,660
Let's go to another call.

850
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,080
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

851
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:45,740
Who's this?

852
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:46,380
It's Ronma.

853
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,980
Who do you think it is?

854
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,460
Hello, Ronma.

855
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,580
God, you have a way of getting through every week.

856
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:52,140
What's on your mind?

857
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,460
We're getting hammered tonight, too, and you get through.

858
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,820
Oh, I have three things I want to talk about, three things.

859
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,380
Make them quick.

860
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,380
Number one.

861
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,660
First thing, this whole high def versus standard definition, fuck it.

862
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,260
I have a nice 20 inch TV, it's standard def, it looks great.

863
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:16,020
I don't care about this high def fly through, it's just a console, I mean, I just don't

864
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,820
get it, you know, it's just...

865
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,820
Okay.

866
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,020
Rama, surely you've heard this old saying, okay, have you ever heard this old saying,

867
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,460
once you go black you never go back. That's because we won't let you go free.

868
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,100
Yeah, same, apply that thought to an HDTV,

869
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,220
seriously, because like once I bought an HDTV

870
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,740
I can't watch standard anymore. I know,

871
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:41,820
I used to play my PS2 on a 55 inch high definition TV,

872
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,020
but when I moved I had a 20 inch SD, standard deaf television,

873
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,100
to me it just looks the same. I enjoyed both of it, you know?

874
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:56,260
All right, well, you know, I I can appreciate that because that tells me that you are about the game first the graphic second

875
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,620
Yes, definitely. All right. What's the second thing you want to call it about?

876
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:08,140
I was kind of tired of the other DDR families in chat. Shut up. It's just a game

877
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:14,780
What what were they saying in chat? I missed it. I mean, we're it was like if your announcement about DDR

878
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,680
Somebody said you guys sold up the Konami. I'm like

879
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:40,200
We are a radio station, and on radio stations they play music, DDR of which has a lot of

880
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,240
music.

881
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:43,240
This partnership makes a lot of sense to me.

882
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,840
I don't know about the rest of you.

883
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,960
This is something that we would have done for Konami three years ago, but whatever.

884
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:49,960
It's finally happening now.

885
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
It's great.

886
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
All right.

887
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,960
Here you go.

888
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,960
Number three.

889
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
The last thing is the whole thing about the PS3.

890
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,960
It's $400, $500.

891
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,320
Some people are forgetting about another console that came out that was just as expensive.

892
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,320
What's that?

893
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,320
NeoGeo.

894
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,320
Ah.

895
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,160
But then again, the NeoGeo wasn't exactly...

896
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:16,320
The Neo Geo was like the rich kid system, you know what I mean?

897
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,840
Everybody knew some rich kid who actually had a Neo Geo.

898
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,520
And the difference is, it had games that kicked major amounts of ass.

899
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,040
It did, but it also, towards at least the end of the run, like you know the first wave

900
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,200
of games was pretty cool, but towards the end of the run it was all Bust-A-Move, King

901
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,440
of Fighters, you know, 99, all that stuff.

902
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,240
I mean, that's all it ever was in the end, which is kinda sadder than something wrong

903
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,240
with King of Fighters?

904
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,720
No, but I'm just saying, I wouldn't buy a console just for King of Fighters.

905
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,400
Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the Neo Geo, but I wouldn't have spent that much money

906
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,400
on it.

907
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:50,900
Yeah, exactly. I mean, all the Neo-Jillies is King of Fighters. You know what, fuck King of Fighters.

908
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,900
I like King of Fighters, not some impact for the PS2, because it's got great graphics or whatever.

909
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:01,900
Each version is just like, same thing, new characters. David, come on. Show me something I'm gonna enjoy.

910
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,400
Neo-Wave, I was happy for it. It got ported back to SNK Arcade, but I mean, fuck, come on.

911
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,900
What is Madden? What is Madden? It's the same game over and over with little upgrades, right?

912
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,980
Thatís why I donít play men, I play Tecmo Bowl.

913
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,980
Tecmo Bowl for life.

914
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Rama, weíve got to let you go.

915
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:19,980
Take more calls.

916
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,780
One more thing, rat race of three, PS2, thatís why I wonít, bye.

917
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:28,700
With the 3D glasses, I hope.

918
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,140
Your calls, weíre taking them tonight here on orangeloundrater.com.

919
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:36,660
Go to www.orangeloundrater.com and click on ìinteract with usî or you can always pick

920
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:41,420
up the telephone and call us that way, 916-226-9067.

921
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,900
Hey, podcast listeners, are you pissed off at the call-in segment because it's always

922
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,500
the same people calling in?

923
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,380
Well, you should call us sometime.

924
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,860
Hi, you're on Warner's Lounge Radio.

925
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
Who's this?

926
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,860
It's DMN.

927
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,860
Hi, DMN.

928
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,620
What's on your mind?

929
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,740
Not much.

930
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:03,620
I wanted to comment about the whole BDR TV show thing, too, but first I want to congratulate

931
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,300
you guys on getting that association with Kami.

932
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,380
I'm really excited about hearing the new music.

933
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
We're excited about it, too.

934
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,380
I think itís going to be a fun time.

935
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,380
Thank you.

936
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,900
Now, letís bag on the TV show a little bit.

937
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:23,820
Iím going to be a bit of a devilís advocate about this whole slumber party gang thing.

938
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,820
Fair enough.

939
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:25,820
We need it.

940
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,540
Youíve got to look.

941
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,900
Whenever youíre at the arcade being the seasoned DVR veterans that all of us are, who do you

942
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,700
see annoys the ever-loving shit out of you on those machines?

943
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,860
The target audience is slumber party girls.

944
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:48,220
I think Konami is targeting that demographic.

945
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,580
I think they're doing it right.

946
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:55,300
I think it's going to be a laughing stock set for the rest of us, but I think it'll

947
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,220
catch whoever watches Saturday morning TV and it'll sell more copies, and that's what

948
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,220
Konami wants to do.

949
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,220
Right.

950
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,060
And to play devil's advocate to devil's advocate.

951
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,860
I understand what Konami is trying to do with that, and you do make a good point.

952
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:14,660
But you can't help, but as a long-time DDR fan, before there were little girls everywhere,

953
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,260
you can't help but cringe a little bit inside, because this doesn't help the whole people

954
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,060
walking behind the machine going, that's gay thing that I was talking about earlier, you

955
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,060
know?

956
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,740
Yeah, well no, I cringe at the thought too, but I see where they're going from a business

957
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,740
standpoint.

958
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,500
So, I kind of wish if they're going to do this, that they would also do a DDR macho

959
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,340
show on Spike TV as well or something.

960
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,700
No, I don't know.

961
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:44,740
I think you can't let society, and this goes with anything, you can't let society tell

962
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,220
you what to do essentially, and if you enjoy something, you should wear it proud, you know

963
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,220
what I mean?

964
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,460
So even though we joke about, you know, we don't like the people that come behind the

965
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:00,560
machine and go, that's gay, that's gay, I think that you should have enough confidence

966
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,540
in yourself to be able to do whatever you want, you know what I mean?

967
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,260
And I think if you do, and DDR is a very social game, a friendly game, and I remember some

968
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,300
kid once did this to me when I was on the machine, and Jamie tore him a new asshole.

969
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,860
He was like, do you want to challenge him on the game?

970
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:16,860
Do you want to fight?

971
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,760
Here, I will pay for you to play against Rob, and we'll see who does better on the game.

972
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,520
So that situation has happened with all of us.

973
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,740
That's why Jamie's on this program, by the way, because she has her moments of gold like

974
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,460
that, which you just got to love.

975
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,520
You just got to love.

976
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:34,240
I think we should look on the bright side of this whole slumber party, girls, though.

977
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,800
appeal to the uh...

978
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,540
twenty-something female demographic who thinks it's oddly cute

979
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,620
might get more of a turnout in the arcades there. Alright, DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

980
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,200
Um, go to PAX

981
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,520
and the Wii's coming soon.

982
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,640
Alright, thank you very much, we appreciate that. Alright. Alright, bye bye. Take care guys.

983
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,240
Alright, let's do at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we'll

984
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,000
uh... probably go and tie up the show.

985
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,360
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

uh... well i just i wanted to share my opinion on something real quick lies

993
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,740
these are lies that he's going to be talking about this game

994
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,500
it is called sui coden ah yes sui coden i've heard of this game

995
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,760
can we hang up on him please? didn't you get your name from a character in sui coden

996
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,480
Yes, he's the best character ever.

997
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,160
An ambiguously gay character.

998
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,160
Ambiguous.

999
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,280
Alright, uh, yes, Bobby, I'd love to know your thoughts on Sweet Coden.

1000
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,800
I thought it sucked.

1001
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,680
I think you suck.

1002
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,560
Okay, why does Sweet Coden suck?

1003
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,720
No, it's mainly just to piss Miklotov off.

1004
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,720
Yeah, oh okay.

1005
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,720
And it works.

1006
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,720
You actually think it's a good game?

1007
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Deep inside?

1008
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,400
I like the first and the third one.

1009
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,800
What about two?

1010
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,160
Besides the translation.

1011
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:59,320
It was so hard to find.

1012
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,400
I haven't played it.

1013
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,120
I can't even find it. Oh, yeah, cuz it's like two hundred fifty dollars. Yeah, I'm not gonna pay 25

1014
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,120
I wrote that game really well

1015
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,760
All right

1016
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,280
Bobby anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1017
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,360
No, that was it. I was just doing this for the chat room. All right, I appreciate it

1018
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,960
Take care Bobby

1019
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:25,480
Comedy gold you can hear little gems like that on his program. I like how people call in to make me wine

1020
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,560
That's why you're here, that's why you're here, because you're a whiner.

1021
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,960
All right, any last minute stories, folks, on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

1022
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,960
But of course.

1023
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,960
Okay.

1024
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,400
So we'll start off with some wonderful homebrew programs, of course.

1025
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,480
If you are a fan of Metroid and you want to play a new side-scrolling version of Metroid,

1026
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:54,900
they have Metroid Return of the SA-X 2.0 for the PSP.

1027
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,660
And this one, of course, is still kind of a work in progress. They just now added a

1028
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:05,060
health bar and the ability to go into more than one room. So, yeah, that's interesting.

1029
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:12,060
But it's still in development, so look forward to more stuff from that. And, of course, if

1030
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:17,900
you're looking for a nice clone, in fact, I think a lot of people got in trouble for

1031
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,460
the Grid Wars. Now they have Trigonometry Wars, the final version, out for the PSP.

1032
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:30,460
and you download it on PSP updates. Definitely something fun if you like Geometry Wars.

1033
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,660
I heard about all the scandal going around there with Geometry Wars.

1034
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,220
Yeah. The clones at least. And people getting sued and stuff.

1035
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,980
I have one quick last minute story if you're done with that one. I just want to say real quick

1036
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,580
with Madden 07 coming out, Slashdot ran a recent

1037
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,980
piece reminding you that EA has a pretty

1038
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,940
interesting privacy policy on Xbox Live. Now you've probably heard this talked about

1039
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,020
about before on other shows, but remember, and I think we've talked about it too, but

1040
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,920
remember the Madden 07 is coming out soon.

1041
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,660
So when you sign on to an EA game on Xbox Live, you are automatically creating an EA

1042
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,340
online account and granting Electronic Arts the ability to collect your name, address,

1043
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:09,900
and credit card information, as well as a variety of demographic information about how

1044
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,380
you use their products.

1045
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,140
Not only that, they explicitly say that they may tie these demographics to your personal

1046
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,480
information.

1047
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,460
It's not anonymous here.

1048
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,860
Now a site called Gamers with Jobs actually cornered EA and Microsoft about these issues

1049
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:27,820
and they were met with silence, probably because of the fact that Madden is coming out next

1050
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,820
week.

1051
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,460
No official comment from the companies, which just goes to show that EA obviously must have

1052
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,140
an evil, invasive privacy policy.

1053
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,580
So think twice before you play Madden Online.

1054
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
Yes, Drew.

1055
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,480
I do have an additional quickie.

1056
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,980
Just was released a couple days ago.

1057
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,280
We have the multiplayer version of F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. Combat, has been released to the public

1058
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,400
for free.

1059
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,180
You can sign up for a free CD key and a download of the game.

1060
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,800
I don't know the link offhand, but I know we have a link to it in our O.L. Army Clan

1061
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,800
section.

1062
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,360
I was going to say, there's already an O.L. Army Clan building up for this.

1063
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,960
I definitely want to check out the game next week.

1064
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,000
I just finished downloading and installing it.

1065
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,760
I'm going to be checking it out tonight.

1066
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,760
Very cool.

1067
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,600
Oh my god, I'm so scared of this game.

1068
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
I just saw...

1069
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,600
What's that?

1070
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:18,280
mentioned last week Happy Feet's coming out on the Wii. I've got happy feet

1071
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,720
okay happy happy feet for those who don't know is kind of like a spoof of

1072
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,200
will they have happy Wii okay no no no get this okay so happy happy feet

1073
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:35,640
basically as you might know or not know it is a movie kind of spoofing the whole

1074
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,920
March of the Penguins thing it's got penguins doing stuff however happy feet

1075
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:47,480
the game is gonna be like DDR and with arrows and all so when I said you could

1076
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,960
strap the Wii controller to your feet I I wasn't exactly too far off was I who

1077
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,200
you were not interesting so that that's kind of interesting some other fun stuff

1078
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:02,960
especially when again the speculation area here the PSP being redesigned kind

1079
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,240
of almost like a PSP light supposed to be coming out in March you wonder where

1080
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,520
got that idea. And, well, it says it's supposed to be like the PSP Lite, I didn't call it

1081
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:19,520
the PSP Lite. Alright. Anyways, PSP 2 or whatever. It's gonna include 8 gigs of flash memory

1082
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:28,120
for storing your wonderful movies and stuff on, as well as they're getting rid of the

1083
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:34,400
UMD slot the way that it is now. You'll actually insert the UMDs into the system, like the

1084
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:43,280
DS and just getting shrunken down like the DS and yeah so that's kind of

1085
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,680
interesting and they're not really talking about how they're gonna oh a

1086
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:52,280
second analog nub on there as well GS 68 in our chat room says please fix the D

1087
01:02:52,280 --> 01:03:00,320
pad Sony um and then finally of course you gotta mention this speaking of

1088
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:07,320
of speculation, the Xbox 360 is supposed to get another SKU. And apparently, rumor for

1089
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:14,580
now, it's going to be a black Xbox 360 with a built-in HD DVD drive, an HDMI AV out, 250

1090
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:21,400
gig hard drive, and PVR functions, like Xbox Live slash DirecTV or that kind of stuff.

1091
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,100
Planned for $600 U.S.

1092
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:26,320
Oh, yeah, that's a brilliant idea, Microsoft.

1093
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,960
This is in the official Xbox magazine, so, um, rumor for now.

1094
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,440
Wait, you had me going bullshit until you said it was in the official Xbox magazine?

1095
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,040
Yeah, it's rumor though, probably.

1096
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,040
Okay.

1097
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,040
I don't know.

1098
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,880
A black Xbox 360, huh?

1099
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:43,880
Something for the emo kids.

1100
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:44,880
Maybe, I don't know.

1101
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,560
It sounds a little weird, but, um, I don't know.

1102
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,600
And I finally, I thought I'd mention the lineup since Live Arcade Wednesdays is still going

1103
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,600
on.

1104
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,480
We had Texas Hold'em coming out free of charge, as we mentioned, for 48 hours.

1105
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:05,440
The week after that, though, we've seen some more stuff, including, I know, what was it,

1106
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,440
Time Pilot?

1107
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Yay!

1108
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
Time Pilot, and then Scramble.

1109
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,440
Yeah, I can do without Scramble.

1110
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
So.

1111
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
Yeah.

1112
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,440
That's it.

1113
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,440
Huh.

1114
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:15,440
Interesting.

1115
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:20,440
As somebody mentioned in the chat room, and it's true, the black Xbox 360 isn't that special

1116
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,120
because those are the dev kits, also.

1117
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,560
And you have the faceplates, too, right?

1118
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,780
We mean you could make your Xbox 360 black looking with the new face

1119
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:32,440
Well, I'm just saying we already have 360s in existence that are black

1120
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,200
So it's not like a huge step up just like how the Xbox 1.0's

1121
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,720
Dev kits were green like the halo Xboxes

1122
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,080
Oh, I know I make sense and the better ones are the white ones are huge

1123
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:50,920
I'd mention one last thing for the PSP another homebrew game our gear to tribute to our type and it looks fucking awesome

1124
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,320
So go download it. All right, that's it. All right

1125
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:58,000
Well, I guess it's about time to wrap up the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1126
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,400
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us this week, but we do have one more story

1127
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,240
for you guys tonight, Loki, and this is just, we saved this for the end because this is

1128
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,200
just one of those WTF stories.

1129
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:15,080
Well, if you were a high school student, and of course in a math class you probably were

1130
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:22,480
playing with a TI calculator, or TI-83 in this case, well, there's somebody creating

1131
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,120
the homebrew Zelda game for it and yeah it's pretty much using some of the

1132
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:33,920
sprites from like Link's Awakening and stuff and pretty amazing and I guess

1133
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:41,640
apparently he's already done a port of Harvest Moon and so yeah it's 50% done

1134
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,840
so far and it looks pretty cool. If I remember correctly they actually did

1135
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:50,280
port Link's Awakening 2 at TI-83 back in the day. I remember the only completely

1136
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,000
original Zelda game on a calculator?

1137
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,160
The only good thing about the old graphing calculators was that, like, you could type

1138
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,960
letters into them so you could essentially, like, I know I used to do this for calculus

1139
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:05,800
tests all the time, I'd put in the notes in my calculator and cheat.

1140
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Exactly.

1141
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
Because I was smart.

1142
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,740
Well, I remember with, like, the TI-83, you know, big thing when I was just going in high

1143
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:16,520
school is they actually, you know, finally got it to run assembly on there and then you

1144
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:22,260
could do grayscale and just like crazy shit on a calculator I don't know I

1145
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,780
remember that's how that's why I had to drop my calculus class because I was

1146
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,540
programming games in it instead of listening a lot of ti-83 love in the

1147
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:37,100
chat room gs68 says I use my ti-83 plus to play fire track kind of crappy shmup

1148
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:42,220
and some folks are saying yay Zelda game and so on and so forth

1149
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,740
evilcheese666 OMG I love those calculators

1150
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:49,780
so a lot of love for the old graphing calculators alright

1151
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,720
well that's about the end of the program but of course we have to go around to

1152
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,380
get everybody's

1153
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:57,780
final thought I'm sure if DarkSakura were here she would say reject faults

1154
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,500
icons

1155
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,360
but she'll be back next week I should point out about next week

1156
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,220
next week's show will not be taped live on Sunday night

1157
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:10,980
this is because I know this is going to sound hella lame I have concert tickets on Sunday

1158
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,460
that I got for my birthday but and the person didn't realize that I would have

1159
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,920
orange lounge so of course I got to go because it's a birthday gift and I'm

1160
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,860
going to see journey how cool is that I'm hoping they'll have the old-school

1161
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:27,060
game there but yeah so we're gonna pre tape next week more news to come to the

1162
