5888	14730	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15450	19130	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
21351	24171	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 194 for this August the 6th of 2006.
27734	28134	OrangeLoungeRadio.com
50683	52264	More gaming news now, Loki.
52544	58807	Yes, this news is actually a little bit about the DS and how it might interact with the Wii and stuff.
59407	71594	One of the things that they're speculating is going to be announced on the 23rd as well in their Nintendo press conference there is going to be about motion sensing control coming to the DS.
72514	73535	And they're saying that...
74488	81673	One of the first games that's actually going to use it is Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam, which you might remember is coming out on the DS and on the Wii, so that's going to be interesting.
82073	87356	It's going to basically be an accessory that slides into the Game Boy Advance slot, very similar to the Rumble Kart.
88057	93380	And they're going to also be using it with games like Excite Truck and Downhill Jam for the Wii.
93900	99143	It will allow you to connect your DS or DS Lite wirelessly to the Wii and use it as a controller.
99584	102946	It says the size of the accessory is going to be about the same as...
103639	109081	and the Game Boy Advance Rumble packs that they have right now for the DS and DS Lite.
109761	115522	And like I said, they're going to be showing it off at the Leipzig Games Convention on the 23rd.
116303	121344	So, speculation for now, but sounds feasible, something.
121484	126185	I could see that, especially with the whole, you know, DS is going to download stuff from the Wii.
126886	128066	You know, well, I mean, not...
128544	129604	Game Boy Advance had the Kirby Rolling Game.
129624	130345	So it's nothing new, in a way.
152196	155417	But they're saying that I think this is going to be more than just one direction.
155477	157058	It's more than just tilting it back and forth.
157098	162659	It's actually going to be, you know, kind of like the PlayStation 3 controller is right now.
162799	164120	How they're going to be doing it with that.
164640	165880	More along that line.
165900	171382	It's not quite what the Wii is, but, you know, more than just the Game Boy Advance cards.
172482	172882	Fair enough.
172942	174263	So they're taking it to the next level.
174323	176384	It is the next gen after all.
177564	177924	Definitely.
178342	182644	I'm still more excited about the new item coming out for the DS.
183785	188608	Basically, there's going to be a new Chocobo game coming out on the DS by Square Enix.
189384	194067	It's Chocobo to Mahou no Eihon, which means Chocobo in the Magic Picture Book.
196369	208537	Basically, it's about a Chocobo farm, and a Chocobo lives there, and a caretaker named Shiroma, which I love puns in games, because the bad guy in the game's name is Kuroma.
208737	210478	Shiro means white, Kuro means black.
211178	211499	Ha ha.
212555	218258	Um, and so, uh, they have to go into the magical picture book world, which sort of makes me think of Winnie the Pooh now.
219058	235045	Um, but, um, it's going to, uh, be, uh, 3D and, uh, supposed to be, uh, from what I'm seeing, it actually looks like it's going to be a really cute game, just from the
235737	236518	No big surprise there.
236538	237338	It's Chocobo.
237498	239019	Is Fat Chocobo going to be the star?
239079	240860	Because Fat Chocobo is my favorite.
240880	241881	Fat Chocobo is not the star.
241921	244803	However, I think that Fat Chocobo needs to be like a special character.
245343	245864	Absolutely.
246124	248265	Or maybe if you eat too many greens, you turn into Fat Chocobo.
248465	248766	Maybe.
250106	256831	Maybe the DS can have a new special attachment that will actually make your DS smell like Chocobo so we can actually know what a Chocobo smells like.
257691	258452	Like chicken butt.
259392	259973	Like chicken butt.
260959	262720	Ninten Cats Ninten Cats
291191	293574	Our chat room is totally getting into the Fat Chocobo thing.
293834	295696	Over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.
295736	298759	We have Blaze says, Fat Chocobo equals fan service.
299119	300921	Eddie says, Fat Chocobo is to pwn.
301662	303864	WonderDog Harold says, Smells like teen Chocobo.
304405	304665	Get it?
305726	307608	And then Bandit gets a little more morbid.
307868	308949	He wants some Chocobo nuggets.
309550	312032	Because, you know, they're just like chicken, I guess.
312212	312793	Choco-nuggets.
313133	313654	Choco-nuggets.
314634	315855	Drew's giving the thumbs up over there.
315875	315955	What?
342443	343024	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
359474	363495	Sorry for the side note, but when you say Choco Nuggets, it makes me think of that concoction.
363515	365556	I still think of VG Cats.
366136	366476	What's that?
367616	370897	It was Kentucky Faraga Chocobo.
371717	372737	It's an old VG Cats.
372777	375178	Of course, I also like the Mog Nuggets or whatever they call it.
375198	382240	I want to say on our MySpace, which gives me an excellent opportunity to plug the Orange Launch Radio MySpace over at MySpace.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
382500	387341	I think there's an old, we have show clips on there, and I think one of them has Kentucky Fried Chocobo in it.
388035	388856	Kentucky Faraga Chocobo
415313	418814	Man, we should make our show exclusive to one of the consoles.
418854	420674	Then maybe they'll send us some stuff, too.
421074	421854	No, I'm just teasing.
421874	422574	That's awesome, though.
423095	435017	But actually, they scored an interview with arcade manager Aaron Greenberg, and it actually confirmed that some of the old Xbox Live arcade games are going to be updated to make them more compatible with the Vision Camera.
435417	438698	Spades, Bank Shop Billiards 2, and other classic titles.
438738	440898	Of course, we all know Uno is ready to go with the camera.
441243	442964	I hate to say it, but I think it's a big duh
469369	471890	I don't think it took a genius to figure that out.
495905	496486	to play the game.
496606	497106	Interesting.
497547	503212	I just wanted to say real quick before we move on, our chat room is lighting up on the whole webcam story.
503292	507416	Jeremy Todd 1 says, great, now we get to watch more dogs painting while we're panting.
507817	508177	Not painting.
508630	509831	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
537082	541966	Teenage girls, you cannot get pregnant over webcam, so keep that in mind when you're doing Xbox Live in the future.
542546	548191	Gorilla seems to think they should do Strip Halo, and DJ Kibbles and Bits wants them to add the camera to Street Fighter 2.
549852	565685	By the way, if you want to know what's up with all the Strip gaming references, earlier in the show we've debated the uses for the Xbox Live camera, and we seem to believe here at Orange Lounge Radio that the use that it probably will get, more than anything, is turning your favorite Xbox Live arcade game into Strip.
566807	569189	I hope they have poker with that camera.
569349	570350	And I know they do have the camera.
570410	574693	I think they should do a drinking game.
575153	578215	Speaking of the collector's edition of it, it's going to retail for $69.99.
578315	586300	It's going to feature an official art book called Destroyed Beauty and a bonus DVD featuring an inside look of the making of the game.
586640	590463	Probably some of that stuff that was on live as well as the stuff on MTV.
590603	595346	If you remember back when they had the Road to Emergency or whatever they were calling that show.
596271	597453	Check it out, November 12th.
598413	600075	There's also something else to check out.
600816	603258	Of course, we've all been pretty excited about Guitar Hero 2.
604159	611946	Red Octane had a party in Australia, basically, showing that there were three more songs going to be in the game.
612727	614469	That puts our track count around 11 now.
615209	620555	There's going to be Stone Temple Pilots, Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart, Anthrax's Madhouse, Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil.
621496	622116	That's pretty cool.
622977	640448	As far as the other eight that were previously announced, there's Revan Horton Heat's Psychobelly Freakout, Kiss Strutter, good song too, Black Sabbath War Pigs, But Whole Surfers, who was in my room last night, Van Halen's You Really Got Me, Rush's YYZ, which I've played and is fantastic.
640569	642230	The bass is so awesome in that game.
643490	650095	And also Primus, John the Fisherman, and Arterial Black by Drist.
650686	651627	I'm waiting for GWAR.
652287	653208	They need GWAR in that.
653228	654269	I don't see my GWAR.
654529	663135	And you know what I don't see, which is a damn crying shame, is there's no ACDC.
664656	666157	That is a damn crying shame.
667598	668499	And no Metallica.
668539	669279	What's up with that?
669860	671120	I have to mention this.
671861	676784	They're still talking about the cam thing, but this is great because this goes back to what they were talking about earlier in the program.
676824	677305	You remember how...
677915	684999	We got issued the challenge by Bobby Blackwolf for Chromehounds that's going to be taking place, I guess some inner podcast war thing.
686359	694224	Bandit decided to step it up and says, good, then when the cam comes out, we can all see Blackwolf's sad face after we all beat him in whatever game he chooses.
695764	696325	Is it wrong?
696445	697185	Well done, Bandit.
698326	699086	Well done, Bandit.
699186	701848	Okay, how about taking it a step further and challenging Bobby to strip Uno?
701868	702588	We love Bobby.
704853	708234	No, there's certain things podcasters don't do with each other and that's one of them.
708995	709435	Exactly.
709455	715637	Look, when we talk about love the independent podcast, we don't mean love the independent podcast, okay?
715758	716358	You lie.
716818	717478	You lie.
717658	718539	You liar.
718679	719819	Take his mic away, Loki, please.
720059	720840	Use it for a better purpose.
720860	722060	Yeah, he doesn't need to have that mic.
722700	733805	Speaking of a better purpose, I think MTV's Music Awards needs a better purpose because they're now honoring game music and sort of honoring game music.
734104	735565	They have two different categories now.
735705	738866	Best Video Game Score and Best Video Game Soundtrack.
739287	747491	The nominees for Best Video Game Score include Hitman Blood Money with Jesper Kidd doing the music on that.
748291	749592	Good luck to him because he was awesome.
750452	754294	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Tom Salta doing the music for that.
754354	762538	Dreamfall The Longest Journey Leon Willett and Evan Magnet Johansson Love that little...
763873	771319	Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion, Jeremy Soule, Electroplankton You know how MTV in their weirdo award shows always throws in some kind of interesting candidate in a lot of categories?
771439	773901	Like the movie awards always have something weird in there.
788127	788788	That's what it is.
789608	790869	Now, the best video... Ah, that's cool.
791410	806141	Oblivion would be my favorite, but that's... Video game soundtrack goes to... They have Fight Night Round 3, Burnout Revenge, which I like some of the songs on there, NBA 2K6, Driver Parallel Lines, and Mark Echo's Getting Up, which, you know, I'm surprised.
806481	810405	Didn't Dance Dance Revolution a couple years ago get nominated in one of those categories?
810425	810685	Yeah.
811105	811866	But not this year.
812626	813267	No love for the VDR.
813287	813887	It was extreme, too.
813927	814868	Best soundtrack.
815028	815889	What about Guitar Hero?
815909	816149	Guitar Hero.
817110	820114	That's very surprising with all the mainstream press love for Guitar Hero.
820174	821556	I'm very surprised that's not there.
822517	822798	Don't know.
823479	824260	Conspiracy.
825001	826443	MTV hates Guitar Hero.
826824	827084	News at 11.
827985	829608	MTV also hates a lot of cool stuff.
829748	831150	MTV hates you, actually.
831190	833233	That's why you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, because we love you.
834180	834981	And Jamie loves you.
835221	837502	And Jamie's going to surf the internet up and down.
837562	839963	Yeah, she doesn't love you, but she loves you.
840223	840643	Oh, baby.
840863	845385	And she surfs the internet up and down every week to find a website that you ought to be looking at.
845625	845986	Up and down.
846006	846946	Because she cares.
847106	849727	She surfs up, up, down, down, left, right, left.
849787	850728	Left, right, B, A, start.
852508	853409	What's the website of the week?
854744	855325	Castlemania Dungeon
877944	889946	which is the place to go to for anything, you know, uh, Akuma Jo, uh, Dracula X, or, sorry, I should just say Dracula's Castle, um, or Castlevania.
890147	891127	Anything having to do with it.
891147	898748	You have sprite rips, characters, history, sound clips, artwork, emulation, even fanfiction.
899108	900069	Castlevania fanfiction.
901089	906990	Um, this is a site I have been going to for at least, um, eight years.
909023	911624	My husband actually introduced me to this site.
912185	924994	The Castlevania Dungeons URL is castlevania.classicgaming.gamespy.com slash dungeon.html But you can also, if you Google search Castlevania Dungeon, it will be the first site that pulls up.
925495	926996	But I mean, it's absolutely fabulous.
927036	931800	I mean, the site itself has had over 200,000 hits since it started in 1997.
931960	932700	So it's pure awesomeness.
938055	938575	www.DarkSakura.com
959604	960185	Ha ha!
960205	961367	At least on the forums.
961487	962429	That's alright.
962630	963131	That's okay.
963151	963932	They have to believe us now.
964012	968181	You can send those apology letters to mailbag at orangelongtrader.com enclosed cookies.
968441	970205	I have a runner up.
970700	971040	What's that?
971060	973141	It's not your side of the week.
973781	974162	Whatever.
974722	976283	If I may mention one more thing, though, about this.
976403	983806	I want to give public kudos to the folks who run Castlevania Dungeon for keeping it alive as long as you have.
983906	984786	It's beautiful.
984866	985046	Oh, yeah.
985086	987367	I'm only giving the forum users a hard time.
987448	988768	I would have been skeptical of us, too.
988828	989228	It's fine.
989729	995231	Anyways, this could also be the site of the week, like an actual site, go-to site.
995831	999633	In Las Vegas, they have the Pinball Hall of Fame where you can go and visit it.
1000193	1029327	and if you're interested in checking out this place you can go play all the games and they have you know games ranging from the 1950s and up to 1990s pinball pinballmuseum.org so if you're in Vegas go check it out seriously that was almost a consideration why have I not been to Vegas for like the past few years like there's all these things I have to go see I have to see this we need to do a road trip live in Vegas I have to see Celine Dion no I'm just kidding I don't have to see her I'm kidding I'm kidding the woman has only done one good song in English and it was a meatloaf song
1031184	1032905	She sounds like crap in English.
1033566	1037369	Dear Celine Dion, if you listen to our podcast, please stick to French.
1037869	1038269	Thank you.
1038369	1042332	She did the Cyndi Lauper song, too, and that really upset me.
1042913	1044714	Anyway, this isn't to talk about Celine Dion.
1045275	1048097	It's to talk about gaming companies.
1049077	1050779	No, no, God no, never.
1052500	1054081	Is her cell phone game out?
1054421	1055422	Has anyone downloaded it?
1055582	1056423	Does anyone care?
1056803	1057604	I'm going to look into it.
1058362	1064747	For you guys, the listeners, I will be brave, and I will pay the $5 to download it so I can review it on the program for you folks.
1064767	1065307	For the listeners.
1065827	1067669	Just for you guys, because I love you.
1070070	1070350	All right.
1071071	1085501	Look, we're here to talk about big gaming companies such as EA, and EA has announced in their quarter one report that revenues were up 13% from last year, but net loss also increased in the same period from $58 million to $81 million.
1085621	1085741	Hmm.
1089872	1094255	They actually did this whole earnings report and did a conference call.
1095015	1098977	They talked with Gamasutra, and Gamasutra ran this report here.
1099317	1101458	EA revealed, That's a broken sentence, but that's alright.
1101478	1102919	I think you get what it's saying there.
1112119	1122107	First Party Wii titles won't be more than $49.99, suggesting that Electronic Arts games may debut for Wii at $49.99 at launch, but they haven't really committed to that.
1122367	1125990	If you want to read more details on the call, visit Gamasutra.com.
1126071	1126891	Want to hear something, Poopy?
1127352	1127652	Okay.
1128473	1133056	Activision titles, they just updated their prices in our system, and they all jumped $10.
1133497	1134938	Now they're all $59.99 for the Wii.
1135058	1135518	Boo!
1137280	1139382	I'm sure they'll change once they see that everybody else is $49.99.
1139482	1139722	We'll see.
1144233	1150556	Well, speaking of losses, I feel so bad for them, sort of.
1151776	1160519	Sega Sammy loses, their profit basically dropped down 93%, at least from their Pachinko machine sales.
1161660	1161820	Ouch.
1162495	1166358	Yeah, which is actually kind of surprising since Spachinko is like hardcore, you know, in Japan, but still.
1167659	1178586	Yeah, they had a profit of 779 million yen, about 6.8 million dollars, which dropped from 10.7 billion yen.
1179146	1181068	So that's quite a bit of loss.
1181748	1185471	They're blaming upfront development costs for game making.
1186391	1211993	and had a loss of 4.06 billion yen in the games division which was twice as much as last year's losses they're still saying however that despite this setbacks they are going to the previous full year earnings their commitment was to stay on track so yeah let's see we'll see
1213464	1215886	A very interesting story related to gaming.
1217026	1219327	This is also another story, actually, coming from Gamasu.
1219488	1219948	Go figure.
1220608	1225911	Full Spectrum Warrior is being used to treat PTSD in war veterans.
1226551	1232475	And that would be short for post-traumatic... Thank you, everybody.
1232595	1232875	All right.
1234556	1236037	This is a quote from the article.
1236077	1242400	The idea being to be in the high-stimulus environment for a long period of time, maintaining a low psycho-psychological arousal.
1243159	1246181	Dennis Wood, Doctor at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego, California
1274178	1275479	Let's see what's in our mailbag.
1294275	1294816	Yes, I do.
1294976	1295396	Yes, I do.
1296317	1304843	Basically, as you might have heard in the first part of the show, I had my hair done at this really cool place in the Castro in San Francisco called the John Brody Salon.
1306164	1307365	I just wanted to make a mention.
1307846	1316272	On August 13th, they're doing a grand opening celebration with proceeds going to a Benefit AIDS Emergency Fund and the Breast Cancer Emergency Fund.
1317874	1318974	It starts at...
1320396	1348178	6pm they're having a cocktail hour 7pm with a fashion show 8pm raffle drawing and the dress code is to be stylish so if anyone is interested in attending you can go to www.johnbrodysalon.com that's j-o-h-m-b-r-o-d-y salon.com and click on the RSVP tab you can't get in unless you're on the list donation suggested is $10 raffle tickets are $5 a piece
1349757	1350978	Should be a fun time.
1351778	1355479	And again, it goes to benefit the AIDS Emergency Fund and Breast Cancer Emergency Fund.
1355759	1356640	Hooray for good cause.
1356980	1357140	Yep.
1357580	1357860	All right.
1358760	1360401	Now let's get into the mailbag.
1360681	1361081	Yes, please.
1363582	1373666	You know, sometimes I can't hear this music without thinking of the old version of our show with you singing.
1373686	1373806	I know.
1373846	1374326	I'm sorry.
1374426	1374846	I'm sorry.
1375336	1375716	It's okay.
1375856	1379098	Well, our first email comes from JeremyTodd1, who's hanging out in our chatroom.
1379498	1383900	It says, since the Dead Rising demo came out this past week, I found an Easter egg in it.
1384620	1385260	That's pretty cool.
1385961	1389242	If you look at the restaurant's banner, you will see that it says Jill's Sandwich.
1390302	1395025	Could this be an Easter egg pointing to Resident Evil when Barry says to Jill, you were almost a Jill sandwich?
1395585	1397526	Especially since they are both zombie-esque games.
1397766	1399386	Just a cool Easter egg I thought I'd share.
1399406	1399867	I think it is.
1400427	1400947	Absolutely.
1401887	1402348	That's funny.
1402488	1403068	That is pretty cool.
1403717	1406500	Krispy Kreme actually asked a question that has nothing to do with video games.
1407120	1408281	Do any of you guys watch Lost?
1408381	1409842	That show totally rocks my boxers.
1411064	1411744	I have friends who do.
1411964	1413326	I don't watch TV at all.
1413346	1413886	That's me too.
1414006	1416629	I have my two best friends watch it, but I don't.
1417049	1417489	It's weird.
1418790	1420112	It's not that I dislike the show.
1421333	1423855	Between the show and work... It takes away from your Survivor time.
1424656	1426717	No, I didn't even really watch Survivor last year.
1426737	1428319	You know what I have been watching, though, is Big Brother.
1429386	1430447	I can't get enough of that show.
1430787	1433750	I know, I know it's crap reality, but I just, it's... I love it.
1434191	1435332	I call them unreality shows.
1435372	1436573	Go Danielle, go Danielle.
1437794	1439716	But I don't watch TV, so no.
1439876	1440176	Alright.
1441758	1451106	Also, from our dear friend Rob, with two B's, Robway, linked me an article on GameSpy, and just to read his email, it says...
1452511	1464098	It's amazing to look at now because Microsoft is single-handedly resurrecting the puzzle game, and the old games on live arcade are from some of these.
1464498	1466779	The rest are being covered by Nintendo's Wii controller.
1467280	1471062	The one I think they got wrong was Maze, First Person Shooter still dominates.
1471662	1473664	The one I think they were right about is Full Motion Video.
1473704	1478208	Full Motion Video will forever be in games, but not as a primary gameplay element.
1478529	1481512	I think that inspiration for new games can come from these genres and feel fresh.
1482492	1491201	Basically, the top ten that were listed was Space Shooters, like Asteroids, Xevious, Space Invaders, R-Type, Radiant Silvergun, Ikaruga.
1492302	1492382	Um...
1493809	1495670	Icarugo, though, is trying, I think, to bring it back.
1496031	1498352	Puzzle games, Tetris, Best Move, Puyo Puyo.
1498933	1501655	Light gun games like Duck Hunt, House of the Dead, Lethal Enforcers.
1503816	1506298	Next up was Text Adventures.
1507299	1509640	Hey, we still have Orange Lounge Radio, the game.
1510761	1511722	Then maze games.
1512342	1516345	And I love, though, they linked Mousetrap, which was like my favorite ColecoVision game ever.
1516686	1517546	Mousetrap was a great game.
1518447	1522770	Virtual Reality, which I think, you know, like the Virtual Boy Power Glove games.
1523519	1531563	Yeah, although I actually have a, what was the one that was supposed to be for Eternal Champions?
1532944	1534885	I have whatever that was that came with Eternal Champions.
1535906	1537367	The Activator, thank you, I do own one.
1538667	1541129	Also, educational games were listed.
1542329	1543670	Oregon Trail was the example.
1545131	1548673	Somebody in our forums posted a link to where you can play Oregon Trail online.
1549033	1552835	I'd seen it before, but it's a good thing to check out.
1553447	1557328	FullMotionVideo was number three with Night Trap, Mad Dog McCree, Dragon's Lair.
1557929	1559149	I'm sorry, Dragon's Lair.
1559929	1560870	There's that HD one.
1561430	1567772	I will be putting out a review of Dragon's Lair HD coming up in the next week or so.
1569246	1570447	because it's freaking rad.
1571007	1571727	It's pretty.
1573568	1577490	Two, the beat-em-up, like Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, River City Ransom.
1578431	1583513	Technically, there was one released, which was that really awful Final Fight.
1585234	1586075	But, no.
1586855	1587816	Really awful Final Fight.
1587836	1588776	I must have missed that game.
1589757	1597480	And the last one listed is Graphic Adventure, which includes Space Quest, King's Quest, Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island.
1597981	1598441	Salmon Man.
1598931	1602194	Oh, hell, I forgot to mention during housekeeping, so I'll mention it now.
1602534	1611701	The Silver Lining folks, the King's Quest IX, but not really, the fan project that changed its name to the Silver Lining, they released a patch for their demo, and it's available on our site.
1611721	1614163	So if you downloaded the demo last week, please download the patch.
1614223	1616105	It's available on our site in the download section.
1616145	1617026	Thank you for reminding me.
1617786	1618527	You're welcome.
1619007	1622530	Actually, the beat-em-up is not completely dead, but yeah, it is dying.
1622590	1626313	I think the last notable beat-em-up I saw was Guilty Gear Isuka.
1627134	1627294	Yeah.
1628260	1634485	Well, I did the, like, you know, they actually started putting those in as little side games in the Tekken series.
1635306	1646355	Well, if you want to talk about beat-em-ups on the PSP, Guilty Gear Judgment, which is, I think, Guilty Gear X2 Reload or something like that, but anyways, that is going to have a beat-em-up in it as well as a fighting game for the PSP.
1646715	1654441	And the next beat-em-up I can think of is Yakuza, which is coming out on the PS2, and that's actually done by Sega Sammy, so that's September, I think, if I remember correctly.
1654881	1655662	So, should be good.
1656434	1659896	Well, JeremyTodd1 sends us another one that I did think was notable.
1662618	1664459	Hello, OLR, JeremyTodd1 here.
1664599	1666641	I'm not going to say again for fear that Rob will freak out again.
1669183	1676007	He's certainly getting a lot of FaceTime on the program, but hey, we let anybody email us or join the chat room, so... Well, to continue with the email.
1676027	1676407	That's right.
1677668	1679850	Would it be possible to listen to OLR live on my 360?
1680850	1681050	No?
1681511	1686074	Yep, I expected that, but a company named TV... T-Versity, I guess?
1686990	1688831	has made their program for the 360.
1688891	1689572	Here's a quote from them.
1690012	1697437	With T-Versity, the menus on the Xbox 360 are extended to include internet content, making it possible to access radio stations, podcasts, and photo feeds.
1698497	1702640	So would this allow 360 owners to be able to listen to OLR live using their Xbox 360?
1703200	1707783	And I can't test this out right now because my 360 isn't connected to the internet right now and it is too much of a hassle to move it.
1707883	1709925	He said he tried it last week and he didn't get it to work.
1709945	1710925	He's in our chat room right now.
1711186	1711946	Okay.
1711986	1712626	I'll check it out.
1712767	1715028	Forward the email to my personal account so I can check it out.
1715428	1721052	To me, it sounds like it's something that you would use with the Windows Media Center type of thing, or something like that.
1721172	1722873	I'd be curious, though.
1722953	1725734	If we could listen to it live over the 360, I'm all over that.
1725894	1729417	You actually can, because Dan listens to MP3s off my computer all the time.
1729617	1731738	Well, that's just streaming MP3s from a PC.
1731818	1737101	All it would have to do is somehow trick the computer into thinking you're playing a regular MP3 when it's a streaming MP3.
1737121	1738102	That's the trick.
1738862	1739903	So, there must be something.
1740683	1743166	or just download the podcast on your computer and link it.
1743366	1744227	Yeah, you could do that too.
1744247	1744767	Well, no, no.
1744987	1749192	He wants to listen to the music and the live shows that we don't podcast.
1749872	1751334	I can't think of how to get that to work.
1751854	1752335	Well, who knows?
1752355	1753976	Maybe this program will work at some point.
1754337	1757840	The last one is from Rye.
1759001	1761284	I'm just emailing to say this is the OLR.
1761324	1762245	I love you email.
1762825	1763606	The one that made me go squee.
1764554	1766796	I'm just emailing to say how great you guys and girl are.
1766956	1771059	I've listened to Orange Lounge for almost a year but recently registered online.
1772040	1782028	Anyways, I listened to your podcast and several others but what ended up happening is all the other podcasters gave up on podcasting with no warning, just stopped and left me really annoyed because they all stopped in a short period.
1782068	1784811	So thank you, OLR, for being a reliable source for video game news.
1786472	1791296	You know, it's tough to do podcasts every week and I think a lot of people...
1791874	1795236	They hear other podcasts and they want to do their own podcasts.
1795256	1795996	I'm all for that.
1796276	1796957	People want to have a voice.
1797297	1801599	But sometimes I think people don't realize how difficult it is.
1802199	1808943	It does take a lot of dedication and work that you don't necessarily see in the hours that we're doing the show and putting it all together.
1809443	1816427	And that's why I have a great respect for other independent podcasters that stick with it.
1816727	1819008	And nothing against the ones who don't end up sticking with it.
1819248	1820929	When you don't have time for it, you don't have time for it.
1821360	1825422	But, you know, it's trickier than I think a lot of people sometimes give it credit for.
1826163	1827843	I'm glad that we make time for you guys.
1829164	1829444	Heart.
1829884	1830085	Heart.
1830445	1830785	All our love.
1831018	1832659	I thought of another TV show I have been watching.
1832779	1834141	And it's a reality show, but it's a good one.
1834241	1834861	Even you'd like it.
1834981	1835201	What?
1835281	1836743	It's called Who Wants to Be a Superhero.
1836783	1837663	Yes, I know.
1837784	1838744	I've been hearing about that.
1838784	1839985	And I adore Stan Lee.
1840366	1842668	Except I hate Major Victory on that.
1842868	1843388	I hate him.
1843588	1843989	I hate him.
1844049	1845009	He can go die in a fire.
1845029	1846451	You've got Tevo, right?
1846471	1848312	Yeah, I have the first two episodes on there right now.
1848652	1850674	Well, let me watch them later in the week.
1850714	1851254	Yeah, you got it.
1851575	1853636	Actually, my favorite right now is Monkey Woman.
1854117	1856018	At least Major Victory had some style to it.
1856118	1856999	Yeah, but he's an ass.
1857019	1857640	I like Monkey Woman.
1859850	1861611	and, yeah, I like Fat Mama.
1861631	1863172	Lucky Woman is a very Marvel name.
1863192	1867235	Because, like, right now... Fat Mama has a song on her MySpace.
1867595	1868176	It's awesome.
1868676	1878643	Well, actually, it's funny because I love their names because... I did check out some of the names because actually two of my favorite characters right now in the Marvel Universe are Big Bertha and Squirrel Girl.
1879263	1879904	Oh, God.
1880284	1881124	I love Squirrel Girl.
1881265	1881905	She beat Doctor Doom.
1882972	1884173	and now I'm a real dork.
1884353	1886533	So let's just close the mailbag.
1886614	1888454	Let's get back to gaming and close the mailbag.
1888494	1890355	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1890375	1891616	We look forward to getting your emails.
1892476	1902320	Speaking of really cool stuff, one of the things that was coming out of E3 was definitely Crysis and basically Crytek's brand new
1903007	1904368	Game using their CryEngine 2.0.
1905028	1908449	For those who don't know, that's the next-gen Far Cry type of game.
1909530	1913252	Well, what's interesting, though, is they're actually looking for people.
1914212	1923036	Well, they had a job posting for people to work on a console version of something for the Far Cry series.
1924817	1927358	One would speculate that, well, it's coming out on the PC.
1928308	1954421	probably coming out on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 so pretty interesting that game looks pretty sweet I mean the level of detail is amazing so should be cool speculate away boys and girls well speaking of as far as things being planned SNK is not actually planning on doing anything for the Playstation 3 until 2009 according to Kotaku
1958373	1960555	The PlayStation 2 is good enough.
1960575	1961035	It's small and cheap.
1961075	1963918	For us, the manufacturers, we don't have to invest in your system.
1963938	1964919	And the PlayStation 3 is a risk.
1986232	1987874	There won't be enough consoles at launch.
1987955	1989977	Few consoles mean few software sales.
1990378	1991620	We need to wait three or four years.
1991660	1994664	Maybe 2009, 2010 is a good time to release a game for the PS3.
1994724	1996387	That does bring up a very good point, though.
1996827	1999451	And this is the same reason why, what was it?
2000146	2006270	The Splinter Cell Double Agent was delayed because they thought there's not enough 360 consoles out there and so they delayed the game.
2006490	2011653	You're going to see a lot of this with the PlayStation 3 games being delayed until like fall of next year because of this.
2012053	2012754	Interesting.
2012814	2016075	That's much bigger news than I initially gave that credit for when we were prepping this show.
2016756	2023800	That's pretty big because that's SNK kind of taking a stand saying, you know, we're just not feeling it from Sony.
2024661	2027002	But again, you know, to play devil's advocate though,
2027939	2034745	S&K doesn't exactly put out a lot of games that, you know, I think of S&K and I think about, you know, games that still look kind of 16-bit.
2035085	2050298	Not that that's a bad thing because, you know, playability is what's important so they could, you know, continue to exist on the PlayStation 2 and there's going to be your, you know, the guy who doesn't consider himself a gamer or herself a gamer
2050851	2051412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2071084	2074207	or even like, you know, I want to say they did Baseball Stars or something like that.
2074267	2077710	It makes me weep that Magical Drop I can only get on my cell phone.
2078050	2079171	They need to, like, make that.
2079471	2084876	I mean, I know that they like the port games and maybe do, like, slight graphical updates to them and stuff like that.
2085116	2093764	That's fine, because that's what's in right now is, you know, people updating some of the retro games and stuff, and they really need to pay attention to some of these older games that were on.
2093784	2098508	I mean, there was more on the Neo Geo than Metal Slug and King of Fighters, so come on.
2100209	2102190	Do a new Fatal Fury game or something like that.
2102250	2104652	I mean, just put something out that's different.
2105052	2107313	I mean, and I know they're not doing it for the PlayStation 3.
2107353	2113997	That's fine, because there are types of games that they release right now, unless they're doing something brand new, don't really need the power of the PlayStation 3.
2114438	2116519	Did SNK do Adventure Island?
2116619	2118160	No, that was Hudson.
2118400	2120541	Why do I remember an Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx?
2121102	2122803	Because there was an Adventure Island on the TurboGrafx.
2122843	2124204	Didn't Hudson work really closely?
2124344	2124904	And Adventure Island 2.
2125925	2128026	Didn't Hudson work really closely with NEC or something?
2128923	2135164	Because Bomberman 93 and Bomberman 94 were also mainstay TurboGrafx-based.
2135184	2135904	Never mind, Konami.
2135924	2137485	Didn't Konami buy them now?
2137505	2139065	Yeah, Konami's doing the Hudson stuff.
2139085	2141265	Well, then Konami needs to put out an Adventure Island game.
2142826	2144046	You know what Konami needs to do?
2144686	2145786	Another Super Konami World.
2146907	2147287	Good luck.
2147327	2152968	They're still doing Bomberman X Zero, which is coming out in a couple weeks.
2152988	2154348	There's also the Bomberman game on the Wii.
2155839	2158421	Oh, there's some love for Magical Drop in the chatroom.
2158461	2159602	That gives me warm fuzzies.
2159682	2161263	Ranma says, I heart Magical Drop.
2161643	2163364	And DMN professes his love for me.
2164025	2165025	I named Magical Drop.
2165065	2165646	That's very sweet.
2166666	2171249	I'm just saying that they really do have a larger library of games than those two.
2173407	2197983	Metal Slug was an awesome game and I did spend a lot of quarters on it but god damn stop really porting this game to every single console and to be honest Metal Slug 1 through 4 or whatever they're up to now they're all the same they all look exactly the same with slightly different artwork in there they haven't changed anything but hey whatever it's a fun game just need some new stuff
2199039	2204524	You know, I think, number one, this is probably going to be a start of a slippery slope.
2204584	2217356	I mean, if SNK is taking a stand like this, what's to say that some more companies may decide to take similar stands and the PS3 may not be as powerful at launch as we thought.
2217556	2222581	It's funny you mention that, Drew, because the next story I have is about Atari.
2223764	2225005	And it's very interesting.
2225505	2230126	There was an interview on GamesIndustry.biz with Bruno Bonell, who's the CEO at Atari.
2230726	2236148	And Atari has said they have no plans to release any games for the PS3 until at least 2007.
2237129	2243171	But they're citing a lack of information being the reason why they are not going to develop for the console.
2243451	2252674	But then the weird thing is, he comes out and says that, quote, picking up the high end of the market, the hardcore, passionate fans, in describing the PS3.
2253553	2257414	So, they're taking a little more of a soft approach to this.
2257474	2263276	Like, well, you know, the PS3 is definitely gunning for that audience, but since we don't know shit about it, we're not developing for it until next year.
2264056	2265456	So, very interesting.
2268297	2281941	As far as also interesting is concerned, well, honestly, it's not really too much of a surprise, but John Woo's Stranglehold is actually delayed until first quarter 2007.
2284777	2287239	It was the very well-received at E3.
2287739	2291320	It's supposed to be one of the top ones to be released.
2291821	2293101	It's in development by Midway.
2294302	2295662	But it's just delayed a little bit.
2296063	2301105	You know, to be honest, I actually looked at the dates on this in my system at work.
2301405	2302445	It's only delayed two weeks.
2303286	2306107	It just happens to fall from December to January.
2306247	2307508	So it is first quarter.
2307528	2309228	So now everybody's saying, oh, it's 2007.
2309268	2310649	I get it.
2310749	2311629	It's like two weeks.
2311729	2312690	I mean, seriously, folks.
2313363	2314804	Games get delayed for stupid reasons.
2314824	2315385	You know what, though?
2315565	2318267	But that is, it is still big news because that means you missed Christmas.
2319248	2320369	They missed Christmas anyways.
2320409	2322991	It was, I think, well, maybe not.
2323071	2324713	They were like a week away from Christmas.
2324733	2327915	But still, though, I mean, it's not a big deal.
2327956	2330878	By that time, though, I mean, you're not going to be picking up for Christmas.
2331198	2331799	I guess that's true.
2331859	2333220	Most people have their Christmas gifts.
2333280	2335462	I want to go for Christmas, Mommy!
2335862	2338825	I mean, no, you're not going to have kids doing that, so.
2340486	2341327	I don't know why.
2342213	2345380	If I don't get John Woo's stranglehold, I'm gonna cry.
2346462	2350511	I love you, Lel, and I want a Rad Rider BB gun and John Woo's stranglehold.
2350852	2351693	Anyways, um...
2352509	2362235	Speaking of things, though, that you might be able to pick up for Christmas, though, I know we mentioned that before, and I think I said, you know, the 360 bundle not happening in the United States.
2362875	2363616	That's a fact.
2363936	2369920	Well, one thing that we do know is going to be happening is it might be happening in other countries, in Canada and in Mexico.
2370580	2371120	For example...
2372557	2374038	Damn you Canada and damn you Mexico.
2374058	2374238	Mexico.
2399724	2402165	But anyways, yeah, so it is coming out.
2402645	2406707	They're saying, though, that it's supposed to retail, I think, about $3.99.
2406847	2408408	So, it's not bad.
2408628	2413210	And being that the game's dropped in price down to $29.99, so, I don't know.
2413430	2414770	Hell yeah, I've been to Mexico!
2415931	2418952	So, should be interesting.
2421913	2424455	If you caught that reference, you're pretty smart.
2425055	2425335	Anyway...
2427449	2428569	You know how we had that story.
2428589	2432991	I think Loki just kind of shouted it out at the end of the last episode.
2433091	2437193	Remember how we had the top 20 gay characters from games or something?
2437613	2438473	And who took the cake?
2438593	2438993	Tingle.
2439674	2446136	Well, isn't it strange that now Nintendo is sending out a survey all about Tingle.
2446856	2451778	A new survey is up at Nintendo's website and it's trying to gauge what people really think about Tingle.
2452058	2453799	Here's some of the questions from the survey.
2454426	2458750	Before reading about this game, how did you feel about Tingle when he showed up in a Zelda game?
2459931	2463874	After reading the article on Nintendo Power, did your opinion of Tingle change?
2464895	2467577	Which of these best describes your view of Tingle?
2467617	2468678	I'll read the answers to this one.
2469019	2474844	Funny, interesting, boring, annoying, none of the above, and flamey.
2475564	2476025	No, I'm just kidding.
2476045	2476725	The last one's not there.
2477226	2477346	Um...
2478183	2482567	Rupeeland incorporates a unique gameplay system in which everything costs rupees.
2482887	2485729	The trick is that you never know how you need to pay.
2486149	2487350	What do you think of this system?
2488151	2489292	Fun, crappy, whatever.
2489872	2494576	And do you feel that Tingle is an interesting enough character to deserve his own game?
2495877	2497758	But I thought this question is very interesting as well.
2498539	2505244	If Tingle made an appearance in the upcoming title The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess for GameCube and Wii, how would you feel?
2506385	2507326	I would be excited.
2507719	2509520	I'd be annoyed, and I'd hit that.
2510861	2511942	Just kidding about the third one.
2514243	2515124	That's so sad.
2515564	2516065	So sad.
2516485	2519047	But speaking about a game I would hit, that would be Spore.
2519527	2525291	And Spore is going to be coming out on consoles now, according to Will Wright.
2525611	2528132	And one of the things that they were saying is...
2530026	2533769	A console controller really makes you want the game avatar based so you don't move on the character.
2548300	2550382	That's why RTS games suck on the consoles.
2550422	2553484	With Spore, about half the game is Avatar-based already.
2553785	2559029	The Creature game and the Space game, it would be pretty easy for us to make intermediate levels Avatar-based.
2559489	2565714	So from the beginning, we thought about how we could move Spore onto platforms including consoles.
2566315	2568636	So, I mean, duh, it's coming to consoles.
2568696	2569397	I mean, come on.
2569417	2573120	It might not be right away, you know, like the PC game, but it's coming.
2573140	2574921	I mean, that's just stupid if they don't.
2575502	2575642	So...
2576752	2577893	Wow, that's a really gay picture.
2578573	2582315	Sorry, somebody in chat just put a picture of the upcoming Tingle game.
2582935	2586177	And, uh, it's, uh, a little bit fruity.
2586197	2590479	Why don't you call it, like, Tingle's flamboyant romp in, like, Rupeeland or something, I mean?
2590739	2592480	Damn, Tingle visits the Castro.
2592500	2595761	The fabulous romp of Tingle in Rupeeland!
2597142	2598442	Tingle goes to the bathhouse.
2598602	2600944	I mean, seriously, that's pretty gay.
2602444	2603725	Look, let me put it this way with Spore.
2604665	2607447	All Spore would have to do is buy me a drink and I'd make sweet love to it.
2607728	2609049	I mean, it's a beautiful game.
2609909	2611350	I want to play it so bad.
2611451	2614393	I was so mad that we couldn't play it at E3 that we just had the demo.
2614673	2627924	You keep seeing on all these news sites and stuff that 3D model feature where you create a creature and you basically hit print and you pay like 10 bucks or whatever to get it shipped to you and they will ship you a model of your character, a little statue.
2628925	2629345	That's cool.
2629707	2630187	That is awesome.
2630207	2630867	Are you going to do that?
2631107	2632228	That sounds like something you'd do.
2632648	2635349	You'd get like five of them and have them declare war on each other.
2636609	2637590	It's like a little kid playing with G.I.
2637610	2637710	Joe's.
2637730	2639430	We could have contests and give them away to people.
2642451	2642812	Alright.
2646133	2655756	Well, you know, I shake my head at this just because poor, poor Sony.
2656872	2659993	Poor Sony trying to be like Microsoft again.
2661434	2672919	They are apparently now wanting to call their rewards system on their online service.
2674060	2675200	They want to call it entitlements.
2676061	2677521	Much like achievement points.
2679622	2680963	Yeah.
2683524	2685605	The only problem though is that
2687498	2692420	The two words are... They can't really use anything against it, though.
2694400	2698321	Because, by definition, they are irreconcilable.
2698581	2703043	I mean... I like what's pointed out here on this article.
2704623	2705624	It's on Joystick, actually.
2706424	2706644	That...
2707757	2714480	Achievement is the act of accomplishing or finishing, while entitlement is the state of being furnished with a right to claim something.
2715160	2717421	So, by definition, they can get away with it.
2717681	2721943	However, it's still really close.
2722123	2722843	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2723003	2725644	So if you're entitled to it, why do you have to earn it?
2727345	2728826	Yeah, it's a weird title.
2729106	2730626	But at the same time, you know what?
2730806	2736289	I don't think... It's not a big surprise that PlayStation is going this route, and...
2737711	2742474	You know, it kind of works for the Xbox, so why not do a similar system?
2742554	2746356	You know, if it works, I'm not surprised they're going to pick it up and do it.
2746396	2753161	I mean, if you think about it, okay, didn't Xbox kind of incorporate rumbling into their controller because Sony did it and it worked there?
2753681	2754121	Good point.
2754481	2758144	Yeah, I mean, if it works one place, why not do it?
2758864	2760565	Yeah, I think they need to pick the right word, though.
2760585	2761125	But it is a dumb name.
2761165	2762306	Entitlements is not the right name.
2763767	2766429	Unless they're doing something, unless they have their own unique spin on this.
2766529	2766829	I don't know.
2767304	2767945	A little latency.
2767965	2770367	Why isn't anyone doing anything about this?
2770407	2771568	That's what I want to know.
2772769	2777512	Why are they letting Microsoft get away with this kind of crap?
2793916	2796138	This is really, really wrong.
2796158	2799962	Sony, I feel sorry for you.
2800943	2802524	You're crazy.
2803345	2805167	I'm not crazy.
2805827	2807409	Blaze in our chatroom says you're awesome.
2808150	2810512	But the only person in there that says you're awesome, just for the record.
2811155	2813876	Don't worry, I only have Ridge Racer on my mind.
2815036	2827920	Anyways, so, speaking of the PlayStation 3 and the 360, during one of the Game Informer interviews with the creators of The Darkness, they were asking, you know, what do you...
2828524	2829884	like about working on the PS3?
2830025	2831225	And how is it different from the 360?
2831865	2834626	Will there be any major differences between the two versions of the game?
2835486	2846870	And the response was, so far the two versions look pretty much the same, quite unsurprisingly, since we both use the same shader source code and content for both platforms, they will be identically gameplay-wise.
2847290	2856673	There will only be a few minor cosmetic differences, such as in the PlayStation 3, we'll have better quality video for in-game TVs, and the Xbox 360 will have a bit more room for textures and memory.
2857594	2858054	In other words,
2859221	2861404	Both of the games are going to be almost exactly the same.
2861905	2864749	Very much like how PlayStation 2 and Xbox games
2865891	2868793	are almost exactly the same, with slight minor differences.
2869434	2874997	So, why do I have to pay 200 extra dollars for a system that'll have games that are almost exactly the same as the 360?
2875678	2877879	Because they'll have exclusive games you can't get on the 360.
2878900	2879681	Whoa!
2880441	2881062	Oh, I'm sorry.
2881082	2881382	Just saying.
2882182	2889928	I am still the tech and whore, and I have to... Final Fantasy XIII, Metal Gear Solid 4... Who gives a rat's ass about Final Fantasy XIII and its 20 million versions?
2889988	2890068	Me.
2890088	2890248	Me.
2892009	2892209	Me.
2892489	2893109	Hello, me.
2893129	2894370	Tekken.
2894630	2896030	Tekken, Tekken, Tekken.
2896150	2896790	I'll buy Tekken 2.
2896850	2898070	Don't get me wrong.
2898110	2899311	Tekken 2 came out already.
2899351	2900111	I mean, you know what?
2900171	2901151	Tekken also.
2902671	2902972	Nerd.
2903712	2904312	All right.
2904712	2907633	That is a joke that has not been patented in your toilet paper joke book.
2907693	2908673	Skype line.
2909013	2909433	I'm taking.

2918547	2919868	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
2941764	2946287	It's Ranma Satome, and I am dead tired from coming back from Otakon.
2946387	2947668	What went on at Otakon?
2948209	2949109	Hey!
2950930	2951891	Oh, man.
2952592	2956234	I just came back from the biggest anime convention in the country.
2956474	2957035	Believe it.
2957275	2959376	What was the coolest thing that happened at Otakon?
2960617	2965861	One of the coolest things to me was a friend of mine got hit by a car going to the convention center...
2966616	2967657	He went to the hospital.
2967737	2968797	That doesn't sound cool.
2969558	2973800	No, what's cool, Paul, is they let him go, and we were all at Hooters the night having dinner.
2975481	2976601	Were you in cosplay?
2977182	2977422	Yes.
2977702	2978062	Please say yes.
2978162	2978722	Oh, my God.
2981404	2982264	Nerds.
2982284	2988648	Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, because I have gone around Disneyland dressed as Shorty from Best of Move 2.
2988708	2988988	Nerd.
2989088	2989848	Nerd.
2990149	2990789	Nerd.
2991713	2993274	Oh yeah, you know what we're doing right now?
2993314	2995555	Hey, it's only a degree of nerdiness, okay?
2995755	2997376	Nerds and damn proud of it.
2997816	2999697	You know what?
3000478	3005521	I'm going to violate your childhoods right now with this link I'm posting in the chatroom right now.
3005581	3010343	Okay, please explain this for the podcast listeners who won't know what the hell you're talking about.
3012084	3013245	Oh no, what is this?
3013265	3013805	That is so cool!
3015819	3016720	Is that a Waldo?
3017180	3017821	Yes, that's right.
3018001	3019302	My friend Mike is Waldo.
3019743	3022425	Now, if they had a wedding, who could find it?
3024667	3025788	That's kind of funny.
3026849	3027109	Wow.
3027169	3028571	That's a Carmen Sandiego.
3028591	3033355	I know, I like the Carmen Sandiego better than the Waldo, no offense.
3033395	3034716	Seriously, how did he find those two?
3036037	3037419	Where in the world was she?
3038587	3040549	Wherever Waldo was, apparently.
3041430	3043372	Are they fucking?
3043632	3044914	What is Waldeck going to think?
3046876	3047396	Or Wilmette.
3047416	3047877	What was her name?
3047917	3048558	Waldeck?
3048618	3049058	Wilmette?
3049098	3049919	I can't even remember.
3049939	3052061	This is scandal.
3052281	3054424	Waldo and Carmen Sandiego are off doing it.
3055083	3056404	But check this out.
3056904	3062367	We have what's called Anime Parliament where people can bring their grievances about anime to a panel.
3063068	3071732	Waldo pulled Carmen Sandiego out and accused her of using all the government's resources to find her while he was still missing for 15 years.
3075799	3080681	That is quite possibly the lamest thing I've heard in my entire life.
3080701	3081902	No way, that's awesome.
3082082	3090726	I mean, it's lame in a funny way, but you know, I'm just like, my god, anime conventions really are the capital of nerd country, aren't they?
3092027	3095128	I want to go to Otacon next year because Anime Expo is a piece of crap.
3096669	3100651	I'm going to book my room now because right now half the hotels are already sold out.
3100951	3101651	Dear god.
3102091	3105213	Waldo's friend was Wanda, by the way, according to DMN in chat.
3107618	3108721	We'll talk about that, Ranchan.
3108881	3110243	Okay, here's what else I want to know.
3110604	3114191	What types of video game content were there at the con and was OLR horde?
3115473	3121017	All I know is there was a couple of Tekken and Smash Bros.
3121057	3121537	tournaments.
3121997	3126340	I tried to get pictures, but you know my grief from the last con.
3126560	3128281	The funk almost killed me.
3128502	3136767	They put the game room in the big place in the center, and still, as I'm coming down the escalator, 30 feet away, I can smell it.
3138928	3142251	I have a suggestion for you for cosplay next year to avoid fanboy funk.
3143832	3144132	Larva.
3146414	3146974	Wear the mask.
3147835	3153940	Blaze in our chat room is trying to get into the zing here by saying, you know, because I was talking about anime conventions being the capital of nerd country.
3154480	3158023	Blaze says, Sky, remember that you are hosting a podcast about video games.
3158984	3159444	Touche.
3159584	3159964	Touche.
3160465	3160725	Burn.
3161263	3161884	Well, well done.
3161904	3162324	Wait, wait, wait.
3162384	3165487	You're supposed to make a point first, and then you say touche.
3165507	3166228	You haven't made a point yet.
3166248	3167169	That was two degrees of calm.
3167189	3173134	Okay, PodCulture wants me to go to DragonCon, which actually would be reasonable since that's actually near my family.
3173554	3175877	DragonCon's in Bobby's neck of the woods.
3175957	3177638	He'd let us stay at his house, I bet.
3180541	3182423	We could play Chromehounds all night long.
3182463	3185565	Yuri Lover says we should go to YuriCon, but actually I'm going to YaliCon.
3186286	3186927	Of course you are.
3189004	3190484	Oh my god, our costumes arrived.
3191045	3195527	Me and Chris and Megzi are cosplaying Organization XIII characters.
3196568	3197548	And our trenches arrived.
3198449	3200690	I'm going to be scarred for life should I see pictures.
3202211	3204692	Drew, I could scar you even worse than that.
3205252	3210515	Anime Next 2007, we're doing original Organization XIII cosplay.
3210935	3215758	It's Jesus Christ and the Twelve Disciples as Organization XIII, all with Keyblades.
3216624	3217344	That's beautiful.
3217464	3218005	You know what?
3218085	3219305	Just have dinner already.
3221146	3221546	Lunchtime.
3221566	3222646	Be online after the show.
3222706	3223987	I got to let you go, Ranma.
3224007	3225948	We want to get other calls in, but thank you for calling, okay?
3226368	3226648	Got it.
3226848	3227248	All right.
3228269	3234171	And by the way, for those folks that say, hey, it's the same people that always call in, why don't you call in?
3234931	3237052	Because I hate reading that about the show.
3237112	3238693	It's the same people that always call in.
3239673	3242254	Then you're obviously listening, so why don't you call in?
3244235	3244675	I don't get it.
3245137	3250440	So let's go to, speaking of, so that being said, hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
3251280	3253241	It's one and only Legend of Zaku.
3253442	3255423	Hello, Zaku, what's on your mind, my friend?
3256083	3268049	Um, basically the fact, you know, obviously the VMA is not having, you know, any music games for that, you know, lame, but yet somewhat important video game soundtrack nomination.
3268069	3270971	I'm sorry, could the record be starting right now?
3271031	3273252	Actually, if we could put this on record, my next statement.
3273913	3274673	Excuse me, one moment.
3276517	3277617	Fuck MTV!
3278238	3279599	Yeah, same, exactly.
3279639	3289664	And you have to understand that MTV pretty much, you know, they suck the dick of hip-hop and rap just because it rates in more money.
3290345	3296228	And, you know, this leads you to believe that MTV's that desperate for cash that they'll pour themselves out for it.
3297555	3298015	Um, okay.
3298235	3301556	All those music channels nowadays, anyways, they're just all reality TV, anyway.
3301596	3302516	You think that's worse?
3303257	3308418	Uh, G4, for G4, you know, Guitar Hero's being nominated for Game of the Year.
3309938	3314780	And so, that leads me to believe that they're gonna, you know, they're gonna bow down to Guitar Hero.
3314860	3316860	I thought G4 wasn't doing an awards show anymore.
3317561	3318821	Um, they're doing G4ia.
3319881	3320101	What?
3320141	3322562	And according to... I thought G4ia got cancelled.
3324258	3325078	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
3354432	3368780	Exactly, it's an economy based, the whole thing is now based on the almighty dollar and they lost touch with themselves, you know, they lost touch of who they were, you know, for years now.
3369380	3374723	It used to be all about music and, you know, now it's just whoring themselves out, but that's besides the point.
3375364	3377785	MTV lost touch about, what, 1994, 1985?
3377905	3380687	Interesting comment in chat room, interesting comment in chat room.
3380707	3380787	Wow.
3385033	3386734	Blaze says MTV owns X-Fire.
3387754	3388595	I like X-Fire.
3388635	3389015	I use it.
3389075	3389775	Okay, okay.
3389795	3391816	That's 1.2 MTV.
3392136	3393316	Their suck actually started in 96.
3393396	3395997	In 94, we still had Headbangers Ball and 120 Minutes.
3399682	3401563	Yeah, and we still had really good shows.
3402283	3405404	We still had Amp in those years, too, so... Oh, yeah.
3405484	3407785	The downhill trend began when Remote Control went off TV.
3407805	3408805	Yeah, when Remote Control lost it.
3409506	3410426	Oh, yeah, that was it.
3410506	3413047	Alright, I gotta take it back on video games.
3413207	3414488	So, Zaku, anything else?
3414528	3415028	No, that's alright.
3416428	3427572	Um, not really, just, you know, the whole thing about... Maybe, you know, if you... For, like, anime conventions, shouldn't they just give out deodorant sticks at the door?
3427653	3428653	They have before.
3429460	3432984	I mean, just... I mean, antiperspirant, not even deodorant.
3433024	3438849	Antiperspirant does a good job at, you know, absorbing sweat and thus killing odor before it even begins.
3439170	3440431	Maxes.
3440531	3447598	A wise person, a co-worker of mine who I really respect, once told me, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
3448359	3448839	That's true.
3448859	3450962	They can put baking soda in the sprinkler system.
3452961	3456364	And that's a good thing I'm not that hardcore about gaming.
3457505	3459087	You know, that at least I bathe.
3459787	3462410	Alright, this is going to be the geek analogy here, okay?
3462430	3465252	To keep hygiene before, you know, before anything else.
3465432	3467154	Alright, last thought, Magus.
3467634	3468896	This is going to be the geek analogy.
3468936	3472619	Just as you cannot move the blob, you cannot get rid of Confunk.
3473331	3475513	G4A2006 is going on and their theme is Fake News Show.
3475533	3476513	I'm glad that's very original.
3501391	3503232	What do you mean their theme is fake news show?
3503812	3504852	It's fake news show.
3505032	3509694	Like their G4A 2006, Unite, Vote, Award, Argue is their theme.
3509714	3511754	All right, let's go to at least one more call here.
3512374	3513455	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3513495	3513855	Who's this?
3514895	3517116	Good afternoon or good evening from Seattle.
3517136	3518076	This is DMN.
3518396	3519757	DMN, my friend.
3519797	3520377	What's on your mind?
3520417	3521097	I'm upset with you.
3522078	3523018	Why are you upset with me?
3523038	3523498	What happened?
3523738	3525178	DarkSakura's pissed.
3525279	3526279	You're supposed to love me.
3527999	3528319	I do.
3528580	3529740	You don't return my calls anymore.
3531818	3534519	Well, I can't help changing my number and you not going to the trouble of stalking me.
3535059	3536920	Look, it's the new hairdo.
3537260	3538561	Now the boys won't leave her alone.
3538761	3541002	My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard.
3543103	3546604	And what leads you to be calling our lovely program tonight, Mr. DMN?
3547345	3550406	Well, I call first off with terrible, terrible news.
3550606	3550986	What's that?
3551166	3557709	Nintendo decided to make me work Sundays now until about 5.30, so I don't get home until 6 or 7.
3557849	3559630	So that means ATH is on hiatus.
3561571	3562972	Aw, I'm sorry to hear that.
3563712	3567614	Yeah, but I'm going to give that Wii away one Wii or another.
3568114	3568514	All right.
3570255	3573936	Could we write a letter to Nintendo begging for clemency or something?
3575797	3576337	All right, fine.
3576637	3579658	I doubt it, but I'm calling for several reasons.
3579718	3582539	I have a laundry list, but I'll try to keep them as short as possible.
3582719	3582999	All right.
3584100	3587901	First of all, the $299 Wii, total, total garbage.
3588582	3589482	Why is this garbage?
3590444	3596769	Reggie Philane, our company president, has made it quite clear that the Wii will not be priced over $249.
3598591	3599031	That's it?
3599211	3599612	Well said.
3601013	3602834	That's pretty much all I can say on that.
3602854	3604275	That's pretty much all that needs to be said.
3604856	3606417	Ooh, you know something we don't know, huh?
3607498	3607778	Yeah.
3607858	3608419	You do!
3608519	3609119	You do!
3609800	3612422	Oh, God, I'm so jealous that you work for Nintendo sometimes.
3612722	3614264	Yeah.
3614284	3617566	At the same time, I'd hate that, because, you know, on this radio program, I would...
3618680	3621122	Probably get fired so fast by saying that crap.
3621202	3622803	Alright, so anyway, change the subject.
3623564	3628888	No, the things that I share with you guys, I'm very, very selective about.
3629088	3629588	That's fine.
3631210	3633391	But also, you guys were talking about EA.
3633531	3640777	EA could make a lot more money if they decided to stop spamming everybody with Madden and actually not kill their franchises.
3640837	3641838	Like, oh, I don't know, SSX?
3643775	3649157	At the same time though, EA has Spore coming out and they have said that they are going to develop more for the Wii and DS.
3649298	3651058	So maybe they are changing their tone a little bit.
3652659	3657841	And I would think that $50 as a price point for software is pretty much going to be the norm.
3658101	3668646	I think what Loki said earlier, if it goes any higher than that, developers are going to have to take a second look at their price points.
3670027	3672508	Well, anything else you want to say to our listeners tonight, DMN?
3673842	3676605	Snakes on a Plane is in less than two weeks.
3676805	3677446	Go see it.
3678046	3680568	Yeah, except this is the day I'm going to Disneyland.
3682090	3686814	I promised somebody weeks ago bacon, and yeah, that's it.
3687374	3687795	All right.
3688215	3689016	Bye, DMN.
3689116	3689376	All right.
3689877	3690297	Bye, guys.
3690517	3690817	All right.
3691158	3692819	Thank you guys so much for your phone calls.
3692859	3693680	We appreciate it.
3693740	3696362	And if you didn't get in tonight, go ahead and try it again next week.
3696823	3699765	We really appreciate you guys trying to call in and participate with our program.
3699946	3700326	It's great.
3701184	3702785	Alright, any last minute stories?
3702805	3703765	Anybody want to get out there?
3704345	3705506	Before we wrap up tonight's program?
3706846	3706966	No.
3706986	3711308	I'm trying to think.
3711408	3713809	All things considered, it's been somewhat of a slow news week.
3715029	3720931	When the big news is all coming from Xbox Live Arcade, which I think we had like five stories on tonight, I think it's kind of a slow week.
3721011	3721972	No offense to the arcade.
3722012	3724833	I love the Xbox Live Arcade, but that's not the center of gaming right now.
3724853	3725453	GameTap
3731158	3732239	partnered with Konami.
3733399	3734700	Oh yeah, I checked out GameTab.
3734880	3737602	Castlevania, Frogger and Contra, Hard Corps.
3737742	3740204	Yeah, they have the Genesis Castlevania game on there now, which is cool.
3740344	3741265	So that's kind of neat.
3742866	3743726	What else do they do?
3745648	3751892	Oh yeah, I was going to say, there was that new device, I guess you would call it a device, Exploder HD.
3753313	3759997	They're putting down the PlayStation 2 to upscale all their games to 720p or 1080i, which I thought was kind of neat.
3760794	3764257	I don't know how great they're going to look, but that is something that's coming.
3764977	3768421	So I guess watch for reviews on that.
3771043	3772164	What's the other thing, too?
3772384	3778510	Oh, I think we mentioned last week that Test Drive Unlimited, that the price was dropping down to $35.99.
3780111	3785216	Well, apparently that only applies to the U.S., so if you're in the U.K., you're still paying full price for it, so that sucks.
3786479	3793103	Funnydale in the chatroom wants me to point out, and I remember Extifer of all people showed me this earlier this week, World of Warcraft now has a MySpace page.
3793743	3799987	So you can add music from the game to your MySpace and I guess other little animations and things like that.
3800067	3804550	So you can pimp your MySpace with World of Warcraft.
3804690	3808252	And Rockstar canceled the Xbox version of Bully.
3808372	3811974	Which is funny because I still haven't even seen the PlayStation 2 version of Bully yet.
3812675	3814016	And waiting for that one to come out.
3814216	3814536	But, um.
3817283	3819225	I hope they do a 360 version, but they said they weren't.
3820606	3820867	Oh, well.
3822208	3822688	We'll have to wait.
3823629	3823910	All right.
3824450	3828354	Well, then I believe that is going to bring our show to a close.
3828414	3831557	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
3832037	3834800	It's that time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
3835721	3837362	Drew, thank you so much for being here tonight.
3837402	3837923	Appreciate it.
3839730	3842432	Unfortunately, I can't call you Dr. Drew because that name is taken.
3842692	3844193	It's unfortunately taken.
3844313	3846754	Reverend Drew or something or Professor Drew.
3846774	3847795	Oh, I like Professor Drew.
3848455	3848976	Oh, snap.
3849176	3850636	Because you kind of look, you know, the glasses.
3850697	3852498	You can have that professor look to you.
3853178	3853498	All right.
3853538	3853998	Final thought.
3854319	3854659	Pie.
3855880	3856720	Loki, your final thought.
3857300	3862303	My final thought is I got to ask a certain somebody for a certain something that I want.
3863824	3866726	My final thought is A, you're not going to get it.
3867136	3870422	B, die monster, you don't belong in this world.
3871003	3872546	And DarkSakura, your final thought.
3873248	3874670	A, reject false icons.
3875371	3879459	B, it was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.
3882410	3886711	Thank you guys so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio and podcasting.
