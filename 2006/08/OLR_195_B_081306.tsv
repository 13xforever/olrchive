20578	21278	Orange Lounge Radio
47791	49332	and just, you know, people who want to have fun.
49352	51954	And that's what we're doing here on Orange Lawn Trader tonight is having a whole lot of fun.
52775	57018	We'd love for you guys to join us sometime live Sunday nights at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
57418	59940	Let's get back into the gaming news, though, so we have something to rant about.
60360	60820	All right.
60900	64843	Speaking of stuff to rant about, I hate to do this every week,
65461	66842	You know, we play this game at work.
66922	69544	It's what stupid thing is Sony going to do this week?
69704	70245	And you know what?
70485	71466	They never disappoint.
71906	73387	But, okay.
73728	74869	So there was news reports.
74909	85477	This isn't exactly PlayStation 3 related, but there's reports that the first Blu-ray drives that are going to be available in the Sony Vios, yeah, they won't play Blu-ray movies.
85998	88820	That's like a DVD player that does not play DVD movies.
89400	91682	So what the hell is it going to do?
92263	93644	Oh, but you can, you know...
94662	96864	Burn your own content and stuff.
99066	101228	So it's like a Blu-ray data drive or something.
101628	102649	Yeah, pretty much.
103070	114279	And because they said that the whole reason why that it can't is because there was actually some lagging software development and copy protection issues.
115520	115681	So...
116821	140221	That's not good, because, you know what, I mean, these PlayStation 3s, they use PC drives, more or less, and, yeah, I hope they get this crap together when the PS3 comes out, or else, who knows, we may see some firmware updates now playing, you know, Blu-ray movies, because I don't know why else you would need a Blu-ray player.
141703	142043	Wow.
142884	144225	Well, we'll see what happens with that.
144990	149631	Well, there is actually some interesting news in regards to the Halo movie.
151852	154293	There is information on Ain't It Cool News.
154733	160654	The director was basically saying that, first of all, he prefers Halo 1.
161034	161895	I thought that was pretty funny.
163490	173996	but that is talking about some of the material that's going to be in the movie, talking about how Master Chief is going to be a mix of the Man in the Suit and CG.
174856	180840	To quote, the film has to have a feeling of reality so that it means I want to keep him as real as much as I can.
181400	187563	They're talking about how it's hard to have someone who moves like an animation as opposed to someone who moves like a human.
187964	192306	They're also working on having the Covenant be along the same lines, making them
192946	195748	as real as they can possibly make the movements.
196588	200631	Another quote from him, from an organic standpoint, they have to be believable.
200991	203192	They also need to be terrifying and alien.
203733	206314	And the best way to start doing that is to break the human silhouette.
206734	211797	Although many of them are bipedal automatically, you can shift the overall body to something very alien.
211958	212818	So I thought that was pretty cool.
213178	213739	So what do you think?
213759	219022	Do you think the Halo movie, hearing the director's perspective and all this, do you think the Halo movie is going to be winner or loser?
219522	226066	Winner because he's actually a huge Halo fan and a huge gamer.
226566	236131	He's basically saying that he's been picking the things that are the most holy of holy things in Halo and keeping them as faithful as possible.
238112	243073	Oh, Chris, one of our in-house lesbians tonight seems to disagree.
243173	243653	What's going on?
244093	246854	Well, I don't really have an idea about the Halo movie.
246874	249054	It's just that I've heard other people who have done the same thing.
249094	254275	It's like, oh, I was this huge fan of this, and I'm going to make sure everything's fine, and it just doesn't work.
254815	257636	Yeah, do you think the guy who directed Street Fighter was a huge fan of Street Fighter?
259236	261737	If he was, I feel very bad.
261757	266018	Yeah, or at least a huge fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Kylie Minogue.
266238	266798	Yeah, pretty much.
268342	271423	PoohEater seems a little upset in our chatroom over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
271443	272303	Click on chat.
272643	275304	Aw, no Uwe Boll for this movie.
275544	277285	Uwe Boll can die in burning hell.
277825	280045	Wow, don't hold back, please.
280726	284527	And Zappy says, all hail Uwe Boll, maker of crappy game movies.
286247	286627	I see.
287268	290269	Now, he may make crappy game movies, but you know what?
290509	292309	I really think he's going to nail Postal.
292629	293810	You can't get that game wrong.
293830	295070	But Postal is a crappy game.
295683	297544	That means he's going to do it justice.
297704	302047	He needs to realize that his movies are never going to be taken seriously.
302167	303108	Just make it campy.
303768	306129	Maybe he should do the Dead Rising movie if there's ever one.
306950	307210	No.
308010	308611	No, he shouldn't.
309311	310312	No, Romero should.
312332	313733	Here we go, Dawn of the Dead Part 2!
329904	340490	The Consumer Electronics Association, or CEA, might be checking into the fact maybe they want to do a massive trade show specifically about games.
340891	349036	Now, they already do the Consumer Electronics Show, and this was the nation's largest gaming show until about 1994 when E3 started.
349856	355179	Only 11% of the attendees at Consumer Electronics Show 2006 had interest in games and gaming products.
355580	356040	But, quote,
356500	366044	Since ESA decided to eliminate the E3 event in its known format, we have been deluged with inquiries on whether we could fill the trade show needs of smaller video entertainment companies.
366124	369785	This coming from Gary Shapiro, President and CEO of the CEA.
370185	377708	Quote, our executive board met yesterday and unanimously asked staff to explore ways that we could help the gaming community.
378528	383450	The Consumer Electronics Association believes that trade shows are the most viable means for reaching a market and
383689	387851	as they serve smaller companies and entrepreneurs who need access to media, buyers, and investors.
388311	391693	Our board, association, and events are committed to growing the industry.
392033	396455	In fact, nearly 80% of our members are companies with annual sales under $10 million.
396755	406500	So maybe here's where the smaller game companies can seek refuge is CES, whether it be in the form of next year's big show or a smaller separate show has been heard about.
406520	410022	To be honest, in the past it was that way anyway, so why not?
411547	411647	E3 CES
434009	436631	Some of our chatroom folks seem to think this is a good idea, though.
436671	438973	NintendoManiac64 says, Woot for CES.
439313	442575	RavensDolphin says, Yes, CES is geek central.
442655	445097	Firebomba thinks a different expo should step up, though.
445177	449240	They'll go to the open arms of Penny Arcade Expo, which a lot of folks have been saying.
450000	450341	Oh, this...
451161	453483	Are the lesbians digging Penny Arcade Expo?
453524	454745	Maisie says, hell yeah.
454825	455325	What's up with that?
455445	457668	Well, I'm just a huge Penny Arcade fan.
457708	458889	I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan.
459129	459630	It's good stuff.
459670	460150	It's good stuff.
460170	461011	Those guys know their stuff.
461131	461572	Don't get me wrong.
461592	462753	I'm a huge Penny Arcade fan as well.
463313	467678	And I met a dude in the line at E3 two years ago buying hamburgers.
468158	470941	We randomly met them at E3 a couple years ago, and...
471161	476223	I was in line with, we were in line buying lunch and just talking about stuff.
476403	478804	I think they write very good editorial pieces on the gaming industry.
478844	480685	I would love to go to Penny Arcade Expo someday.
480725	482206	It's just a lack of fundage.
482306	483326	But have you been, Megzi?
483566	484247	No, I haven't.
484327	485387	I would kill to go.
486028	488429	I heard they're giving away a new car this year.
489509	492971	The big gaming cluster tournament they have there of all these old school games.
493191	493831	That's pretty awesome.
495095	497718	Will you maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?
497878	498118	Pardon?
498439	500721	Maybe make an appearance at a later Penny Arcade Expo?
500902	501402	I'd love to.
501522	504346	Maybe we could have an Orange Lounge Radio booth and staff it with lesbians.
504586	506528	That would be awesome.
507109	508491	The new breed of booth babe.
510273	512376	These booth babes don't want anything to do with you.
515986	517807	And how's that different than any other year?
517867	518807	That's very true.
519508	520448	Very, very true.
520908	522028	So, yeah, it's kind of funny.
522449	528291	Well, anyways, another cool thing that's going to be happening pretty soon, and you've probably seen it with a lot of the games out there right now.
529151	533112	Like, Xbox 360 games are pretty much the same with any other next-gen games.
533132	534173	They're pretty expensive right now.
534973	537174	$59.99 retail seems to be the going price for most games out there.
537714	538435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
554306	557348	Samurai Warriors 2, Just Cause, Blitz the League, Fusion Frenzy 2, Viva Pinata, Cars, and Rayman's Raving Rabbids.
571877	574139	And those are all going to be coming out $49.99.
574499	577601	If that's still too much for you, $39.99.
577721	580022	We're going to be having Test Drive Unlimited coming out.
581483	589328	Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1, if you happen to not be on live, which is weird, but whatever.
589728	593250	That's going to be coming out early September as well as Kabbalah's Alaskan Adventure.
594226	596247	I'm just going to give you a hint, the game's probably going to be crap.
596427	597487	That's probably why it's cheap.
598207	601588	World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions is going to be coming out.
601668	605709	Pimp My Ride in November, Kabbalah's African Safari.
606629	608590	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
609070	616372	Also to remind you, as we mentioned last week, the first party games from Microsoft, the launch ones...
616892	622233	Cameo, Project Gotham Racing 3, and Perfect Dark Zero, all $29.99 right now.
622393	625854	And as we mentioned in Part A, Ridge Racer 6, a whopping $19.99.
626414	626654	Wow.
626874	629215	I should invent a game.
629435	630915	Now, wait, what's this?
631616	632436	Unpimp My Ride.
632936	640418	And have it sponsored by Volkswagen, where you get more points for, you know, like you get like 50,000 points for spinners and...
641578	654089	and if they have like if they have vinyl applied to their paint you know when you destroy that car you get extra extra points and if it's actually painted on then you get a lot of points so yeah alright
655286	661673	I want to say real quick, though, I heard Megzi give a little cheer over Viva Pinata, and I haven't heard a lot of people really excited about this game.
661713	663355	So what has you excited about Viva Pinata?
663775	670723	Well, I just like those really obscure, quirky games like Katamari, stuff like that, Cube of War for the GameCube.
670763	671543	You're on the right show.
672865	674006	You are.
674507	677149	I actually heard about it from my manager at work.
678157	679418	Animal Crossing Good Thing, Bad Thing
700250	703071	Fire Resurrected in chat says, I got my Viva Pinata pre-ordered.
703711	707313	And another game, of course, Rapala Trophies coming out on the 360.
707513	708453	Also going to be $35.99.
709154	712015	But really, how many fishing fans are out there on the 360 anyways?
712075	712815	Hey, you never know.
713816	715336	If it's easy achievement points, you'll buy it.
716357	717057	No, I won't.
717718	718438	I will get it for free.
720299	727362	Well, speaking of online-related things, and Megzi should be interested in this.
728260	730242	Dead Rising already has download content.
732644	736207	It's actually going to be released in about a month in Europe.
736848	741612	They've already put out, though, some quick downloadable content.
741632	745596	They have basically keys that are unlocking costumes that are hidden in the games.
746096	752582	They're called Miami Knights, Casual, Weekender, Round Shades, Burgundy Grandpa, Pink Paparazzi,
753248	754508	and Man in Black.
755049	756129	So what do you get, Johnny Cash?
756269	756789	That's cool.
757069	760070	No, he's just got a black jacket, black pants.
760430	761891	Wait, so you've seen these costumes, Loki?
762071	764331	Yeah, they're downloadable right now in live.
764992	767212	They came out the same day as Dead Rising.
767672	776195	And basically in the very beginning of the game when you first get into the security room there's a bunch of lockers in there and you can walk up and change clothes.
776355	777495	They did that in Resident Evil 2.
777595	779956	You get the keys and you get Jill's cowgirl outfit and...
780973	781814	Dead Rising, Jill's Sandwich
808080	808641	Pretty cool.
808761	810724	Is there a smoothie shop in the mall?
811685	812587	There is, I think.
813348	814529	Oh, all right.
816733	817814	Oh, I see what you're doing.
817854	821600	Yeah, go listen to Part A if you haven't yet, and you'll get that maybe.
822521	824484	Remember, smoothie.
826096	826856	and so on.
848513	848833	Dead Rising 2
868031	872314	If not that, okay maybe that's a little ambitious, at least being the number two game, where Oblivion was a little while ago.
872334	876838	In fact, I'm looking at my list right now, right this minute, somebody is playing Dead Rising.
877218	880581	And this person on my friends list already got the infinite mode it looks like, so that's pretty cool.
880861	881121	Lucky.
881201	882942	You know what's great though?
883123	889547	If you happen to read somethingawful.com, they have a little page on there talking about Dead Rising and how to spend the 72 hours in the game.
889828	893590	It's hilarious because they basically never left the security room for the 72 hours.
896370	899178	It's funny, they kept taking pictures of the one chick's boobs in there.
901605	901825	Wow.
903257	908161	Dear everyone, I have heard your concerns and passed them to every source within Capcom Possible.
931181	938950	I feel your pain as I myself have a large SDTV and am having trouble reading the mission objectives, item names, etc.
939330	942094	I'd like you all to know we have heard your concerns and take them seriously.
942174	945918	I've been seeing campaigns on other forums to send hundreds of emails to our support email.
946348	964516	unfortunately this doesn't expedite or increase the importance of the concern in any way but it does take time and resources from other fans equally deserving concerns all concerns are always important to us and do what we can we do what we can we would like you to know we appreciate your feedback blah blah blah so basically they're saying please stop emailing us we know
965285	966365	There's a boo-boo in the game.
966385	967726	My bad, shut up.
968126	969266	Yeah, my bad, shut up.
969487	970287	What do you think they're going to do?
970307	971067	You think they'll patch it?
971107	972227	I think they'll patch it.
972508	973088	You really think?
973528	975169	That seems like an awfully big thing to patch.
975449	976629	Does he have font size?
976669	976889	No.
978050	978290	Mixi?
979950	987533	I don't really know much about it since I have yet to play Dead Rising, but it seems like, like you said, a big thing to patch and kind of a...
988126	988887	Dead Rising MMO
1011338	1015822	I think a lot of folks would have just liked to see Dead Rising be multiplayer.
1016362	1021666	But my thought is, if they've done Dead Rising multiplayer, what's going to be the big catch for Dead Rising 2?
1021866	1024949	Be the zombie?
1025109	1026670	Didn't they already do that?
1027370	1034055	I think the perfect MMO would be you have your everyday life and then you release your serum.
1034936	1036838	And if your character gets infected...
1037614	1038295	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1065919	1070400	All right, let's get into the mailbag and find some other great thoughts.
1070560	1071940	We're going to put the hazmat suit.
1073120	1082682	Yes, Jamie's going to suit up in the hazmat at bestest suit right now and get her hands wet and get there in the mailbag at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com They better not get wet.
1082722	1084282	Your emails right now.
1084362	1086002	If they get wet, that means my suit's broken.
1092344	1094504	First email comes from Nailhead.
1096921	1102390	I'll start by saying that I love the show, been listening to the podcast for a year, it makes traveling to work and back much faster.
1104494	1108581	Most games that I buy are from recommendations from Orange Lodge Radio, so thank you for that.
1109008	1112869	That's a scary thought that we're influencing the general public like that, but no thank you, seriously.
1113230	1115010	I have a story that you may want to know about.
1115170	1117531	I'm part of a small film company in Huntsville, Alabama.
1117571	1119132	Shout out to Jamie, I know she's from Alabama too.
1119292	1119912	Hell yeah!
1120932	1123713	And we are in production of a World of Warcraft documentary.
1123773	1127455	I'll link you to this article because I love the way it's written much better than me trying to describe it.
1128375	1130096	I'm going to read the URL, it's fairly long.
1130276	1133197	It's at wowinsider.com slash 2006 slash 08 slash 08.
1136158	1142892	slash bowling dash four dash GnomeReagan G-N-O-M-E GnomeReagan, actually, but that's alright.
1143113	1143553	Sorry, I don't...
1144724	1145064	Whatever.
1146005	1149368	Dash wow, dash documentary, dash in, dash the, dash works.
1149528	1152510	So it sounds like go to this wow insider and look for an August 8th post.
1152570	1152670	Yeah.
1152690	1153371	Sounds like, okay.
1154612	1154772	Yeah.
1155052	1162798	Okay, the link to the film's webpage is at worldofwarcraftthemovie.com and the film company is deadworkers.com.
1162818	1163478	That's pretty cool.
1164279	1167942	Not as cool as zombie flesh eaters, but still pretty damn cool.
1168582	1170824	I'd be curious to see what this documentary would turn out like.
1171125	1172626	It'd be great if you mentioned it on the show.
1173967	1176029	It would surely help get us more interviews.
1176510	1178932	Also, we would love to interview you all as well.
1179132	1180934	That is, if we can make it out west.
1181835	1184077	In closing, I'll list three things about your show I love.
1184297	1186500	FUs of the Week, PC vs. Mac is hilarious.
1186620	1187941	I tend to side with Loki on this one.
1188702	1189803	You are Bruce Campbell fans.
1191187	1192228	Here's something funny.
1192448	1201157	Speaking of Penny Arcade earlier, they did a strip about Dead Rising and they had Mac fans drooling over the... That was great.
1202179	1202959	Yeah, that was great.
1204101	1207164	The closing on this is thanks, I love you all.
1207865	1208205	Kisses.
1209166	1209927	Smoochie, smoochie.
1211429	1212570	Got one from Diginova.
1213599	1216363	Hey crew, a big hello from DigiNova on the other side of the pond.
1216883	1221849	Been a while since I last called in, but I wanted to raise the subject of the OLR Skype line.
1222350	1224592	I totally find this part of the show one of the most interesting parts.
1224993	1233363	Granted, there are the regular callers, but to myself they are part of the OLR formula that makes it so addictive, that makes me so envious that I can't participate more often.
1233763	1235043	I can't wait to see the reaction of this week's show.
1257890	1267277	At this point, I want to make my dedication to the OLR crew and have purchased the above domain, which isn't a total rip-off, but I hope this makes me an official trooper from Sky.
1268138	1269199	Have a great show tonight.
1269499	1272501	I'll be sure to listen to and pass the word of OLR to the masses.
1279150	1282156	So somebody bought OrangeLounge.co.uk for us, in a way.
1282456	1284119	Seriously, maybe we should have a UK Mirror.
1284861	1286023	I'm down with that.
1286083	1288547	Email us back if you want to help run a UK Mirror for us.
1289663	1290083	Two things.
1290323	1303807	A, I'm very glad someone's saying something positive about the call-in segment because I think, I want to say either the reviews in iTunes or somewhere was bashing on the callers and I, you know, they're just mad they don't listen Sunday nights and can call in themselves.
1303887	1304807	I don't know what their deal is.
1304827	1313269	So I'm really glad something said, because we really want this to be everybody's show, not just, you know, DarkSakura, Loki, and Sky hog the airwaves for, you know, three hours.
1313550	1315170	We like getting you guys involved, you know.
1315290	1317871	Although my ego does like hogging the airwaves for three hours.
1317891	1318671	We are the stars.
1320053	1321857	I'm the diva of the show.
1321917	1323199	No, Rob's the diva of the show.
1323259	1323901	Second thing.
1324952	1333897	I'm loving the increase it seems like we've been having in UK presence lately because I've noticed on Myspace we've been getting a lot of ads from UK folks lately.
1334277	1337218	So whoever's spreading our name out there in the UK, thanks.
1337418	1343962	And we're really glad that you guys are noticing that we want to be representative of gamers everywhere.
1344182	1351345	Not just silly America, but UK, Australia, Canada, anywhere.
1351525	1354187	So worldwide gaming news.
1355328	1379648	I especially love our UK listeners though because I'm going to move into your country one day when I have money I'm in your country buying your stuff eating your food Oh Bobby Bobby Blackwolf wrote us
1380839	1386382	Oh, our good pal Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com, who also does a show Sunday nights.
1386402	1388143	The subject is Dear LLR Heart.
1389243	1390944	As in, you know, less than three.
1392465	1393786	Dear LLR, all in caps, by the way.
1393806	1396727	Which is how many kills he'll get in the Chromestowns tournament, by the way.
1396987	1397848	Less than three.
1398528	1399289	Like your mom.
1399429	1399829	Listen.
1402705	1403846	Stop talking trash.
1404326	1404646	I know.
1404666	1406488	I'm sorry.
1406808	1411391	Less than three is how many people we have signed up to participate in the Chrome House tournament right now.
1411631	1418536	This whole thing reminds me of that South Park episode where they're trying to get Tweekin, I forget the other guy, to fight.
1418876	1419416	Oh, Craig.
1419517	1419817	Craig.
1419837	1421278	Yeah, Tweekin, Craig to fight.
1421638	1423699	And they're all talking trash for them.
1423719	1424080	Yeah.
1424100	1425160	Okay.
1435743	1437344	I love your show.
1437424	1439625	I also love destroying the crumhounds of your listeners.
1440066	1440686	See you next week.
1440826	1441987	XOXOXOXO.
1442507	1443608	Heart, heart, Bobby Blackwolf.
1444448	1445029	I love you, Bobby.
1447350	1447610	What a jerk.
1447630	1448951	That email was full of awesome and win.
1449271	1451112	I personally don't give a shit because I don't play crumhounds.
1451533	1455135	Yeah, easy for you to say until we get trashed on next week's show.
1456101	1456701	I can't wait.
1483946	1484627	I'm going to read this.
1484807	1485367	It's really long.
1486388	1491490	Hey guys, just wanted to let you guys know I enjoy the show and wanted to share my thoughts about video games causing violence in teen pregnancy.
1492531	1498154	The knee-jerk reaction from many in our age group, like Junami, is to blame the parents.
1498474	1508019	However, the vast majority of us are not parents or are not parents of adolescent age children, especially when you factor out the Pac-Man and Sudoku playing grandmothers that bump up the average age of the gamer statistic.
1508559	1512342	It's easy for those of us who aren't parents to cast blame, but it's not so simple.
1512522	1517926	Who among us growing up had parents who were successfully able to control all the influence that shaped our minds?
1518206	1522589	There are many influences on a child, including the extended family, community, peers, and yes, media.
1522930	1524251	Parents can only control so much.
1524711	1528454	Full-time parents in the 60s couldn't keep Playboy and Pod out of the hands of children.
1528814	1531056	How can single parents and dual-wage parents today...
1532249	1533350	Thank you for watching.
1557782	1558983	It's obviously not video games.
1559023	1560924	People always blame new technology, trends, and music.
1560964	1565247	The parents of yesterday were convinced that Elvis singlehandedly deflowered a generation of virgins.
1567489	1567989	That's not fiction.
1570322	1596196	but there are very few parents of today who grew up with that music agree there have been studies done linking video games to physical agitation like increased heart rate and aggression but also after playing a game of football doesn't feel that same agitation and aggression video games are new they will be scapegoated until we who have grown up with them become the parents of adolescents ourselves but then I'm sure we'll be blaming VR my god that role plays my god that role plays snuff films we never had that satan
1598315	1601177	Defensively pointing to the First Amendment as a shield doesn't solve anything.
1601437	1605919	The game industry in particular and the gaming community in general has to take a lead in tackling these problems.
1606259	1609720	Without casting blame, we need to improve our society's respect for life and human dignity.
1609900	1610341	Amen.
1610901	1612882	These ideas have to be proactively taught.
1612942	1615583	Simply censoring or removing media to the contrary doesn't work.
1615983	1620545	Eliminating the video game where you can kill a prostitute does not by itself create respect for women.
1620865	1624347	We have to directly teach respect for women.
1626490	1633114	We have to directly teach respect for women, and a society that has respect for women will naturally not be entertained by a video game where you can kill a prostitute.
1633674	1636496	That's the message that we need to communicate to the mainstream and to our government.
1636816	1639537	Instead of fighting over whose fault it is, let's work on fixing the problem.
1639818	1640438	I agree with that.
1640958	1646081	As a side note, Canton, Ohio is a socially and religiously conservative city that teaches abstinence only.
1646161	1653946	Conservative parents seem to generally believe that kids, if never told about sex, will never figure out how to perform sex or even that there are certain bodily parts that can be stimulated.
1654586	1660751	This is even though one of these conservative parents themselves conceived their current crop of children in the back of a four pinto.
1661131	1661752	But I digress.
1662152	1664634	That's why these parents think that it must be music or video games.
1664714	1668918	After all, children are never exposed to sex in their God-fearing homes and communities, right?
1669198	1670619	It must be an outside influence, right?
1671140	1673742	Fighting the conservatives will always be an exercise in frustration.
1674102	1677925	They think they're angels, but an all-demonic influence must come from the outside.
1678025	1678285	Sad.
1678365	1679366	Sorry for the long-winded email.
1679386	1680747	Just wanted you to know that I enjoy the show.
1680787	1681288	Thanks, Johnny.
1681828	1683810	I agree with every damn thing that you've said there.
1685498	1691881	I'd like to say I have plenty of respect for women, but I enjoy games where you can kill prostitutes.
1692801	1695863	They have little respect for themselves, though.
1695883	1696743	Oh, okay.
1696883	1698184	Well, I had fun with Grand Theft Auto.
1699084	1709629	I actually, I have to say, I do love having my random vows of fake, non-reality destruction.
1710610	1710730	It's
1711812	1712953	It's a release, a regression.
1712993	1721798	And on top of it, there's all those added studies too about how solving even the puzzles in some of these more violent games, how they raise your cognitive function.
1721998	1735566	I'll have you know, I'm actually going to be putting Grand Theft Auto San Andreas on my laptop so that during our segments or during our breaks between Part A and Part B, I can play the hot coffee mod at whim.
1736707	1737087	You know what?
1737267	1739469	I give props to that listener for being well educated.
1741270	1741570	That's all.
1742253	1742713	Well-educated.
1743393	1743753	Individual.
1744513	1746714	You don't agree with some... No, no, no, I'm... No.
1746834	1747254	No, I do.
1747614	1758436	No, I... Saying I... You know, not often you see well-educated internet rants, so I'm very pleased Well, honestly, I think that that type of attitude should be applied toward all sorts of things within, you know, society that's going on.
1758857	1764178	You know, I honestly think that... You know, I actually... I'm not going to go into detail about this.
1764258	1766058	I recently had a conversation with my mother.
1766618	1768118	You know what I'm talking about.
1768138	1768298	Mm-hmm.
1769339	1769419	Um...
1772580	1777523	I had a discussion with my mother and she started to preach at me and try to bring Bible quotes into it.
1778303	1779604	And I was like, excuse me?
1779624	1781925	She's like, do you believe in Jesus?
1782005	1786327	I was like, what does me believing in Jesus have to do with you respecting who I am?
1791854	1796018	There's nothing wrong with being religious.
1796078	1796738	Nothing at all.
1796798	1797119	It's just...
1814874	1826040	If you're really trying to convince people to not act a certain way, or not to play these violent games, or to not do something, you need to actually have something substantial to support your claim with.
1826261	1827201	That's what I have to say.
1827621	1843091	I actually have, to defend, I'm not conservative or anything, but to defend the conservatives, there are a few people out there that are just that dumb that they will go out and do stupid things from games, but I would have more respect for them if they actually researched the subject they were talking about.
1843271	1846834	You should see some of those anti-Harry Potter, oh, Harry Potter Promotes Witchcraft.
1847234	1848775	They're Christians, hello.
1848955	1854179	There actually is a book, though, that one of my friends who is, she's a very, she's a liberal Christian.
1855099	1863545	She is called What Harry Potter Teaches Us About Jesus or something like that and how they're actually using it as a relation, how it teaches good values.
1864346	1864726	Well, again.
1864806	1865167	It does.
1865287	1867048	It does teach some good values, but.
1867659	1870241	Listen, if you want witchcraft, you watch Harry Potter.
1870341	1876687	If you want, you know, Jesus and all that stuff, you watch The Chronicles of Narnia.
1877688	1883793	So, you know, there's movies out there that are both parallel to different religions.
1884494	1888698	I'm waiting for my goddamn Pagan series, or better yet, Scientology.
1888758	1890960	Oh, I'm sorry, Battlefield Earth was already out there, so...
1893035	1896839	Tom Cruise, Saving the World with Scientology Jeremy Todd 1
1909858	1911259	First of all, RidRacer.
1912119	1914380	R-I-D-R-A-Y-S-H-E-R.
1915981	1917241	Okay, I found this on YouTube.
1917281	1921683	Jack Thompson was interviewed, well, not really an interview, but more of a discussion about video game violence.
1922164	1925645	The main discussion was about the game Bully and how it could affect children in schools.
1925685	1926946	Here's a link to the video.
1927406	1929387	Look on YouTube and look under Jack Thompson.
1929997	1931858	Yeah, do a search if you really want.
1932959	1942865	Honestly, there's a reason why we've relegated this sort of to the mailbag segment and didn't talk about it a whole lot in depth tonight, and that is, unlike G4, we don't feel like giving this guy more attention.
1943626	1948549	With all due respect to the emailer, I realize it's in the blogs and everything, you know, and people are talking about it, but...
1949093	1950394	I'm going to finish reading his email.
1951274	1955416	They bring up some interesting points and I thought that OLR and possibly some of the listeners would want to see this video.
1956016	1958317	My opinion is also, by the way, on game politics.
1958417	1959678	They kept bringing some of the stuff up.
1960378	1968362	My opinion on this video is that Jack Thompson believes that when a kid starts playing a violent video game, that the kid will instantly turn into an angry, violent kid and that that's just not true.
1968902	1973625	One thing I found interesting is that when they asked Jack if he had seen the game being played by someone...
1974605	1975986	and he replies by saying no.
1976566	1982548	So basically he is saying that the game Bully will make kids violent even though he hasn't actually seen the video being played and he doesn't know what the game runs.
1982988	1995493	To be fair, none of them have seen the game yet and also to be fair, his whole assumption on the game was based off of the press release about the game, the pictures they've seen so far of the game and that kind of stuff.
1995913	1999495	So he's in the wrong for assuming that this game is
2000148	2004870	You know, a certain way because of just, you know, a press release and some pictures and he hasn't played the game.
2005130	2008231	But they're also wrong in defending the game because they haven't played it yet either.
2008751	2012553	So, the whole thing is, it's an argument over something completely retarded.
2012593	2023357	That's just like saying, you know, The Passion of the Christ and, you know, Mel Gibson is making a movie pretending the movie hasn't come out yet or something like that and debating, you know, that whole movie without having seen anything on it.
2023757	2026898	It's just, the whole argument, the whole interview is retarded.
2026978	2028419	The whole thing was an...
2029139	2031401	Ego cock-stroking thing.
2031621	2032182	Seriously.
2032342	2034424	Jack Thompson wanted to be on cable TV.
2034784	2038468	G4 wanted to be able to interview the big bad guy behind video games.
2038808	2041310	There was nothing redeeming about that whole thing.
2041450	2041650	Nothing.
2041671	2042491	They covered nothing.
2042812	2046235	And I wish to not waste any more time talking about it.
2046595	2047256	Moving on.
2048757	2061327	Chris emails us saying, Hey OLR, I recently received a DS Lite for my birthday and I was wondering, this is my favorite game for PSP and PS2 is SOCOM, if there are any games that are similar to SOCOM for DS because please let me know.
2061507	2062408	Thanks, love the show.
2063889	2064230	I don't know.
2065066	2065887	Call of Duty Call of Duty
2081033	2085937	DS, I don't know about that, but there might be something like that coming out.
2086737	2091561	I would say probably right now, Metroid Prime Hunters is a first-person shooter.
2091581	2096124	There's not a whole lot of first-person shooters on the Wii just because of the control setup on it.
2097805	2098886	DS, Wii, whatever.
2100347	2108793	I would say, though, if you have these games that you like, check the publisher's websites and see if they have any release dates listed for any games along those lines.
2110140	2117954	I was just going to throw out as the Nintendo fangirl that Metroid Prime for the DS is really very, very good.
2118719	2147632	and I'm not a big fan of first person shooters in general but that was very very good I liked Metroid and the DS better than I did on the consoles to be honest I like the first Metroid on the Nintendo a little wireless multiplayer goes a long way Super Metroid yes that game was the shit that's all for the email though alright you should email us too you there sitting at your computer or sitting on the bus or in the car listening to our show right now I mean if you're driving don't email us right now but send us an email at some point mailbag at orange lounge radio
2148112	2151434	I just wanna say this isn't news.
2170959	2172260	But I understand why we're covering it.
2172340	2172600	That's fine.
2172620	2173360	I just want to get that out there.
2173380	2173860	This isn't news.
2174160	2174361	Okay.
2175261	2177442	Best game of the year, Elder Scrolls 4.

2224755	2225496	Can I rant for a minute?
2225516	2226876	Actually, that game was really good-looking.
2227732	2229033	Yeah, Finite is a beautiful looking game.
2229413	2230273	Can I rant for a minute, though?
2230853	2235956	I am sick of G4 farting and it turning up on all these game blogs.
2236096	2241418	I mean, seriously, what has G4 done for the gaming industry in the past year?
2241898	2244539	Not a goddamn thing, but letdowns and disappointment.
2244900	2249282	Why is the gaming community continuing to give a shit about anything G4 does?
2250442	2253144	Seriously, don't look at it and maybe it'll go away.
2253424	2270758	We should be focusing our attention on more promising gaming representations such as Independent Radio, GamePolitics.com, which is an impressive website, GameplayHD, that whole channel which is run by people who actually know things about video games, shock and awe.
2271331	2273934	I've actually seen good stuff come out of Eurogamer TV too.
2274214	2274615	You know what?
2274855	2275716	And YouTube.
2276117	2277438	You want to know something funny though?
2277658	2280582	This year's G4ia was X-Play presents G4ia.
2280822	2281483	Because you know what?
2281603	2284066	X-Play is the only gaming show on that network anymore.
2284186	2285628	So seriously, gaming community?
2285808	2286789	I challenge you.
2287490	2291415	Stop giving a shit about G4 for like six months.
2292349	2293250	Thank you for watching!
2310562	2324985	I'm just saying, you know, even ever since the first GeForia that I saw, which was retarded anyways, I was amazed that Spike and their award show was actually better than GeForia when it first came out.
2325005	2329886	I'm like, and this is a network that doesn't even, you know, this isn't a gaming network and they're doing a better show?
2330266	2331046	I mean, come on.
2331327	2334427	Well, GeFor is not a gaming network anymore, and that is a fact.
2334587	2335527	They've come out and said it.
2335727	2337788	It is a guy TV network like Spike.
2338868	2344153	I'm just fucking sick of seeing all these, you know, G4 does this, and it ends up on Dig.
2344273	2347476	I'm like, G4 can suck my dick.
2347516	2348556	Will that end up on Dig?
2349057	2349677	Probably!
2351226	2356488	G4 comes to Orange Lounge Radio Studio and proceeds to get down on their knees and serve a slob.
2373121	2381287	And G4, remember everything negative I'm saying about G4 is in the past couple years, pretty much every decision they made since the tech TV merger, I think we can all agree.
2381768	2384349	G4, when it first started, had a lot of promise.
2384390	2385230	That's pretty cool.
2385330	2397039	And sure, even myself, maybe on this program in the past, I gave Scott and some of the other G4 personalities a hard time, but no more than some of the internet gives us a hard time being a podcaster or whatever.
2397419	2397919	Thanks for watching!
2415926	2425535	that he believed in and something that is so much more beneficial for the gaming community and it makes me so frustrated that all games does things.
2426076	2432522	Orange Lounge Radio, Gamer Andy, Chatterbox, Bobby, everybody does things and nobody seems to care.
2432904	2433304	Exactly.
2433404	2437545	It's like, you know, if I report a street date or something of something, it doesn't matter.
2437765	2446328	But if G4 just says, oh, by the way, this is coming out, it will get posted on every single... If all games did an award show like G4ia did that, nobody would care.
2446648	2450289	And it's sad because that award show would be brought to you by real gamers.
2450889	2451469	Real gamers.
2453270	2454190	Not Game for Pay.
2455137	2457258	Anyway, that was my little rant.
2457478	2458399	That was my little rant.
2458519	2458879	Sorry.
2459899	2463441	I do want to give Scott massive kudos, though.
2463601	2470704	I absolutely give Scott massive kudos because the whole reason why we're on board with all games is that we believe in his vision.
2470784	2475466	Next story, please.
2476707	2477868	Scott is full of awesome and win.
2477888	2478308	Yeah, I know.
2478548	2478728	I know.
2479042	2480484	He's a good guy.
2481025	2483329	Lawrence, I couldn't say enough great things about him.
2484050	2486654	If we could afford to pay him to be our producer, we would.
2487676	2492022	And of course Bobby, even though we give him a hard time about the whole Chromehounds and everything thing.
2492643	2494106	Bobby is full of awesome and win too.
2494946	2496066	They're great.
2496327	2505030	I think I would rather kind of lump G4 in with the Jackie Poo thing and just basically treat it like that.
2505110	2506991	Let's just not talk about them anymore.
2508092	2508552	You know what?
2509032	2510112	I'm taking a stand right now.
2511013	2515375	G4, those words are banned from this program from here on out.
2515815	2517996	Unless they are mentioned in other words and not together.
2518881	2519922	Well, yeah, you know what I mean.
2520883	2524205	Like, for example, we could talk about a G4 map.
2524465	2534132	Okay, that would be fine, but unless they talk about something really big, with the exception of one segment that's coming up tonight, because I just realized there's something coming up in a segment tonight.
2534452	2538134	After tonight's episode, seriously, no more G4 news stories.
2538515	2538895	Seriously.
2539015	2540136	Gee, I wish I had forearms.
2542730	2547305	By the way, Pooeater, just linked to the chatroom, a dig story about G4.
2547907	2549472	Did it seriously get dug?
2551852	2553412	Oh, God, you guys are crazy.
2553933	2557175	Anyway, in news... Yes, please, thank you.
2557715	2564219	There is a full-length feature made especially for Xbox Live that will be coming out on the Marketplace.
2564939	2569982	It's basically a recap of the so far Battlestar Galactica series.
2570782	2573204	So if any of you missed it, go get it.
2573524	2575365	Battlestar Galactica is awesome sauce.
2575970	2581872	I'm glad we can talk about good cable TV now because Battlestar Galactica is pretty fracking awesome.
2582132	2584573	I used to watch the old Battlestar Galactica.
2584593	2589054	The new one just takes the old one and makes it great.
2589194	2590394	You know what they need to do for me though?
2590694	2595076	They need to freaking put the new Doctor Who episodes up there for me because the new Doctor is cute.
2597876	2603218	I made the mistake of watching Doctor Who on YouTube and I found out what happens to Rose.
2607831	2611213	Sorry, I love my British sci-fi, y'all.
2611433	2614494	I think it's a really good idea to put this on Xbox Live.
2615715	2616976	It's a marriage of geekdom.
2617376	2617836	It's great.
2618076	2623359	Dear Microsoft, Doctor Who, please, for the win.
2623519	2624479	Okie dokie.
2625000	2625380	Alright.
2626881	2629744	Louisiana employees of GameStop are suing the retailer for unfair labor practices
2645080	2652907	Six managers claimed they were forced to work 60 or more hours a week without being paid overtime and were told they were not eligible for overtime.
2653927	2657811	EA, by the way, and other major developers lost a court case of something similar.
2657951	2659132	So what do you guys think of this?
2660203	2665344	It happened in California, actually, and they changed, because this affected my husband's salary.
2666504	2674766	They actually had to change part of, I think, something from salaried pay to, it was part of a class action lawsuit.
2674926	2679327	They had to rework, because it was violating some California pay and labor law.
2679887	2689209	In fact, the company I work for has actually had to redo that, because they were paying us by something that's legal in North Carolina and not what's legal in California.
2689764	2691845	But yeah, that happened out here too.
2695486	2698228	That thing's already up to seven digs on dig.com.
2698708	2701209	But it doesn't link to anything because the podcast isn't up yet.
2701229	2703430	They should have waited until the podcast was up and then they could link it.
2703870	2704230	We'll see.
2704390	2704690	I don't know.
2704710	2705370	We'll see what happens.
2705410	2705851	That's cute.
2706311	2707071	You guys are so great.
2707271	2708372	I love Oil Army.
2711533	2712133	Oh, I'm sorry.
2712593	2713474	Megzy was going to have a comment.
2713494	2713954	I'm sorry, Megzy.
2713974	2715535	What did you want to say on the GameStop thing?
2717375	2718396	I like GameStop.
2720016	2723459	Hi, this is Eris from GameStop.
2723479	2724500	She called me like five times.
2725600	2727502	Since I'm not a manager, it doesn't really affect me.
2728743	2731985	So I guess I don't really have anything to say about it.
2733426	2734947	Well, I don't want you to endanger your job.
2734967	2736849	I was going to say, from your perception, does it seem unfair?
2736869	2738530	You don't have to answer.
2738910	2740291	I guess.
2740371	2745195	I mean, if you're working 60 more hours a week in any job, you should be paid fairly for it.
2745578	2746719	True.
2746940	2755030	In California, basically, and I honestly, this is why I will never move out of state because I've worked in the South and it sucks.
2756900	2763242	In California, you're required to have, for every six hours you work, you're required to have two 15-minute breaks.
2763602	2767944	If you work over six hours, you get a 30-minute lunch that you're not paid for, of course.
2768364	2772865	If you work over eight hours in a day, unless there are other prior arrangements made, you get paid overtime.
2773205	2775386	If you go over 10 hours, you get time and a half.
2777127	2778287	Not time and a half, you get double time.
2779827	2781188	Yeah, that's law in California.
2782028	2784649	And if you work over 40 hours a week, you get overtime pay.
2785770	2792212	Now, did they specify whether these were, this is probably just a small detail, if these were store managers or assistant managers?
2792832	2794072	Just said six managers.
2794192	2795413	Oh, alright, then I really don't know.
2796193	2800474	But I think that there's actually something similar in regards, at least for the weekly overtime.
2801214	2806215	But a lot of the, as far as I was aware, I think that most of the GameStop managers are on salary.
2806495	2806916	Yeah, they are.
2807496	2812117	And they actually, they eliminated that in California because it was violating labor law.
2812297	2812517	I see.
2813979	2841168	GameStop managers in Wisconsin are on salary as far as I can tell but if they're working 60 hours a week there should be some sort of provision because I believe that standard salary pay is on a 45 hour a week well in California it's 40 but I think that their old way that they did it is that 45 hours of pay each paycheck and if you're working 60 hours then no that doesn't apply
2842623	2846667	I'm not sure how it is in Wisconsin, I'm just a part-time worker, so I'm just glad when I get hours.
2847768	2853313	But yeah, I guess that if you are working 60 hours, you should get some sort of compensation, because that's just insane.
2856677	2858298	Alright, let's keep it moving.
2859239	2866106	Anyways, speaking of disappointments, PlayStation 3, not going to be playable at Lipzig.
2867429	2875436	So all you German fans of the PlayStation 3 out there, sorry, basically Sony wants to save all their surprises for the Tokyo Game Show.
2876216	2881141	And no word if other developers are showing off any playable PlayStation 3 games.
2882610	2888355	But if Sony decides that they are not going to show the unit, you can bet that a decent amount of the companies will follow suit.
2889136	2889996	So what's this mean?
2891177	2899724	This means that they're going to have to pull out some serious leprechaun magic to get this thing to be impressive by the time Tokyo Game Show comes around.
2899764	2900745	That's all I've got to say.
2901866	2902807	So, I don't know.
2903748	2907531	Not too surprised that they're not having stuff playable because they don't need any more negative press.
2909346	2938595	but I am surprised that they're not gonna well, who knows, maybe they will detail some more stuff about their online service and that kind of thing but no game sucks well, speaking of that particular little convention, there actually is an Ubisoft lineup that was posted if anybody cares about Ubisoft which I do, because I think Ubisoft is they do some happy
2941986	2945668	Dark Messiah of Might and Magic will be out fall 2006.
2947228	2950729	There's also Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent.
2951669	2954130	It has single player, multiplayer mode on Xbox 360, PC, and...
2959571	2961512	This is Xbox 360, I'm sorry.
2962072	2965173	Call of Juarez, Western shooter, playable on PC, September 2006.
2966233	2968974	The Settlers 2, The Next Generation.
2968994	2970534	I haven't heard of The Settlers 1, to be honest.
2970974	2971614	It's on PC.
2971654	2972494	It's a strategy game.
2972915	2973315	No wonder.
2973555	2977696	The Settlers, construction-based strategy game, playable on the DS.
2978456	2981277	Horses with a Z, riding adventure, playable on PC.
2982037	2985378	Open Season, action-adventure, playable on PlayStation 2.
2987103	3002128	and also there were members of the international development team available there who were giving some of the background into how games are created, speaking out on new projects, showing playable games.
3003649	3007270	They also had a playable of Dark Messiah available there.
3008751	3009331	That's pretty cool.
3011078	3039971	some interesting things coming from Sony again talking about their online service for the PS3 well there's also an online service that's supposed to be coming to the PSP in the form of an iTunes like service to download movies and video and of course some music and stuff so anyways it's kind of interesting though right now they've got a total of 120 games coming out by the end of the year so
3041002	3042123	PSP, Gameplay Elements,
3069469	3071350	So some games will support GPS.
3071390	3074772	I think actually Hot Shots Golf, the new ones coming out, will support that.
3075572	3079314	They're also talking about the camera add-on is going to have a microphone built in.
3079354	3081295	It will be able to take still pictures and video.
3082156	3089859	And future iterations of the PSP are likely, but Sony is believing that the device will have a 10-year lifespan.
3089919	3091340	This is all coming from Kotaku.
3091360	3098404	They actually had an interview that they did with John Kohler, the senior marketing manager for the PSP.
3099482	3100322	Kind of interesting.
3101582	3110484	I want to know when their download service for the games is coming out because if they're having trouble with the movies and the music, games is going to be another thing too.
3111024	3113184	And do you really think this is going to take off?
3113524	3113865	I don't know.
3118525	3119686	But, Maisie?
3120726	3126127	Like I said, I've got a vendetta against Sony and the PSP is one of the things I hate most about Sony.
3126567	3126807	Why?
3126827	3126867	Um...
3128157	3146651	Because, let's see, looking at it from, if you just look at it hypothetically, it's a great system, you know, it does all this stuff, but it seems like it almost does too much and everything is kind of half done, and it seems like all this other stuff is just overkill, and it's going to all be half done, just kind of like the movies and the music and the games.
3146731	3148433	Pick something and do it well?
3148693	3156319	Yeah, the business world has that saying that if you do one thing well, then you've succeeded, if you do three things halfway, then you've failed, and that's the PSP.
3156639	3157360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3177878	3183381	There really, to be honest, isn't a game that you gotta have for the PSP.
3183741	3187303	I mean, I play Grand Theft Auto religiously, and that's pretty much it.
3187403	3189765	That's my one game I buy each year.
3190245	3191806	I mean, but you know what?
3191826	3197028	That's pretty sad, because I don't even play the DS that much, and I've bought more than one game for it this year.
3197749	3200330	And I plan on buying a lot more coming soon.
3200430	3205153	But there just isn't any games out there that come out that are really great.
3205293	3205753	And it's just...
3206708	3208549	Why would I waste my money on this stuff?
3208889	3209790	And that's the other thing, too.
3209910	3211811	The games are more expensive than the DS.
3212291	3219354	So, great that, you know, it's a more powerful system, but it's just, I don't know, they're not making good software for it.
3220075	3224697	I actually have to, though, give mad props to DJ Janai, the Wonderswan.
3225868	3227749	The Swan Kicks All Your Portable Asses
3251542	3264206	The analogy I use a lot with the PSP when trying to explain to someone is it's like when you go to Thanksgiving dinner and you load up your plate with all sorts of stuff, like everything, way too much of anything, and then you sit down and you try to eat it and you just can't finish it.
3264406	3265306	And you get sick.
3265326	3266046	Well, that too.
3266346	3267827	But it's all just half done.
3268347	3272088	Whereas the DS, you got a bunch of turkey and you can finish all your turkey and it's really good.
3272808	3274248	And then you have a nice nap when you're done.
3274328	3275129	Yeah, then you fall asleep.
3276389	3276729	All right.
3279208	3282894	I'm sure we'll get some emails on that, so we look forward to reading those.
3283676	3287101	In the meantime, we're going to shift gears here a little bit on Orange Lounge Radio.
3287121	3291669	We're going to do something we have not done in a long time, at least six months.
3291749	3292470	But you know what, kids?
3292510	3293592	It's a slow news week.
3294273	3306937	and all things considered, it's a pretty slow news week and it's time for us here on Orange Lounge Radio to bring back an old segment that we used to do back in the day when we did like a three hour live show and a podcast and all that stuff.
3306997	3307357	Quite.
3307737	3308037	Alright.
3308537	3309697	So, are we ready?
3309717	3311318	Because I think, Loki, are you filming this?
3312685	3312925	Match Game
3333561	3335382	Video game match game to be specific.
3335442	3336362	Oh, we got a call already.
3337343	3338623	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3338663	3339083	Who's this?
3339824	3340844	This is Drew Nami.
3341244	3342665	Oh, Drew Nami, our old friend.
3342685	3344065	We can't escape you.
3344166	3344986	We can't escape you.
3345006	3345786	No, you cannot.
3346066	3347427	You're not in studio tonight.
3347447	3348167	You're still there.
3349008	3351169	I love GS68 in our chat room.
3351289	3352569	What did GS68 in our chat room say?
3352689	3353810	Nissan Skype line.
3354830	3356891	So, okay, no more calls on Skype, please.
3356911	3357611	We have our contestant.
3357631	3359052	You want to play some match game tonight, Drew Nami?
3359588	3359908	Hell yeah.
3360168	3360969	Alright, hell yeah.
3361389	3368393	Alright, and you're going to be playing against somebody from our chatroom, and the person you're going to be playing against in our chatroom tonight is DMN.
3369293	3376157	Alright, so DMN, we did a trivia contest in chat earlier, and DMN won, so it's you against DMN tonight.
3378078	3378738	Sound good, Magus?
3379319	3379659	Oh yeah.
3379839	3381840	Alright, you know how the match game works, right?
3383126	3385988	Alright, well let me explain it for those folks that don't know how Match Game works.
3386028	3390890	What's going to happen is that we're going to read some sentences and they kind of have something to do with video games, but not really.
3391810	3400354	And then our celebrities here in studio will fill in the blank and then you guys are going to try and guess what's in that blank.
3401414	3403875	And for every one that you guess, you get a point.
3404416	3406777	And the person with the most points will win a fabulous prize.
3407117	3411339	Tonight's prize is a space on our MySpace Top 8.
3413767	3415668	All right, so let's introduce tonight's celebrities.
3436744	3447677	Alright, celebrity number one is from Wisconsin and enjoys all types of different video games, especially those by Nintendo and is a lesbian.
3448498	3450440	Say hello to Megzi, celebrity number one.
3451000	3451581	Yay.
3451881	3452282	Hi Megzi.
3452602	3452862	Hi.
3453123	3457368	Alright, celebrity number two comes to us from the Bay Area.
3458431	3464594	and she's Megzi's girlfriend and does a lot of really nice sketch art that she's drawing right now.
3464614	3465035	I like this.
3465155	3466095	She does a lot of great art.
3466435	3467716	So say hello to Chris.
3468276	3468917	Hi, y'all.
3469197	3469497	All right.
3469917	3475380	Now, celebrity number three is over there in the corner taping, videotaping all this hot lesbian action going on.
3475780	3476821	And it's the one and only Loki.
3478423	3478904	Hi, Loki.
3479164	3479724	I'll be number three.
3479984	3484727	Celebrity number four is hiding behind the laptop from the camera.
3485048	3486569	Say hello to DarkSakura.
3486789	3487829	Get that thing out of my face.
3488370	3492492	And celebrity number five is me, Rob Roberts.
3492733	3494874	Hi, my adoring fans all there.
3494894	3495514	Hi, you're a celebrity.
3495534	3496675	Internet celebrity, yo.
3500182	3501924	Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.
3523075	3525297	It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house.
3525397	3530521	Nelly's screaming, Matt, put down the blank so we can have whoopee.
3532522	3535485	Okay, our celebrities are thinking of their answers.
3536726	3539528	Matt, put down the blank so we can have whoopee.
3542690	3543071	All right.
3543711	3545452	Our celebrities are thinking about their answers.
3550036	3550777	I'm waiting on our...
3552213	3554494	I'm waiting on our chat room person to send me an answer there.
3555314	3555875	We have our celebrity.
3555935	3556995	Are our celebrities a ding-ding?
3557175	3557415	Ding.
3558556	3558896	Okay.
3559016	3559236	Ding.
3559316	3559636	I'm ding.
3559676	3560357	Loki, you a ding?
3560777	3560957	All right.
3560977	3561597	Megs, he's a ding.
3562057	3562257	All right.
3562277	3565519	We're just waiting on our chat room, our chat person.
3566219	3568200	In chat room, I am not looking at your answers.
3568480	3570421	I'm doing this all by myself, okay?
3570461	3571581	Oh, you're not looking at chat room answers?
3571601	3572422	You're doing it all by yourself?
3572462	3573122	He's a big boy now.
3573142	3573382	All right.
3576670	3577992	Alright, there we go, we have an answer.
3578072	3581116	Okay, so Magus, what is your answer?
3581156	3582878	Let me read the question one more time.
3583318	3585781	Nelly hates the fact that Loki plays so many video games.
3586162	3591408	It's a nightly occurrence to hear at their house Nelly screaming, Matt, put down the blank so we can have whoopee.
3591709	3592530	Magus, what's your answer?
3593030	3595291	Matt, put down the Rez Transvibrator.
3595611	3599132	Rez Transvibrator, so we can have Whoopi.
3599212	3602313	Okay, and let's see what contestant number two in chat, DMN, said.
3602753	3606414	Said, Matt, put down the Wii, so we can have Whoopi.
3606875	3607455	The Wii.
3607555	3608755	All right, DarkSakura.
3608875	3610056	I said Transvibrator.
3610096	3613337	Transvibrator, 1.4 Magus.
3613537	3614437	That's crazy.
3614717	3620059	And yes, we're writing it down in studio, and she does have that written down on her little piece of paper.
3620499	3622561	I had that written down ten minutes ago.
3640382	3641682	Xbox 360 Control.
3641702	3642563	What a boring answer.
3643103	3643883	Shut up.
3644783	3650545	My answer was put down the Wii so we can make Whoopi.
3650705	3653646	So I matched with DMN so it's all tied up one to one.
3653826	3654286	Let's see.
3655086	3656106	Megzy, what did you put?
3656186	3657567	Put down the... Corn.
3658067	3658547	Corn?
3661448	3662168	The corn?
3662708	3663468	I don't want to know.
3663648	3666169	You're only going to get that if you've seen Sensitive Pornograph.
3666309	3666789	No, no, no.
3666869	3669330	It was in Book of the Sexual Harassment.
3670086	3670766	Nerds!
3671266	3672007	Nerds!
3673367	3673647	Alright.
3674867	3678388	Chris, Matt, put down the... Third hand.
3678768	3680149	Third hand.
3680229	3681129	Not a match.
3681209	3682069	I didn't know.
3682209	3683190	Alright, that's alright.
3684050	3685470	You're still hot, so we'll give it to you.
3685890	3690231	Alright, but it doesn't help out our chatroom DMN, or it doesn't help out Magus any.
3690271	3693432	It's still 1-1, though, which is a higher score than usual for a match game.
3693472	3693932	So here we go.
3694313	3695473	We're ready for question number two.
3695913	3696533	You ready, Magus?
3697093	3697373	Bring it.
3697714	3699414	Any choice words for DMN?
3700956	3701916	Oh, you're going down.
3702217	3703157	Alright, here it is.
3703757	3704498	Question number two.
3706158	3707199	Oops, no music yet.
3707799	3712981	DarkSakura is planning a road trip with her girlfriends very soon.
3714942	3723746	Luckily, they drive a magical car capable of playing any video game to entertain themselves on the trip there.
3724786	3730369	Realizing this, DarkSakura says, Oh, I better make sure to bring a copy of blank.
3746261	3750182	All right, our folks are thinking about their answers there.
3751082	3752003	We have our celebrities.
3752583	3754363	Hey, no cheating, no conferring over there.
3754803	3756824	No, we're not, but we all think the same thing anyway.
3756884	3758465	Which video game are they going to bring?
3758565	3760305	Okay, we have an answer from chat.
3760705	3761185	I'm ding.
3761585	3762926	Ding.
3763586	3764626	All right, we got everybody.
3766347	3766847	Magus.
3767659	3772561	We better make sure to bring a copy of... Kingdom Hearts for those Bishonen.
3773061	3774762	Kingdom Hearts for the Bishonen.
3775382	3776463	Interesting guess.
3776943	3781865	DMN says bring a copy of... LocoRoco!
3782125	3783005	LocoRoco is close.
3783045	3786587	If I had to be in the car with those girls, I'd be going LocoRoco as well.
3790128	3790689	I'm in hell.
3792149	3793070	Let's see if there's a match.
3793150	3793750	DarkSakura.
3794755	3795596	Animal Crossing!
3795896	3797157	Animal Crossing!
3797197	3799339	Of course, all these girls love their Animal Crossing.
3799399	3800080	Not a match, though.
3800140	3800480	Loki!
3803363	3805384	What are you guys laughing at?
3805565	3807026	I guess, I guess... What?
3807586	3810169	We'll tell you later.
3810349	3812791	What is the Animal Crossing a euphemism for now?
3812951	3813672	We'll tell you later.
3813832	3815153	Tom Nook something dirty.
3815253	3816114	Okay, look.
3816574	3817255	Tom Nookie.
3817595	3818216	Tom Nookie.
3818476	3819217	Alright, look, what...
3820114	3821215	What's your answer, Loki?
3821295	3824778	Well, my answer... I'm one question too late.
3824838	3828242	I said the Rez with the Rez Trans Vibrator.
3829082	3830223	Where were you, Loki?
3830304	3831625	Where were you when I needed you?
3831985	3833466	Not a match, not a match.
3834187	3835689	My answer is, of course...
3836611	3837731	Girls are going to get together.
3837771	3842033	They're going to play Dead or Alive Extreme Beach Volleyball.
3842373	3843253	Not a match, though.
3843333	3843653	Not a match.
3843673	3845414	Good answer from myself, but not a match.
3845474	3845934	Sad to say.
3846494	3847434	Megzi, what did you say?
3848055	3848835	Animal Crossing.
3849075	3850015	Animal Crossing.
3850255	3850635	Chris?
3850836	3851516	Animal Crossing.
3851636	3852396	Oh, wow.
3853857	3858598	That was a... It's a massive... There are too many giggling girls on tonight's program.
3859478	3860158	Way too many.
3860199	3860759	I'm not in on it.
3860779	3864520	I remember those emails we got back in the day about the giggling co-hosts.
3865459	3866900	Oh, this is revenge.
3868541	3869221	Alright, here it is.
3869301	3870662	Question number three, boys and girls.
3870702	3871602	You ready for question number three?
3871622	3872723	It's still tied up, one to one.
3873203	3874384	Alright, here it is.
3874784	3876585	Question numero tres.
3877445	3880807	Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.
3881947	3887050	Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.
3890052	3891092	I have my answer.
3891372	3891792	Dang it.
3896482	3898323	Rob gets very scared when playing Silent Hill.
3898343	3902004	Because of this, he has to remember when playing scary games to bring some blank.
3929036	3929516	Still waiting.
3929997	3930557	Okay, there we go.
3930597	3931218	We have an answer.
3931998	3935361	Alright, so let's go over to Magus.
3936442	3938063	Rob gets scared when playing games.
3938583	3942746	He has to remember when playing scary games to bring some... Clean underwear.
3942966	3944468	Clean underwear.
3945929	3946829	Clean underwear.
3946909	3952093	Okay, and DMN says... Has to remember to bring some... Depends.
3952113	3952314	Depends.
3953274	3953875	Depends.
3954724	3955765	Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.
3956605	3957606	Oops, I cracked my pants.
3957626	3959988	Yeah, oops, I cracked my pants.
3960028	3961769	All right, let's see if we get a match.
3961809	3963370	We have clean underwear and Depends.
3963410	3964311	Those are different things.
3964551	3967373	They are distinctly different because you don't poop in clean underwear, okay?
3967413	3968734	But you can poop in Depends all you want.
3969015	3970636	I said Depends adult diapers.
3971136	3971697	You did?
3971777	3972257	Yes, I did.
3972337	3974379	All right, that's a point for DMN.
3974399	3975720	I specifically said Depends.
3976000	3976940	All right, point for DMN.
3976961	3977961	I said, oops, I cracked my pants.
3978061	3978562	All right, here we go.
3978642	3979302	Loki, what'd you say?
3980363	3981384	I actually said...
3983707	3986451	Basically, a baby bottle and a blanket.
3986491	3990276	Because only babies would be scared of Silent Hill yet, jackass.
3992742	3993002	Ouch.
3993763	3994083	Burn.
3994223	3994944	Ouch, ouch.
3994964	3995944	You guys are very cruel.
3996004	3996324	All right.
3996665	3997565	Well, that's not a match.
3998166	4004090	My answer was Rob better bring some Guinness because if I'm drinking, it's okay.
4004110	4004990	Guinness.
4005310	4006171	It calms me down.
4006251	4007332	Guinness goes well with everything.
4007352	4010554	Meg Z, we're looking for Depends or Clean Underwear.
4010574	4011014	What did you say?
4011214	4012335	Pyramid Head Plushies.
4012555	4013796	Pyramid Head Plushies.
4013816	4014356	That's cute.
4014436	4015297	I want one.
4015397	4015657	I know.
4015837	4016358	Me too.
4016378	4017218	Somebody should make one.
4017438	4017999	That's cute.
4018439	4019360	I like the way you think, Megzi.
4019600	4021462	Chris, do we have another match?
4021482	4021983	What did you say?
4022183	4024025	Bring some... I said a blanket.
4024546	4025507	A blanket.
4025647	4028130	I get really, really scared by those things.
4028190	4033876	I'm a big pussy, too.
4034717	4038361	I don't know if I want the lesbian on the show to be talking about what a big...
4041736	4047820	Let's go back to the scoreboard where DMN has two points and 23rd Magus has one point.
4047920	4050061	So Magus, you're lagging behind.
4050081	4051401	You've got two more questions to catch up.
4051421	4051742	You ready?
4052922	4053142	Sure.
4053482	4054203	Alright, here we go.
4054283	4055704	Here comes question number four.
4055824	4056444	Question number four.
4058123	4062526	And I apologize for this after the earlier rant, but these match game questions were written in advance.
4063006	4067569	Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently, yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.
4068250	4076736	What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled, he said about Adam Sessler, Man, does that guy need blank!
4081299	4085662	Jack Thompson said about Adam Sessler after that interview, Man, that guy needs blank!
4086840	4087940	Ooh, Chris already ding.
4094042	4095783	I'm ding as well if I didn't already say.
4098624	4098864	Okay.
4099624	4100004	You got it?
4100445	4100685	Yep.
4100865	4104226	Alright, we're just waiting on DMN there in chat.
4104526	4105406	Magus, do you have an answer?
4105426	4106006	Are you ready to go?
4107327	4108127	More cowbell.
4108487	4109248	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
4109308	4110088	Don't give your answer yet.
4110208	4110448	Sorry.
4111328	4111828	Eh, it's not my answer.
4111848	4112689	I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
4113029	4114189	Alright, I'll get another one.
4115310	4116390	I'll pull another one on my ass.
4117850	4119071	I don't need to know about your ass.
4120071	4120492	Sure you do.
4121492	4122393	Alright, okay, here it is.
4123053	4123413	Here it is.
4124114	4124874	We got our answer.
4126615	4126915	Alright.
4128076	4131498	Jack Thompson was on Attack of the Show recently yelling back and forth with Adam Sessler.
4131518	4138962	What you didn't see, though, was after the interview, Jack's feathers were so ruffled, he said about Adam Sessler, man, does that guy need what, Magus?
4140423	4140843	Yowie.
4141343	4141944	Yowie!
4143206	4146108	Wow, Chris and Maisie gasped at that answer.
4147348	4149850	That might be a bad sign, though, because that usually means they didn't think of it.
4150470	4156154	DMN says, that guy needs to get laid, says DMN.
4156174	4157774	Let's see if there's any matches here in studio.
4158055	4159255	DarkSakura, what was your answer?
4159916	4160816	A good ass hammering.
4161096	4162257	A good ass hammering.
4162917	4164438	Is that a match with to get laid?
4164458	4166800	Yeah, it's a match with to get laid.
4166820	4167000	Both.
4167981	4174363	But we think it's... No, actually, honestly, it's a half point on the Yowie side because he would be the recipient instead of watching it.
4174423	4175764	Let's give a half point to each.
4176404	4177444	We'll give a half point to each.
4177484	4178084	How's that sound?
4178364	4180505	Why don't you just not give a point to either one?
4180525	4181145	Yeah, let's do that.
4181305	4182846	Rob, that is actually getting laid.
4185049	4188513	That is technically getting laid.
4188834	4190115	We'll have to give it to DMN.
4190175	4191637	Sorry, Magus, but we'll give you a half point.
4191697	4193399	Unless they've got a mirror up or something.
4193419	4194680	But I didn't specify.
4194841	4196122	That's the ruling of the judges.
4196182	4196583	So be it.
4196683	4198004	Loki.
4198885	4201208	He needs to get shot in the face because...
4202688	4204329	Wow, shot in the face.
4204389	4205269	Don't hold back, Loki.
4205309	4210531	Well, that's because, you know, Jack Thompson says all gamers need... Oh, okay, okay, good.
4210571	4211592	That'd be irony right there.
4211612	4212372	Good justification.
4212732	4214873	All right, not a match, though.
4215293	4220756	My answer was, man, does Adam Sessler need personality, was my answer.
4220936	4221696	Personality.
4222916	4224157	Unfortunately, not a match.
4227697	4229619	Hey, enough Pyramid Head plushie talk, please.
4230079	4234242	Meg Z, Adam Sessler, man, does he need... To sit on a tack.
4234402	4235663	To sit on a tack.
4236644	4237945	Would that count with getting laid?
4237985	4238646	I don't know.
4238926	4240007	I don't think it does at this point.
4240027	4242709	Would that count as yowie?
4243209	4245531	Maybe it would count if it was sex with Kevin Pereira.
4245771	4246432	Ba-dum-bum.
4246952	4247333	All right.
4248554	4249514	I'm sorry, Kevin.
4249554	4250095	I didn't mean it.
4251109	4251809	You're still cute.
4251869	4253470	Alright, Chris.
4253830	4258931	I actually said butt sex, which is... Butt sex would count to get laid.
4258951	4260171	Come on, come on.
4260211	4261231	That would be yaoi.
4261251	4261912	Yes, yes.
4262092	4263872	I was thinking of yaoi.
4263992	4264872	Okay, okay.
4265012	4266833	So we'll give 23rd Magus another half point.
4267393	4268813	So Magus has two points.
4268833	4269813	It doesn't involve a paddle, does it?
4270093	4272214	Magus has two points and DMN has four.
4273564	4275205	DMN is on it tonight.
4275325	4276485	DMN is on it tonight.
4276945	4279926	Surprise butt sex coming from DJ tonight.
4279986	4281987	You have one more chance, Magus.
4282007	4282367	You ready?
4283247	4283587	Bring it.
4283607	4284788	Here it is, the last question.
4286988	4290829	Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?
4291850	4297011	When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, Oh, that last compartment.
4297391	4298912	That's where you can store the blank.
4309926	4310947	Celebrities are thinking.
4311588	4311988	Ding.
4312589	4312869	Ooh.
4313830	4321297	Jinx.
4321337	4322218	Loki, was that a ding?
4322698	4322979	Ding.
4323179	4323880	All right, you dinged.
4324680	4326822	And I'm just waiting on our chatroom player there.
4330066	4331727	Magus, don't give us your answer, but do you have one?
4332388	4332488	Yep.
4332528	4334470	You're going to get two points with it because that's what you need.
4335658	4336438	I don't know, can I?
4337599	4340800	Well, don't get smart with me, asshole, or you're going to lose this game.
4341300	4342981	Hey, someone has to be smarter around here.
4343281	4344521	Oh, but I'm bummed.
4344601	4345542	Funny, funny guy.
4347422	4349223	I'd rather be smart in my little head than in my ass.
4349243	4350904	We have a... Alright.
4352324	4354125	Ah, that's... Okay, here we go.
4354565	4355025	Here it is.
4355465	4356206	Fifth question.
4357666	4360007	Did you hear about yet another new flap on the Wii?
4360327	4364769	When asked for comment, our dear pal Reggie told us, oh, that last compartment, that's where you can store the...
4365865	4368346	DarkSakura, what did you say?
4368426	4368746	Lube
4389181	4390702	You need some lube for your Wii, apparently.
4390722	4392523	Maybe with a special cock attachment.
4393303	4396005	I don't know what you got planned for your Wii, DarkSakura.
4396285	4397466	Okay, Loki.
4398566	4400728	Where would a match game be without this answer?
4401468	4404410	That last compartment is the store of the Iraqi suicide babies.
4406883	4408524	I was in on that joke when it started
4425441	4426041	Here we go.
4426821	4431003	My answer was, that's where you can store the weed.
4431343	4432783	You put your weed in there.
4433284	4434364	Oh, the SNL.
4434564	4435865	You put your weed in there.
4435885	4436005	Get it?
4436025	4437685	That actually was my first answer, and I changed it.
4438065	4439466	Wait, wait, get it?
4439546	4439806	Weed.
4439906	4441286	Ha, ha, ha.
4441406	4441887	Fired.
4442547	4442927	Magazine.
4443487	4444387	Lesbian porn.
4444467	4445608	Lesbian porn.
4445648	4446028	Not a match.
4446608	4446868	Chris.
4448029	4448409	Drugs.
4448749	4449449	Drugs.
4450569	4454931	Unfortunately, no points scored there, so let's look at the scoreboard and tally it up.
4456633	4463576	Magus, you have two points, which is very good for Orange Lounge Radio Match Game to even get on the damn scoreboard.
4463596	4465017	So you should be very proud of your effort.
4465037	4470760	But unfortunately, DMN kicked your butt by scoring four points.
4470800	4471820	He broke the record.
4471840	4472661	Yeah, he broke the record.
4472761	4474022	The record was two and a half.
4474442	4474762	All right.
4475062	4476723	Congratulations, DMN.
4476763	4479404	You're a winner and you get a space in our top eight on MySpace.
4479424	4482306	We're going to bump Freeze Pop for you because they have like 11 billion friends.
4482326	4482946	They don't need any more.
4484087	4489610	Magus, you get a clump of dirt as a runner-up prize, and we'll give that to you at the next show, okay?
4489790	4490850	We'll dust it in your backyard.
4492591	4493052	Oh, fine.
4493092	4494472	No special gifts for you guys.
4494732	4495093	All right.
4495613	4497814	Magus, anything you want to say while we have you on the line?
4499175	4500536	Oh, it's on, DMN.
4500896	4502617	Another time, another place, it's on.
4502737	4504018	Did you have fun on tonight's program?
4504578	4506079	Oh, yeah, even though I did get served.
4506219	4507499	You did get served, I'm sorry to say.
4507579	4509641	Well, have fun and enjoy the dirt.
4510601	4511822	Yes, dirt is good.
4512461	4512762	All right.
4512842	4515246	I hear it's a growing investment.
4515266	4515887	It's gay dirt.
4516248	4516648	Gay dirt.
4516668	4518812	Yeah, it's gay dirt because we all touched it.
4518892	4519253	All right.
4519293	4519593	Bye.
4520555	4520835	All right.
4520855	4525143	And he gets a good old-fashioned orange lounge hanging up on at the end there for playing there.
4525904	4526365	All right.
4527083	4528945	DMN is going to earn a space in our top eight.
4529325	4530066	What did you guys think?
4530346	4536471	Okay, I'm curious because we haven't done the game in a long time and our podcast audience hasn't really gotten to see the game, so I'm curious.
4536771	4538373	What did you guys think of the game?
4538693	4539374	Was that fun?
4539554	4540294	Was it stupid?
4540354	4541115	Was it a waste of your time?
4541435	4543477	Give us feedback in chat and in mailbag.
4543517	4544958	That's old school OLR for you.
4544998	4546440	It was a fun, stupid waste of time.
4546460	4546540	Yeah.
4547130	4553976	but anyway, we do still have a little more gaming news before we finish up the show and of course we're going to open up the skype line very soon for your general calls Loki!
4554636	4560481	yes, speaking of games anyways, we've got to talk about Sony again why?
4560521	4576254	because we have to and we've got to talk about the PSP and we've got to talk about firmware updates because with PSP's firmware 2.8 there are some more problems not only is it Sony's latest attempt to stop homebrew
4576974	4577815	On the PSP.
4578676	4579256	But guess what?
4579436	4581658	You may not be able to browse certain websites.
4582499	4598412	Because now, the brand new web browser not only allows a developer to use the site to obtain specific information on how you got to their website, more importantly, they can check what firmware you have and deny you access based on that.
4599653	4602816	I have a suggestion for the homebrew websites then.
4603336	4605318	Put a keyword on your site that says porcupine.
4605959	4610242	Whenever anyone puts in Porcupine, it brings up Homebrew Games.
4611483	4614926	And all the information on Porcupine she ever wanted to know.
4616007	4618789	Put in Porcupine in video game, and there you go.
4621010	4624573	So, but, I mean, I assume that this is only for, like...
4625620	4628141	You know, manufacturer websites or something like that.
4628241	4632563	You know, stuff that's pertaining to games, you know, official sites and that kind of thing.
4632983	4636145	Probably not going to be if you're running, you know, Flash games or something like that.
4636525	4637865	Probably not going to run into a problem with this.
4638306	4640406	But still, I mean, come on.
4640787	4643628	I mean, what more do they really need to do to block stuff?
4643968	4645389	I mean, the web browser sucks as it is.
4645849	4650051	And do we really need, you know, to deny people more browsing on there?
4650251	4650591	I don't know.
4652174	4656797	More than likely, anyways, we wouldn't be able to pull up the page you're trying to block anyway, so whatever.
4658818	4659238	All right.
4659878	4661879	Well, I have one more story there.
4662520	4664881	Are you going to upgrade, Loki, or screw it?
4664961	4666522	I've got two, so yeah, I can.
4666822	4667102	Okay.
4668243	4675086	All right, we've got one more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line for general feedback, so you can start hammering away there.
4675166	4678088	The username is OrangeLoungeRadio, or you can always call us on the landline,
4678422	4682425	916-226-9067 But please keep in mind, that's a toll call.
4682465	4683446	It's not an 800 call.
4683466	4691292	So if you're not paying the bill, Mom is going to get very angry with you, says Meg Z. Like last night.
4693594	4695135	Sorry.
4696196	4699959	I want to do a story real quick here on Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
4700059	4701540	There are some new details.
4701580	4705984	And of course, our in-house lesbians would love to hear some more details on Dead or Alive Extreme 2, right?
4706864	4707085	Oh, yes.
4709803	4717789	It sounds like it will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show, and Japan's Famitsu Magazine got a quick look at the game, and of course, you know, the trailer's online.
4718550	4721352	Excluding Beach Volleyball, the game engine is mostly complete.
4721652	4731159	For Beach Volleyball, we had the previous title, so we left it until the end, but since we're at last finishing up the other areas, we're at the point where it's about time we start making the new Beach Volleyball, and that comes from...
4732020	4732901	Itagaki Itagaki
4747623	4749685	JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis, JetSkis
4777450	4783153	See, now, you're also talking to two lesbians who happen to be in graphic arts and are taking art classes.
4783473	4784713	Artsy lesbians.
4785874	4791236	Just the colors and the skin tones, that's pretty... Yeah, I got a bone.
4791736	4792117	Wow.
4794217	4798439	All right, let's go to the Skype line and see what they have to say.
4798539	4802241	So we love interacting with our listeners, and we're going to take some phone calls right now.
4802321	4803582	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4803622	4804042	Who's this?
4804922	4805723	Hello, can you hear me?
4805963	4806643	Yes, who is this?
4807720	4808701	This is Nintendo Maniac 64.
4809141	4809961	Haven't called in a while.
4810081	4811402	Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.
4811442	4812142	What's on your mind, buddy?
4812942	4814083	A couple things.
4814803	4818465	First off, Megzie seems to actually have a lot of similar interests to me.
4818485	4822006	She likes Nintendo games, and her opinion on Sony is pretty much the same as mine.
4822206	4823127	Sony, die.
4823947	4825768	So a Nintendo Maniac agrees with you.
4825848	4827569	It loves the Nintendo, and Sony can go die.
4827789	4828989	Yeah, Sony can suck my dick.
4829129	4832491	Are you just trying to get points with the lesbians?
4837070	4837950	What else is on your mind, buddy?
4841794	4843295	One thing I've been dying to ask you this.
4844315	4845316	Please don't hang up on me.
4846297	4848959	Hey, guy, what do you think about straight sex?
4851601	4856585	Try a joke that's not like 30 years old on this program.
4856965	4858767	I'm not gonna hang up on you, but seriously.
4859207	4860348	We have plenty of new jokes.
4860568	4861949	Go to tonight's match game.
4861969	4862670	There's a lot there.
4863851	4870755	For those that have no idea what we're talking about, you've got to go back to, like, an old To Go episode back when we were doing the podcast separately.
4871075	4872196	When Guitar Hero first came out.
4872496	4873797	Firebomba says, fail, get.
4874937	4878820	Chat room is booing you, so you better say something thoughtful right now to make up.
4879520	4882382	Thoughtful, thoughtful.
4882402	4886744	Who needs TV when you have YouTube?
4886804	4887024	Indeed.
4887104	4890486	Are there any gaming-related clips on YouTube that you want to point out?
4890506	4891227	No, I just thought of that.
4892717	4893017	All right.
4893938	4896459	I'm going to let you go, Nintendo Maniac 64, but thanks for the call.
4897059	4897340	Okay.
4897680	4898020	All right.
4898360	4899021	Good job failing.
4901062	4901862	Boom, failed.
4905324	4909606	He's a nice kid, but seriously, leave the inside jokes.
4909687	4911007	Hello, it's Raven's Dolphin.
4911027	4912048	Well, hi, Raven's Dolphin.
4912068	4913989	I hadn't even said hello yet, but hi, how you doing?
4914369	4915070	What's on your mind?
4915450	4915570	I'm...
4916556	4917456	More lesbians.
4919737	4920078	You know what?
4920098	4923039	The lesbian gamers can have their own podcast as far as I'm concerned.
4923059	4924680	This reminds me of an episode of Raw.
4924900	4931583	I'm sorry to bring up wrestling, but it just reminds me of hot lesbian action, just kissing and all kinds of craziness.
4931623	4934204	Look, I want this on the record.
4934264	4944789	We're making the lesbian thing kind of a joke tonight because if we did really have a hot lesbian podcast, people would be like, oh my god, I've got a boner, da-da-da-da.
4945134	4945494	Make out!
4945554	4945954	Make out!
4975134	4977435	All right, seriously, do you have anything gaming related you want to share?
4978595	4982236	Yeah, they were talking about the PSP being like a big paperweight.
4982616	4983216	Ah, what do you think?
4984256	4984896	I think different.
4985316	4986337	I love my PSP.
4986697	4987737	Why do you love your PSP?
4988837	4994919	Well, I don't own an iPod, and the Apple Store didn't open up yet, so I'm still stuck with it for a while.
4995579	4996979	Yeah, like Chris is all, where do you live?
4998200	4999140	I live in New Jersey.
4999160	5001020	They just don't understand.
5002261	5003841	There's no Apple Store in New Jersey?
5004574	5012677	There is, but it's like two hours away, and they're opening one on the boardwalk where I live, so it's like heaven, finally.
5013197	5013557	Oh, okay.
5014478	5020160	So, but you're not using, it sounds like you don't really use your PSP as a gaming device, you use it as an MP3 player, primarily.
5020500	5022181	Yeah, I use it for everything, mostly.
5022581	5024962	Hmm, interesting, okay.
5025002	5028843	I'd like to kind of try to redeem myself about my comments about Sony.
5028863	5033205	Don't get me wrong, I hate them, but the PSP, it's
5034263	5050531	it's a good system if you're looking for it to do all that stuff but you're straight up games if I'm going to drop $250 on a gaming system I want it to play games are you going to buy Star Fox Command for the DS?
5051952	5053953	maybe are you a Star Fox fan?
5055182	5055782	Not so much.
5056562	5056943	I'm sorry.
5058564	5060425	I can't wait to get my hands on that thing.
5060765	5061205	I love it.
5061305	5063727	So you have a little love for DS and PSP then?
5064447	5064808	I do.
5064948	5068310	I own two DSs and I own two PSPs.
5068670	5069871	Now you're just a hardcore nerd.
5071525	5072605	I like you.
5072685	5073186	I like you.
5073526	5074026	I like you.
5074526	5074966	I like you.
5075006	5075446	I like you.
5075966	5076787	I like you.
5076807	5077227	I like you.
5077247	5077727	I like you.
5077747	5078107	I like you.
5078127	5078467	I like you.
5078507	5078827	I like you.
5099906	5102647	Yeah, TV's dead and YouTube is for porn.
5103567	5105768	YouTube is for great stuff.
5106428	5107828	Have a good night, Raven's Dolphin.
5107848	5108248	Thank you.
5108328	5109128	You too, bye.
5109569	5113670	Blaze is coming up with a witty retort there about me bashing on nerds.
5113970	5117811	Blaze, Sky, again, you are hosting a podcast about gaming.
5118651	5119571	Good point, good point.
5120031	5121772	I am pretty hardcore to my nerdom.
5122032	5123032	Orange Zones Radio, who's this?
5123732	5125032	This is Black Boy, James.
5125913	5126733	Hi, Black Boy, James.
5126773	5127313	What's on your mind?
5128486	5130769	I had a question about the PSP.
5131409	5132370	Okay, what do you want to know?
5132390	5141940	Because with their firmware updates, they include something else, like something to enhance the functionality of the PSP, and I was just curious, was there anything like that with this update?
5142580	5144542	Loki, you're my man for the PSP updates.
5144582	5145063	What do you think?
5145824	5148606	Well, 2.8 was video podcast, RSS.
5148827	5149928	Oh, this is that one.
5151263	5155784	So you can watch the one-up show on your PSP, yippity-yay, hooray.
5157025	5162246	Or you can watch Hope is Emo, which is a great vodcast.
5162486	5165047	Upgrade your PSP so you can watch Hope is Emo.
5165067	5167847	Okay, maybe I'll do that.
5168548	5171648	Or maybe me and Gregor will go find a pizza box to live in.
5173689	5176450	Alright, so does that sound worth it to you, Black Boy?
5177170	5177570	Not really.
5178828	5179508	I didn't think so.
5179588	5182450	Just use iTunes for your vodcasting needs.
5182510	5183190	Yes, seriously.
5183590	5185632	I use my iPod for my podcasts.
5186072	5188994	Oh, you're fancy enough to own a color video iPod.
5189394	5190815	I'm too broke, unfortunately.
5190835	5191935	I have the old school one.
5191976	5193296	Yeah, I have an old school iPod.
5193356	5196718	It was my Christmas gift to myself.
5196919	5197799	I have Kristen's.
5197819	5198980	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
5199520	5200141	I do actually.
5200801	5208248	I wanted to say to your guests tonight that they get major love and win for being lesbians and not frightening me.
5209409	5212072	You don't mind me saying you're a gay gamer, correct?
5212272	5212712	I am.
5212772	5216936	I know that because you're on All Games Interactive all the time and they pick on you so horribly for that.
5217477	5218197	So sorry.
5218578	5222101	Every time I listen to frickin' Ron, I cringe.
5222461	5222701	Anyway...
5223482	5226363	No, I love Ran, but seriously, he needs to stop the gay jokes.
5226644	5227384	I know, we all do.
5228544	5231566	I can't wait to come back to Arena and have more Ran love.
5232666	5233227	Not like that!
5233347	5233807	Not like that!
5235891	5237692	I'd pay money for that.
5237792	5240112	Are you loving our friend Black Boy here?
5240272	5240632	I do.
5241653	5246314	Keep in mind, most of the extreme lesbian jokes that we've been doing have been just that.
5246534	5247134	Just jokes.
5248054	5249815	We're fully clothed.
5250275	5251355	I know that's disappointing.
5252196	5252956	But we are cuddling.
5253396	5253956	But I like you.
5253976	5256777	Thank you.
5256817	5258257	I like you too.
5261863	5262283	Thank you.
5262303	5262923	Thank you.
5263123	5263383	Thank you.
5288686	5290788	Alright, let's go to one more call here on the Skype line.
5291169	5292330	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5292350	5292730	Who's this?
5293531	5294993	Good evening, this is DMN.
5295193	5298076	DMN, congratulations on your match game win earlier this evening.
5298797	5301660	Yeah, apparently 23rd Magus wants my neck now.
5302220	5303161	Well, he'll get over it.
5303221	5304743	What do you want to say tonight?
5306255	5309098	I am bitching about World of Warcraft.
5309498	5310038	Why?
5310058	5311800	You're not a big fan of this new news?
5313081	5330295	Well, I've never been a fan of World of Warcraft, mainly more so because I've got a roommate who's very hardcore into it, and I don't understand why it takes them almost two years to release an update to the damn game when, you know, pretty much everybody and their mom's at the highest level.
5331055	5333838	World of Warcraft, though, it patches all the frickin' time.
5334761	5336982	Yeah, but there's a difference between a patch and an expansion.
5337062	5340524	I mean, patches just adjust certain things and piss certain people off.
5340924	5343386	You have an expansion, it's a whole new way of opening things up.
5343466	5345387	If you just do a patch, it's the same map.
5346087	5346887	There's nothing new.
5347127	5349949	But they're not changing anything with this, DMN.
5350189	5353791	I mean, they're adding new stuff that's going to have a slightly different spin to it.
5355162	5358584	True, but I don't see anything about it.
5358624	5361265	They're saying, oh, you can go up to level, what, 70 now?
5361325	5363046	I'm like, I don't care.
5363166	5363986	It's 10 more levels.
5364266	5369869	Drew Nami in our chatroom, your good pal after tonight's match game battle, says, WoW doesn't end at 60.
5370409	5371810	Patches add content.
5372110	5373971	Okay.
5374311	5376672	Well, like I said, I don't play it, so I don't know.
5377012	5378253	I just know the basics.
5378313	5379594	I know 60's the highest.
5379974	5380574	Blah, blah, blah.
5380614	5381835	Is there any MMO you do enjoy?
5383837	5385858	Gunbound, but that's not really an MMO anymore.
5388959	5390779	But no, I'm not a huge fan of MMOs.
5390919	5397541	I'm intrigued by the, I guess, the society within them, but not a fan of playing them, no.
5398882	5400622	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
5402803	5407144	I was born in Wisconsin, so to hear somebody else from Wisconsin on the show tonight was pretty freaking awesome.
5407384	5408364	Yay, Wisconsin!
5408464	5409445	Only not so much.
5411035	5411995	Bring me some cheese next time.
5412015	5412536	Yeah, I will.
5414257	5415617	DM out.
5415637	5418378	I brought Chris and Jamie cheese.
5418479	5424742	I'm offering to give you something from the Nintendo store because I work there and stuff.
5426102	5427183	Jamie's supposed to give me that info.
5427703	5433906	That's when I told you earlier that we need your address to... Look at all the straight boys trying to get points of the lesbians tonight.
5435146	5437228	I'm not trying to hit points.
5437288	5438048	I'm just being a nice guy.
5438189	5438489	I know.
5438509	5439630	You are a nice guy, DMN.
5439650	5441451	We appreciate you calling in as always, okay?
5442072	5442392	All right.
5442432	5443012	Take care, guys.
5443032	5443613	Have a good one, buddy.
5443773	5443933	Bye.
5444233	5444394	Bye.
5444414	5445034	Bye-bye.
5446215	5448297	Wow, thank you guys so much for the calls tonight on Skype.
5448317	5449998	That was fun, and that's what it's all about.
5450058	5453381	So even though a few guys listening on the Internet are about to write us, they hate me.
5454028	5459431	You guys don't talk about video games enough, and you let your callers call in and talk about lesbians and yaoi.
5459451	5461632	What is wrong with you people at Orange Lands Radio?
5461672	5462212	I hate you.
5462553	5463753	I hate you, Sky.
5463813	5464854	I hate you, Rob Roberts.
5464894	5465994	I hope you die in a fire.
5467515	5468236	Well, you know what?
5468356	5470557	You can get in line behind G4.
5473518	5474139	I love you, Rob.
5474619	5475039	Thank you.
5475539	5478361	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
5478461	5478861	What?
5479362	5480082	I'm going to cut you.
5481547	5481907	Promise?
5482668	5483168	Oh, baby.
5483388	5485449	With that pyramid head plushie of love.
5485869	5488150	All right, eight last minute stories tonight.
5488570	5488830	Loki.
5490111	5491172	And then DarkSakura, you have one too?
5492772	5492952	No.
5493153	5493913	Okay, well, Loki then.
5494798	5495278	Okie dokie!
5516907	5517828	Thank you for watching.
5517848	5518228	See you next time.
5534915	5535795	It is coming soon.
5536756	5541938	Other news, of course, Atari has finally picked up Bullet Witch to distribute it in the US.
5542338	5544038	So that's always good, because that game looked awesome.
5544579	5555423	And then, of course, Shiny has announced that they're doing a free MMO called Two Moons, which is supposed to be the most violent MMO to date, which is going to be awesome.
5555843	5560545	And then, finally, the best part about this, you're going to love this, is...
5561445	5570568	According to Game Daily Biz, production company Project 51 has snatched up the rights to do an anime version of Castlevania.
5573529	5574209	My god!
5574829	5576910	I think three sets of panties just got wet.
5578390	5579570	That boner just came back.
5580711	5581311	Gross!
5585432	5586252	I mean, I don't know.
5586313	5587573	Did that get picked up by the mics?
5587633	5588793	Could you folks hear that at home?
5588893	5591134	That just collective gasp of
5591860	5593441	We also got one from Sauce.
5601238	5603739	Also, real quickly, I just want to cover this too.
5604880	5608602	There is a... This was actually reported on Kotaku.
5608822	5615245	There is a guy, a fanboy here, who's doing a short film adaptation of Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
5615545	5615925	Yes!
5616225	5618146	That person just wins the internet.
5618266	5620668	You win your own slice of the internet just for you.
5622248	5623769	And the adoration of lesbians everywhere.
5623809	5624970	So that's pretty awesome.
5625850	5627051	It's basically part of this...
5629308	5634551	Project TV Short Film Contest Project TV Short Film Contest Project TV Short Film Contest
5657972	5660873	I haven't heard a gamergasm like that since Snake being in Smash Bros.
5688050	5689393	A gamer chasm, I love it.
5690376	5691779	Snakes on the game?
5692140	5692400	Shit.
5692501	5693543	Oh my god.
5696235	5700277	Orange Lounge needs its own Wikipedia for these terms that we're coining tonight.
5700677	5701317	Alright, anyway.
5701898	5702358	Sorry, Loki.
5702398	5707140	The last one I had, I actually saw this last week, and I'm trying to find the exact link I had.
5707961	5714003	Basically, what it was is they were also doing a live-action version, this was also fan-done, of Devil May Cry.
5714244	5716164	And it's being done by some Japanese guy, so.
5717145	5717665	That's kind of neat.
5718606	5718926	Alright.
5719486	5721507	Lots of fan service out there, so.
5724213	5727794	Wow, well, tonight has certainly been a... Oh, I'm sorry, Megzi!
5727894	5728454	Megzi, yes!
5729314	5731094	Reporter-in-training for Orange Lawn Radio.
5731274	5731515	What's up?
5731735	5742317	This isn't really news, but a couple weeks ago, DarkSakura gave a shout-out to one of my good friends who was in a car accident.
5742997	5743797	I remember this, yes.
5744917	5749678	And I just wanted to give an update, is that she's perfectly fine, and she actually went home yesterday.
5750216	5750657	Yay!
5750977	5751558	Very cool.
5751778	5751938	Yep.
5752078	5754020	So Larissa is back home.
5754481	5754841	Alright.
5754861	5755622	And doing just fine.
5756083	5757124	She made a full recovery.
5757284	5760248	No, nothing psychological or weird or anything.
5760968	5761449	Great.
5761689	5763692	Let's give a big shout out to the twins right now, though.
5763772	5765734	The twins, Larissa and Corinne.
5766243	5766744	DarkSakura.com
5786209	5790691	Our chat room wants us to mention the Grand Theft Auto Coca-Cola ad.
5790711	5793212	If you haven't seen this on YouTube, it's kind of interesting.
5793512	5795352	We were watching this just before the show tonight.
5795392	5797213	There's this CGI ad.
5797853	5801555	It's like a Coke ad with the Grand Theft Auto characters.
5801615	5802375	It's kind of interesting.
5802415	5805196	Check it out on YouTube if you want to.
5806234	5810118	I was going to mention something about that Devil May Cry short film that's being done.
5810398	5813460	Actually, the director has a MySpace page if you want to check it out.
5813941	5816823	MySpace.com slash Shadow Motion Pictures.
5817724	5818264	So check it out.
5819005	5819285	Alright.
5820276	5822416	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's program.
5822456	5825277	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5826097	5828958	Megzi, thank you so much for being here all the way from Wisconsin tonight.
5829098	5834078	And, you know, all joking aside about the lesbian, you're a very cool gamer gal, gamer in general.
5834478	5836219	And have fun with the Wii when it comes out.
5836259	5836579	Yes, I will.
5836679	5838459	And let us know how dirgeous service is.
5838599	5838939	Oh, I will.
5838979	5840239	All right, final thought.
5840419	5842500	Any last message you want to give to our listeners?
5843700	5848981	Ken Kutaragi needs a helmet and some oven mitts and needs to ride the small bus.
5851343	5851923	Very well put.
5852003	5852304	All right.
5853165	5853445	Is that it?
5854967	5855948	GameStop for the win.
5856228	5856569	All right.
5856889	5862556	Chris, likewise, thank you so much for being here and representing the gamer girls very well.
5862616	5863217	Appreciate it.
5863557	5864118	Your final thought.
5866843	5868764	Orange Lounge Radio is full of awesome and win.
5869265	5870345	Awesome sauce.
5870365	5871065	Thank you.
5871886	5873447	All your listeners are actually really, really cool.
5874087	5875188	We do have some great listeners.
5875208	5879470	They were very, very patient with all of our really stupid lesbian jokes.
5879790	5880731	Fangirl lesbian.
5880751	5881331	Fangirl lesbian.
5881371	5882191	So thank you all.
5882232	5885914	You guys all deserve your own piece of the win internet.
5887134	5887775	I love everybody.
5888055	5889235	DarkSakura, your final thought?
5889716	5891156	As always, reject false icons.
5892317	5894178	And number two
5895563	5897584	Did you see the shampoo I sent you?
5898244	5900285	It's made for very fine hair.
5901845	5905306	And if your friend says I love you, don't punch!
5905767	5906967	Say thank you.
5909248	5914449	And my final thought is you put your weed in there.
5915690	5917891	Loki, your final thought.
5918711	5924673	My final thought is I want to play more Dead Rising, but people want me to play more Chromehounds.
5925117	5926158	Decisions, decisions.
5926238	5926498	I know.
5926598	5927459	Good luck in the tournament.
5927859	5928900	We'll be cheering you on.
5928920	5929761	Thank you guys.
5929841	5933645	Thank you very much for nominating me for this tournament.
5933905	5936027	For not even having a team.
5936287	5936567	You know what?
5936587	5937288	You know what?
5937688	5939110	I say, screw it.
5939530	5946436	Let's figure out a way to get Chris and Megzy and two other lesbian gamers and we'll just have the giggling lesbian squad go up against you.
5946476	5946896	Yeah, right.
5946916	5947317	We'll kick
5948137	5948357	Yeah!
5948878	5950858	We'll kick so much ass with our giggles.
5951358	5953179	Okay, okay.
5953199	5957841	Because all the straight guys from all games in Gamer Andy will have such big boners that they won't be able to play.
5957861	5959462	We'll bounce around.
5959742	5963863	I will take them on one-on-one, but this four-on-four crap is ridiculous.
5964764	5971486	I didn't agree to do any sort of... I said I wanted to play these guys, but I never said... Just take one for the team, Loki.
5972607	5973467	Now you're being a woman.
5974007	5974347	Alright.
5975348	5975688	Whatever.
5976926	5980229	Thanks everybody so much for listening and tuning in, supporting Internet Radio.
5980289	5986955	Even on a crazy night like tonight, the fact that you guys are sticking with Orange Lounge Radio means you too are made of winning awesome, and we love you for it.
5986995	5987536	Thanks so much.
5987656	5989137	We'll see you next week for Orange Lounge 196.
5990178	5991580	Dark Sakura's not going to be here next week.
5991980	5992380	That's right.
5992440	5998166	I'm going to be at Disneyland having a big massive Disneyland Mississippi orgy.
5998966	5999467	Which means...
6000413	6003595	Boys, take control of Orange Lounge Radio next week once again.
6003615	6006096	Which means enjoy it while it lasts.
6006296	6006637	All right.
