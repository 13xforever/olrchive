Tonight, August 6th, 2006, Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a really big PlayStation game, two big game companies post big losses, and do video games cause teen pregnancy?
Hey everybody, this is Loki.
Joining us once again, we have another week of wonderful game news.
This is August 6th, and well, we have a wonderful show for you guys tonight, especially when we're not giggling.
Joining us as always, we have the wonderful DarkSakura.
Of course I'm wonderful.
And I'm also really hot today.
Because the AC doesn't get in this room.
And normally introducing us, the wonderful Skye.
OrangeLoungeRadio.com
We tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, although tonight, thanks to all our fault starts, it's more like 6.36 right now.
We're finally getting into the show, but that's just all part of the live experience.
You can also hear us syndicated weekly on allgames.com, our affiliate station.
That's Mondays at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, and you get most of the same live stuff that you do here.
DarkSakura World of Warcraft Animal Crossing
I mean, really, this week has been a lot of preparation for other things.
Dan went to some pinball party in Concord, but I haven't heard how that went.
Actually, no, I did play a whole lot of Twilight Zone pinball, but Dan's been working on the machine.
It's been my usual stuff, however, I am looking forward to Dead Rising.
Did you play the demo?
No, I haven't.
I've been busy.
So you've just seen the trailer and stuff?
Yeah, I'm going to set it for download tonight.
Unfortunately, my work is wanting me to do another flyer for them.
Art for free.
So like overtime now?
No, I don't get paid for it, sadly, but it does go in my portfolio.
That's good.
You need something for it.
How's World of Warcraft going?
I'm at level 8.
Slowly but surely wins the race.
I play like an hour every so often just when I'm like, oh, I have an hour.
Plus, I notice you like to get on there and screw around too.
Yeah.
Like you'll be dancing out in the village and all that stuff.
I remember one time I logged in and my character on World of Warcraft is female because people give you stuff more when you're female.
And it was myself and DarkSakura and Tiara, right?
We were all playing.
Yeah.
It was Tiara.
And we were all dancing.
The three zombie ladies were all dancing.
She's listening right now.
Hi, Sauce.
Hello.
All right.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
it's just such a small section of the mall and I mean there's not really anything you can do I mean it's only it's 15 minutes timed as well so but it's fun I mean don't get me wrong I'm buying the game you know in a couple days but it's just you know for demo it's okay I'm not having as much fun as I did with Saints Row Saints Row it's just fun and then on top of all that I actually haven't bought Street Fighter 2 just because I don't really want to I don't know
It doesn't seem like something I'd like.
I'll wait for Pac-Man this week, I guess.
I don't know why the hell I'd buy Pac-Man, but Nelly will probably want to play it or something.
And then more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.
We're really getting frustrated with it.
We need to get the new one, which is coming out early October.
So hoping, you know, hearing some good things on it.
They're going to have Jet Ski, the new one, which is awesome.
You can swim, so that's also good.
And it should be pretty cool.
All right.
Say hello as well to our very special guest, although, I don't know, the special thing is wearing off, because this is, what, like the third week in a row?
I don't know.
But say hello to... Are you changing your name to Drew Nami now, officially, or what's the deal?
I'm trying to do a handle change.
Alright, then Drew Nami it is.
The artist formerly known as 23rd Magus.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
I've been in a hotel for most of the week, so I've been playing a lot of DS games.
I've been replaying Phoenix Wright again, a little Animal Crossing, Wild World...
Actually, that's about it.
A little guilty pleasure of Yu-Gi-Oh!
Nightmare Troubadour.
Other than that, not much to speak of for my gaming week.
It's kind of sad.
But next week, I'll be back to World of Warcraft.
Alright, sounds good.
My gaming week, you know what?
Surprisingly, I haven't been playing a lot of World of Warcraft because, oh, and the WoW players are going to get pissed at me for this, but I don't care.
I decided to check out Guild Wars for the first time.
I haven't played Guild Wars in like, gosh, probably like a year and a half.
It's been a long, long time since I played Guild Wars.
But I remember that Guild Wars, one of the perks about it is that you don't pay a monthly fee for it.
So I can do that.
I can just decide to log in and play again.
So I decided to do that.
I just fired it up and played.
And it's interesting.
Lots changed because I haven't played ever since they rolled out the factions expansion.
And they really changed the interface and everything when factions rolled out, I guess.
But I created a new character.
I started to do it.
I think I'm a necromancer slash monk.
and having fun with it.
You know, the graphics in that game are really nice.
I love the fact that, you know, just like World of Warcraft, you can do a windowed full screen.
It's seamless.
It's easy.
The graphics are really nice, no matter which way you're playing it.
It gives you a lot of control over the video elements as well.
Gameplay style is very similar to that of World of Warcraft, except you're limited to how many skills you can take out on the field at a time.
And, of course, the biggest change is the fact that, you know, for those of you guys that do play WoW, it's almost like the entire world is like an instance.
You're only around other people when you're in towns.
And if you choose to go out with other people into the world, then you get your own copy of the world.
So it's kind of interesting.
I don't know how long I'm going to play it.
I don't know if I'm, you know, we'll see.
I guess it depends how many other people I can find that play it.
But the reason why I went on it is that some listeners were saying, hey, you should get it back on Guild Wars.
So I'm like, okay, I'll check it out.
So there I am.
So maybe we'll start a Noel Army Guild there.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Otherwise, I've been playing Prey a little more, just trying to make my way through that slowly but surely.
and Street Fighter 2 hit the arcade this week.
And, of course, I had to download the demo for that.
I actually downloaded the full game.
I didn't download the demo.
I just got the game.
And it's pretty good.
I know a lot of people have been knocking it for the lag online, but to be honest, I haven't had a lot of problem with lag.
I mean, I have played one or two laggy matches, but I've had way worse in Dead or Alive 4.
So maybe I'm just lucky.
I don't know.
Or the fact that there's so many people on Street Fighter 2 right now.
Maybe it's just not that bad.
You know, it is what it is.
It's Street Fighter 2.
There's not a lot of frills.
I mean, sure, there's the quarter mode, which is okay.
But it's not as great as you'd think.
And, of course, it has, you know, the achievements.
Granted, I know there's been problems with people that want to quit out when they don't win a match.
But truthfully, I haven't had that problem.
I haven't had anybody quit on me when I've beat them.
And of course, I do beat a lot of people on Xbox.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm about half and half.
I probably have as many wins as losses.
You've shown them death, Rob.
You've shown them death.
I have about half as many.
I have equal wins and losses.
I'm about 50-50.
And I haven't had a problem with that.
If somebody did do that to me, I would totally leave them the feedback that says they quit early.
Because 360 has that where you can leave the feedback.
And I just block them so I wouldn't get matched with them again.
You can do that feature too where you put the little frowny face next to their name and then it won't match you with them in the future.
So...
but I've had pretty good luck with my online on Street Fighter so I'm I'm very happy about that so I I think I think it's good I think for ten dollars is a decent value but at the same time if you have a Super Nintendo still hooked up and a Street Fighter cartridge I don't know if this is going to be
Good for you because you already have the game.
And here's the other thing to keep in mind.
Street Fighter 2 on Xbox Live has the arcade default difficulty.
And remember, the arcade machine was designed to suck away your quarters.
So a lot of people have complained, oh, the difficulty, the difficulty is so hard.
It's a hard game.
Well, it's the default arcade difficulty which was kind of hard to begin with.
I think a lot of people went from Super Nintendo Street Fighter 2 or Genesis Street Fighter 2 which default difficulty was much easier and then went on to this and thought, oh my gosh, I'm getting my butt kicked.
Well, I mean, keep in mind, and not only was it Street Fighter 2, it was Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.
So it was, I think, above and beyond designed to be a little tougher because that game came out after Street Fighter 2 was already a great success and lots of people were kicking each other's butts on it.
On the plus side, though, if you had experience with Anniversary Collection, that defaulted to arcade difficulty as well.
So if you have experience with the PS2 collection, then you should have no problem with the Xbox Live version.
If I recall was a bitch to set up.
Amen to that.
If you guys have that, then I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.
You know, because you're already playing Street Fighter 2 online.
But, you know, it's certainly a ton of people are on there right now.
I've only one time gotten the same person back to back.
I get a lot of different people and I don't have to wait long for a match at all.
It's really quick.
So.
All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.
Actually, wait, quick, some housekeeping, because I actually have a Street Fighter 2 related thing in our housekeeping tonight.
Something I want to mention, it's going on over at allgames.com, which is our, you know, affiliate site that broadcasts us on Mondays at 5 Pacific Standard Time.
All Games is doing a big Street Fighter 2 tournament over there, and they've got room for quite a few people, so it's us and...
and I believe Bobby Blackwolf and All Games Interactive are all kind of coming together to try and get people in on this tournament.
So it's kind of like a Voltron tournament, so to speak, where we're all coming together to form a giant monster of a tournament.
So we're going to be holding this big Street Fighter 2 tournament.
No cost to enter.
It's just sign up, have fun with it.
And I believe there are prizes involved as well.
I believe they're giving away your choice of a Street Fighter 2 figure.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So by all means, go over to allgames.com, click on where it says tournaments, and check out Street Fighter 2.
And I entered the tournament myself, so possibly you will be playing against me in the first round.
And probably taking me out in the first round, because I'm not that good at Street Fighter 2.
I'm okay, but I'm not that good.
So we'll see.
I believe the way the rules work is it's three rounds, or I'm sorry, three matches.
It's best of three matches with three rounds apiece.
So if you get screwed your first game, you still have two chances.
So it's best two out of three matches.
So it gives you a fair chance.
So that should be fun.
Let me introduce our chat room as well over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on chat.
JeremyTodd1, who by the way is a listener that I actually fought on Street Fighter 2 earlier this week because he happens to be on my buddy list on Xbox Live.
And I beat him.
To be fair, though, it was really close and he beat me one round.
So it was a good match.
Sky, or anyone else, when you do quick rank matches, do you ever get a timed out thing and then have to try to find another person to fight?
Yes, I do get that.
I read some tip on one of the gaming blogs, I want to say it was Kotaku, where you're supposed to be able, if you hit a button during that, then you don't get the time out.
It's the Xbox guide button.
I don't, yeah, I don't know why that would have an effect on it.
If it's counting down, what it's doing, the counting down from five down.
You just hit the Xbox Guide button once and then hit it again to basically kind of pop up your guide and then put it away.
And then that'll allow it to connect.
I don't know why.
But, you know, honestly, it's so fast.
The whole process is so fast to get in there and do a quick match.
It doesn't really bother me.
Like, I heard some people the first day were getting, like, tens and twenties of those in a row.
But my thing is...
If that's happening to me, I would create a match and wait for someone to join it.
Maybe that would be better.
I don't know.
And I think, to be honest, what it is is it's just that everyone was hammering it in the beginning.
It's going to get better as it goes along.
And if there is a serious problem, they will patch it.
All right.
So go represent the OL Army, you guys, over in the Street Fighter 2 tournament on allgames.com.
And for those of you guys that are in our chat room, I noticed Bobby Blackwolf is there.
And he posted a link right to the tournament page.
So check that out.
That's pretty much it for housekeeping.
I don't think I have a whole lot else.
That's on the agenda, so let's get into tonight's news!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
to basically attend this thing and it's going to be much lower key they're playing on just you know they're going to have the big press conferences like they did this year and the other years but it's not going to be the whole you know if I work at GameStop or something like that I can just get in you're not going to be able to so
Definitely more intimate type of thing.
And from the sounds of it, I know on the video side they have a thing called VSDA, which they're putting out with the EMA, and it's the same type of thing.
It's for the video industry, and it's also very low-key like that.
But it's always good, because to be honest, the E3 is just a clusterfuck of line-weighting and just a lot of behind-closed-door stuff anyway, so...
It could end up being good.
We just have to see.
They're also saying that they're going to be changing the date on it.
It's not going to be being held in May.
It's going to actually be in July now.
Response from our chat room here over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
Click on chat.
ZeroCool says, E3 Media Festival, worst effing name ever.
Let's see.
We also have PooEater says, E3 Watered Down Festival, less fun, more talk.
And, of course, we have somebody from the East Coast.
I'm assuming they're a Yuri lover.
Digital Life
It's just a bad taste in your mouth after the whole thing.
I actually do have to admit I had to play up being female a little to get some of the stuff I did.
Jeremy Todd 1 says, For the people that go to E3, it sucks for them, even for OLR.
What are they going to do now then?
We do consider ourselves to be a legitimate media outlet.
We have a business license.
We're not...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Look at the bottom of press releases and make sure you're in constant contact with these people and basically be interested in what they have to say.
And that's it.
Being in with some of the big game companies might be the secret to next year's E3.
And we might be lucky enough to have that.
I don't know.
It just kind of depends.
So I'm not going to speculate until we know a little more about what E3 really is going to be next year.
I'm not too concerned about E3 next year because it's my company.
They were in VIP retail last year.
Lucky you.
Well, they get four invites.
And from what I imagine, there wasn't that many invites.
So it was a good portion of them.
And they said that they're going to get the same thing next year.
So, well, one way or another, we'll be there.
But, you know, the Beyonce, it's...
Like I said, it's behind the scenes stuff.
Okay, so we've heard a lot about E3.
Most people I imagine listening to this show probably read a lot about this on the internet last week.
So let's change this a little bit and say, what do you think, being into E3 before, reading all this and staying on top of this this week, what do you think folks can realistically expect next year's E3?
What is it going to be like?
Next year's E3 is going to basically be press conferences with companies.
They're going to probably set up certain...
almost like workshops or something like that where you set a time and they basically preview the game and give you all the info in a block of like an hour or so.
For example, kind of like what we do with the Gamer Days and when the companies come into my company, they basically talk about the titles that are coming out, they show us a bit of it, they tell us the selling points of it, and then they'll give you either, in the case of E3, they'll probably give you some time to play with the game or, you know,
and so on.
They're not going to have maybe a lot of playable demos because companies are really... They say that interrupts their production cycle because they have to crank up this demo even though the game's not ready yet.
And so you're not going to probably see a lot of demos anymore.
It's just going to be press information.
That's why it's media festival.
Jamie, what do you think E3 is going to look like?
What are you going to see when you walk through the doors of E3 2007, which hopefully you will be?
I'm pretty much in agreement with Loki.
That's what it sounds like it's going to be developing into.
So it's kind of like...
It's a little more controlled where the publishers will have control over this certain block of time and sort of the crowd's attention or what have you.
Well, by doing that also, they bypass a lot of the overheard stuff because we've all overheard some of the executives walk around talking about certain things too.
It really controls the information given out.
That's, you know what, that's true.
I remember, yeah, the overhearing thing is interesting because I remember at E3 this year we were walking right by some Activision people and, you know, they said this in public, I don't have a problem repeating it.
The Activision people were talking about the purchase of Red Octane and they were talking about, like, wow, that was a really, I'm really glad we did that type, you know, they were saying, oh, that was a really good move and all that stuff, you know, I thought that was just kind of interesting to overhear something like that, like...
Should you be talking about that where all these people can hear you?
You know, so it's interesting.
And I think it also, for some of the higher-ups that are there, it actually protects them, I think, from some of the crowd.
Because, for example, I mean, I saw Miyamoto last year, this year, just freaking mobbed by people, by different press.
And, you know, it actually would be a more controlled way for some of the higher-ups within the companies to make appearances, I think.
That's true, because at Konami Gamers Day, there were a lot of celeb-type things, especially for the music games, and the only people mobbing them was us.
We're smart when we do it.
We don't mob them.
We didn't drool as much as normal.
And there were big media people, TV people, and stuff there, too, but I think in a more controlled environment like that, where you don't have the...
Rampant fanboyism, you know what I mean?
You kind of take the fanboys out and the people that are there for business.
It was a lot more controlled.
I was a rampant fanboy.
Well, yeah, but there's even a game journalist, you know, a game journalist is a game journalist, hopefully in part because they truly enjoy video games.
And so there's something that they're going to get giddy about whether they want to admit it or not.
It's just about, you know,
Kencha Hall in a hotel
I think it's going to look like Kensha Hall looks like or they have like all the meeting rooms in the back and then like the front or like a smaller booth and I think take out the people that used to be in Kensha Hall and plug in the bigger game companies and I think that's kind of what it's going to look like.
If it's anything like VSTA which normally is the show floor is hardly anything it's all meetings with companies and basically companies will invite you know hey we've got times you know for meetings you know let us know when you want to come by.
Sign up for a slot and come by and we'll show you what our product is.
And that's, I think, what's going to be.
I think they're really going to follow the model of VSTA, which is, like I said, it's all meetings, it's all in suites, and they're all basically just one-on-one contact with people.
And there are some stuff.
Lots of parties, though.
They do have parties, so that's good.
So there'll be that.
But it's more or less just one-on-one contact with your key retailers.
Because to be honest,
The way they see things, they're all, well, why should I even bother with the small press?
Because, you know, it's the big press that gets the most views out there anyways, and they're the ones that have the most influence over what people buy, or, you know, how they feel about our games, so what's it really matter?
That's how they kind of unfortunately view things, and you kind of have to convince them otherwise.
You're like, hey, you know what?
You know, mom and pop video stores out there may not be a big part of the rental scene, but they're still part of the rental scene, so you better pay attention to them.
Alright, well, let's hope
Let's hope that thought process carries over.
We're screwed.
We'll see, though.
Anyway, let's kind of move on here to kind of another aspect of this, and that would be, of course, with E3 going down, part of what we were talking about last week is who's going to try and rise up and take that big video game showy crown away.
And it looks like America's Video Game Expo might be throwing down the gauntlet saying, hey,
www.vgexpo.com
What do you guys think?
Do you think we're going to see more of this where other companies are trying to step up and say, hey, we want to be the new E3?
Or do you think this show might be where it's at or what?
It's an opportunity to capitalize.
And honestly, it's like, hey, our one and only competition has decided to do something stupid.
I'm sorry, decided to do something different.
And we're going to hop in their spot.
We're going to be the big name.
We're going to rise to the occasion.
I think that that's exactly what's going on with that.
Hmm.
All right.
Well, if you guys want to check that out for yourself, www.vgexpo.com.
And I won't be able to make it this year, and I don't think any of us can.
October?
Maybe next year.
End of October.
The problem is it's the exact same weekend, I think, as the New York City thing I'm doing.
But I'm not sure.
And I'm doing Wicon.
I don't think the wife would like me flying across country.
Yeah.
Philadelphia is a nice place, though.
I've been there.
Good times.
Good times.
All righty.
Well, to sort of give a little bit better news than the whole bummer E3 business, because everybody has been just buzzing on that.
It looks like Xbox Live Arcade is going to have the PlayStation 1 version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night, known in Japan as Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, the direct sequel to Dracula X for the PC Engine.
Which actually makes me incredibly happy, because then I don't have to dust off my PlayStation collection every time I want to play it.
But it will be on, they're saying, early next year.
There's also a lot of indication that it will be possibly emulated on the PSP and showing up on Wii's Virtual Console.
So that's pretty cool.
I'm going to be on Wii's Virtual Console.
I mean, that's the only weird thing about that because it was never on the Nintendo system.
Well, they're not saying they're going to do it.
It's just saying that the door is open for that possibility because it's a non-exclusive agreement.
Because I think a lot of people were saying, well, wait a minute.
What about the whole backwards compatible PS1 on the PSP Ridge Racer type thing that they were touting at Sony?
Does this mean that Konami's pulled out of that?
No, I don't think it does.
I think it just means...
Hey, they're trying to milk this for all it's worth.
Smart to me.
There's also First Quarter 2007 Frogger, Contra, Super Contra, Track and Field, Time Pilot, and Scramble and it's looking like they're the coin-op versions.
Well, Frogger... Oh yeah, I hope they're not releasing another Frogger.
It is the old school arcade Frogger.
Which I still can't play if I'm not on roller skates.
Um...
What was I going to say about Castlevania?
Oh, now I think it would be cool if they would unlock some bonus content in the Xbox Live Arcade.
Give it something that the PlayStation version never had.
Like Maria?
I don't know.
Just a thought, maybe do it, because in the Saturn version you could play as Maria, right?
Yes, but it was actually, she was supposed to be playable in the original release.
But basically what the Saturn version is, is the finished version.
Because also, there's a trick that you can do if, when you first run in through the gates in the castle, you jump back up and jump down through this...
Trapdoor.
You can knock the trapdoor down.
You can get in the trapdoor if you get there fast enough, and then it leads you to a save room.
But in Saturn version, it leads you to a whole new underground conservatory, I think.
And I was doing a lot of reading that a lot of that... In fact, actually, there's a voice sample.
If you have a viewer... Sorry, a list of something to play the audio files of PlayStation, where it has Maria saying, who would have thought that such a little girl had so much energy when she's possessed by the succubus?
An ending that was supposed to be in the game, which actually I don't think is in the Saturn one, because I've beaten it with Maria, which is actually kind of hard.
Well, that would be kind of cool if they would maybe realize that storyline's full potential in this Xbox Live Arcade release, maybe.
One thing that I really liked on the Saturn one is that Symphony of the Night is supposed to be a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood.
and it actually, I think that it would be a really neat thing is that if they can work it out to where they put like Rondo of Blood on the Wii and then have as a special offering Symphony of the Night.
That would kick ass.
I do remember that they did a script dump of the PlayStation version of Symphony of the Night and they had the fourth ending to it which was supposedly Maria's ending.
Maria being possessed by the Succubus was one.
Yeah, exactly.
My only comment is if they re-dub Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live...
They're going to kill it.
The whole cheesiness of the dub is sort of what sells it.
Well, for any of our listeners, if you want to see some of that special stuff that's tucked away, especially the sound files from Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you can go to Castlevania Dungeon and download those as well as see more stuff about the Rondo of Blood in case you
aren't lucky enough to have the TurboGrafx version.
And also for that text dump that I was talking about, you can find that on the Game Facts page for Sunday Night PlayStation version.
What do you guys think about the fact that this is really the first game that's going to be a really big game?
You know what I mean?
Not big in the sense... Well, I mean, it is probably, for me, the greatest PlayStation game they ever did.
Epic.
Classic.
I mean big in the sense of this is not just some 80s arcade game ported over.
You know what I mean?
Or this is not some
Little, Tiny, Cloning Clyde.
Not to knock those games, because they're good games, but it's not some little thing that was designed to be a little game, a flash game made big.
This is really the first CD game now downloadable.
This is the Holy Grail of Castlevania.
Well, it's one of the Holy Grails of the PlayStation era, and it's this very strange...
I mean, it's exciting, but it's kind of weird.
It's like, what kind of precedent does this set for future Xbox Live Arcade?
Yeah, what's next?
What are we going to see next?
I don't know.
Who knows?
But I know there is a lot of stuff coming out.
So definitely.
Like what?
Like, you know, well, definitely, well, one of the things, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 this week, which is one of the best-selling titles on Xbox Live Arcade.
Actually, one of the fastest games selling right now, even beating out...
Geometry Wars, Dig Dug, Paperboy, Rally-X
Rootbeer Tapper, Sonic the Hedgehog High Speed, Super Contra, Luminous Alive, Hoop World,
I don't know, Roleplaying Game or something?
By the way, Luminous Live will be that new game that on every post Major Nelson makes in his blog, now it'll be Where the Hell is Luminous?
Because it used to be Where the Hell is Street Fighter 2, now it's going to be Where the Hell is Luminous.
Yeah.
Some of the other things, though, that are going to be coming out, there's going to be a mini-golf game, which makes me happy.
That's pretty awesome.
Of course, Small Arms is going to be coming out, which is supposed to be just like...
Super Smash Bros.
So that should be pretty good.
Some ones I didn't... Track and Field.
They actually have Track and Field on here.
Totem Ball, which we actually saw at E3.
Which is kind of weird because it used the live vision camera.
It's almost like an eye toy type of thing.
Of course, Texas Hold'em coming out.
Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.
So that should be pretty cool.
Yeah, so just lots of good stuff.
Definitely going to be... They're saying that they might even be able to do
I'm not excited to watch a Madonna video while I play Luminous.
You know, kind of knocking the whole video on the back.
Well, can't you turn them off?
Turn off the videos if you don't like it.
Well, as we speculated when we first talked about Luminous Live here on the show, a lot of those primo songs will probably be downloadable enhancements.
Now, before we get to the next story, tell me if you think this is a crazy idea or not.
What about an Xbox Live arcade game that could, like, enhance a 360 title?
Halo Cardfighter Chunk of a World
Chocobo World, Final Fantasy VIII
Well, wasn't that what they're planning on doing anyways with Forza?
Remember Forza 2?
You're going to be able to customize your cars on your Vista PC and use them in Forza 2.
I guess that's true.
Ooh, DJ Kibbles and Bits has a good idea.
Imagine a Halo that played like Gunstar Heroes.
No, they just need Gunstar Heroes live.
They would wreck that.
You know they'd wreck that.
It's sad but true.
They would kill that.
Well...
I do have some other good news.
Not as cool as Gunstar here.
Actually, it is pretty cool.
Okay, what's that?
Well, you know there was that little law that they passed in Minnesota that said that children can't buy or rent rated M or adult-only games?
Well, it's been struck down as unconstitutional, like we all knew it would be.
I seem to see this as a pattern amongst all these laws that keep getting passed.
They keep getting struck down.
Well, they need to realize that...
And it really needs to go, I think, to more federal court.
Because I believe that once it's passed three times in federal court, it becomes common law.
Or, to be honest, I don't remember the exact Latin term that they use in legal circles.
But I do believe that it has to pass three times in a federal court for it to become a common judgment.
Where these cases usually end up being thrown out once they try to bring in laws like this.
But they should really learn.
I mean, it's happened in so many places now where you say, oh, children can't do this.
Well, where's the constitutional precedent for you to be able to do that?
But yeah, they said that basically there was a lack of evidence showing that video game violence was harmful to children.
So it was actually overturned.
To quote also Judge Rosenbaum who overturned it said, Is it impossible to determine from the data presented whether violent video games cause violence or whether violent individuals are attracted to violent video games?
I thought that was a very good point.
Your general pacifist person isn't necessarily going to be into playing Halo.
You may have your completely docile person who loves their puzzle games, but I've known people who are calm, collected, cool, who just kick ass on Doom.
It's always the quiet ones.
It's always the quiet ones, yeah.
I think about our buddy Arcadian42, one of the quietest guys I know.
But a real butt kicker on Sega games.
Amen to that.
However, you know, there is something really sad that I've seen pointed out.
That, you know, while all of this debate is going on, you know who has to suffer for it?
Taxpayers.
It comes out of their pocket.
True.
So, how long is it going to be until, you know, the people are going to say, Hey, we're sick of paying for your idiocy.
Just don't.
Would you say it's a true statement that video games cause violence in the weak-minded?
I'm not saying that they're the cause, I'm saying it could be an influence, but the weak-minded, you know, need to be... Need to be hugged, or something.
They need special care.
Extra tender loving care.
Are you calling me weak-minded?
I see these looks going back and forth here.
I know you're talking about me.
Relax, you're looking at me.
Like, you know, it's always the quiet ones.
I'm far from quiet.
I'm saying that, like, I'll go ahead and define it this way.
I think that a violent video game can be an influence on somebody who does not have a more positive influence otherwise.
A.K.A.
parents who don't do their job.
And in your case, Loki, you talk about killing and you talk about how you're going to run everybody over on the road who can't drive.
And sure, you've done crazy things like, you know, your story about eating the lamb burger and then wiping it off on the lambs.
That whole thing.
But you don't actually act out on your murderous things.
That's why you're not.
The way I figure it, if I kill a prostitute in Grand Theft Auto, that's one less prostitute that's on the street.
I have saved society from that prostitute until she respawns again.
In the pixelated world of your PlayStation, yes.
I'm doing the greater good, okay?
We're going to give you credit for having the mental fortitude to be able to tell fiction from reality.
Otherwise, you would not be on this program, and neither would he.
But honestly, I really think that, you know, when mass media is covering things like, you know, children who play Doom who go out and blow away their school, they really need to look at what type of home life were they living.
Did they have chemical imbalances?
Did their parents abuse them?
Have they, you know, what's their major other influences be?
Do they, you know...
and I don't know if I want to go there but take the Columbine thing for instance and how Doom was pretty quick to be blamed for that and then what was it like Marilyn Manson and all that stuff.
I think you learned an awful lot about those kids' lives and it just kind of sounded like it wasn't just the game or just the music.
There was just something way off balance.
I think people like to look for an easy scapegoat.
People are looking for an easy thing to blame.
They want to be able to point fingers at everything but the true cause of the problem.
And honestly, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm being un-American or anything like that, but it is pretty much a very American thing to do, I've noticed.
We do hear some of this in a lot of other industrialized countries, but at the same time we hear most of it coming from here, I think.
That's at least where, in all of my reading, where I've seen a lot of it.
Blame Canada.
for the children being all foul-mouthed and potty-mouthed.
So let's blame Canada.
I love Canada, for the record.
I think it's a solution that would require a lot of work, but unfortunately people are not willing to put the work into changing themselves because they don't think there's anything wrong with them in particular or anything wrong with how they think.
But overall, I think there is a general problem on the issues that people focus on.
There's a general lack of accountability here
and the majority of individuals, I think, over in this country.
Gorilla says, hey, to cry like a baby and sue everyone.
That's the American way.
That coming from our chat room.
Sad but true.
Gorilla also asked the question, what would Brian Boitano do?
If he were here today, he would kick an ass or two.
Because it's the American way?
No, that's what Brian Boitano would do.
Speaking of crying like a baby, one of the people that was sponsoring the Minnesota anti-games bill had some, you know,
Some very choice words to say about the whole thing.
And she is sporting a very stupid looking haircut, I might add, by the way.
Anyways, her comment was, and I'm going to quote this in the voice I think would be best suited for her.
The whole ruling defied common sense.
I'm so disappointed.
The federal court said we don't have the right to protect our children, but we protect our children from other things.
We don't let them smoke or buy liquor.
You score points in video games for how many women you rape and how many cops you kill.
How could that not affect them psychologically?
So yeah, she's a whining bitch.
Anyways, but I don't know.
It's just...
These people don't understand why these bills keep getting overturned.
Maybe because they're not constitutional.
Maybe because there's actually no proof that any of this is true.
And yeah, it's great that you're limiting them from buying things that we know can harm them.
But things that have been proven or not proven to harm somebody, you can't really protect them from that.
So, oh well.
Magus, some thoughts?
Or Drew Nami, sorry, some thoughts?
These people just need to stop already.
I mean, yeah, we can tell the difference.
You might want to protect your kids, you know, the parents need to protect their kids because they may not know any better, but, you know, quit screwing the game buyers in general, giving us a bad name.
If you were lord and over ruler of the entire world, what would your solution be to this problem of kids play video games and then think it's okay to act that out in real life?
If you're gonna blame anyone, blame the parents.
Have the parents get sued, not the game companies.
What if the parents get sued for the damages?
It's their responsibility.
It is their responsibility.
However, the companies do have a right of responsibility in advertising, making sure that the information is fully out there.
I think that there are cases of misrepresentation.
There are cases where the parents do not choose to be properly informed.
Bullshit.
We have a rating system set up already.
But hold on, hold on.
I can't help but think about those episodes of Maury Povich where I'm seeing the...
The old moms that are on there with like the crazy ass kids, you know.
The ones really deformed?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm talking about like, you know, the, I can't control my daughter.
She wants to dress like a hoe and she beats up everybody in school.
That's your fault, you stupid dick.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
These are the people I'm beating up in Grand Theft Auto.
I don't know that.
What about those kids that are past the point of no return?
To start it this way, you do have to look in the origin of how a child...
Where I do believe that children are born with a certain genetic predisposition towards some behaviors, I do also think that a lot of behaviors are learned if you do not start from infancy.
preparing them for, you know, living a responsible adult life, then they're not going to be that way.
You have to start off with showing proper discipline, with not letting them walk all over you, first of all, because, I mean, if the kids get, honestly, and I was like this when I was a kid, if you give an inch, they'll take a mile.
I mean, but I honestly look at a lot of the more well-adjusted ones, the ones who don't need as much supervision,
and when you see the type of encouraging, responsible lifestyle that most of my friends who are more well-adjusted have grown up in, however, if there is a degree of, for lack of a better description, mental disturbance,
There are treatments available, you just have to be willing to offer it.
Here's an interesting quote in our chatroom, and let me get your guys' reaction to this, and then we need to move on.
Jonathan F. in our chatroom over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat, says, Companies should put a notice at every game startup to say that they are not responsible for the actions of its players.
What do you think of that comment?
That's a great idea.
That's a smart move.
Really?
It's an interesting idea.
I'm not saying it's a bad idea.
Should they have to?
Put the printing on the box.
Purchase of this game.
I always think about those commercials.
Like, you know, you see the commercials on TV where it's like, you know, the driving around and doing the stunts.
And what does it always say at the bottom?
Do not attempt at home.
And I'm thinking driving around a professional course.
Duh.
Well, you know what?
They have to because of lawsuits.
I mean, that's why Jackass, in front of every single show and the movie and the trailer, they have to put, you know.
Don't try this at home.
We're professionals.
If you try this, you're going to get hurt and possibly kill yourself.
We are not responsible for any injury.
Unfortunately, people in the Sue Happy world that we're in, we have to remind them of the stupid things out there.
Guess what?
Fire hot.
Ice cold.
Car dangerous.
I mean, just stupid shit like that.
I don't know.
That's how dumb America is.
Alright, one more thought, Drew Nami.
Okay, you know how we have those disclaimers?
People who've played MMOs get the disclaimers.
The whole ESRB disclaimer.
Game experience may change during online play.
They're not, you know, the company is not responsible for its player base.
The player base is responsible for the player base.
I would hope game experience changes in online play because I play as a woman in MMOs.
Like I said, more free stuff.
That's your problem, Rob.
Alright, anyway.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
When we heard about the whole, you know, video games cause teen pregnancy, I was serious when I said that.
Here it is.
There was an opinion piece that was on CantonRep.com that was addressing the high pregnancy rates in students at this particular high school, Timken High School.
And basically what it does is it places blame on all sorts of things.
And it says here, here's a quote.
Whose fault is it?
That more than 13% of Tim Kim's girls are with child.
Some would say fault finding isn't a fruitful exercise, but in this case it's critical.
Suspects range from movies, TV, and video games to lazy parents and lax discipline.
Only one thing is sure, schools don't impregnate children.
I'd like to point out, by the way...
The article said nothing about sex ed, birth control, education, or anything like that.
I actually did know somebody in Alabama who conceived her baby in the bathroom at my high school.
That's crazy shit.
Wow.
So yes, you... school...
and directly.
Okay, my thought is though, how did somebody get the notion, and I think the reason why this got picked up by some of the game blogs this week and why we're reporting on it now, how did somebody get the notion that video games cause pregnancy?
Because I don't know about you, but video games is usually an experience by yourself, unless it's Mario Party, something like that, Lamb Party.
And last time I checked, masturbation won't make you pregnant.
It's all about Rez.
I'm not even going to say what just popped into my head.
What popped into your head?
Come on.
Transcontroller Turkey Baster.
And more importantly, why was she looking at me when she said it?
I wasn't looking at you.
Oh, shit.
You're frightening me now.
It's the new hair.
She's made you a sexy beast.
I know all those chicks out there, they get totally hot and bothered when they see pixelated people having sex in games or pixelated nipples and stuff.
Yeah, your wife.
I know, she totally gets hot and bothered by all that shit.
She has to jump on the cock right there.
You know what?
Sex is overrated.
Of course I'm being sarcastic here, obviously.
I think that people just need to, you know, realize that there's stuff other than sex to be interested in and, like, stop blaming video games when people decide to be horny bitches.
Well, video games are responsible for every other of society's ills.
Why not blame them for this?
Rich Richard taught me how to drive.
Just a friendly reminder, boys and girls.
The following program is intended for mature audiences.
Okay, let me basically say something here.
If you've ever talked to any girlfriend out there that has her boyfriend who's playing video games, what's the biggest complaint?
He plays the video games!
He doesn't pay attention to me!
I would say, if anything, that video games, TV, and movies reduce the amount of sex that you have
rather than, you know, increase anything.
Because I can tell you this much, if there's a guy watching TV or football or something like that and this woman's trying to get up on him, he's like, excuse me, hun, I'm trying to watch the TV, you know, move over.
I mean, that's kind of what it is.
This is kind of what Pooeater's saying in chat.
He said this right before you said that, Loki.
Video games stop teen sex.
Hold up, baby, I gotta pwn this noob.
Stop touching me!
I remember a G4 vodcast with a fake commercial touting World of Warcraft as a birth control method.
and this is basically it.
Wait, something funny actually came from a G4 vodcast?
Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?
I know, amazing.
You know, new and exciting.
Alright, any other thoughts on the games and teen pregnancy?
Yeah, well, guess how many pregnant teens said the same thing?
Yeah, I would like to hear from a pregnant teen.
I would like to hear from anyone.
Seriously.
Did the video game cause you to get pregnant?
If so, how?
But please don't go into graphic detail.
Okay, we know how birds and bees work, okay?
You've got nine months.
Go.
All right.
You know, all these stories about the, you know, video game bills and the people saying video games cause pregnancy, it makes me a little angsty.
Does it make you angsty, DarkSakura?
I'm always angsty.
What are you talking about?
Well, then you know what it means that it's time for a particular segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio that we have to do every single week, right?
Of course we do.
My FU of the week goes toward the traffic from, uh, I'd have to say Vacaville to Davis.
I know I've been going to the Bay Area like every weekend now and coming back, but, um, it was really stupid and I thought it was maybe a car accident because, you know, people are retarded.
They like to look at the car crashy and see the pretty lights go in the air.
But this is just so many stupid people and the SUV drivers, oh my god.
Do not buy an SUV unless you live in the boonies.
The end.
Okay, thanks, bye.
Loki.
F you to the illegal immigrants that were carrying down the shed that's next to my apartment at 7.30 in the morning on Saturday because they didn't want to work late that day.
And, um, yeah, I don't know.
It's really annoying to complain to my apartment complex and they didn't really give a shit.
But, um, yeah, the shed's been sitting here.
They had it, like, framed the
F you to staying in a hotel.
A hotel is my least favorite place to stay, period.
We have these idiot people one floor down.
I so much as drop a water bottle, they make a call up to the front desk, and they threaten to check us out.
They can't throw us out, but they can check us out.
And the AC doesn't work right, although it's a welcome change from the house.
And the beds suck.
So yeah, F you to hotels.
Learn to make a comfy hotel, and maybe I'll stay there.
I'd like to give an F you to downtown San Francisco for smelling like pee.
Amen!
That's it.
I second that one, Rob.
Alright, back to the news.
Thank you for the mic there, Magus.
Anyways.
Maybe we should call him Magnami.
I'd like to really quickly clarify something in the chatroom because they're saying I said legal immigrants and that's maybe racist of me.
Okay, they had their 10-year-old son working on the job at the same time with these other people, so I don't think that's legal.
It is.
I do believe you have to be at least 15 in the state for a work permit.
Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, child labor laws and such.
Anyways, speaking of illegal things, Nintendo and Microsoft are being sued over controller patents, and they're being sued by this company called Aniscape, who apparently has patents on
Such things as remote controller with analog button, 3D controller with vibration, and game controller with analog pressure sensors, among other things.
What's funny, though, is this company, Anescape, hasn't made anything.
They just hold patents for a ton of shit, which is excellent.
And the kind of speculation around this is that this company, Anescape, is actually a company made to...
Basically, sue people.
And what's funny is, there was a comment by one of the people on Kotaku, which this story ran on.
by this guy named Baboon, and I think he sums it up pretty good.
It says, given that Nintendo 64 had an analog stick in 1996, and a patent describing it in 1999 won't be upheld in court, as to why Aniscape isn't suing Sony, this might have something to do with who owns Aniscape.
Take a quick Google search and you'll get nothing but patent applications.
It's quite likely Aniscape is nothing but a shell company created to litigate
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
is just to not make any product at all.
If you don't do anything other than patent stuff, you can't be breaking anyone else's patents, and chances are you'll be able to reach a settlement that gets you mucho dinero.
Interesting comments from our chat room here.
Some folks kind of feel the same way, that probably this company is just set up to sue people.
Eddie in chat says, these companies survive on lawsuits.
VXJasonXV says, I hate patent sporgers.
and VidPal, it kind of sums up my thoughts on this.
Geez, how many more no-name companies have patents for vibrating controllers?
Didn't we kind of already go here already?
Exactly, and here's the other thing too.
Why now?
Why, you know, if you've held this patent since 1999, why when, you know, the original Nintendo 64, you know, came out or whatever, or when the PlayStation came out, why are you waiting until like five generations down the road before you start suing?
That's the kind of fishy part about it.
I mean...
It's like, you know, the whole thing, like if Konami didn't sue Roxor over DDR, if they let it go and stuff after a long time, then it almost seems like there's nothing they should be able to do about it, you know, because you've allowed it to happen.
It's kind of protecting your own asses.
Assets.
Yeah, I get it.
All right, well, interesting.
I guess we'll see what happens.
Did you have a comment on this?
I got nothing.
Oh, okay.
Well...
Speaking of Nintendo, there's actually going to be some Wii news breaking in Leipzig on August 23rd.
They have a keynote at the games convention that should last for about an hour called Wii Prove Our Promise.
Pun.
Speaking of more puns.
I'm glad even they can make fun of their own name.
There's also a plan to show five new Wii games during that event.
I wish we knew what games, but I guess that's part of the secret.
We will wait and see.
You're fired.
I am not sponsoring these jokes, I swear.
You're fired, too.
All right.
Do you think this is where we're going to finally find out, okay, here's the date it's coming out, here's the price, all that good stuff?
Yeah, because they're not at Tokyo Game Show.
They're not doing Space World this year.
It's the last big convention before the launch.
But I thought we weren't supposed to hear until September.
It's a goddamn week from September.
Close enough.
Alright, just thought I'd get that in there.
They're like, okay, we're a little early.
So sue us.
We're Nintendo, we can do what we want.
I must express, previously on the program, I had a little bit of disappointment that Mortal Kombat Armageddon was only coming out for current-gen consoles.
It's only coming out for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but actually there's been news this week that it is actually coming out for the Nintendo Wii.
No word on how it's going to take advantage of the Wii's control scheme, but this would be one more title that's going to be coming out.
There is a quote from the publisher.
Our Chicago studio, under the direction of Ed Boon, has been working extremely hard to make Armageddon stand out in a big way with the inclusion of the entire Mortal Kombat character lineup, the Motor Kombat minigame, which, by the way, is supposed to be like Mario Kart.
It looks awesome.
It's going to be great.
I just kind of wish it was next-gen, but whatever.
A new conquest mode and several other innovative gameplay additions that help keep the franchise at the top of its genre.
We're confident that Wii fans will truly appreciate the finished product when it's ready to hit store shelves.
You hear it's also being packaged with Mortal Kombat 3.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
You know what, but see, the only downside to this news, I think, for Midway, is that, at least for me, I was going to pick this up, even if it is on current gen, I was going to pick it up, but now, I'm going to wait.
I'm going to wait and get the one on the Wii, because I just have this feeling that there'll be something extra there, you know?
It's alright, they're both coming out in October anyways.
Well, maybe that one, but they're saying that Armageddon probably won't be out until early 2007, or do you think there's something...
I don't know.
The GameCube one was delayed.
Not this one, but the last one.
Deception?
Deception was delayed on GameCube.
I don't know.
Whatever.
Well, a little bit more Wii news.
Wii bits of news.
It sounds like Ubi's going to be releasing seven Wii launch titles.
So it looks.
Did they say what titles?
We do have a list.
We have Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Open Season, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Red Steel.
That's the list.
And Blazing Angels?
Well, that was also on the list too.
Yeah, that's going to be awesome.
Interesting.
These are all going to come out launch?
When they say launch, does that mean first quarter?
Does that mean the day the Wii's on the shelves?
All these games are going to hit?
They have.
Didn't I make some bet on the show that there weren't going to be more than 20 games when the system comes out?
I think that bet's been... Yes, you did.
I might be in trouble.
I think you owe some money to somebody.
No, I think it was something to do with pudding or something.
But wait, wasn't... $250.
I thought the deal was it had to be first party games.
I'm going to have to go back and find the show where I made the bet because I think it was 20 first party games.
Well, they're getting pretty close.
I know, I'm starting to worry.
I'm sure some listener's been keeping track of that.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it should be interesting.
I mean, I don't know.
Prince of Persia had a lot of swinging around.
How about old school Prince of Persia?
You know, where I actually swing my sword, you know?
Maybe.
I don't know.
That'd be pretty cool.
Maybe a hidden game.
Who knows?
I was going to mention real quick another title that we had coming out, which I'm sure you'll be reading about on all the major press sites later on this week, as the trend seems to be.
Anyways, I'm not sure if you're a big fan of fishing out there, but Rapala Pro...
What was it?
Trophies is going to be coming out on the Wii and on the Xbox 360.
Well, slated sort of in October, but we'll have to wait and see to see when the actual games come out.
So that is one title that you can look for so you can get your fishing on, your Wiimote fishing.
The chat room is commenting on the pudding thing.
It was not dance naked and pudding.
That would not happen on air.
I would not subject Loki and DarkSakura to that.
No, it was $250 worth of pudding.
It was not that either.
It was something about a whole six-pack of pudding rubbing it on my chest or something live on air.
I don't even know where that came from, but that was the bet.
Remind me not to be here for that show.
Some folks are saying it was first party.
Some folks are saying it wasn't.
I'll go back and dig up that show and figure it out.
So we'll see.
I want to mention this, though, regarding the price of the Wii.
You know, $250 a pudding, most people would say, could also buy you a Wii.
However, there's a possible leak to the price of the Wii, and it's coming through the most oddest of places.
7-Eleven.
And no, they're not going to be selling the Wii console, but they're giving away some prizes, and some of them are going to include Wii consoles.
Well, now, here's the deal.
DarkSakura.com
and maybe it's because the cost of shipping is included there and who knows what else.
I still think this is not the telltale and I'll be all signed of the Wii's price.
So we'll see.
Come on, 7-Eleven?
No.
And I don't believe 7-Eleven would be the place that would announce that either.
7-Eleven probably has no guests just like the rest of us do.
DMN in the chatroom says it's approximate retail value, Rob.
And that's correct.
It's the approximate retail value.
Who knows?
They're making an educated guess.
We'll see.
Educated or edumacated?
Probably a little of both.
Well, I have something that isn't an estimation.
These are actual release dates in the UK.
All right.
Our UK friends and pals, what are they getting?
just a few releases coming out on the 11th is Dark Star 1 for PC Panzer Elite Action for Xbox and Siphon Filter Dark Mirror on PSP so other things to look forward to coming up though is on the 25th Dig Dug Digging Strike Reservoir Dogs on the 25th that I think would be fairly interesting and there's a few really good ones coming out next month too because they get Dance Factory and Star Fox Command
Oh, I'm sorry.
There's also some cool, well, not too much coming out in the U.S., but some good stuff, though.
Well, let's start with the Game Boy Advance.
Games Explosion, which is coming out.
It's supposed to be a collection of, like, card games and stuff.
Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
Woo-hoo.
Super Robot Tyson, original generation, which is supposed to be, like, a robot fighting game.
More of a strategy fighting game.
Anyways, on the PC, a bunch of no-name stuff.
My favorite one on this list, though, is Pony Love.
And I hope that's not what I think it is.
Anyways, so on PlayStation 2... Maybe it's a game for little girls who have My Little Ponies.
And you're taking it and making it this sick, perverse thing that it doesn't have to be.
It has to be.
Anyways, D1 Grand Prix is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the official drift racing game.
Pirates of the Legend of the Black Buccaneer is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 as well.
And of course...
The best game of the week, Dead Rising on 360, which I will end up having a review for next week.
What was it?
Rampage?
Oh yeah!
That hit all those blogs this week and I'm thinking, didn't we cover that like two weeks ago on the program?
So here's the story you're going to hear about in two weeks everywhere else.
Exactly folks.
Anyways, well this is going to have to do with some wonderful Take-Two games and the Take-Two games I'm talking about of course are Darkness and Bioshock which are going to be coming out actually next year, 2007.
on around April 5th.
So check those out.
That's going to be pretty cool.
Also, for you music gaming fans, I'll have you know that we have the date now for Guitar Hero 2, which is going to be coming out on November 8th.
Project Gotham Racing 3 Cameo, Perfect Dark Zero,
Now all retail for $29.99 As of now?
As of last week, about Wednesday Really?
But why didn't, if that's the case, if they dropped on Wednesday, why hasn't anyone else picked this up yet?
Because I'm smooth like that Okay, I hope you're right
Otherwise, regardless, October and November are getting to be huge, huge release months, which is typical.
But we've got a lot of big titles coming out in October.
Well, hell, the Wii might be coming out in October, so we're still pretty convinced.
And then we've got September, just tons and tons.
September's not too bad.
Hello, November.
Tons and tons and tons of stuff.
November's pre-packed.
We're gearing up, folks.
We're getting closer and closer to some busy, busy, busy time for gaming.
One thing that won't be busy though much longer are some of EA's servers.
They're shutting down the servers for some of the old games.
And the good news is though it's mostly sports titles and I'm not trying to rub it in the sports fans' faces.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
NCAA Football 2005, NHL 2005, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005, and UEFA Champions League 2004-2005.
All those games are getting shut off pretty soon.
By the way, on October 1st, 2006, Madden 2005 is going to be closing as well as NFL Street 2 Unleashed.
I should also mention one big title I left out there.
Need for Speed Underground 2 has also had their servers shut down.
So if you're a fan of playing those older games, unfortunately, time to upgrade to the newer games.
And to be really honest, I don't think anyone's playing those games online anymore.
I mean, I don't know if you've ever tried to go play some older games on multiplayer and stuff.
There's no one on.
Yeah, so it's probably not going to be missed.
Although you know there's a couple people that are holding out, that are holding on to those titles, and the one or two people that are still playing them, they're going to be pissed.
Write us angry emails, I don't know.
Awesome.
Well, speaking of some hate going around, which is sad, apparently LocoRoco sucks in Japan.
Yeah, LocoRoco is biting the big one.
No one likes it.
Yeah, they actually...
You know, advertise the hell out of this game.
Sony thought it was going to be really cool.
Their website was really cool.
And, well, when it went on sale on July 13th, it sort of was like, eh.
So, yeah, the critics were saying that it wasn't huge.
It's hitting bargain bins already.
They packaged it with PSPs.
It's just, it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.
They thought it was going to be the next Katamari Damacy, and it wasn't.
Do you think it's because they tried too hard?
The thing is that they didn't try to make Katamari Damashii a success.
In fact, it almost seems like they wrote that title off because it was a 1999 release.
It was just released under the table, practically, and became something huge.
But LocoRoco, especially in Japan, they really pushed to try and make it the next Katamari.
This is why I like the call of the snakes on a plane syndrome.
You can't force something to be a cult title.
You release it, and people like it, then it becomes a cult title.
Well, even the critics were saying that they should have let it go as a sleeper.
Let it sneak out into the market.
People go, oh, look where it go.
You know, I honestly, I hope that, you know, they actually look at that tactic for, you know, a release over here.
Because I think it really...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It was a fun demo and stuff, but you know what?
I don't think it's going to keep me interested as long as, say, Scarface, which is coming out later that month, or Godfather, which is also coming out later that month.
However, depending on what you're into, I sat with LocoRoco with the demo for an hour screaming at it.
Well, they also have Capcom Puzzle World coming out in September as well, the same time around as local Rokos.
You know what?
I played the demo at E3 and I wasn't feeling it.
I'm still going to get LocoRoco.
Okay.
No, no, LocoRoco was cool.
I'm talking about Capcom Puzzle World.
I'm burnt out on Puzzle Fighter.
I was really close to importing it, and if it's as cheap as all that, I'm going to wait for the U.S.
release, but I'm thinking that we're going to see the Japanese release.
For all you import crazy people, we're going to see it drop.
That's my speculation.
Well...
In our chatroom, just real quick, VidPower seems to think it seems like everything nowadays is trying to be the next Katamari Damacy.
And I believe from Blaze's comment here in our chatroom, he thinks Elite Beat Agents could be the next sleeper hit.
I think so.
Jeremy Todd 1 points out something good that LocoRoco might not have also sold because the PSP didn't do so well in Japan.
I thought it did better over there than it did over here, but I don't know.
PSP was doing pretty good over there.
It seemed like it was doing okay over there.
I don't think the sales were what they speculated them to be.
It was getting beat down majorly by the DS, but it was still doing good.
The DS Lite had the craziness factor around it, whereas the PSP had a, you know, brisk sales factor around it.
I think that the DS, basically, especially in mind for the Japanese audience...
I think that it really did cater more toward what is typically a more popular item.
You know, something that may not be the most powerful thing, but it's cute, it's, you know, it's compact, it's easy to use, it's versatile.
It's new, it's innovative.
And the fact that, right, and what, what are you going by now?
Drew Nami?
What he said was, you know, that it's the new thing.
People, it's innovative.
People jump on it.
Well,
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
West Yorkshire Police Federation Chairman Tom McGee called the game a sickening glorification of violence against police officers and says it's impossible to see how such a game can have anything other than a highly damaging effect on how people perceive and react to police officers.
The only problem is it's a game and people understand for the most part, at least I assume in the UK more than the US that the game is
Fantasy, and not reality.
I mean, so, they didn't really want it banned, they just wanted to basically kind of, um, they were gonna make it unrated, just because it was so violent.
That's pretty much what it was.
It was just because the game's so freaking bloody, and awesome!
Bloody awesome!
But, um, yeah, that's why they wanted to give it an unrated rating on it.
Meanwhile, ironically, the Reservoir Dogs movie is still being sold in the UK.
Hmm.
Hmm, I say.
Is it because of the interactive element, possibly?
Possibly, but it's still fiction.
People should be able to tell the difference.
Okay, fine.
So you can interact with the characters.
Great.
You don't have to kill the cop in the game.
You don't have to do that.
But here's the other thing, too.
The games don't look exactly as real as a movie.
I mean, the movie has real people in it, you know, performing simulated, you know, acts on people, but it looks very realistic, whereas a game looks like a game.
You know, unless maybe the PlayStation 5 or something, that may be a different story, but for right now, on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, I'm going to look at that and go, yeah, that's a game.
I'm going to know the difference.
I want to know, yeah, it's okay to kill a cop in the game because I know if I kill a cop in the game, the police are not going to be busting down my door in an hour to come kill me.
So it's fine.
It's acceptable.
All right.
Well, I think it's about time for us to take a little break here on the live show, and that means the podcast gets broken up as well because we release in two parts every week.
