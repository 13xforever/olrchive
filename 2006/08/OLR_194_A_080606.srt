1
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:25,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, August 6th, 2006, Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a really big PlayStation game, two big game companies post big losses, and do video games cause teen pregnancy?

2
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:34,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey everybody, this is Loki.

3
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:38,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining us once again, we have another week of wonderful game news.

4
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:45,039
[SPEAKER_04]: This is August 6th, and well, we have a wonderful show for you guys tonight, especially when we're not giggling.

5
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:49,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining us as always, we have the wonderful DarkSakura.

6
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course I'm wonderful.

7
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:52,921
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also really hot today.

8
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:55,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the AC doesn't get in this room.

9
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally introducing us, the wonderful Skye.

10
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:00,885
[SPEAKER_03]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com

11
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:34,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We tape Sunday nights at 6 o'clock, although tonight, thanks to all our fault starts, it's more like 6.36 right now.

12
00:01:34,836 --> 00:01:38,078
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finally getting into the show, but that's just all part of the live experience.

13
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also hear us syndicated weekly on allgames.com, our affiliate station.

14
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:48,424
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Mondays at 5 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, and you get most of the same live stuff that you do here.

15
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:49,904
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura World of Warcraft Animal Crossing

16
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:19,007
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, this week has been a lot of preparation for other things.

17
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:22,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan went to some pinball party in Concord, but I haven't heard how that went.

18
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, I did play a whole lot of Twilight Zone pinball, but Dan's been working on the machine.

19
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:33,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been my usual stuff, however, I am looking forward to Dead Rising.

20
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:35,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you play the demo?

21
00:02:36,214 --> 00:02:36,755
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.

22
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:37,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been busy.

23
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,388
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've just seen the trailer and stuff?

24
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:42,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to set it for download tonight.

25
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, my work is wanting me to do another flyer for them.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,770
[SPEAKER_00]: Art for free.

27
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,791
[SPEAKER_03]: So like overtime now?

28
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:51,593
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't get paid for it, sadly, but it does go in my portfolio.

29
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

30
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You need something for it.

31
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:55,694
[SPEAKER_03]: How's World of Warcraft going?

32
00:02:56,475 --> 00:02:57,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at level 8.

33
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly but surely wins the race.

34
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:04,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I play like an hour every so often just when I'm like, oh, I have an hour.

35
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, I notice you like to get on there and screw around too.

36
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

37
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you'll be dancing out in the village and all that stuff.

38
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:17,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one time I logged in and my character on World of Warcraft is female because people give you stuff more when you're female.

39
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:22,649
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was myself and DarkSakura and Tiara, right?

40
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:23,429
[SPEAKER_03]: We were all playing.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

42
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Tiara.

43
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were all dancing.

44
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:27,552
[SPEAKER_03]: The three zombie ladies were all dancing.

45
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:28,152
[SPEAKER_00]: She's listening right now.

46
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:28,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Sauce.

47
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:28,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

48
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:30,273
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

49
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:32,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

50
00:03:53,274 --> 00:04:22,827
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just such a small section of the mall and I mean there's not really anything you can do I mean it's only it's 15 minutes timed as well so but it's fun I mean don't get me wrong I'm buying the game you know in a couple days but it's just you know for demo it's okay I'm not having as much fun as I did with Saints Row Saints Row it's just fun and then on top of all that I actually haven't bought Street Fighter 2 just because I don't really want to I don't know

51
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem like something I'd like.

52
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll wait for Pac-Man this week, I guess.

53
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:31,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why the hell I'd buy Pac-Man, but Nelly will probably want to play it or something.

54
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,505
[SPEAKER_04]: And then more Grand Theft Auto Liberty City stories.

55
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,166
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really getting frustrated with it.

56
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:40,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get the new one, which is coming out early October.

57
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:44,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So hoping, you know, hearing some good things on it.

58
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,971
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have Jet Ski, the new one, which is awesome.

59
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,912
[SPEAKER_04]: You can swim, so that's also good.

60
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And it should be pretty cool.

61
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:51,553
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

62
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello as well to our very special guest, although, I don't know, the special thing is wearing off, because this is, what, like the third week in a row?

63
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:58,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

64
00:04:58,585 --> 00:05:03,847
[SPEAKER_03]: But say hello to... Are you changing your name to Drew Nami now, officially, or what's the deal?

65
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do a handle change.

66
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, then Drew Nami it is.

67
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:08,590
[SPEAKER_03]: The artist formerly known as 23rd Magus.

68
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:09,530
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

69
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

70
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in a hotel for most of the week, so I've been playing a lot of DS games.

71
00:05:14,312 --> 00:05:19,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been replaying Phoenix Wright again, a little Animal Crossing, Wild World...

72
00:05:21,556 --> 00:05:22,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that's about it.

73
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:24,478
[SPEAKER_01]: A little guilty pleasure of Yu-Gi-Oh!

74
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:25,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Nightmare Troubadour.

75
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, not much to speak of for my gaming week.

76
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:29,883
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of sad.

77
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,944
[SPEAKER_01]: But next week, I'll be back to World of Warcraft.

78
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:33,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

79
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:35,828
[SPEAKER_03]: My gaming week, you know what?

80
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:42,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprisingly, I haven't been playing a lot of World of Warcraft because, oh, and the WoW players are going to get pissed at me for this, but I don't care.

81
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:45,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to check out Guild Wars for the first time.

82
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:49,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played Guild Wars in like, gosh, probably like a year and a half.

83
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long, long time since I played Guild Wars.

84
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:56,000
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember that Guild Wars, one of the perks about it is that you don't pay a monthly fee for it.

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can do that.

86
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just decide to log in and play again.

87
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:00,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to do that.

88
00:06:01,163 --> 00:06:03,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I just fired it up and played.

89
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting.

90
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots changed because I haven't played ever since they rolled out the factions expansion.

91
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:13,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really changed the interface and everything when factions rolled out, I guess.

92
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But I created a new character.

93
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I started to do it.

94
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:20,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm a necromancer slash monk.

95
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,711
[SPEAKER_03]: and having fun with it.

96
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,632
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the graphics in that game are really nice.

97
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:29,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact that, you know, just like World of Warcraft, you can do a windowed full screen.

98
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:29,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's seamless.

99
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:30,376
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy.

100
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,818
[SPEAKER_03]: The graphics are really nice, no matter which way you're playing it.

101
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives you a lot of control over the video elements as well.

102
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Gameplay style is very similar to that of World of Warcraft, except you're limited to how many skills you can take out on the field at a time.

103
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, the biggest change is the fact that, you know, for those of you guys that do play WoW, it's almost like the entire world is like an instance.

104
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:51,185
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only around other people when you're in towns.

105
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you choose to go out with other people into the world, then you get your own copy of the world.

106
00:06:55,046 --> 00:06:55,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of interesting.

107
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how long I'm going to play it.

108
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'm, you know, we'll see.

109
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it depends how many other people I can find that play it.

110
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,751
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason why I went on it is that some listeners were saying, hey, you should get it back on Guild Wars.

111
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, okay, I'll check it out.

112
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:07,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So there I am.

113
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll start a Noel Army Guild there.

114
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:10,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

115
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,053
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

116
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I've been playing Prey a little more, just trying to make my way through that slowly but surely.

117
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,521
[SPEAKER_03]: and Street Fighter 2 hit the arcade this week.

118
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, I had to download the demo for that.

119
00:07:23,321 --> 00:07:24,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually downloaded the full game.

120
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:25,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't download the demo.

121
00:07:25,462 --> 00:07:26,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got the game.

122
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty good.

123
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people have been knocking it for the lag online, but to be honest, I haven't had a lot of problem with lag.

124
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:40,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have played one or two laggy matches, but I've had way worse in Dead or Alive 4.

125
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'm just lucky.

126
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:43,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

127
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the fact that there's so many people on Street Fighter 2 right now.

128
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:47,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just not that bad.

129
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:49,499
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it is what it is.

130
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,399
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Street Fighter 2.

131
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,919
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of frills.

132
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sure, there's the quarter mode, which is okay.

133
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not as great as you'd think.

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, it has, you know, the achievements.

135
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:05,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I know there's been problems with people that want to quit out when they don't win a match.

136
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,962
[SPEAKER_03]: But truthfully, I haven't had that problem.

137
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had anybody quit on me when I've beat them.

138
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I do beat a lot of people on Xbox.

139
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

140
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about half and half.

141
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:14,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably have as many wins as losses.

142
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:15,104
[SPEAKER_01]: You've shown them death, Rob.

143
00:08:15,124 --> 00:08:15,845
[SPEAKER_01]: You've shown them death.

144
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I have about half as many.

145
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:18,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I have equal wins and losses.

146
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:19,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm about 50-50.

147
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't had a problem with that.

148
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:25,929
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody did do that to me, I would totally leave them the feedback that says they quit early.

149
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Because 360 has that where you can leave the feedback.

150
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just block them so I wouldn't get matched with them again.

151
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:36,013
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do that feature too where you put the little frowny face next to their name and then it won't match you with them in the future.

152
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:36,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

153
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:54,128
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've had pretty good luck with my online on Street Fighter so I'm I'm very happy about that so I I think I think it's good I think for ten dollars is a decent value but at the same time if you have a Super Nintendo still hooked up and a Street Fighter cartridge I don't know if this is going to be

154
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you because you already have the game.

155
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:57,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the other thing to keep in mind.

156
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:01,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Street Fighter 2 on Xbox Live has the arcade default difficulty.

157
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:05,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, the arcade machine was designed to suck away your quarters.

158
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people have complained, oh, the difficulty, the difficulty is so hard.

159
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:09,724
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hard game.

160
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:14,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the default arcade difficulty which was kind of hard to begin with.

161
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:25,500
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people went from Super Nintendo Street Fighter 2 or Genesis Street Fighter 2 which default difficulty was much easier and then went on to this and thought, oh my gosh, I'm getting my butt kicked.

162
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, keep in mind, and not only was it Street Fighter 2, it was Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.

163
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:39,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was, I think, above and beyond designed to be a little tougher because that game came out after Street Fighter 2 was already a great success and lots of people were kicking each other's butts on it.

164
00:09:39,805 --> 00:09:46,547
[SPEAKER_01]: On the plus side, though, if you had experience with Anniversary Collection, that defaulted to arcade difficulty as well.

165
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:52,168
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have experience with the PS2 collection, then you should have no problem with the Xbox Live version.

166
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: If I recall was a bitch to set up.

167
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:10,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen to that.

168
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:14,950
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have that, then I don't know if there's going to be a lot here for you.

169
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because you're already playing Street Fighter 2 online.

170
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,794
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's certainly a ton of people are on there right now.

171
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only one time gotten the same person back to back.

172
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a lot of different people and I don't have to wait long for a match at all.

173
00:10:29,099 --> 00:10:29,699
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really quick.

174
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

175
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,152
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, let's get into tonight's gaming news.

176
00:10:34,212 --> 00:10:39,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, wait, quick, some housekeeping, because I actually have a Street Fighter 2 related thing in our housekeeping tonight.

177
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:49,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I want to mention, it's going on over at allgames.com, which is our, you know, affiliate site that broadcasts us on Mondays at 5 Pacific Standard Time.

178
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: All Games is doing a big Street Fighter 2 tournament over there, and they've got room for quite a few people, so it's us and...

179
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:04,418
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe Bobby Blackwolf and All Games Interactive are all kind of coming together to try and get people in on this tournament.

180
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:09,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like a Voltron tournament, so to speak, where we're all coming together to form a giant monster of a tournament.

181
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,045
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be holding this big Street Fighter 2 tournament.

182
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: No cost to enter.

183
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sign up, have fun with it.

184
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe there are prizes involved as well.

185
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe they're giving away your choice of a Street Fighter 2 figure.

186
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:22,915
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

187
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:49,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So by all means, go over to allgames.com, click on where it says tournaments, and check out Street Fighter 2.

188
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:56,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I entered the tournament myself, so possibly you will be playing against me in the first round.

189
00:11:56,715 --> 00:12:00,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably taking me out in the first round, because I'm not that good at Street Fighter 2.

190
00:12:00,496 --> 00:12:01,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay, but I'm not that good.

191
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:02,476
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

192
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the way the rules work is it's three rounds, or I'm sorry, three matches.

193
00:12:07,717 --> 00:12:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's best of three matches with three rounds apiece.

194
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:14,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you get screwed your first game, you still have two chances.

195
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:16,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's best two out of three matches.

196
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gives you a fair chance.

197
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:19,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So that should be fun.

198
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:26,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me introduce our chat room as well over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

199
00:12:26,527 --> 00:12:27,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

200
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:34,468
[SPEAKER_03]: JeremyTodd1, who by the way is a listener that I actually fought on Street Fighter 2 earlier this week because he happens to be on my buddy list on Xbox Live.

201
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I beat him.

202
00:12:37,729 --> 00:12:39,970
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, though, it was really close and he beat me one round.

203
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a good match.

204
00:12:42,858 --> 00:12:48,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Sky, or anyone else, when you do quick rank matches, do you ever get a timed out thing and then have to try to find another person to fight?

205
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:50,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do get that.

206
00:12:50,866 --> 00:12:58,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I read some tip on one of the gaming blogs, I want to say it was Kotaku, where you're supposed to be able, if you hit a button during that, then you don't get the time out.

207
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Xbox guide button.

208
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:02,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, yeah, I don't know why that would have an effect on it.

209
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:05,779
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's counting down, what it's doing, the counting down from five down.

210
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:12,441
[SPEAKER_04]: You just hit the Xbox Guide button once and then hit it again to basically kind of pop up your guide and then put it away.

211
00:13:13,022 --> 00:13:15,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that'll allow it to connect.

212
00:13:15,323 --> 00:13:15,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

213
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:18,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, honestly, it's so fast.

214
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:21,566
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole process is so fast to get in there and do a quick match.

215
00:13:21,606 --> 00:13:22,467
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really bother me.

216
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:27,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I heard some people the first day were getting, like, tens and twenties of those in a row.

217
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,170
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thing is...

218
00:13:28,783 --> 00:13:32,385
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's happening to me, I would create a match and wait for someone to join it.

219
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:33,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that would be better.

220
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

221
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:38,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, to be honest, what it is is it's just that everyone was hammering it in the beginning.

222
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:39,770
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to get better as it goes along.

223
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there is a serious problem, they will patch it.

224
00:13:43,752 --> 00:13:43,992
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

225
00:13:44,352 --> 00:13:49,275
[SPEAKER_03]: So go represent the OL Army, you guys, over in the Street Fighter 2 tournament on allgames.com.

226
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you guys that are in our chat room, I noticed Bobby Blackwolf is there.

227
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:54,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And he posted a link right to the tournament page.

228
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:55,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

229
00:13:56,972 --> 00:13:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it for housekeeping.

230
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I have a whole lot else.

231
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,957
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on the agenda, so let's get into tonight's news!

232
00:14:29,073 --> 00:14:30,154
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

233
00:14:47,833 --> 00:15:05,894
[SPEAKER_04]: to basically attend this thing and it's going to be much lower key they're playing on just you know they're going to have the big press conferences like they did this year and the other years but it's not going to be the whole you know if I work at GameStop or something like that I can just get in you're not going to be able to so

234
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely more intimate type of thing.

235
00:15:09,063 --> 00:15:17,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And from the sounds of it, I know on the video side they have a thing called VSDA, which they're putting out with the EMA, and it's the same type of thing.

236
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the video industry, and it's also very low-key like that.

237
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:34,041
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's always good, because to be honest, the E3 is just a clusterfuck of line-weighting and just a lot of behind-closed-door stuff anyway, so...

238
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It could end up being good.

239
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,229
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to see.

240
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:39,591
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also saying that they're going to be changing the date on it.

241
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be being held in May.

242
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,613
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to actually be in July now.

243
00:15:45,495 --> 00:15:48,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Response from our chat room here over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

244
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:48,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

245
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:52,879
[SPEAKER_03]: ZeroCool says, E3 Media Festival, worst effing name ever.

246
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

247
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have PooEater says, E3 Watered Down Festival, less fun, more talk.

248
00:16:00,624 --> 00:16:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, we have somebody from the East Coast.

249
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:03,546
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming they're a Yuri lover.

250
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital Life

251
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:37,291
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a bad taste in your mouth after the whole thing.

252
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:45,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do have to admit I had to play up being female a little to get some of the stuff I did.

253
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:49,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy Todd 1 says, For the people that go to E3, it sucks for them, even for OLR.

254
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:52,784
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to do now then?

255
00:16:52,864 --> 00:16:55,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We do consider ourselves to be a legitimate media outlet.

256
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:56,927
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a business license.

257
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:57,548
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not...

258
00:16:58,149 --> 00:16:58,770
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

259
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:29,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the bottom of press releases and make sure you're in constant contact with these people and basically be interested in what they have to say.

260
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:30,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

261
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Being in with some of the big game companies might be the secret to next year's E3.

262
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And we might be lucky enough to have that.

263
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

264
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:38,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kind of depends.

265
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:42,952
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to speculate until we know a little more about what E3 really is going to be next year.

266
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:45,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not too concerned about E3 next year because it's my company.

267
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:48,036
[SPEAKER_04]: They were in VIP retail last year.

268
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:48,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky you.

269
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they get four invites.

270
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,661
[SPEAKER_04]: And from what I imagine, there wasn't that many invites.

271
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:54,942
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a good portion of them.

272
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:57,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said that they're going to get the same thing next year.

273
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, one way or another, we'll be there.

274
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the Beyonce, it's...

275
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:04,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it's behind the scenes stuff.

276
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:07,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we've heard a lot about E3.

277
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:11,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people I imagine listening to this show probably read a lot about this on the internet last week.

278
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:24,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's change this a little bit and say, what do you think, being into E3 before, reading all this and staying on top of this this week, what do you think folks can realistically expect next year's E3?

279
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:25,593
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it going to be like?

280
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:30,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year's E3 is going to basically be press conferences with companies.

281
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:31,416
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to probably set up certain...

282
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:42,618
[SPEAKER_04]: almost like workshops or something like that where you set a time and they basically preview the game and give you all the info in a block of like an hour or so.

283
00:18:42,918 --> 00:19:00,984
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, kind of like what we do with the Gamer Days and when the companies come into my company, they basically talk about the titles that are coming out, they show us a bit of it, they tell us the selling points of it, and then they'll give you either, in the case of E3, they'll probably give you some time to play with the game or, you know,

284
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:02,044
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

285
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:35,147
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to have maybe a lot of playable demos because companies are really... They say that interrupts their production cycle because they have to crank up this demo even though the game's not ready yet.

286
00:19:35,387 --> 00:19:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're not going to probably see a lot of demos anymore.

287
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:40,131
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just going to be press information.

288
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,052
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's media festival.

289
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, what do you think E3 is going to look like?

290
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:47,657
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to see when you walk through the doors of E3 2007, which hopefully you will be?

291
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,939
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty much in agreement with Loki.

292
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:53,281
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like it's going to be developing into.

293
00:19:54,162 --> 00:19:54,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like...

294
00:19:56,336 --> 00:20:02,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more controlled where the publishers will have control over this certain block of time and sort of the crowd's attention or what have you.

295
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:12,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by doing that also, they bypass a lot of the overheard stuff because we've all overheard some of the executives walk around talking about certain things too.

296
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:16,985
[SPEAKER_00]: It really controls the information given out.

297
00:20:17,932 --> 00:20:19,032
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know what, that's true.

298
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:27,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, yeah, the overhearing thing is interesting because I remember at E3 this year we were walking right by some Activision people and, you know, they said this in public, I don't have a problem repeating it.

299
00:20:27,696 --> 00:20:38,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The Activision people were talking about the purchase of Red Octane and they were talking about, like, wow, that was a really, I'm really glad we did that type, you know, they were saying, oh, that was a really good move and all that stuff, you know, I thought that was just kind of interesting to overhear something like that, like...

300
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:41,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you be talking about that where all these people can hear you?

301
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:43,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's interesting.

302
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:48,943
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it also, for some of the higher-ups that are there, it actually protects them, I think, from some of the crowd.

303
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:58,905
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, for example, I mean, I saw Miyamoto last year, this year, just freaking mobbed by people, by different press.

304
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:06,547
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it actually would be a more controlled way for some of the higher-ups within the companies to make appearances, I think.

305
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:16,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, because at Konami Gamers Day, there were a lot of celeb-type things, especially for the music games, and the only people mobbing them was us.

306
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,115
[SPEAKER_03]: We're smart when we do it.

307
00:21:19,155 --> 00:21:19,915
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't mob them.

308
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't drool as much as normal.

309
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:29,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were big media people, TV people, and stuff there, too, but I think in a more controlled environment like that, where you don't have the...

310
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Rampant fanboyism, you know what I mean?

311
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,667
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of take the fanboys out and the people that are there for business.

312
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot more controlled.

313
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:38,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a rampant fanboy.

314
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:50,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but there's even a game journalist, you know, a game journalist is a game journalist, hopefully in part because they truly enjoy video games.

315
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's something that they're going to get giddy about whether they want to admit it or not.

316
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:56,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just about, you know,

317
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Kencha Hall in a hotel

318
00:22:24,624 --> 00:22:37,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to look like Kensha Hall looks like or they have like all the meeting rooms in the back and then like the front or like a smaller booth and I think take out the people that used to be in Kensha Hall and plug in the bigger game companies and I think that's kind of what it's going to look like.

319
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:51,794
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's anything like VSTA which normally is the show floor is hardly anything it's all meetings with companies and basically companies will invite you know hey we've got times you know for meetings you know let us know when you want to come by.

320
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:56,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Sign up for a slot and come by and we'll show you what our product is.

321
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:58,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, I think, what's going to be.

322
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:08,741
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're really going to follow the model of VSTA, which is, like I said, it's all meetings, it's all in suites, and they're all basically just one-on-one contact with people.

323
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:11,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some stuff.

324
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:12,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of parties, though.

325
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:14,943
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have parties, so that's good.

326
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,403
[SPEAKER_04]: So there'll be that.

327
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:21,785
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's more or less just one-on-one contact with your key retailers.

328
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:22,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to be honest,

329
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:26,748
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they see things, they're all, well, why should I even bother with the small press?

330
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:36,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it's the big press that gets the most views out there anyways, and they're the ones that have the most influence over what people buy, or, you know, how they feel about our games, so what's it really matter?

331
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:41,179
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they kind of unfortunately view things, and you kind of have to convince them otherwise.

332
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:42,240
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, hey, you know what?

333
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, mom and pop video stores out there may not be a big part of the rental scene, but they're still part of the rental scene, so you better pay attention to them.

334
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:51,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, let's hope

335
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:54,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hope that thought process carries over.

336
00:23:54,745 --> 00:23:55,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We're screwed.

337
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:56,267
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, though.

338
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, let's kind of move on here to kind of another aspect of this, and that would be, of course, with E3 going down, part of what we were talking about last week is who's going to try and rise up and take that big video game showy crown away.

339
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like America's Video Game Expo might be throwing down the gauntlet saying, hey,

340
00:24:18,427 --> 00:24:18,807
[SPEAKER_03]: www.vgexpo.com

341
00:24:48,683 --> 00:24:49,203
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?

342
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:22,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we're going to see more of this where other companies are trying to step up and say, hey, we want to be the new E3?

343
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think this show might be where it's at or what?

344
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:26,827
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an opportunity to capitalize.

345
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:33,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it's like, hey, our one and only competition has decided to do something stupid.

346
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,811
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, decided to do something different.

347
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:38,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to hop in their spot.

348
00:25:38,392 --> 00:25:39,812
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be the big name.

349
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:42,093
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to rise to the occasion.

350
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:43,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's exactly what's going on with that.

351
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:46,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

352
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:47,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

353
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:51,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you guys want to check that out for yourself, www.vgexpo.com.

354
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And I won't be able to make it this year, and I don't think any of us can.

355
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: October?

356
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:55,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe next year.

357
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,080
[SPEAKER_03]: End of October.

358
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:01,842
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is it's the exact same weekend, I think, as the New York City thing I'm doing.

359
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:02,602
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not sure.

360
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm doing Wicon.

361
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the wife would like me flying across country.

362
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:06,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

363
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Philadelphia is a nice place, though.

364
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:08,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been there.

365
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:09,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

366
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:10,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

367
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:11,004
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty.

368
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:19,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to sort of give a little bit better news than the whole bummer E3 business, because everybody has been just buzzing on that.

369
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:34,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Xbox Live Arcade is going to have the PlayStation 1 version of Castlevania Symphony of the Night, known in Japan as Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight, the direct sequel to Dracula X for the PC Engine.

370
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:40,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually makes me incredibly happy, because then I don't have to dust off my PlayStation collection every time I want to play it.

371
00:26:41,104 --> 00:26:44,407
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will be on, they're saying, early next year.

372
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:54,355
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of indication that it will be possibly emulated on the PSP and showing up on Wii's Virtual Console.

373
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,117
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.

374
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be on Wii's Virtual Console.

375
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:01,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the only weird thing about that because it was never on the Nintendo system.

376
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're not saying they're going to do it.

377
00:27:03,197 --> 00:27:08,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just saying that the door is open for that possibility because it's a non-exclusive agreement.

378
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think a lot of people were saying, well, wait a minute.

379
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:17,142
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the whole backwards compatible PS1 on the PSP Ridge Racer type thing that they were touting at Sony?

380
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:18,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this mean that Konami's pulled out of that?

381
00:27:19,423 --> 00:27:20,824
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think it does.

382
00:27:20,884 --> 00:27:21,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it just means...

383
00:27:21,926 --> 00:27:23,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, they're trying to milk this for all it's worth.

384
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:25,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart to me.

385
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:35,731
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also First Quarter 2007 Frogger, Contra, Super Contra, Track and Field, Time Pilot, and Scramble and it's looking like they're the coin-op versions.

386
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Frogger... Oh yeah, I hope they're not releasing another Frogger.

387
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:44,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the old school arcade Frogger.

388
00:27:44,894 --> 00:27:46,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I still can't play if I'm not on roller skates.

389
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:49,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

390
00:27:49,966 --> 00:27:51,788
[SPEAKER_03]: What was I going to say about Castlevania?

391
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:59,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now I think it would be cool if they would unlock some bonus content in the Xbox Live Arcade.

392
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it something that the PlayStation version never had.

393
00:28:01,818 --> 00:28:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Maria?

394
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

395
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:07,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a thought, maybe do it, because in the Saturn version you could play as Maria, right?

396
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:15,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it was actually, she was supposed to be playable in the original release.

397
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,040
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what the Saturn version is, is the finished version.

398
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:25,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Because also, there's a trick that you can do if, when you first run in through the gates in the castle, you jump back up and jump down through this...

399
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:28,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Trapdoor.

400
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:30,711
[SPEAKER_00]: You can knock the trapdoor down.

401
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:35,013
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get in the trapdoor if you get there fast enough, and then it leads you to a save room.

402
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:39,956
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Saturn version, it leads you to a whole new underground conservatory, I think.

403
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:46,459
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was doing a lot of reading that a lot of that... In fact, actually, there's a voice sample.

404
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:57,644
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a viewer... Sorry, a list of something to play the audio files of PlayStation, where it has Maria saying, who would have thought that such a little girl had so much energy when she's possessed by the succubus?

405
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:04,410
[SPEAKER_00]: An ending that was supposed to be in the game, which actually I don't think is in the Saturn one, because I've beaten it with Maria, which is actually kind of hard.

406
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:14,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that would be kind of cool if they would maybe realize that storyline's full potential in this Xbox Live Arcade release, maybe.

407
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:21,634
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I really liked on the Saturn one is that Symphony of the Night is supposed to be a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood.

408
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:33,292
[SPEAKER_00]: and it actually, I think that it would be a really neat thing is that if they can work it out to where they put like Rondo of Blood on the Wii and then have as a special offering Symphony of the Night.

409
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:34,893
[SPEAKER_01]: That would kick ass.

410
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:43,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I do remember that they did a script dump of the PlayStation version of Symphony of the Night and they had the fourth ending to it which was supposedly Maria's ending.

411
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Maria being possessed by the Succubus was one.

412
00:29:45,681 --> 00:29:46,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

413
00:29:47,463 --> 00:29:51,786
[SPEAKER_01]: My only comment is if they re-dub Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live...

414
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:53,007
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to kill it.

415
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:56,788
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole cheesiness of the dub is sort of what sells it.

416
00:29:57,468 --> 00:30:13,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for any of our listeners, if you want to see some of that special stuff that's tucked away, especially the sound files from Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you can go to Castlevania Dungeon and download those as well as see more stuff about the Rondo of Blood in case you

417
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,447
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't lucky enough to have the TurboGrafx version.

418
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:23,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for that text dump that I was talking about, you can find that on the Game Facts page for Sunday Night PlayStation version.

419
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:29,369
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think about the fact that this is really the first game that's going to be a really big game?

420
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:29,809
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

421
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:34,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Not big in the sense... Well, I mean, it is probably, for me, the greatest PlayStation game they ever did.

422
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Epic.

423
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:35,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.

424
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:40,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean big in the sense of this is not just some 80s arcade game ported over.

425
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

426
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:41,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Or this is not some

427
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:45,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Little, Tiny, Cloning Clyde.

428
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:53,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to knock those games, because they're good games, but it's not some little thing that was designed to be a little game, a flash game made big.

429
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:58,140
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really the first CD game now downloadable.

430
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,081
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Holy Grail of Castlevania.

431
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:06,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's one of the Holy Grails of the PlayStation era, and it's this very strange...

432
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:08,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's exciting, but it's kind of weird.

433
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what kind of precedent does this set for future Xbox Live Arcade?

434
00:31:13,762 --> 00:31:14,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's next?

435
00:31:14,823 --> 00:31:16,003
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to see next?

436
00:31:16,284 --> 00:31:16,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

437
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

438
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:21,326
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know there is a lot of stuff coming out.

439
00:31:21,966 --> 00:31:22,467
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely.

440
00:31:23,727 --> 00:31:24,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what?

441
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:32,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, well, definitely, well, one of the things, you know, we had Street Fighter 2 this week, which is one of the best-selling titles on Xbox Live Arcade.

442
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of the fastest games selling right now, even beating out...

443
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:38,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Geometry Wars, Dig Dug, Paperboy, Rally-X

444
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Rootbeer Tapper, Sonic the Hedgehog High Speed, Super Contra, Luminous Alive, Hoop World,

445
00:32:16,932 --> 00:32:18,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Roleplaying Game or something?

446
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Luminous Live will be that new game that on every post Major Nelson makes in his blog, now it'll be Where the Hell is Luminous?

447
00:32:26,015 --> 00:32:29,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it used to be Where the Hell is Street Fighter 2, now it's going to be Where the Hell is Luminous.

448
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

449
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:34,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the other things, though, that are going to be coming out, there's going to be a mini-golf game, which makes me happy.

450
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,019
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty awesome.

451
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:40,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Small Arms is going to be coming out, which is supposed to be just like...

452
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Smash Bros.

453
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:44,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty good.

454
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:47,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Some ones I didn't... Track and Field.

455
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:49,162
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually have Track and Field on here.

456
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:50,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Totem Ball, which we actually saw at E3.

457
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:54,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is kind of weird because it used the live vision camera.

458
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:55,624
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like an eye toy type of thing.

459
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:57,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Texas Hold'em coming out.

460
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.

461
00:33:01,185 --> 00:33:02,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So that should be pretty cool.

462
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so just lots of good stuff.

463
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:10,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely going to be... They're saying that they might even be able to do

464
00:33:11,974 --> 00:33:14,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not excited to watch a Madonna video while I play Luminous.

465
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,109
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, kind of knocking the whole video on the back.

466
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:42,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, can't you turn them off?

467
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn off the videos if you don't like it.

468
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:52,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as we speculated when we first talked about Luminous Live here on the show, a lot of those primo songs will probably be downloadable enhancements.

469
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:57,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, before we get to the next story, tell me if you think this is a crazy idea or not.

470
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: What about an Xbox Live arcade game that could, like, enhance a 360 title?

471
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:05,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo Cardfighter Chunk of a World

472
00:34:26,676 --> 00:34:27,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Chocobo World, Final Fantasy VIII

473
00:34:52,278 --> 00:34:55,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wasn't that what they're planning on doing anyways with Forza?

474
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:56,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Forza 2?

475
00:34:56,321 --> 00:35:02,906
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be able to customize your cars on your Vista PC and use them in Forza 2.

476
00:35:03,306 --> 00:35:03,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true.

477
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:05,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, DJ Kibbles and Bits has a good idea.

478
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:07,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine a Halo that played like Gunstar Heroes.

479
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,151
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they just need Gunstar Heroes live.

480
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:12,872
[SPEAKER_01]: They would wreck that.

481
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:14,353
[SPEAKER_01]: You know they'd wreck that.

482
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:15,234
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad but true.

483
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:16,695
[SPEAKER_01]: They would kill that.

484
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:16,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Well...

485
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,571
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some other good news.

486
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as cool as Gunstar here.

487
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:25,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is pretty cool.

488
00:35:25,652 --> 00:35:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what's that?

489
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:35,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know there was that little law that they passed in Minnesota that said that children can't buy or rent rated M or adult-only games?

490
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's been struck down as unconstitutional, like we all knew it would be.

491
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:44,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I seem to see this as a pattern amongst all these laws that keep getting passed.

492
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:45,435
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep getting struck down.

493
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:47,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they need to realize that...

494
00:35:48,716 --> 00:35:52,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really needs to go, I think, to more federal court.

495
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:57,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I believe that once it's passed three times in federal court, it becomes common law.

496
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, to be honest, I don't remember the exact Latin term that they use in legal circles.

497
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:10,224
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that it has to pass three times in a federal court for it to become a common judgment.

498
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:14,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Where these cases usually end up being thrown out once they try to bring in laws like this.

499
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,070
[SPEAKER_00]: But they should really learn.

500
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:21,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's happened in so many places now where you say, oh, children can't do this.

501
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:27,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, where's the constitutional precedent for you to be able to do that?

502
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:32,934
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they said that basically there was a lack of evidence showing that video game violence was harmful to children.

503
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:39,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was actually overturned.

504
00:36:40,437 --> 00:36:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: To quote also Judge Rosenbaum who overturned it said, Is it impossible to determine from the data presented whether violent video games cause violence or whether violent individuals are attracted to violent video games?

505
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a very good point.

506
00:36:56,087 --> 00:37:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Your general pacifist person isn't necessarily going to be into playing Halo.

507
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:12,880
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have your completely docile person who loves their puzzle games, but I've known people who are calm, collected, cool, who just kick ass on Doom.

508
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always the quiet ones.

509
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:17,623
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always the quiet ones, yeah.

510
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:22,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about our buddy Arcadian42, one of the quietest guys I know.

511
00:37:23,752 --> 00:37:25,553
[SPEAKER_03]: But a real butt kicker on Sega games.

512
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:26,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen to that.

513
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:33,696
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you know, there is something really sad that I've seen pointed out.

514
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:38,218
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, while all of this debate is going on, you know who has to suffer for it?

515
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:39,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxpayers.

516
00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:41,739
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out of their pocket.

517
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,220
[SPEAKER_00]: True.

518
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,822
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how long is it going to be until, you know, the people are going to say, Hey, we're sick of paying for your idiocy.

519
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:50,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't.

520
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:56,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say it's a true statement that video games cause violence in the weak-minded?

521
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:25,143
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that they're the cause, I'm saying it could be an influence, but the weak-minded, you know, need to be... Need to be hugged, or something.

522
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:26,724
[SPEAKER_00]: They need special care.

523
00:38:27,064 --> 00:38:28,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra tender loving care.

524
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you calling me weak-minded?

525
00:38:30,246 --> 00:38:32,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I see these looks going back and forth here.

526
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're talking about me.

527
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:35,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Relax, you're looking at me.

528
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's always the quiet ones.

529
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:40,412
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm far from quiet.

530
00:38:40,805 --> 00:38:45,008
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that, like, I'll go ahead and define it this way.

531
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:52,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a violent video game can be an influence on somebody who does not have a more positive influence otherwise.

532
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:53,714
[SPEAKER_00]: A.K.A.

533
00:38:53,794 --> 00:38:54,575
[SPEAKER_00]: parents who don't do their job.

534
00:38:55,675 --> 00:39:02,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And in your case, Loki, you talk about killing and you talk about how you're going to run everybody over on the road who can't drive.

535
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:08,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, you've done crazy things like, you know, your story about eating the lamb burger and then wiping it off on the lambs.

536
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:09,356
[SPEAKER_03]: That whole thing.

537
00:39:09,636 --> 00:39:14,380
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't actually act out on your murderous things.

538
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're not.

539
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:21,306
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I figure it, if I kill a prostitute in Grand Theft Auto, that's one less prostitute that's on the street.

540
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:25,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I have saved society from that prostitute until she respawns again.

541
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,931
[SPEAKER_04]: In the pixelated world of your PlayStation, yes.

542
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing the greater good, okay?

543
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:37,039
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to give you credit for having the mental fortitude to be able to tell fiction from reality.

544
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you would not be on this program, and neither would he.

545
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:51,516
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, I really think that, you know, when mass media is covering things like, you know, children who play Doom who go out and blow away their school, they really need to look at what type of home life were they living.

546
00:39:51,536 --> 00:39:52,976
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they have chemical imbalances?

547
00:39:53,216 --> 00:39:54,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Did their parents abuse them?

548
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they, you know, what's their major other influences be?

549
00:39:58,238 --> 00:39:58,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they, you know...

550
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:09,196
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't know if I want to go there but take the Columbine thing for instance and how Doom was pretty quick to be blamed for that and then what was it like Marilyn Manson and all that stuff.

551
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:17,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you learned an awful lot about those kids' lives and it just kind of sounded like it wasn't just the game or just the music.

552
00:40:17,941 --> 00:40:21,504
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just something way off balance.

553
00:40:22,184 --> 00:40:24,185
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people like to look for an easy scapegoat.

554
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:26,347
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking for an easy thing to blame.

555
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:31,482
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to be able to point fingers at everything but the true cause of the problem.

556
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:42,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, and I don't want anyone to think that I'm being un-American or anything like that, but it is pretty much a very American thing to do, I've noticed.

557
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:49,888
[SPEAKER_00]: We do hear some of this in a lot of other industrialized countries, but at the same time we hear most of it coming from here, I think.

558
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:54,710
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at least where, in all of my reading, where I've seen a lot of it.

559
00:40:56,408 --> 00:40:57,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame Canada.

560
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:08,990
[SPEAKER_03]: for the children being all foul-mouthed and potty-mouthed.

561
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,270
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's blame Canada.

562
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Canada, for the record.

563
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:24,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a solution that would require a lot of work, but unfortunately people are not willing to put the work into changing themselves because they don't think there's anything wrong with them in particular or anything wrong with how they think.

564
00:41:24,953 --> 00:41:30,554
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think there is a general problem on the issues that people focus on.

565
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,635
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a general lack of accountability here

566
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:37,264
[SPEAKER_00]: and the majority of individuals, I think, over in this country.

567
00:41:38,085 --> 00:41:40,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla says, hey, to cry like a baby and sue everyone.

568
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,648
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the American way.

569
00:41:41,748 --> 00:41:42,649
[SPEAKER_03]: That coming from our chat room.

570
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:43,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Sad but true.

571
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Gorilla also asked the question, what would Brian Boitano do?

572
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:50,094
[SPEAKER_00]: If he were here today, he would kick an ass or two.

573
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's the American way?

574
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,437
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's what Brian Boitano would do.

575
00:41:53,777 --> 00:42:02,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of crying like a baby, one of the people that was sponsoring the Minnesota anti-games bill had some, you know,

576
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:06,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Some very choice words to say about the whole thing.

577
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:11,907
[SPEAKER_04]: And she is sporting a very stupid looking haircut, I might add, by the way.

578
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:22,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, her comment was, and I'm going to quote this in the voice I think would be best suited for her.

579
00:42:22,967 --> 00:42:24,828
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole ruling defied common sense.

580
00:42:24,928 --> 00:42:25,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so disappointed.

581
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:32,192
[SPEAKER_05]: The federal court said we don't have the right to protect our children, but we protect our children from other things.

582
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:35,114
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't let them smoke or buy liquor.

583
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:41,197
[SPEAKER_05]: You score points in video games for how many women you rape and how many cops you kill.

584
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:44,659
[SPEAKER_05]: How could that not affect them psychologically?

585
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, she's a whining bitch.

586
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, but I don't know.

587
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:50,522
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

588
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:55,777
[SPEAKER_04]: These people don't understand why these bills keep getting overturned.

589
00:42:55,817 --> 00:42:57,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because they're not constitutional.

590
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because there's actually no proof that any of this is true.

591
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's great that you're limiting them from buying things that we know can harm them.

592
00:43:10,842 --> 00:43:16,724
[SPEAKER_04]: But things that have been proven or not proven to harm somebody, you can't really protect them from that.

593
00:43:16,944 --> 00:43:17,804
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh well.

594
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:21,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Magus, some thoughts?

595
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:24,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Drew Nami, sorry, some thoughts?

596
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:26,914
[SPEAKER_01]: These people just need to stop already.

597
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:29,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, we can tell the difference.

598
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:41,987
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to protect your kids, you know, the parents need to protect their kids because they may not know any better, but, you know, quit screwing the game buyers in general, giving us a bad name.

599
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:59,271
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were lord and over ruler of the entire world, what would your solution be to this problem of kids play video games and then think it's okay to act that out in real life?

600
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:02,534
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're gonna blame anyone, blame the parents.

601
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Have the parents get sued, not the game companies.

602
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:07,525
[SPEAKER_01]: What if the parents get sued for the damages?

603
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:10,046
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their responsibility.

604
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:11,667
[SPEAKER_00]: It is their responsibility.

605
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:19,009
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the companies do have a right of responsibility in advertising, making sure that the information is fully out there.

606
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:22,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there are cases of misrepresentation.

607
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,511
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cases where the parents do not choose to be properly informed.

608
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.

609
00:44:27,571 --> 00:44:29,432
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a rating system set up already.

610
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:30,212
[SPEAKER_03]: But hold on, hold on.

611
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:33,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't help but think about those episodes of Maury Povich where I'm seeing the...

612
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:38,376
[SPEAKER_03]: The old moms that are on there with like the crazy ass kids, you know.

613
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:39,437
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones really deformed?

614
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,018
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

615
00:44:41,058 --> 00:44:43,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about like, you know, the, I can't control my daughter.

616
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,124
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants to dress like a hoe and she beats up everybody in school.

617
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:49,605
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your fault, you stupid dick.

618
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:50,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

619
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:53,087
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the people I'm beating up in Grand Theft Auto.

620
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:53,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that.

621
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: What about those kids that are past the point of no return?

622
00:44:57,351 --> 00:45:03,676
[SPEAKER_00]: To start it this way, you do have to look in the origin of how a child...

623
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:15,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I do believe that children are born with a certain genetic predisposition towards some behaviors, I do also think that a lot of behaviors are learned if you do not start from infancy.

624
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:23,702
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing them for, you know, living a responsible adult life, then they're not going to be that way.

625
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:35,588
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start off with showing proper discipline, with not letting them walk all over you, first of all, because, I mean, if the kids get, honestly, and I was like this when I was a kid, if you give an inch, they'll take a mile.

626
00:45:35,828 --> 00:45:42,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I honestly look at a lot of the more well-adjusted ones, the ones who don't need as much supervision,

627
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you see the type of encouraging, responsible lifestyle that most of my friends who are more well-adjusted have grown up in, however, if there is a degree of, for lack of a better description, mental disturbance,

628
00:46:00,442 --> 00:46:03,943
[SPEAKER_00]: There are treatments available, you just have to be willing to offer it.

629
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an interesting quote in our chatroom, and let me get your guys' reaction to this, and then we need to move on.

630
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:17,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonathan F. in our chatroom over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat, says, Companies should put a notice at every game startup to say that they are not responsible for the actions of its players.

631
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:19,948
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think of that comment?

632
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:21,189
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.

633
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:22,189
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a smart move.

634
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:24,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

635
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,499
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting idea.

636
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it's a bad idea.

637
00:46:30,264 --> 00:46:31,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they have to?

638
00:46:31,286 --> 00:46:32,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the printing on the box.

639
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:32,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchase of this game.

640
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:38,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think about those commercials.

641
00:46:38,564 --> 00:46:43,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, you see the commercials on TV where it's like, you know, the driving around and doing the stunts.

642
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:44,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does it always say at the bottom?

643
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:46,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not attempt at home.

644
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:47,888
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking driving around a professional course.

645
00:46:48,048 --> 00:46:48,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Duh.

646
00:46:48,668 --> 00:46:49,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?

647
00:46:49,368 --> 00:46:50,769
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to because of lawsuits.

648
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:55,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why Jackass, in front of every single show and the movie and the trailer, they have to put, you know.

649
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:57,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try this at home.

650
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,433
[SPEAKER_04]: We're professionals.

651
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:01,356
[SPEAKER_04]: If you try this, you're going to get hurt and possibly kill yourself.

652
00:47:01,716 --> 00:47:03,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not responsible for any injury.

653
00:47:03,798 --> 00:47:09,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, people in the Sue Happy world that we're in, we have to remind them of the stupid things out there.

654
00:47:09,262 --> 00:47:09,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

655
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:10,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire hot.

656
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:12,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Ice cold.

657
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:13,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Car dangerous.

658
00:47:13,806 --> 00:47:15,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just stupid shit like that.

659
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

660
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:19,971
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how dumb America is.

661
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more thought, Drew Nami.

662
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:24,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you know how we have those disclaimers?

663
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:26,442
[SPEAKER_01]: People who've played MMOs get the disclaimers.

664
00:47:26,702 --> 00:47:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole ESRB disclaimer.

665
00:47:29,603 --> 00:47:31,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Game experience may change during online play.

666
00:47:32,324 --> 00:47:35,985
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, you know, the company is not responsible for its player base.

667
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,486
[SPEAKER_01]: The player base is responsible for the player base.

668
00:47:39,267 --> 00:47:43,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hope game experience changes in online play because I play as a woman in MMOs.

669
00:47:44,449 --> 00:47:45,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, more free stuff.

670
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:47,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your problem, Rob.

671
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:48,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway.

672
00:47:48,663 --> 00:47:49,163
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

673
00:48:13,496 --> 00:48:18,479
[SPEAKER_03]: When we heard about the whole, you know, video games cause teen pregnancy, I was serious when I said that.

674
00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:19,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

675
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:29,345
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an opinion piece that was on CantonRep.com that was addressing the high pregnancy rates in students at this particular high school, Timken High School.

676
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:34,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what it does is it places blame on all sorts of things.

677
00:48:34,128 --> 00:48:35,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says here, here's a quote.

678
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:36,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Whose fault is it?

679
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,470
[SPEAKER_03]: That more than 13% of Tim Kim's girls are with child.

680
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:45,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Some would say fault finding isn't a fruitful exercise, but in this case it's critical.

681
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:51,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Suspects range from movies, TV, and video games to lazy parents and lax discipline.

682
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one thing is sure, schools don't impregnate children.

683
00:48:55,097 --> 00:48:56,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to point out, by the way...

684
00:48:57,523 --> 00:49:03,470
[SPEAKER_03]: The article said nothing about sex ed, birth control, education, or anything like that.

685
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:08,456
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did know somebody in Alabama who conceived her baby in the bathroom at my high school.

686
00:49:09,637 --> 00:49:10,839
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy shit.

687
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:11,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

688
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,243
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, you... school...

689
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:16,119
[SPEAKER_03]: and directly.

690
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:31,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my thought is though, how did somebody get the notion, and I think the reason why this got picked up by some of the game blogs this week and why we're reporting on it now, how did somebody get the notion that video games cause pregnancy?

691
00:49:31,826 --> 00:49:40,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't know about you, but video games is usually an experience by yourself, unless it's Mario Party, something like that, Lamb Party.

692
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And last time I checked, masturbation won't make you pregnant.

693
00:49:44,608 --> 00:49:49,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about Rez.

694
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:52,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to say what just popped into my head.

695
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:54,735
[SPEAKER_04]: What popped into your head?

696
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:55,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

697
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:58,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Transcontroller Turkey Baster.

698
00:50:00,379 --> 00:50:03,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, why was she looking at me when she said it?

699
00:50:03,861 --> 00:50:04,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't looking at you.

700
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:08,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.

701
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:09,605
[SPEAKER_00]: You're frightening me now.

702
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the new hair.

703
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:14,560
[SPEAKER_04]: She's made you a sexy beast.

704
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:23,286
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all those chicks out there, they get totally hot and bothered when they see pixelated people having sex in games or pixelated nipples and stuff.

705
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your wife.

706
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:28,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, she totally gets hot and bothered by all that shit.

707
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,811
[SPEAKER_04]: She has to jump on the cock right there.

708
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:31,112
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

709
00:50:31,513 --> 00:50:32,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Sex is overrated.

710
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I'm being sarcastic here, obviously.

711
00:50:39,128 --> 00:50:47,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people just need to, you know, realize that there's stuff other than sex to be interested in and, like, stop blaming video games when people decide to be horny bitches.

712
00:50:47,317 --> 00:50:50,440
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, video games are responsible for every other of society's ills.

713
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not blame them for this?

714
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:52,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Rich Richard taught me how to drive.

715
00:50:54,446 --> 00:50:55,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a friendly reminder, boys and girls.

716
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:59,089
[SPEAKER_03]: The following program is intended for mature audiences.

717
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me basically say something here.

718
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:09,434
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've ever talked to any girlfriend out there that has her boyfriend who's playing video games, what's the biggest complaint?

719
00:51:09,514 --> 00:51:10,575
[SPEAKER_04]: He plays the video games!

720
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:11,615
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't pay attention to me!

721
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:18,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, if anything, that video games, TV, and movies reduce the amount of sex that you have

722
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:22,191
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than, you know, increase anything.

723
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:31,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I can tell you this much, if there's a guy watching TV or football or something like that and this woman's trying to get up on him, he's like, excuse me, hun, I'm trying to watch the TV, you know, move over.

724
00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:32,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's kind of what it is.

725
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,700
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of what Pooeater's saying in chat.

726
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,382
[SPEAKER_03]: He said this right before you said that, Loki.

727
00:51:36,442 --> 00:51:38,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Video games stop teen sex.

728
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:40,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold up, baby, I gotta pwn this noob.

729
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:40,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop touching me!

730
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:49,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a G4 vodcast with a fake commercial touting World of Warcraft as a birth control method.

731
00:51:52,262 --> 00:51:53,142
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is basically it.

732
00:51:53,162 --> 00:51:55,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, something funny actually came from a G4 vodcast?

733
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:56,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

734
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:57,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, amazing.

735
00:51:58,984 --> 00:51:59,884
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, new and exciting.

736
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:03,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, any other thoughts on the games and teen pregnancy?

737
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:06,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, guess how many pregnant teens said the same thing?

738
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:09,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would like to hear from a pregnant teen.

739
00:52:10,087 --> 00:52:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to hear from anyone.

740
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:12,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

741
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:14,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Did the video game cause you to get pregnant?

742
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:15,528
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, how?

743
00:52:15,648 --> 00:52:16,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But please don't go into graphic detail.

744
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:18,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we know how birds and bees work, okay?

745
00:52:18,829 --> 00:52:19,489
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got nine months.

746
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:19,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.

747
00:52:22,082 --> 00:52:22,362
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

748
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:31,664
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all these stories about the, you know, video game bills and the people saying video games cause pregnancy, it makes me a little angsty.

749
00:52:31,684 --> 00:52:33,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it make you angsty, DarkSakura?

750
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:34,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always angsty.

751
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:35,265
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?

752
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:41,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you know what it means that it's time for a particular segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio that we have to do every single week, right?

753
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:43,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we do.

754
00:52:56,934 --> 00:53:03,977
[SPEAKER_00]: My FU of the week goes toward the traffic from, uh, I'd have to say Vacaville to Davis.

755
00:53:05,297 --> 00:53:14,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been going to the Bay Area like every weekend now and coming back, but, um, it was really stupid and I thought it was maybe a car accident because, you know, people are retarded.

756
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:20,023
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to look at the car crashy and see the pretty lights go in the air.

757
00:53:20,803 --> 00:53:24,825
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just so many stupid people and the SUV drivers, oh my god.

758
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:28,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not buy an SUV unless you live in the boonies.

759
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:29,710
[SPEAKER_00]: The end.

760
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks, bye.

761
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:31,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

762
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:42,293
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to the illegal immigrants that were carrying down the shed that's next to my apartment at 7.30 in the morning on Saturday because they didn't want to work late that day.

763
00:53:43,093 --> 00:53:45,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, yeah, I don't know.

764
00:53:45,274 --> 00:53:49,055
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really annoying to complain to my apartment complex and they didn't really give a shit.

765
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:51,836
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, the shed's been sitting here.

766
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:53,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They had it, like, framed the

767
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,541
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to staying in a hotel.

768
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: A hotel is my least favorite place to stay, period.

769
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these idiot people one floor down.

770
00:54:21,362 --> 00:54:27,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I so much as drop a water bottle, they make a call up to the front desk, and they threaten to check us out.

771
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,365
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't throw us out, but they can check us out.

772
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:37,268
[SPEAKER_01]: And the AC doesn't work right, although it's a welcome change from the house.

773
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:39,269
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beds suck.

774
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:41,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, F you to hotels.

775
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn to make a comfy hotel, and maybe I'll stay there.

776
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to give an F you to downtown San Francisco for smelling like pee.

777
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen!

778
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:53,561
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

779
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:55,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I second that one, Rob.

780
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, back to the news.

781
00:55:01,344 --> 00:55:03,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the mic there, Magus.

782
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:04,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

783
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:06,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should call him Magnami.

784
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:14,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to really quickly clarify something in the chatroom because they're saying I said legal immigrants and that's maybe racist of me.

785
00:55:15,031 --> 00:55:21,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they had their 10-year-old son working on the job at the same time with these other people, so I don't think that's legal.

786
00:55:22,054 --> 00:55:22,294
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

787
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:25,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe you have to be at least 15 in the state for a work permit.

788
00:55:25,495 --> 00:55:28,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, child labor laws and such.

789
00:55:28,837 --> 00:55:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking of illegal things, Nintendo and Microsoft are being sued over controller patents, and they're being sued by this company called Aniscape, who apparently has patents on

790
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:50,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Such things as remote controller with analog button, 3D controller with vibration, and game controller with analog pressure sensors, among other things.

791
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:55,405
[SPEAKER_04]: What's funny, though, is this company, Anescape, hasn't made anything.

792
00:55:55,645 --> 00:56:00,166
[SPEAKER_04]: They just hold patents for a ton of shit, which is excellent.

793
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And the kind of speculation around this is that this company, Anescape, is actually a company made to...

794
00:56:09,685 --> 00:56:11,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, sue people.

795
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:17,733
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's funny is, there was a comment by one of the people on Kotaku, which this story ran on.

796
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:21,559
[SPEAKER_04]: by this guy named Baboon, and I think he sums it up pretty good.

797
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, given that Nintendo 64 had an analog stick in 1996, and a patent describing it in 1999 won't be upheld in court, as to why Aniscape isn't suing Sony, this might have something to do with who owns Aniscape.

798
00:56:34,348 --> 00:56:37,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a quick Google search and you'll get nothing but patent applications.

799
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:43,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's quite likely Aniscape is nothing but a shell company created to litigate

800
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:47,818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

801
00:57:11,957 --> 00:57:14,379
[SPEAKER_04]: is just to not make any product at all.

802
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:25,926
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't do anything other than patent stuff, you can't be breaking anyone else's patents, and chances are you'll be able to reach a settlement that gets you mucho dinero.

803
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:28,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting comments from our chat room here.

804
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks kind of feel the same way, that probably this company is just set up to sue people.

805
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Eddie in chat says, these companies survive on lawsuits.

806
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:38,594
[SPEAKER_03]: VXJasonXV says, I hate patent sporgers.

807
00:57:39,702 --> 00:57:41,864
[SPEAKER_03]: and VidPal, it kind of sums up my thoughts on this.

808
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:45,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Geez, how many more no-name companies have patents for vibrating controllers?

809
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:47,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't we kind of already go here already?

810
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and here's the other thing too.

811
00:57:49,348 --> 00:57:49,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Why now?

812
00:57:50,069 --> 00:58:04,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Why, you know, if you've held this patent since 1999, why when, you know, the original Nintendo 64, you know, came out or whatever, or when the PlayStation came out, why are you waiting until like five generations down the road before you start suing?

813
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:06,560
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of fishy part about it.

814
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:06,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

815
00:58:07,498 --> 00:58:21,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, the whole thing, like if Konami didn't sue Roxor over DDR, if they let it go and stuff after a long time, then it almost seems like there's nothing they should be able to do about it, you know, because you've allowed it to happen.

816
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of protecting your own asses.

817
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:23,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Assets.

818
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:26,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I get it.

819
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,396
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, interesting.

820
00:58:28,437 --> 00:58:29,497
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll see what happens.

821
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:30,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a comment on this?

822
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing.

823
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

824
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:33,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Well...

825
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:42,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Nintendo, there's actually going to be some Wii news breaking in Leipzig on August 23rd.

826
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:50,031
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a keynote at the games convention that should last for about an hour called Wii Prove Our Promise.

827
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:51,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Pun.

828
00:58:52,332 --> 00:58:53,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of more puns.

829
00:58:53,392 --> 00:58:55,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad even they can make fun of their own name.

830
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:02,835
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a plan to show five new Wii games during that event.

831
00:59:04,747 --> 00:59:08,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish we knew what games, but I guess that's part of the secret.

832
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:09,269
[SPEAKER_00]: We will wait and see.

833
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,310
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fired.

834
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:13,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not sponsoring these jokes, I swear.

835
00:59:13,612 --> 00:59:14,312
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fired, too.

836
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:19,334
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

837
00:59:19,414 --> 00:59:24,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think this is where we're going to finally find out, okay, here's the date it's coming out, here's the price, all that good stuff?

838
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:27,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because they're not at Tokyo Game Show.

839
00:59:27,218 --> 00:59:29,119
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not doing Space World this year.

840
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the last big convention before the launch.

841
00:59:32,691 --> 00:59:34,994
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought we weren't supposed to hear until September.

842
00:59:35,955 --> 00:59:37,356
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a goddamn week from September.

843
00:59:37,457 --> 00:59:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Close enough.

844
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just thought I'd get that in there.

845
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, okay, we're a little early.

846
00:59:42,843 --> 00:59:43,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So sue us.

847
00:59:43,443 --> 00:59:45,386
[SPEAKER_00]: We're Nintendo, we can do what we want.

848
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I must express, previously on the program, I had a little bit of disappointment that Mortal Kombat Armageddon was only coming out for current-gen consoles.

849
00:59:54,282 --> 01:00:02,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only coming out for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but actually there's been news this week that it is actually coming out for the Nintendo Wii.

850
01:00:02,324 --> 01:00:09,326
[SPEAKER_03]: No word on how it's going to take advantage of the Wii's control scheme, but this would be one more title that's going to be coming out.

851
01:00:09,987 --> 01:00:11,287
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a quote from the publisher.

852
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:24,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Our Chicago studio, under the direction of Ed Boon, has been working extremely hard to make Armageddon stand out in a big way with the inclusion of the entire Mortal Kombat character lineup, the Motor Kombat minigame, which, by the way, is supposed to be like Mario Kart.

853
01:00:24,724 --> 01:00:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks awesome.

854
01:00:25,364 --> 01:00:26,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great.

855
01:00:26,844 --> 01:00:29,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of wish it was next-gen, but whatever.

856
01:00:29,405 --> 01:00:35,426
[SPEAKER_03]: A new conquest mode and several other innovative gameplay additions that help keep the franchise at the top of its genre.

857
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:40,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We're confident that Wii fans will truly appreciate the finished product when it's ready to hit store shelves.

858
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:43,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You hear it's also being packaged with Mortal Kombat 3.

859
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:44,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

860
01:00:45,024 --> 01:00:54,426
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, but see, the only downside to this news, I think, for Midway, is that, at least for me, I was going to pick this up, even if it is on current gen, I was going to pick it up, but now, I'm going to wait.

861
01:00:54,627 --> 01:00:58,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to wait and get the one on the Wii, because I just have this feeling that there'll be something extra there, you know?

862
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright, they're both coming out in October anyways.

863
01:01:00,268 --> 01:01:07,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe that one, but they're saying that Armageddon probably won't be out until early 2007, or do you think there's something...

864
01:01:09,362 --> 01:01:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

865
01:01:09,862 --> 01:01:12,603
[SPEAKER_03]: The GameCube one was delayed.

866
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this one, but the last one.

867
01:01:15,183 --> 01:01:15,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Deception?

868
01:01:16,284 --> 01:01:19,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Deception was delayed on GameCube.

869
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:20,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

870
01:01:21,085 --> 01:01:21,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

871
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:27,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a little bit more Wii news.

872
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:29,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Wii bits of news.

873
01:01:30,507 --> 01:01:37,468
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like Ubi's going to be releasing seven Wii launch titles.

874
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:39,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks.

875
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they say what titles?

876
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:44,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a list.

877
01:01:45,626 --> 01:01:55,591
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Far Cry, GT Pro Series, Open Season, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, Rayman Raving Rabbids, and Red Steel.

878
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:56,672
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the list.

879
01:01:57,152 --> 01:01:59,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And Blazing Angels?

880
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was also on the list too.

881
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's going to be awesome.

882
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:03,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

883
01:02:05,327 --> 01:02:06,669
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all going to come out launch?

884
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,014
[SPEAKER_03]: When they say launch, does that mean first quarter?

885
01:02:09,054 --> 01:02:10,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean the day the Wii's on the shelves?

886
01:02:10,877 --> 01:02:11,779
[SPEAKER_03]: All these games are going to hit?

887
01:02:11,919 --> 01:02:12,260
[SPEAKER_03]: They have.

888
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't I make some bet on the show that there weren't going to be more than 20 games when the system comes out?

889
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:19,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that bet's been... Yes, you did.

890
01:02:19,472 --> 01:02:20,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I might be in trouble.

891
01:02:20,512 --> 01:02:21,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you owe some money to somebody.

892
01:02:21,932 --> 01:02:23,913
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it was something to do with pudding or something.

893
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,234
[SPEAKER_03]: But wait, wasn't... $250.

894
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:30,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the deal was it had to be first party games.

895
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:34,076
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have to go back and find the show where I made the bet because I think it was 20 first party games.

896
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're getting pretty close.

897
01:02:36,096 --> 01:02:37,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I'm starting to worry.

898
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:41,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure some listener's been keeping track of that.

899
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:43,016
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

900
01:03:12,094 --> 01:03:13,635
[SPEAKER_04]: But it should be interesting.

901
01:03:13,675 --> 01:03:14,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

902
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:16,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Prince of Persia had a lot of swinging around.

903
01:03:16,456 --> 01:03:17,937
[SPEAKER_03]: How about old school Prince of Persia?

904
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:20,358
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where I actually swing my sword, you know?

905
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:21,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

906
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:21,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

907
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:22,639
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be pretty cool.

908
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:24,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a hidden game.

909
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

910
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to mention real quick another title that we had coming out, which I'm sure you'll be reading about on all the major press sites later on this week, as the trend seems to be.

911
01:03:35,885 --> 01:03:40,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'm not sure if you're a big fan of fishing out there, but Rapala Pro...

912
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,570
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

913
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:46,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Trophies is going to be coming out on the Wii and on the Xbox 360.

914
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:55,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, slated sort of in October, but we'll have to wait and see to see when the actual games come out.

915
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,323
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is one title that you can look for so you can get your fishing on, your Wiimote fishing.

916
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:04,913
[SPEAKER_03]: The chat room is commenting on the pudding thing.

917
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not dance naked and pudding.

918
01:04:07,435 --> 01:04:08,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That would not happen on air.

919
01:04:08,616 --> 01:04:11,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not subject Loki and DarkSakura to that.

920
01:04:11,758 --> 01:04:13,979
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was $250 worth of pudding.

921
01:04:14,359 --> 01:04:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not that either.

922
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something about a whole six-pack of pudding rubbing it on my chest or something live on air.

923
01:04:20,804 --> 01:04:22,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where that came from, but that was the bet.

924
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Remind me not to be here for that show.

925
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:27,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks are saying it was first party.

926
01:04:27,048 --> 01:04:28,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks are saying it wasn't.

927
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go back and dig up that show and figure it out.

928
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:33,219
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

929
01:04:35,301 --> 01:04:37,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to mention this, though, regarding the price of the Wii.

930
01:04:37,802 --> 01:04:42,205
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, $250 a pudding, most people would say, could also buy you a Wii.

931
01:04:42,265 --> 01:04:48,209
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there's a possible leak to the price of the Wii, and it's coming through the most oddest of places.

932
01:04:48,229 --> 01:04:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-Eleven.

933
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:57,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, they're not going to be selling the Wii console, but they're giving away some prizes, and some of them are going to include Wii consoles.

934
01:04:57,675 --> 01:04:58,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now, here's the deal.

935
01:04:59,389 --> 01:04:59,729
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

936
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:29,575
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe it's because the cost of shipping is included there and who knows what else.

937
01:05:30,456 --> 01:05:35,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think this is not the telltale and I'll be all signed of the Wii's price.

938
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:37,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see.

939
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, 7-Eleven?

940
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

941
01:05:40,981 --> 01:05:44,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't believe 7-Eleven would be the place that would announce that either.

942
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:49,365
[SPEAKER_03]: 7-Eleven probably has no guests just like the rest of us do.

943
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:53,645
[SPEAKER_03]: DMN in the chatroom says it's approximate retail value, Rob.

944
01:05:53,845 --> 01:05:54,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's correct.

945
01:05:54,946 --> 01:05:56,527
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the approximate retail value.

946
01:05:57,448 --> 01:05:57,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

947
01:05:57,909 --> 01:05:59,090
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making an educated guess.

948
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,211
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

949
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:02,012
[SPEAKER_00]: Educated or edumacated?

950
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:03,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably a little of both.

951
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:08,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have something that isn't an estimation.

952
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:10,280
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actual release dates in the UK.

953
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,381
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

954
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:13,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Our UK friends and pals, what are they getting?

955
01:06:14,852 --> 01:06:43,799
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few releases coming out on the 11th is Dark Star 1 for PC Panzer Elite Action for Xbox and Siphon Filter Dark Mirror on PSP so other things to look forward to coming up though is on the 25th Dig Dug Digging Strike Reservoir Dogs on the 25th that I think would be fairly interesting and there's a few really good ones coming out next month too because they get Dance Factory and Star Fox Command

956
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:48,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry.

957
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:53,838
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also some cool, well, not too much coming out in the U.S., but some good stuff, though.

958
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:56,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's start with the Game Boy Advance.

959
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:57,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Games Explosion, which is coming out.

960
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:00,081
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to be a collection of, like, card games and stuff.

961
01:07:00,421 --> 01:07:01,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

962
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:03,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

963
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:09,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Robot Tyson, original generation, which is supposed to be, like, a robot fighting game.

964
01:07:10,465 --> 01:07:11,505
[SPEAKER_04]: More of a strategy fighting game.

965
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:16,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, on the PC, a bunch of no-name stuff.

966
01:07:17,148 --> 01:07:19,809
[SPEAKER_04]: My favorite one on this list, though, is Pony Love.

967
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:22,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope that's not what I think it is.

968
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:28,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so on PlayStation 2... Maybe it's a game for little girls who have My Little Ponies.

969
01:07:28,371 --> 01:07:32,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're taking it and making it this sick, perverse thing that it doesn't have to be.

970
01:07:33,873 --> 01:07:34,373
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be.

971
01:07:34,873 --> 01:07:39,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, D1 Grand Prix is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, the official drift racing game.

972
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:43,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirates of the Legend of the Black Buccaneer is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2 as well.

973
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:44,416
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course...

974
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:50,625
[SPEAKER_04]: The best game of the week, Dead Rising on 360, which I will end up having a review for next week.

975
01:08:05,856 --> 01:08:06,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

976
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:06,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Rampage?

977
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah!

978
01:08:09,317 --> 01:08:13,499
[SPEAKER_03]: That hit all those blogs this week and I'm thinking, didn't we cover that like two weeks ago on the program?

979
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:18,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the story you're going to hear about in two weeks everywhere else.

980
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly folks.

981
01:08:19,082 --> 01:08:32,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, well this is going to have to do with some wonderful Take-Two games and the Take-Two games I'm talking about of course are Darkness and Bioshock which are going to be coming out actually next year, 2007.

982
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: on around April 5th.

983
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:38,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So check those out.

984
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:40,118
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be pretty cool.

985
01:08:40,498 --> 01:08:49,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, for you music gaming fans, I'll have you know that we have the date now for Guitar Hero 2, which is going to be coming out on November 8th.

986
01:08:50,748 --> 01:08:52,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Project Gotham Racing 3 Cameo, Perfect Dark Zero,

987
01:09:12,811 --> 01:09:15,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all retail for $29.99 As of now?

988
01:09:15,935 --> 01:09:19,340
[SPEAKER_04]: As of last week, about Wednesday Really?

989
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:23,005
[SPEAKER_03]: But why didn't, if that's the case, if they dropped on Wednesday, why hasn't anyone else picked this up yet?

990
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:27,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm smooth like that Okay, I hope you're right

991
01:09:28,755 --> 01:09:34,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, regardless, October and November are getting to be huge, huge release months, which is typical.

992
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:36,718
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got a lot of big titles coming out in October.

993
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:39,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hell, the Wii might be coming out in October, so we're still pretty convinced.

994
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got September, just tons and tons.

995
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:44,460
[SPEAKER_03]: September's not too bad.

996
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, November.

997
01:09:45,561 --> 01:09:47,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Tons and tons and tons of stuff.

998
01:09:48,182 --> 01:09:48,982
[SPEAKER_03]: November's pre-packed.

999
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gearing up, folks.

1000
01:09:50,162 --> 01:09:53,343
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting closer and closer to some busy, busy, busy time for gaming.

1001
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:59,436
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that won't be busy though much longer are some of EA's servers.

1002
01:09:59,876 --> 01:10:03,117
[SPEAKER_03]: They're shutting down the servers for some of the old games.

1003
01:10:03,717 --> 01:10:09,720
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good news is though it's mostly sports titles and I'm not trying to rub it in the sports fans' faces.

1004
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:11,691
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1005
01:10:38,528 --> 01:10:47,694
[SPEAKER_03]: NCAA Football 2005, NHL 2005, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005, and UEFA Champions League 2004-2005.

1006
01:10:48,074 --> 01:10:51,076
[SPEAKER_03]: All those games are getting shut off pretty soon.

1007
01:10:51,176 --> 01:10:59,421
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, on October 1st, 2006, Madden 2005 is going to be closing as well as NFL Street 2 Unleashed.

1008
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:01,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I should also mention one big title I left out there.

1009
01:11:01,943 --> 01:11:06,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Need for Speed Underground 2 has also had their servers shut down.

1010
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:12,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a fan of playing those older games, unfortunately, time to upgrade to the newer games.

1011
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:19,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be really honest, I don't think anyone's playing those games online anymore.

1012
01:11:19,343 --> 01:11:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if you've ever tried to go play some older games on multiplayer and stuff.

1013
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:25,387
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one on.

1014
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:27,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it's probably not going to be missed.

1015
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:37,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you know there's a couple people that are holding out, that are holding on to those titles, and the one or two people that are still playing them, they're going to be pissed.

1016
01:11:38,195 --> 01:11:39,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Write us angry emails, I don't know.

1017
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:40,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1018
01:11:43,978 --> 01:11:49,901
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of some hate going around, which is sad, apparently LocoRoco sucks in Japan.

1019
01:11:51,322 --> 01:11:54,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, LocoRoco is biting the big one.

1020
01:11:54,664 --> 01:11:55,364
[SPEAKER_04]: No one likes it.

1021
01:11:56,925 --> 01:11:58,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they actually...

1022
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:01,849
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, advertise the hell out of this game.

1023
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony thought it was going to be really cool.

1024
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Their website was really cool.

1025
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:12,855
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, when it went on sale on July 13th, it sort of was like, eh.

1026
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:16,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the critics were saying that it wasn't huge.

1027
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:18,758
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hitting bargain bins already.

1028
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:21,860
[SPEAKER_00]: They packaged it with PSPs.

1029
01:12:22,961 --> 01:12:25,022
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it wasn't what they thought it was going to be.

1030
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,343
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was going to be the next Katamari Damacy, and it wasn't.

1031
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's because they tried too hard?

1032
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:34,235
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is that they didn't try to make Katamari Damashii a success.

1033
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it almost seems like they wrote that title off because it was a 1999 release.

1034
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:42,901
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just released under the table, practically, and became something huge.

1035
01:12:43,161 --> 01:12:48,025
[SPEAKER_03]: But LocoRoco, especially in Japan, they really pushed to try and make it the next Katamari.

1036
01:12:48,065 --> 01:12:50,367
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I like the call of the snakes on a plane syndrome.

1037
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:52,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't force something to be a cult title.

1038
01:12:53,049 --> 01:12:56,171
[SPEAKER_04]: You release it, and people like it, then it becomes a cult title.

1039
01:12:56,551 --> 01:13:00,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even the critics were saying that they should have let it go as a sleeper.

1040
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:02,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it sneak out into the market.

1041
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,935
[SPEAKER_00]: People go, oh, look where it go.

1042
01:13:05,695 --> 01:13:14,979
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I honestly, I hope that, you know, they actually look at that tactic for, you know, a release over here.

1043
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think it really...

1044
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1045
01:13:31,912 --> 01:13:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a fun demo and stuff, but you know what?

1046
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:44,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to keep me interested as long as, say, Scarface, which is coming out later that month, or Godfather, which is also coming out later that month.

1047
01:13:44,416 --> 01:13:49,417
[SPEAKER_00]: However, depending on what you're into, I sat with LocoRoco with the demo for an hour screaming at it.

1048
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:57,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they also have Capcom Puzzle World coming out in September as well, the same time around as local Rokos.

1049
01:13:57,970 --> 01:13:58,391
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1050
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:01,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I played the demo at E3 and I wasn't feeling it.

1051
01:14:02,209 --> 01:14:03,451
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going to get LocoRoco.

1052
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1053
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,153
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, LocoRoco was cool.

1054
01:14:06,173 --> 01:14:07,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about Capcom Puzzle World.

1055
01:14:07,615 --> 01:14:09,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm burnt out on Puzzle Fighter.

1056
01:14:09,196 --> 01:14:13,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really close to importing it, and if it's as cheap as all that, I'm going to wait for the U.S.

1057
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:16,123
[SPEAKER_00]: release, but I'm thinking that we're going to see the Japanese release.

1058
01:14:16,523 --> 01:14:18,986
[SPEAKER_00]: For all you import crazy people, we're going to see it drop.

1059
01:14:19,086 --> 01:14:19,947
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my speculation.

1060
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:20,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

1061
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:26,571
[SPEAKER_03]: In our chatroom, just real quick, VidPower seems to think it seems like everything nowadays is trying to be the next Katamari Damacy.

1062
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:32,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe from Blaze's comment here in our chatroom, he thinks Elite Beat Agents could be the next sleeper hit.

1063
01:14:32,615 --> 01:14:33,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1064
01:14:33,216 --> 01:14:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy Todd 1 points out something good that LocoRoco might not have also sold because the PSP didn't do so well in Japan.

1065
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it did better over there than it did over here, but I don't know.

1066
01:14:42,962 --> 01:14:44,503
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP was doing pretty good over there.

1067
01:14:44,603 --> 01:14:45,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It seemed like it was doing okay over there.

1068
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:48,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the sales were what they speculated them to be.

1069
01:14:48,974 --> 01:14:52,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It was getting beat down majorly by the DS, but it was still doing good.

1070
01:14:52,899 --> 01:14:58,807
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS Lite had the craziness factor around it, whereas the PSP had a, you know, brisk sales factor around it.

1071
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:03,213
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the DS, basically, especially in mind for the Japanese audience...

1072
01:15:03,809 --> 01:15:08,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it really did cater more toward what is typically a more popular item.

1073
01:15:09,232 --> 01:15:17,516
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something that may not be the most powerful thing, but it's cute, it's, you know, it's compact, it's easy to use, it's versatile.

1074
01:15:19,197 --> 01:15:20,278
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new, it's innovative.

1075
01:15:20,398 --> 01:15:24,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that, right, and what, what are you going by now?

1076
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Drew Nami?

1077
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:29,262
[SPEAKER_00]: What he said was, you know, that it's the new thing.

1078
01:15:29,802 --> 01:15:31,023
[SPEAKER_00]: People, it's innovative.

1079
01:15:31,723 --> 01:15:32,324
[SPEAKER_00]: People jump on it.

1080
01:15:32,584 --> 01:15:32,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

1081
01:15:33,206 --> 01:15:34,768
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1082
01:15:50,683 --> 01:16:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: West Yorkshire Police Federation Chairman Tom McGee called the game a sickening glorification of violence against police officers and says it's impossible to see how such a game can have anything other than a highly damaging effect on how people perceive and react to police officers.

1083
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:17,877
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problem is it's a game and people understand for the most part, at least I assume in the UK more than the US that the game is

1084
01:16:18,547 --> 01:16:20,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantasy, and not reality.

1085
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:30,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so, they didn't really want it banned, they just wanted to basically kind of, um, they were gonna make it unrated, just because it was so violent.

1086
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much what it was.

1087
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,562
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just because the game's so freaking bloody, and awesome!

1088
01:16:34,762 --> 01:16:35,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Bloody awesome!

1089
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:40,808
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, that's why they wanted to give it an unrated rating on it.

1090
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:47,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, ironically, the Reservoir Dogs movie is still being sold in the UK.

1091
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

1092
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:51,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm, I say.

1093
01:16:51,801 --> 01:16:53,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it because of the interactive element, possibly?

1094
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:56,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly, but it's still fiction.

1095
01:16:57,122 --> 01:16:58,802
[SPEAKER_01]: People should be able to tell the difference.

1096
01:17:00,523 --> 01:17:01,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fine.

1097
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:03,143
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can interact with the characters.

1098
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:03,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1099
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:05,984
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to kill the cop in the game.

1100
01:17:06,264 --> 01:17:07,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to do that.

1101
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:08,564
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the other thing, too.

1102
01:17:09,544 --> 01:17:11,965
[SPEAKER_04]: The games don't look exactly as real as a movie.

1103
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:22,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the movie has real people in it, you know, performing simulated, you know, acts on people, but it looks very realistic, whereas a game looks like a game.

1104
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:33,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unless maybe the PlayStation 5 or something, that may be a different story, but for right now, on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, I'm going to look at that and go, yeah, that's a game.

1105
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:34,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to know the difference.

1106
01:17:35,728 --> 01:17:44,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know, yeah, it's okay to kill a cop in the game because I know if I kill a cop in the game, the police are not going to be busting down my door in an hour to come kill me.

1107
01:17:44,512 --> 01:17:46,413
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fine.

1108
01:17:46,593 --> 01:17:47,194
[SPEAKER_04]: It's acceptable.

1109
01:17:48,494 --> 01:17:48,894
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1110
01:17:49,495 --> 01:17:56,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's about time for us to take a little break here on the live show, and that means the podcast gets broken up as well because we release in two parts every week.

1111
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:02,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to take a break, and we will be right back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1112
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:12,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio
