00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,760
Tonight, August 6th, 2006, Xbox Live Arcade is going to get a really big PlayStation game,

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,760
Two big game companies post big losses, and do video games cause teen pregnancy?

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,760
Orange Lounge Radio

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,760
Hey everybody, this is Loki. Joining us once again, we have another week of wonderful game news.

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,760
This is August 6th, and well, we have a wonderful show for you guys tonight, especially when we're not giggling.

6
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,320
Joining us, as always, we have the wonderful DarkSakra.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,900
Of course I'm wonderful.

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,040
And I'm also really hot today.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,700
Because the AC doesn't get in this room.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,760
And normally introducing us, the wonderful Sky.

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
Hi, I'm not allowed to do the intro anymore on this program, because this is what, Take

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
4?

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Take 5?

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Something like that?

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
That's alright.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,520
Yeah, I'm no longer allowed to do the intro on Orange Launch Radio.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Well, you can take it from here.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm not hurt.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Alright, thank you very much.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,840
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and all that fun stuff.

21
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Let's start it off.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Let's get right into it.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,240
We've had a lot of pre-show antics for those that listen live to us on Sunday nights.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
If you want to get in on the live experience, you can always tune in to us.

00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,880
more like 0636 right now.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
We're finally getting into the show, but that's just all part of the live experience.

00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,360

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:53,920

So check it out.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,280
Anyway, let's get it started.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,800
Let's talk about your gaming week and the type of stuff

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,960
you've been playing this week, the video games that have gotten your attention. Dark

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,760
Sakura. World of Warcraft. That's it? Animal Crossing. I mean, really, this week

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,880
has been a lot of preparation for other things. Dan went to some pinball party

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,940
in Concord, but I haven't heard how that went. Actually, no, I did play a whole lot

47
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,680
of Twilight Zone Pinball, but Dan's been working on the machine, so it's really,

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,560
it's been my usual stuff, however I am looking forward to Dead Rising, so yeah.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,640
Did you play the demo no, I haven't I've been dizzy

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,960
But so you've just seen like the trailer and stuff. Yeah, I'm gonna set it for download tonight

51
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,720
Um, cool. Unfortunately, my work is wanting me to do another flyer for them art for free

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,100
So like over time now, no, I don't get paid for it sadly, but it does go in my portfolio. That's good

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,120
There's something for it. All right, how's World of Warcraft going? I'm a level 8. Whoo

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,200
Slowly but surely wins the race. No, I play like an hour every so often just when I'm like, oh I have an hour

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Well, plus, I noticed you like to get on there and screw around, too.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Yeah.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Like you'll be dancing out in the village and all that stuff.

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I remember one time I logged in and my character on World of Warcraft is female

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
because people give you stuff more when you're female.

60
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,200
And it was myself and DarkSakura and Chiara, right?

61
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
We were all playing.

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Yeah.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
It was Chiara.

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
And we were all dancing.

65
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
The three zombie ladies were all dancing.

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
She's listening right now.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Hi, Sauce.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Hello.

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
All right.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Loki, how was your gaming week?

71
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
It was good.

72
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:41,080
demos. I was playing more of Saints Row and managed to get myself outside the boundaries

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,360
of the demo, which is also fun, where they have an AK there. And I played Dead Rising

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
Demo a little bit. That game, you know, the demo didn't really hold my interest too long

75
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,840
just because it's just such a small section of the mall and I mean there's not really

76
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,320
anything you can do. I mean, it's only, it's 15 minutes timed as well. So, but it's, it's

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,500
fun. I mean, don't get me wrong, I've been buying the game, you know, in a couple days,

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,200
but it's just, you know, for a demo, it's okay. I'm not having as much fun as I did

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,320
with Saints Row Saints Row, it's just fun. And then on top of all that, I actually haven't

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
bought Street Fighter II, just because I don't really want to. I don't know. It doesn't seem

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,220
like something I'd like. I'll wait for Pac-Man this week, I guess. I don't know why the hell

82
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,300
I'd buy Pac-Man, but Nelly will probably want to play or something. And then, uh, more Grand

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Theft Auto Liberty City stories. We're really getting frustrated with it. We're, eh, need

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,380
to get the new one, which is coming out early October, so. Hoping, you know, hearing some

85
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,140
good things on it, they're going to have Jet Ski as a new one, which is awesome. You can

86
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,740
swim, so that's also good, and, um, should be pretty cool. Alright, say hello as well

87
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,180
to our very special guest although I don't know the special things wearing

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,060
off because this is what like the third week in a row I don't know but say hello

89
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,260
to what are you changing your name to Drew Nami now officially or what's

90
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,200
what's the deal trying to do a handle change all right then Drew Nami it is

91
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,660
yeah the artist formerly known as 23rd Magus yeah what's on your mind not much

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,820
I've been in hotel for most of the week so I've been playing a lot of DS games a

93
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,980
lot of been replaying Phoenix right again a little Animal Crossing wild

94
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,300
world um actually that's about it a little guilty pleasure of uh yugioh nightmare troubadour

95
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,660
other than that not much to speak of for my gaming week it's kind of sad but next week

96
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,340
i'll be back to world of warcraft all right sounds good uh my gaming week you know what surprisingly

97
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,900
i haven't been playing a lot of world of warcraft because oh and the the wow players are gonna get

98
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,540
pissed at me for this but i don't care uh i i decided to check out guild wars for the first

99
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,540
I haven't played Guild Wars in like, gosh, probably like a year and a half.

100
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,540
It's been a long, long time since I've played Guild Wars.

101
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,540
But I remember that Guild Wars, one of the perks about it is that you don't pay a monthly fee for it, so I can do that.

102
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,540
I can just decide to log in and play again.

103
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,540
So I decided to do that.

104
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,540
I just fired it up and played, and it's interesting.

105
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,540
Lots changed because I haven't played ever since they rolled out the Factions expansion,

106
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,540
and they really changed the interface and everything when Factions rolled out, I guess.

107
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,860
But I created a new character.

108
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,500
I started to do it, I think I'm a necromancer slash monk.

109
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,220
And I'm having fun with it.

110
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
The graphics in that game are really nice.

111
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,660
I love the fact that, just like World of Warcraft, you can

112
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,140
do windowed full screen.

113
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,900
It's seamless.

114
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,860
It's easy.

115
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,340
The graphics are really nice, no matter which way you're

116
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,060
playing it.

117
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,180
Gives you a lot of control over the

118
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,620
video elements as well.

119
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,700
Gameplay style is very similar to that of World of

120
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,740
Warcraft, except you're limited to how many skills you

121
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,340
can take out on the field at a time.

122
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,580
And of course the biggest change is the fact that, you know, for those you guys that do

123
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,360
play WoW, it's almost like the entire world is like an instance.

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,500
You're only around other people when you're in towns, and if you choose to go out with

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,120
other people into the world, then you get your own copy of the world.

126
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
So it's kind of interesting.

127
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,800
I don't know how long I'm going to play it.

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,460
I don't know if I'm, you know, we'll see.

129
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,040
I guess it depends how many other people I can find that play it.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,000
But the reason why I went on it is that some listeners were saying, hey, you should get

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
it back on Guild Wars.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
So I'm like, okay, I'll check it out.

133
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,480
So there I am.

134
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,400
So maybe we'll start an O.L. Army Guild there.

135
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I don't know.

136
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,720
Otherwise, I've been playing Prey a little more.

137
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,120
Just trying to make my way through that slowly but surely.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,840
And Street Fighter 2 hit the arcade this week, and of course I had to download the demo for

139
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
that.

140
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Or no, download the...

141
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
I actually downloaded the full game.

142
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,640
I didn't download the demo, I just got the game.

143
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,360
And it's pretty good.

144
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,520
I know a lot of people have been knocking it for the lag online, but to be honest, I

145
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,240
haven't had a lot of problems with lag.

146
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,120
Like I mean, I have played one or two laggy matches, but I've had way worse in Dead or

147
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,720
are alive for, so maybe I'm just lucky, I don't know, or the fact that there's so many

148
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,360
people on Street Fighter 2 right now, maybe it's just not that bad.

149
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,360
You know, it is what it is, it's Street Fighter 2, there's not a lot of frills, I mean sure

150
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,200
there's the quarter mode, which is okay, but it's not as great as you'd think, and of course

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,440
it has, you know, the achievements, granted I know there's been problems with people that

152
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,260
want to quit out when they don't win a match, but truthfully I haven't had that problem,

153
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,460
I haven't had anybody quit on me when I beat them, and of course I do beat a lot of people

154
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,460
on Xbox.

155
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
No, I'm kidding.

156
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I'm about half and half.

157
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
I probably have as many wins as losses.

158
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
You shunned them to death, Rob.

159
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
You shunned them to death.

160
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,460
I have about half as many.

161
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,460
I have equal wins and losses, about 50-50, and I haven't had a problem with that.

162
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,660
If somebody did do that to me, I would totally leave them the feedback that says they quit

163
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,260
early because 360 has that where you can leave the feedback, and I just block them, so I

164
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,500
wouldn't get matched with them again.

165
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,740
You can do that feature, too, where you put the little frowny face next to their name,

166
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,180
and then it won't match you with them in the future.

167
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,700
I've had pretty good luck with my online on Street Fighter, so I'm very happy about that.

168
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
I think it's good.

169
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I think for $10 it's a decent value, but at the same time, if you have a Super Nintendo

170
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:55,380
still hooked up and a Street Fighter cartridge, I don't know if this is going to be good for

171
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,900
you, because you already have the game.

172
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,500
And here's the other thing to keep in mind.

173
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,620
Street Fighter II on Xbox Live has the arcade default difficulty.

174
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,460
And remember, the arcade machine was designed to suck away your quarters.

175
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,060
So a lot of people have complained, oh the difficulty, the difficulty is so hard, it's

176
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,260
a hard game.

177
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,460
Well, it's the default arcade difficulty, which was kind of hard to begin with.

178
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,620
I think a lot of people went from Super Nintendo Street Fighter II or Genesis Street Fighter

179
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,080
II, which default difficulty was much easier, and then went on to this and thought, oh my

180
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,900
gosh, I'm getting my butt kicked.

181
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,660
Well, keep in mind, and not only was it Street Fighter II, it was Street Fighter II Hyper

182
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Fighting.

183
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,100
So it was, I think, above and beyond designed to be a little tougher because that game came

184
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,660
out after Street Fighter 2 was already a great success and lots of people were kicking each

185
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,660
other's butts on it.

186
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,700
On the plus side though, if you had experience with anniversary collection, that defaulted

187
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,100
to arcade difficulty as well.

188
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,700
So if you had experience with the PS2 collection, then you should have no problem with the Xbox

189
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
Live version.

190
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Good point.

191
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,300
But at the same time, if you had the PS2 collection, you're already playing Street Fighter 2 online

192
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,300
anyway, right?

193
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,340
No, anniversary collection didn't have online play.

194
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,340
One of them went online.

195
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,340
It must have been Xbox.

196
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Because one of them went online.

197
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
Yeah, Xbox I think.

198
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,180
Dreamcast the matching service ones yeah yeah so I if I recall was a bitch to set

199
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,420
up if you come into that if you guys have that then I don't know if there's

200
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,700
gonna be a lot here for you you know because you're already playing Street

201
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,340
Fighter 2 online but you know it's it's it's certainly a ton of people are on

202
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,180
there right now I I I've only one time gotten the same person back-to-back I

203
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,540
get a lot of different people and I don't have to wait long for a match at

204
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,100
all it's really quick so all right well let's get into tonight's gaming news

205
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,760
actually wait quick some housekeeping because I actually have a street

206
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,860
fighter 2 related thing in our housekeeping tonight something I want to

207
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,820
mention it's going on over at all games dot-com which is our you know affiliate

208
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,660
site that broadcasts us on Mondays at 5 Pacific Standard Time all games is doing

209
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,060
a big Street Fighter 2 tournament over there and they've got room for quite a

210
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,620
few people so it's us and I believe Bobby Blackwolf and all games interactive

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,760
We're all kind of coming together to try and get people in on this tournament.

212
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,020
So it's kind of like a Voltron tournament, so to speak, where we're all coming together

213
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,820
to form a giant monster of a tournament.

214
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,720
So we're going to be holding this big Street Fighter II tournament.

215
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,540
No cost to enter, it's just sign up, have fun with it, and I believe there are prizes

216
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
involved as well.

217
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,820
I believe they're giving away your choice of a Street Fighter II figure as well as an

218
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,820
all-games t-shirt.

219
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,460
So hey, something for nothing, you know, it's pretty cool.

220
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,300
So just sign up.

221
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,780
The only rule is that you have to have a valid gamer tag, of course, and everything is set

222
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,020
up okay in your allgames.com profile.

223
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
So please check that out.

224
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,300
You just register for the site.

225
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,860
They're not going to send you spam mail or anything like that.

226
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,120
We broadcast with them.

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
We trust them.

228
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,540
They're not going to do anything shady like that.

229
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,960
It's just about having fun.

230
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,740
So by all means, go over to allgames.com, click on where it says Tournaments, and check

231
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,620
out Street Fighter II.

232
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,000
And I entered the tournament myself, so possibly you will be playing against me in the first

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,920
round and probably taking me out in the first round because I'm not that good at Street

234
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Fighter 2.

235
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I'm okay, but I'm not that good.

236
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
So, we'll see.

237
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,780
I believe the way the rules work is it's three rounds, or I'm sorry, three matches.

238
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,560
It's best of three matches with three rounds a piece.

239
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,500
So, if you get screwed your first game, you still have two chances, so it's best two out

240
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
of three matches.

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,300
So, it gives you a fair chance, so that should be fun.

242
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,700
Let me introduce our chat room as well over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

243
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Click on chat.

244
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,460
Jeremy Todd won, who by the way is a listener that I actually fought on Street Fighter II

245
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,100
earlier this week, because he happens to be on my buddy list on Xbox Live.

246
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,780
And I beat him.

247
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,940
To be fair though, it was really close and he beat me one round, so it was a good match.

248
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,780
Sky or anyone else, when you do quick rank matches, do you ever get a timed out thing

249
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,020
and then have to try to find another person to fight?

250
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,740
Yes, I do get that.

251
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,580
I read some tip on one of the gaming blogs, I want to say it was Kotaku,

252
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,860
where you're supposed to be able, if you hit a button during that then you don't

253
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,140
get the time out. It's the Xbox guide button.

254
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,460
I don't know why that would have an effect on it. If it's counting down when it's doing the counting down

255
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,980
from five down, you just hit the Xbox guide button once and then hit it again

256
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,580
to basically kinda pop up your guide and then put it away

257
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,780
and then that'll allow it to connect. I don't know why.

258
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,020
But you know honestly it doesn't, it's so fast,

259
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,380
The whole process is so fast to get in there and do a quick match, it doesn't really bother

260
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,380
me.

261
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,620
Like, I heard some people the first day were getting like 10s and 20s of those in a row,

262
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,860
but my thing is, if that's happening to me, I would create a match and wait for someone

263
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
to join it.

264
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,420
Maybe that would be better, I don't know.

265
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,900
And I think to be honest, what it is, is it's just that everyone was hammering it in the

266
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
beginning.

267
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,860
It's going to get better as it goes along, and if there is a serious problem, they will

268
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,580
patch it, so.

269
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,140
Alright, so go represent the OL Army, you guys, over in the Street Fighter 2 tournament

270
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,360
on allgames.com and for those of you guys that are in our chatroom I noticed Bobby Blackwolf

271
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,160
is there and he posted a link right to the tournament page so check that out.

272
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,640
That's pretty much it for housekeeping, I don't think I have a whole lot else that's

273
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,400
on the agenda so let's get into tonight's news.

274
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,740
Well starting off with the news of course, probably the biggest news story of the week

275
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,520
and of course we covered it a little bit last week with E3 kind of going away as we know

276
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
it.

277
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,200
Well actually, it is going away as we knew it at the big huge convention, not going to

278
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,840
be happening anymore, but they're going to be toning it down a bit and kind of giving

279
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
you a new facelift.

280
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,720
It's going to be called the E3 Media Festival, it's going to take place still in L.A.,

281
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,160
tentatively planned.

282
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,240
They're talking about maybe two hotels there.

283
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,080
And what they're saying is they're going to be basically inviting, you know, members

284
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:45,920
of the press and big wigs in the retail business and stuff like that, you know, your CEOs at

285
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,380
Best Buy and stuff, to basically attend this thing. And it's going to be much lower key.

286
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,080
They're playing on just, you know, they're going to have the big press conferences like

287
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,700
they did this year and the other years, but it's not going to be the whole, you know,

288
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,400
if I work at GameStop or something like that, I can just get in. You're not going to be

289
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,040
able to. Definitely more intimate type of thing. And from the sounds of it, I know on

290
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,360
the video side they have a thing called VSDA which they're putting out with the EMA and

291
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,640
it's the same type of thing. It's for the video industry and it's also very low key

292
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,840
like that. It's always good because to be honest the E3 is just a clusterfuck of line

293
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,200
waiting and just you know a lot of behind closed door stuff anyway so it

294
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,080
could end up being good I would just have to see they're also saying that

295
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,560
they're going to be changing the date on it it's not going to be being held in

296
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,800
May it's going to actually be in July now response from our chat room here

297
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,340
over at orange launch rated comm click on chat zero cool says e3 media festival

298
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
worst effin' name ever.

299
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,780
Let's see, we also have

300
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,180
Pooh Eater says E3 watered down festival,

301
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,660
less fun, more talk.

302
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,380
And of course we have somebody from the east coast,

303
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,200
I'm assuming there, Yuri Lover,

304
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,020
saying digital life, this is where it's at.

305
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,340
As a lot of our New York City callers

306
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
were calling in about last week.

307
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,660
My only concern of this is the smaller press.

308
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,060
I'm just getting completely ignored.

309
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,820
And it's just like, E3 was a problem before.

310
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,780
I remember going up to certain people and stuff

311
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,860
they're like oh well it's like you know your media you've got the credentials to

312
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,640
get in the E3 as media but you know you're just not good enough for us to

313
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,880
you know have an interview it's kind of like that it's really stupid the way

314
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,720
they do it and I mean you know it's just a bad taste in your mouth after the

315
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,760
whole thing so I actually do have to admit I had to play up you know being

316
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,960
female a little some of the stuff I did Jeremy Todd one says for the people to

317
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,760
go to E3, it sucks for them, even for O-L-R.

318
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,400
What are they gonna do now then?

319
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,480
Well, I mean, we do consider ourselves

320
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,960
to be a legitimate media outlet.

321
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,160
We have a business license.

322
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,120
We're not, it's not like something we just started overnight.

323
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,560
We've been doing this for, by the time E3 next year

324
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,800
rolls around, five years at that point.

325
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,240
So we're hoping that we can still get in.

326
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,400
But we'll do our best.

327
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,560
What it comes down to, and my advice to anyone

328
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,600
that's thinking about their podcasters or whatnot,

329
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,880
just get in touch with your PR people at these companies the PR contacts are out

330
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,480
there you know sign up on site like gamespress.com

331
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,800
look at the bottom of press releases and make sure you're in constant contact with these

332
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,720
people

333
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,160
and basically be interested in what they have to say and that's it. Being in with

334
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,360
some of the big game companies might be the secret

335
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,640
to next year's E3 you know and and we might be lucky enough to have that I

336
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
don't know it just kinda depends

337
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,560
so I'm not gonna speculate until we know a little more about what E3 really is gonna be

338
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,480
next year. I'm not too concerned about E3 next year because it's my company, they were

339
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,740
in VIP retail last year and... Lucky you! Well, they get four invites and from what

340
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,740
I imagine there wasn't that many invites so it was a good portion of them and they said

341
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,860
that they're going to get the same thing next year so, well, one way or another we'll be

342
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,060
there but, you know, to be honest though, it's, like I said, it's behind the scenes

343
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,240
stuff and... Okay, so we've heard a lot about E3, you know, most people I imagine listening

344
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,600
this show probably read a lot about this on the internet last week so let's

345
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,760
change this a little bit and say what do you think you know having

346
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,120
you know you're being the E3 before reading all this and staying on top of this this week

347
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,320
what do you think

348
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,760
folks can realistically expect next year's E3? Well next year's E3

349
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,080
What is it going to be like? Next year's E3 is going to basically be press

350
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,080
you know conferences with companies. They're going to probably set up you know certain

351
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,040
almost like workshops or something like that where you set a time

352
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,840
and they basically preview the game and give you all the info

353
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,760
in your block like an hour or so. Like for example

354
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,060
kinda like what we do with the gamer days and like for you know when the companies

355
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,080
come into my company

356
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,600
they basically talk about the titles that are coming out, they show us

357
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,260
a bit of it, they tell us the selling points of it, and then they'll give you

358
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,860
either

359
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,600
you know in the case of E3 they'll probably give you some time to play with the game

360
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,680
or you know give you a press kit

361
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,760
or something like that and here's all the information that you need to know and

362
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,120
that's pretty much you know like going through some of the sites

363
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,920
or the companies that we went through that's pretty much the rundown is they

364
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,720
show you what the games are show you

365
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
you know what is gonna be really cool about them and unique and stuff

366
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,240
and then basically say okay here's the information that you're in need to

367
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,400
you report on this here you go and that's it it's gonna be very

368
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,920
they're not gonna have maybe a lot of playable demos because you know companies are

369
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,600
really

370
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
interrupts their production cycle because they have to create this

371
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,480
crank up this demo

372
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,280
you know, even though the game's not ready yet. And so, you're not gonna probably see a

373
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,320
lot of demos anymore. It's just gonna be, you know, press information.

374
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,200
That's why it's Media Festival.

375
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,320
Jamie, what do you think E3's gonna look like? What are you gonna see when you walk through

376
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,720
the doors of E3 2007, which hopefully you will be?

377
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm pretty much in agreement with Loki. That's what it sounds like it's gonna be

378
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,840
developing into. So it's kinda like, um, it's a little more

379
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,640
controlled,

380
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,720
where the publishers will have control over, you know, the certain block of time

381
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,560
and sort of the crowd's attention or what have you?

382
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,880
well by doing that also that they uh... bypass a lot of the uh... overheard

383
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,140
stuff like his you know we

384
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:14,320
overheard some of the executive walk around talking about certain things to

385
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,920
it really controls the information given out

386
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,320
that's the you know what that's true i remember yet overhearing things

387
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,400
interesting because i remember e three this year we were walking right by some

388
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,800
activism people

389
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,680
and uh... you know they said this in public i have a problem repeating it

390
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,800
yet if you were talking about the purchase of red octane and they were

391
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,520
talking about like wow those were really I'm really glad we did that type that

392
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,840
you know they were they were saying oh that was a really good move and all that

393
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,560
stuff you know I thought that was just kind of interesting to overhear

394
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,520
something like that like should you should you be talking about that we're

395
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,800
all these people can hear you you know so it's interesting and I think it also

396
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,040
for some of the higher-ups that are there it actually protects them I think

397
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,340
from some of the crowd because for example I mean I saw Miyamoto last year

398
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,400
of this this year just freaking mobbed by people by different press and you

399
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
You know, it actually would be a more controlled way for some of the higher-ups within the

400
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,320
companies to make appearances, I think.

401
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,400
That's true, because, you know, at Konami Gamers' Day, there were a lot of, you know,

402
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,680
celeb-type things, especially, you know, for the music games, and the only people mobbing

403
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,280
them was us, but not even, you know, we're smart when we do it, we don't mob them, but,

404
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
you know.

405
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,840
You didn't drool as much as normal.

406
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,440
And there were, you know, big media people, TV people and stuff there, too, but, you know,

407
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,680
I think in a more controlled environment like that where you don't have the rampant fanboyism,

408
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
you know what I mean?

409
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,480
You kind of take the fanboys out and the people that are there for business, it was a lot

410
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
more controlled.

411
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
I was a rampant fanboy.

412
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:48,160
Well, yeah, but there's even a game journalist, you know, a game journalist is a game journalist,

413
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,240
hopefully in part because they truly enjoy video games.

414
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,440
And so there's something that they're going to get giddy about, whether they want to admit

415
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
it or not.

416
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,740
about, you know, appropriately conveying that and still being an unbiased journalist and

417
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
all that.

418
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
But that's another topic.

419
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,520
Well, it's like, what was it, the guy that heads up the DDR in Japan or something was

420
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,900
there watching people play Supernova and it was like, you know, you're thanking him.

421
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,700
It's like, this is awesome, you know, I love what you did with this, you know, and they

422
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
love it.

423
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
They love compliments like that.

424
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,900
We're getting Naoki this time, you know, something.

425
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,720
I would say my thought for what E3 is going to be next year, I think it's going to be

426
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,280
Kensha Hall in a hotel, but not the exact... I think it's gonna look like Kensha Hall

427
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,760
looks like, or they have like all the meeting rooms in the back

428
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,200
and then like the front or like a smaller booth, and I think take out the

429
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,560
people that used to be in Kensha Hall and plug in the bigger game companies,

430
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,440
and I think that's kind of what it's going to look like. If it's anything like

431
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,320
VSTA, which normally is the show floor is

432
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,640
hardly anything, it's all meetings with companies, and basically companies

433
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,520
will invite you know, hey we've got times you know for

434
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,120
meetings, you know, let us know when you want to come by. You know, sign up for a slot and

435
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,560
come by and we'll show you what our product is. And that's, I think, what's going to be.

436
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,680
I think they're really going to follow the model of VSTA, which is, like I said, it's

437
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,700
all meetings. It's all in like suites and they're all basically just, you know, one-on-one

438
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,000
contact with people and, you know, there are some stuff. Lots of parties though. They do

439
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,160
have parties so that's good you know so there'll be that but it's more or less

440
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,400
just one-on-one contact with your you know key retailers because to be honest

441
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
the way they see things they're all well why should I even bother with the small

442
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,560
press because you know it's a big press that gets the most views out there

443
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,520
anyways and they're the ones that have the most influence over what people buy

444
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,440
or you know how they feel about our games so what's it really matter that's

445
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,800
how they kind of unfortunately view things and you kind of to convince them

446
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,220
otherwise you're like hey you know what your mom-and-pop video stores out there

447
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,040
may not be a big part of the rental scene but they're still part of the

448
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,960
rental scene so you better pay attention to them.

449
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,260
Well let's hope that thought process carries over. We're screwed.

450
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,360
We'll see though. Anyway let's kind of move on here to another aspect of

451
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,440
this and that would be you know of course with E3 going down part of what

452
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,760
we were talking about last week is who's going to try and rise up and take that

453
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:16,000
that big video game showy crown away, and it looks like America's Video Game Expo might

454
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,560
be throwing down the gauntlet saying, hey, come to our show, we're a consumer-friendly

455
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
show.

456
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,720
And sure enough, the Lunar Tide Communications, who announced America's Video Game Expo,

457
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,560
has said, hey, it's a consumer-centric show, anyone's invited to this show.

458
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,160
And it will be taking place from October 27th through 29th at the Valley Forge Convention

459
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,880
Center right outside of Philadelphia, and if you're interested in checking it out, head

460
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,520
on over to www.VGExpo.com.

461
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,080
What I thought was most interesting about this is that they put out a press release

462
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,640
this week essentially saying, you know, it's really unfortunate what happened to E3, but

463
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,440
we invite you to come to our show.

464
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,380
So it's kind of interesting, and I know that some people we work closely with are going

465
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,360
to be involved in this too, because I think all games, and Bobby, are doing something

466
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
with this show.

467
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,080
I don't know the details as to that yet

468
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,620
because I don't think,

469
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,580
with unfortunately little notice being the end of October,

470
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm not gonna be able to make it, maybe next year,

471
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,340
but I know they're doing something.

472
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,220
Maybe they'll have a booth or something, we'll see.

473
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,460
So what do you guys think?

474
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,940
Do you think we're gonna see more of this

475
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,780
where other companies are trying to step up and say,

476
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,460
hey, we wanna be the new E3?

477
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,520
Or do you think this show might be where it's at or what?

478
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,620
It's an opportunity to capitalize.

479
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,120
honestly is saying, hey, our one and only competition has decided to do something

480
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,880
stupid, I'm sorry, decided to do something different, and we're gonna hop in their

481
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,680
spot. We're gonna be the the big name. We're gonna, you know, rise to the

482
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,200
occasion. I think that that's exactly what's going on with that.

483
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,320
Hmm. All right, well if you guys want to check that out for yourself, www.vgexpo.com

484
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,000
and I won't be able to make it this year, and I don't think any of us can, but

485
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,840
October next year maybe end of October the problem is is the exact same weekend

486
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,640
I think as the New York City thing I'm doing but I'm not sure I'm doing why con

487
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,400
I don't think the wife would like me flying across country yeah Philadelphia

488
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,160
is a nice place though I've been there good times good times alrighty well um

489
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:17,840
to sort of give a little bit better news than the whole bummer e3 business

490
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,800
because everybody has been just buzzing on that um it looks like at Xbox Xbox

491
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,520
arcade is going to have the PlayStation 1 version of Castlevania Symphony of the

492
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,680
Night known in Japan as a Dracula X Nocturne in the Moonlight the direct

493
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,840
sequel to Dracula X for the PC Engine haha which actually makes me incredibly

494
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,880
happy because then I don't have to dust off my PlayStation collection every time

495
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,980
I want to play it but it will be on there saying early next year there's

496
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:52,600
also a lot of indication that it will be possibly emulated on the PSP and showing

497
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,160
up on Wii's virtual console.

498
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,000
So that's pretty cool.

499
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,760
Probably to be on Wii's virtual console.

500
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,200
I mean, that's the only weird thing about that,

501
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,000
because that was never on the Nintendo Switch.

502
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,160
Well, they're not saying they're going to do it.

503
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,840
It's just saying that the door is open for that possibility,

504
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,240
because it's a non-exclusive agreement.

505
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,560
Because I think a lot of people were saying,

506
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,400
well, wait a minute.

507
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,960
What about the whole backwards compatible PS1 on the PSP Ridge

508
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,120
Racer type thing that they were touting at Sony?

509
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,320
Does this mean that Konami's pulled out of that?

510
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,840
No, I don't think it does.

511
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,320
I think it just means, hey, they're

512
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,040
trying to milk this for all it's worth, you know, smart to me.

513
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:32,740
There's also, first quarter 2007, Frogger, Contra, Super Contra, Track and Field, Time

514
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,000
Pilot, and Scramble, and it's looking like they're the coin-op versions.

515
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Well, Frogger, I think they're, oh yeah, I hope they're not releasing another Frogger

516
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
game.

517
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
No, no, I think it's just part of their, you know, scheme.

518
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,400
It is the old school arcade Frogger.

519
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Right.

520
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Which I still can't play if I'm not on roller skates.

521
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,160
What was I going to say about Castlevania?

522
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,240
I think it would be cool if they would

523
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,340
unlock some bonus content in the Xbox Live Arcade. Give it

524
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,120
something that the

525
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,760
PlayStation version never had. Like Maria, I don't know.

526
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,080
Just a thought. Because in the Saturn version you could play as Maria, right?

527
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Yes, but she was supposed to be playable

528
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,620
in the original release.

529
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,340
What basically what the Saturn version is is the finished version because also there's a trick that you can do if

530
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,860
when you first run into the gates in the castle you jump back up and

531
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
jump down through this

532
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,580
Trap door you can knock the trapdoor down

533
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:34,940
You can get in the trapdoor if you get there fast enough and then it leads you to a save room

534
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,980
But in the Saturn version leads you to a whole new the underground

535
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Conservatory I think hmm and

536
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:58,100
And I was doing a lot of reading that a lot of that, in fact, actually there's a voice sample if you have a viewer, sorry, a list of something to play the audio files of PlayStation where it has Maria saying who would have thought that such a little girl had so much energy when she's possessed by the succubus.

537
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,100
An ending that was supposed to be in the game, which actually I don't think is in the Saturn one because I've beaten it with Maria, which is actually kind of hard.

538
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,100
Well that would be kind of cool if they would like maybe realize that

539
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,580
storylines full potential in this Xbox Live Arcade release maybe.

540
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,780
One thing that I really liked on the Saturn one is that

541
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,780
I mean Symphony of the Night is supposed to be a direct sequel to Rondo of Blood

542
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,540
and it actually I think that it would be a really neat thing is that

543
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,740
if they can work it out to where they put like Rondo of Blood on the Wii

544
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,380
and then have as a special offering Symphony of the Night.

545
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,900
that would kick ass. I do remember that they did a script dump of the PlayStation version

546
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,740
of Symphony of the Night, and they had the fourth ending to it, which was supposedly

547
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,980
Maria's ending. Maria being possessed by the Succubus was one. Yeah, exactly. My only comment

548
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,500
is if they redub Symphony of the Night for Xbox Live, they're gonna kill it. The whole

549
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,220
cheesiness of the dub is sort of what sells it. Well, for any of our listeners, if you

550
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:03,820
want to see some of that the special stuff that's tucked away and there's

551
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,020
especially the sound files from a castlevania symphony of the night you

552
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,460
can go to castlevania dungeon and download those as well as see more stuff

553
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,340
about the rondo blood in case you aren't you know aren't lucky enough to have the

554
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,360
turbo graphics version what do you also for that text dump that I was talking

555
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,140
about you can find that on the game facts page for something I playstation

556
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,620
version what do you guys think about the fact that this is really the first game

557
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,920
that's going to be like a really big game, you know what I mean?

558
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,800
Like, not big in the sense, well I mean it is, like probably for me the greatest Playstation

559
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
game they ever did.

560
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Epic, classic.

561
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,500
But, I mean big is in the sense of this is not just some 80's arcade game ported over,

562
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
you know what I mean?

563
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,360
Or this is not some little tiny, you know, cloning Clyde.

564
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,600
Not to knock those games, because they're good games, but you know, it's not some little

565
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,640
thing that was designed to be a little game, you know, flash game made big.

566
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,160
This is really the first CD game now downloadable.

567
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,760
This is the Holy Grail of Castlevania.

568
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,480
Well, it's one of the Holy Grails of the PlayStation era, and it's just very strange in a way.

569
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,540
I mean, it's exciting, but it's kind of weird.

570
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,000
What kind of precedent does this set for future Xbox Live Arcade, do you think?

571
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Yeah, what's next?

572
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,120
What are we going to see next?

573
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
I don't know.

574
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Who knows?

575
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,120
But I know there is a lot of stuff coming out, so definitely.

576
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,120
Mmm, like what? Like, you know, well, definitely, well, one of the things, you know, we had,

577
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,080
you know, Street Fighter II this week, which is one of the best selling, you know, titles

578
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,440
on Xbox Live Arcade, actually one of the fastest games selling right now, even beating out,

579
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,920
you know, Geometry Wars, which is pretty cool, but just a ton of stuff coming out. In fact,

580
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,120
we talked about some of this last week, you know, with, like, Alien Hominid and Castle

581
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,880
Crashers, but some of the other things that you can definitely look forward to, some Namco

582
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,840
on ports like Dig Dug, we even have like Paperboy,

583
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,080
Rally X, Root Beer Tapper, that's going to be pretty cool.

584
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,720
Sonic the Hedgehog High Speed which I think is a port of

585
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,520
the original Sonic the Hedgehog game. Of course from Konami

586
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,200
as mentioned before Super Contra and Contra.

587
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,640
Luminous Live of course is going to be coming out as well as Hoop World which is that

588
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,200
weird basketball kinda

589
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,720
I don't know, a role-playing game or something? By the way, Luminous Live will be that new

590
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,560
game that

591
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,560
on every post Major Nelson makes in his blog, now it'll be where the hell is

592
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,840
Luminous, because like it used to be where the hell is Street Fighter 2,

593
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,960
now it's gonna be where the hell is Luminous. Yeah, um, some of the other things though that are gonna be

594
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,720
coming out, um, there's gonna be a mini golf game which makes me happy,

595
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,760
um, that's pretty awesome. Of course, uh, Small Arms

596
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,160
gonna be coming out which is supposed to be just like, um,

597
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,600
what was it, Super Smash Brothers, so that should be pretty good.

598
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,280
Some ones I didn't, Track and Field, they actually have Track and Field on here.

599
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,240
Totem Ball, which we actually saw at E3, which is kind of weird because it used the live

600
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,880
vision camera as almost like an eye toy type of thing.

601
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,860
Of course, Texas Hold'em coming out, Ultimate Moral Combat 3, so that should be pretty cool.

602
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,480
And yeah, so just lots of good stuff.

603
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,240
Definitely going to be, they're saying that they might even be able to do, you know, one

604
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,760
a week to the end of the year.

605
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,020
said they've got 35 games ready so I'm just reading through the chat room here

606
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,580
before we go to the next story I was looking at DJ kibbles and bit says we

607
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,260
need zombie ate my neighbors on xbox live oh yeah yeah that's a very cult

608
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:35,060
classic there no we know what else we need Akari warriors zero yes we do zero

609
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,780
shock troopers zero cool says I'm not excited to watch a Madonna video while I

610
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,080
play luminous you know kind of knock in the hole you know video about what turn

611
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Can't you turn them off?

612
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,280
Turn off the videos if you don't like it.

613
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,780
As we speculated when we first talked about Luminous Live here on the show, a lot of those

614
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,840
primo songs will probably be downloadable enhancements.

615
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,520
Now, before we get to the next story, tell me if you think this is a crazy idea or not.

616
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:04,780
What about an Xbox Live arcade game that could enhance a 360 title?

617
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,040
Like what about, let's say when Halo 3 comes out, that's going to be the must-own 360 game,

618
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
I'm sure.

619
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,180
about an arcade title that like you know was like a spin-off story or something

620
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:18,440
that a little card fighter you know I'm I'm I'm that's actually not a half bad

621
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,800
idea you know something that like by doing well in the spin-off you can

622
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,240
enhance okay you know what I'm thinking about when I say that like do you

623
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,040
remember yes that's exactly what I'm thinking about the pocket station

624
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,360
fantasy a like a download thing that's why I'm the child game yeah and a Sonic

625
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,920
adventure yeah any of that stuff wouldn't that be kind of interesting

626
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,780
like if xbox live arcade could be like a you know especially if they do this

627
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,040
whole we're going to link to your cell phone we're going to link to your

628
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,320
windows desktop you know by playing games maybe on those platforms you could

629
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,860
unlock tech it just just well what are you planning on doing anything with

630
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:01,520
Forza or for the to customize your cars on your Vista PC and then use them in

631
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,120
you know for the two I guess that's your DJ kibbles and bits has a good idea

632
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,840
Imagine a Halo that played like Gunstar Heroes.

633
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,200
No, they just need Gunstar Heroes Live.

634
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,360
There you go. They would wreck that. You know they'd wreck that. It's sad but true.

635
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,400
They would kill that.

636
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,760
Well, I do have some other good news.

637
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,400
Not as cool as Gunstar Heroes. Actually, it is pretty cool. Okay, what's that?

638
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,520
Well, you know there was that little law that

639
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,280
they passed in Minnesota that said that children can't buy

640
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,040
or rent rated M or adult only games. Well, it's been shut down as unconstitutional

641
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,780
like we all knew it would be. I seem to see this as a pattern

642
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,000
amongst all these laws that keep getting passed. They keep getting struck

643
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,480
down.

644
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,360
Well, they need to realize that it really needs to go, I think,

645
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,120
to more federal court because I believe that once it's passed three times in

646
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,660
federal court it becomes common law.

647
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,280
Or, to be honest, I don't remember the exact

648
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,880
Latin term that they use in legal circles

649
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,960
But I do believe that it has to pass three times in a federal court for it to become a common judgment

650
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,260
Where these court cases that usually end up being thrown out well

651
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,960
You know once they try to bring in laws like this, but they should really learn

652
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,080
I mean it's happened in so many places now. We're easy. Oh children. Can't do this well

653
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,960
Where's the you know constitutional press president for you to be able to do that?

654
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,800
You know

655
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,440
But yeah, they said that basically there was a lack of evidence showing that video game violence was harmful to children. So it was

656
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,280
It was actually

657
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,020
overturned

658
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,640
to quote also

659
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:49,040
Judge Rosenbaum who overturned it said is it impossible to determine from the data presented whether violent video games cause violence or whether violent

660
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,800
Individuals are attracted to violent video games. I

661
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,820
I thought that was a very good point as I mean your general pacifist person it

662
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,080
isn't necessarily going to be in to play in Halo you know they you may have your

663
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,340
completely docile person who loves their puzzle games but you know the I've known

664
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:15,200
people who were calm collected cool who just kick ass on on doom and it's always

665
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,660
the quiet ones it's always the quiet ones yeah I think about our buddy

666
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:25,900
Arcadian42, like one of the quietest guys I know, but a real butt-kicker on Sega games.

667
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,100
Amen to that.

668
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:35,220
However, you know, there is something really sad that I've seen pointed out, that while

669
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,460
all of this debate is going on, you know who has to suffer for it?

670
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,780
Taxpayers.

671
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,420
It comes out of their pocket.

672
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,940
So how long is it going to be until the people are going to say, hey, we're sick of paying

673
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:53,540
for your idiocy just don't you know send these through anymore stop wasting our

674
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:59,620
money but then again the majority of the taxpayers are also I mean if you look at

675
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:03,500
it statistically they're also the same people who are buying into this BS that

676
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,660
you know violent games cause violence so I think that just people need to start

677
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,820
thinking for themselves and not you know would you say it's a true statement the

678
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:18,160
video games cause violence in the weak minded I'm not saying that they're the

679
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,440
cause I'm saying it could be an influence but the weak-minded you know

680
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,360
need to be need to be hugged or something they need a little care extra

681
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,060
tender loving care you call me weak-minded I see this I see these looks

682
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,360
going back and forth here no I know you're talking about me relax you're

683
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,940
looking at me like you know it's always the quiet one no you know what I'm far

684
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:46,060
from quiet. I'm saying that like, I'll go ahead and define it this way, I think that

685
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,060
a violent video game can be an influence on somebody who does not have a more positive

686
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,820
influence otherwise. AKA parents who don't do their job. And in your case, in your case

687
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,620
Loki, you talk about killing and you talk about how you're going to run everybody over

688
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,700
on the road who can't drive, and sure you've done crazy things like, you know, your story

689
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,800
about eating the lamb burger and then wiping it off on the lamb, that whole thing, but

690
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,380
you don't actually act out on your, you know, murderous things, that's why you're not.

691
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,360
The way I figure it, if I kill a prostitute in Grand Theft Auto, that's one less prostitute

692
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,720
that's on the street.

693
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,780
I have saved society from that prostitute until she respawns again.

694
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,420
In the pixelated world of your Playstation, yes.

695
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,780
I'm doing the greater good, okay?

696
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,340
They're going to give you credit for having the mental fortitude to be able to tell fiction

697
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,860
from reality.

698
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,100
Otherwise you would not be on this program, and neither would he.

699
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,140
But honestly, I really think that, you know, when mass media is covering things like, you

700
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,660
know, children who play Doom who go out and blow away the school, they really need to

701
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,380
look at what type of home life were they living, did they have chemical imbalances, did their

702
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,660
parents abuse them, have they, you know, what's their major other influences be, do they,

703
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
you know.

704
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,460
I don't know if I want to go there but you know take the Columbine thing for

705
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,520
instance and how Doom was pretty quick to be blamed for that and then what was

706
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,540
it like Marilyn Manson all that stuff you know I think you learned an awful

707
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,420
lot about those kids lives and it just kind of sounded like it wasn't just the

708
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,620
game or just the music there was there was just a something way off balance I

709
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,480
think people like to look for an easy scapegoat people are looking for an easy

710
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,560
thing to blame they want theirs they want to be able to point fingers at

711
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,160
everything but the true cause of the problem and honestly in and I don't want

712
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,600
anyone to think that I am being an American or you know anything like that

713
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,200
but it is pretty much a very American thing to do I've noticed you know we

714
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,880
don't we do hear some of this in we do hear some of this in a lot of other

715
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,320
industrialized countries but at the same time we hear most of it coming from here

716
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,320
I think that's at least where you know in all of my reading where I've seen a

717
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,960
lot of it blame Canada no no no seriously I think about that song blame

718
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,880
Canada like you know in the movie South Park you know it was all about let's

719
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,760
blame something for the children you know being all foul-mouthed and potty

720
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,520
mouth so let's play let's blame Canada what I think that what I think and this

721
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,920
is I love Canada for the record I think it's a solution that would require a lot

722
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
of work but unfortunately people are not willing to put the work into changing

723
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,200
their themselves because they don't think there's anything wrong with them

724
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,160
in particular or anything wrong with how they think but overall I think there is

725
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,720
a general problem in how people you know on the issues that people focus on and

726
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,320
there's a general lack of accountability in the majority of individuals I think

727
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,800
over in this country. Gorilla says hey to cry like a baby and sue everyone that's

728
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,120
the American Way that coming from our chat room and it's sad but true. Gorilla

729
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,920
also asked the question what would Brian Boitano do? If he were here

730
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,480
today yes he would kick an ass or two because it's the American way that's

731
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,600
what Biden would do anyway speaking of crying like a baby one of the people

732
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,360
that was sponsoring the Minnesota anti games bill had some uns you know some

733
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,560
very choice words to say about the whole thing and she had she is sporting a very

734
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:16,560
stupid looking haircut I might add by the way. Anyways, her comment was, and I'm going

735
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,080
to quote this in the voice that I think would be best suited for her, the whole ruling defied

736
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,380
common sense. I'm so disappointed. The federal courts say we don't have the right to protect

737
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,160
our children, but we protect our children from other things. We don't let them smoke

738
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,280
or buy liquor. You score points in video games for how many women you rape and how many cops

739
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:49,720
to kill. How could that not affect them psychologically? So yeah, she's a whiny bitch. Anyways, but

740
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,760
I don't know. It's just these people don't understand why these bills keep getting overturned.

741
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,280
Maybe because they're not constitutional. Maybe because there's actually no proof that

742
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,240
any of this is true. And yeah, it's great that you're limiting them from buying things

743
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,600
that we know can harm them, um, but things that have been proven or not proven to harm

744
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,920
somebody, uh, you can't really protect them from that. So, oh well.

745
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,400
Magus, some thoughts, or Drewnami, sorry, some thoughts?

746
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,800
These people just need to stop already. I mean, yeah, we can tell the difference. You

747
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,560
might want to protect your kids, you know, the parents need to protect their kids because

748
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:39,920
they may not know any better but you know quit screwing the game buyers in

749
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,040
general giving us a bad name if you know quit being such a care bear let the

750
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,880
parents raise their children if you were Lord and over ruler of the entire world

751
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,560
what I forbid what would you yeah heaven help us all what would your solution be

752
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:58,680
to this problem of kids play video games and then think it's okay to act that out

753
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:04,120
in real life. If you're gonna blame anyone, blame the parents. Have the parents get sued,

754
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:10,480
not the game companies. Have the parents get sued for the damages. It's their responsibility.

755
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,360
It is their responsibility, however, the companies do have a right of responsibility in advertising

756
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,320
making sure that the information is fully out there. I think that there are cases of

757
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,720
misrepresentation, there are cases where the parents do not choose to be properly informed.

758
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,880
bullshit we have a rating system set up already hold on hold on I can't help but

759
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,200
think about like those episodes of Maury Povich where I'm seeing like you know

760
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,600
the the old moms that are on there with like the crazy ass kids you know one's

761
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,080
really deformed yeah no no no no no no no I'm talking about like you know that

762
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,760
I can't control my daughter she wants to dress like a hoe and she beats up

763
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:52,240
everybody at school that's your fault you know the people I'm beating up in

764
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,960
Grand Theft Auto I don't know that what about those kids that are past the point

765
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,440
and no return.

766
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:05,120
To start it this way, you do have to look in the origin of how a child, where I do believe

767
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,180
that children are born with a certain genetic predisposition towards some behaviors, I do

768
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,640
also think that a lot of behaviors are learned.

769
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,920
If you do not start from infancy, preparing them for, you know, living a responsible adult

770
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,800
life, then they're not going to be that way.

771
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,180
You have to start off with showing proper discipline,

772
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,720
with not letting them walk all over you, first of all,

773
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,500
because, I mean, if a kid's, honestly,

774
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,260
and I was like this when I was a kid,

775
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,820
if you give an inch, it'll take a mile.

776
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,940
I mean, but I honestly look at

777
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,820
a lot of the more well-adjusted ones,

778
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,340
the ones who don't need as much supervision,

779
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:47,180
and when you see the type of encouraging,

780
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,820
responsible lifestyle that most of my friends

781
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,380
who are more well-adjusted have grown up in.

782
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,780
they know their boundaries. However, if there is

783
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,340
a degree of, for lack of a better description, mental disturbance,

784
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,940
there are treatments available, you just have to be willing to

785
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,780
to offer it. Here's an interesting quote in our chat room, and let me get your guys'

786
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,980
reaction to this, and then we need to move on. Jonathan F. in our chat room over at

787
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,200
OrangeLunchRadio.com, click on chat, says,

788
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,700
companies should put a notice at every game startup to say

789
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,060
that they are not responsible for the actions of its players. What do you think of that

790
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,260
comment? That's a great idea. That's a smart move.

791
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,740
really do you think I mean I don't I don't disagree on it it's an

792
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,100
interesting idea I'm not saying it's a bad idea but

793
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,420
do they should they have to? Put the printing on them on the box

794
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,620
I always think you know I purchase of this game I always think about those

795
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,740
commercials like you know you see the commercials on TV where it's like you

796
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,320
know the

797
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,780
the driving around and doing the stunts what does it always say at the bottom

798
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,980
do not attempt at home and I'm thinking driver and professional course

799
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:51,340
duh well you know what they have to because the lawsuits I mean that's why

800
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,940
jackass in front of every single show and the movie and the trailer they have

801
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,940
to put you know don't try this at home we're you know professionals if you try

802
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,660
this you're gonna get hurt and possibly kill yourself we are not responsible for

803
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:07,360
any injury unfortunately people in the soo happy world that we're in we have to

804
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,500
remind them of the stupid things out there guess what fire hot you know ice

805
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:17,740
cold car dangerous I mean just you know stupid shit like that it's I don't know

806
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,740
That's how dumb America is.

807
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:22,740
Alright, one more thought, Jiranami.

808
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Okay, you know how we have those disclaimers? People who have played MMOs get the disclaimers.

809
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,740
The whole ESRB disclaimer. Game experience may change during online play.

810
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:35,740
They're not, you know, the company is not responsible for its player base.

811
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:38,740
The player base is responsible for the player base.

812
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,740
I would hope game experience changes in online play because I play as a woman in MMOs.

813
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:45,740
Like I said, more free stuff.

814
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,240
That's your problem Rob all right anyway

815
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:53,880
Seriously, if you guys have a thought we'd love to hear from you mailbag at orange launch radio comm and we'll open up the mailbag

816
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,780
later in the program

817
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,780
But of course we open it up every week

818
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,420
So if you have a comment on this we'd love to hear from you guys and also there's always our chat room as well

819
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
Orange launch radio comm click on chat

820
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,780
Now now let's get into the teen pregnancy thing because it's kind of on the same lines

821
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,820
I bet a lot of you guys were giggling at the intro like we were earlier tonight when we heard about the whole you know

822
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,180
video games cause teen pregnancy.

823
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,940
I was serious when I said that.

824
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,940
Here it is.

825
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:26,520
There was an opinion piece that was on cantinerep.com that was addressing the high pregnancy rates

826
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,800
in students at this particular high school, Timkin High School, and basically what it

827
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,220
does is it places blame on all sorts of things, and it says here, here's a quote, whose fault

828
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:41,060
is it that more than 13% of Timkin's girls are with child?

829
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,920
Some would say fault finding isn't a fruitful exercise, but in this case, it's critical.

830
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:51,880
Suspects range from movies, TV, and video games to lazy parents and lax discipline.

831
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,120
Only one thing is sure, schools don't impregnate children.

832
00:48:55,120 --> 00:49:01,040
I'd like to point out, by the way, the article said nothing about sex ed, birth control,

833
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,000
education, or anything like that.

834
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,400
To refute that, I actually did know somebody in Alabama who conceived her baby in the bathroom

835
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,800
at my high school.

836
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,520
That's crazy shit.

837
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,520
Wow.

838
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,040
So, yes, you school, and directly.

839
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,520
My thought is, though, how did somebody get the notion, and I think the reason why this

840
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,920
got picked up by some of the game blogs this week and why we're reporting on it now, how

841
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,960
did somebody get the notion that video games cause pregnancy?

842
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,480
Because I don't know about you, but video games is usually an experience by yourself,

843
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,160
unless it's mario party you know something like that lamb party

844
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,600
and last time i checked masturbation won't make you pregnant

845
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,600
it's all about rez

846
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,120
hahahaha

847
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,640
okay

848
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,880
i'm not even gonna say what just popped into my head

849
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,320
what popped into your head

850
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,260
transcontroller turkey baster

851
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,840
and more importantly why was she looking at me when she said it

852
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
I wasn't looking at you.

853
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
Oh shit.

854
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,840
You're frightening me now.

855
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,840
It's the new hair. She's made you a sexy beast.

856
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:22,840
Hey, I know all those chicks out there, they get totally hot and bothered when they see pixelated people having sex in games or pixelated nipples and stuff.

857
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
Yeah, your wife.

858
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:29,840
I know, she totally gets hot and bothered by all that shit. She has to jump on the cock right there.

859
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,840
You know what? Sex is overrated.

860
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Of course I'm being sarcastic here, obviously.

861
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,840
I think that people just need to realize that there's

862
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,840
stuff other than sex to be interested in and stop blaming video games when

863
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,840
people decide to be horny bitches. Video games are responsible for every other of

864
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,840
society's ills. Why not blame them for this? Red Tracer taught me how to drive.

865
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,840
Just a friendly reminder, boys and girls. The following program is intended

866
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,240
for mature audiences.

867
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,000
OK, let me basically say something here.

868
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,360
If you've ever talked to any girlfriend out there that

869
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,560
has her boyfriend who's playing video games, what's

870
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,520
the biggest complaint?

871
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,920
He plays the video games, he doesn't pay attention to me.

872
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,680
I would say if anything, that video games, TV, and movies

873
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,760
reduce the amount of sex that you have rather than increase

874
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,260
anything.

875
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,640
Because I can tell you this much,

876
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,480
if there's a guy watching TV, or football,

877
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,640
or something like that, and this woman's

878
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,260
trying to get up on him he's like excuse me hon I'm trying to I'm trying to watch

879
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:33,500
the TV you know move over I mean that's kind of what it is this is kind of what

880
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,660
poo eaters saying in chat he said this right before you said that Loki video

881
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:43,200
games stop teen sex hold up baby I gotta pwn this noob stop touching me I remember

882
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,200
a g4 vodcast with a fake commercial touting World of Warcraft as a birth

883
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,960
control method and this is basically something funny actually came from a g4

884
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,880
podcast yeah it's amazing isn't it I know amazing you know new and exciting

885
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,840
and all right any other thoughts on the games and teen pregnancy yeah well guess

886
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,120
how many pregnant teens said the same thing yeah I would I would like to hear

887
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,520
from a pregnant tea I would like to hear from anyone seriously did the video game

888
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,160
cause you to get pregnant if so how but please don't go into graphic detail okay

889
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:24,560
we know how birds and bees work okay got nine months go all right you know all

890
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,100
All these stories about the, you know, video game bills and the people saying video games

891
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,520
cause pregnancy, it makes me a little angsty.

892
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,720
Does it make you angsty, Dark Sakura?

893
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
I'm always angsty.

894
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,720
What are you talking about?

895
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,400
Well, then you know what it means.

896
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,560
That it's time for a particular segment we love here at Orange Lounge Radio that we have

897
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,700
to do every single week, right?

898
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:56,960
Of course we do.

899
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:05,200
My FU of the week goes toward the traffic from uh, I'd have to say Vacaville to Davis.

900
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,340
I know I've been going to the Bay Area like every weekend now and coming back, but um,

901
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,540
It was really stupid and I thought it was maybe a car accident because you know people

902
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,540
are retarded.

903
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:21,260
They like to look at the car crashy and see the pretty lights go in the air but this is

904
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,620
just so many stupid people and the SUV drivers oh my god.

905
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,260
Do not buy an SUV unless you live in the boonies.

906
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:30,260
The end.

907
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,260
K thanks bye.

908
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,260
Logan!

909
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:36,080
A few to the illegal immigrants that were carrying down this shed that's next to my

910
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,900
apartment at 730 in the morning on Saturday because they didn't want to work late that

911
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:42,900
day.

912
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,920
And yeah, I don't know, it's really annoying to complain to my apartment complex and they

913
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,760
didn't really give a shit.

914
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,120
But yeah, the shed's been sitting here, they had it framed the foundation for about a year

915
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,120
now.

916
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,580
And now they're in a big hurry to tear this piece of shit down, so they had to do it early

917
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:06,780
in the morning because I believe you bastards weren't doing anything during the week, so

918
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,780
fuck them.

919
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,780
Judami?

920
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:17,300
F you to staying in a hotel, a hotel is my least favorite place to stay, period.

921
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,460
We have these idiot people one floor down, I so much as drop a water bottle, they make

922
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,380
a call up to the front desk and they've written to check us out, they can't throw us out but

923
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:36,500
they can check us out and the AC doesn't work right although it's welcome change

924
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,220
from the house and the beds suck so yeah F you to hotels learn to make a

925
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:47,780
comfy hotel and maybe I'll stay there I'd like to give an F you to downtown

926
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:52,380
San Francisco for smelling like pee amen

927
00:54:52,380 --> 00:55:01,980
that's it I second that one mob all right back to the news thank you for the

928
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,960
mic there my guess anyways maybe we should call a magnami I'd like to

929
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,460
really quickly to clarify something in the chat room because they're saying I

930
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:15,760
said legal immigrants and you know that's maybe racist of me okay they had

931
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,240
their like ten-year-old son working on the job at the same time with these

932
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:23,560
other people so I don't think that's legal it is I do believe you have to be

933
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,400
at least 15 in the state for a work permit yeah that's sorry child labor

934
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:34,400
laws and such anyways speaking of illegal things Nintendo Microsoft are

935
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,120
being sued over controller patents and they're being sued by this company

936
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:42,440
called an escape who apparently has patents on such things as remote

937
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,880
controller with analog button 3d controller with vibration and game

938
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,920
controller with analog presser sensors, among other things.

939
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,700
What's funny though is this company, Anescape, hasn't made anything.

940
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,000
They just hold patents for a ton of shit, which is excellent.

941
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,600
And the kind of speculation around this is that this company, Anescape, is actually a

942
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,900
company made to basically sue people.

943
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,540
And what's funny is, this was actually, there was a comment by one of the people on Kotaku

944
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:21,580
which the story ran on by this guy named Baboon, and I think he sums it up pretty good.

945
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,580
It says,

946
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:28,220
Given that Nintendo 64 had an analog stick in 1996, and a patent describing it in 1999

947
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,860
won't be upheld in court.

948
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:34,420
As to why Anescape isn't suing Sony, this might have something to do with who owns Anescape.

949
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,220
Take a quick Google search and you'll get nothing but patent applications.

950
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,840
It's quite likely that Anascape is nothing but a shell company created to litigate.

951
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:50,180
Given how the US patent system works, any software electronic company is probably violating

952
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,940
at least a couple dozen patents here and there.

953
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:58,480
Most of those companies are just patenting everything they can just to be able to react

954
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,900
to another company's patent lawsuit.

955
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,220
All they have to do is dig in their list of patents for something that the plaintiff has

956
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,900
been doing and countersue.

957
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:14,820
The only sure way is to avoid a lawsuit trading is just to not make any product at all.

958
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,940
If you don't do anything other than patent stuff, you can't be breaking anyone else's

959
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:26,820
patents and chances are you'll be able to reach a settlement that gets you mucho dinero.

960
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,500
Interesting comments from our chat room here.

961
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,620
Some folks kind of feel the same way that probably this company is just set up to sue

962
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:32,620
people.

963
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,260
Eddie in chat says, these companies survive on lawsuits.

964
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,820
VX JasonXV says, I hate patent sporgers.

965
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,260
And Vic Powell kind of sums up my thoughts on this.

966
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,980
Geez, how many more no-name companies have patents for vibrating controllers?

967
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,500
Do we kind of already go here already?

968
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,440
Exactly, and here's the other thing too.

969
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Why now?

970
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:55,660
Why, you know, if you've held this patent since 1999, why when, you know, the original

971
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:00,820
1064, you know, came out or whatever or when the PlayStation came out and stuff, why are

972
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:05,120
waiting until like five generations down the road before you start suing. That's the kind

973
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,500
of fishy part about it. I mean, it's like, you know, the whole thing like if Konami didn't

974
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:16,220
sue Roxor over, you know, DDR, if they let it go and stuff after a long time, then it

975
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,900
almost seems like there's nothing they can, they should be able to do about it, you know,

976
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,780
because you've allowed it to happen. It's kind of protecting your own asses, assets.

977
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:30,180
Yeah, I get it. All right, well, interesting. I guess we'll see what happens. Did you have

978
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:36,560
comment on I got nothing okay well speaking of a Nintendo there's actually

979
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:44,080
going to be some we news breaking in a light sick on August 23rd they have a

980
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,560
keynote at the games convention that should last for about an hour called we

981
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,900
prove our promise pun speaking of I'm glad even they can make fun of their own

982
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:02,400
own name oh and they're also there's a plan to show five new Wii games during

983
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,400
that event I wish we knew what games but I guess that's part of the secret we

984
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:15,080
will wait and see haha you're fired not spotters so fires where you're fired to

985
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:19,740
all right it'll be what do you what do you think they're gonna do you think

986
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,800
this is where we're gonna finally find out okay here's the date it's coming out

987
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:29,120
Here's the price all that good stuff. Yeah, because they're not a Tokyo game show. They're not doing space world this year

988
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:34,940
It's the last big convention before the launch, but I thought we weren't supposed to hear sell tell September

989
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,940
It's a goddamn week from September close enough

990
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,400
All right. Just thought I'd get that in there like, okay. We're a little early so sue us

991
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,780
We can do what we want. All right. Well, I I must express previously on the program

992
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,500
I had a little bit of disappointment that Mortal Kombat Armageddon was only coming out

993
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,940
for current-gen consoles.

994
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:58,180
It's only coming out for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, but actually there's been news this

995
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:02,340
week that it is actually coming out for the Nintendo Wii.

996
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,940
No word on how it's going to take advantage of the Wii's control scheme, but this would

997
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:10,060
be one more title that's going to be coming out.

998
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:14,460
There is a quote from the publisher, �Our Chicago studio, under the direction of Ed

999
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,580
Boone, has been working extremely hard to make Armageddon stand out in a big way with

1000
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:23,060
the inclusion of the entire Mortal Kombat character lineup, the Motor Kombat minigame,

1001
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:27,240
which by the way is supposed to be like Mario Kart, it's going to be great, I just kind

1002
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,500
of wish it was next gen, but whatever, a new conquest mode and several other innovative

1003
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,220
gameplay additions that help keep the franchise at the top of its genre.

1004
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,980
We're confident that Wii fans will truly appreciate the finished product when it's ready to hit

1005
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
store shelves.

1006
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,660
You hear it's also being packaged with Mortal Kombat 3?

1007
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,080
Oh that's pretty cool.

1008
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,960
You know what, but see, the only downside to this news, I think, for Midway is that,

1009
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,720
at least for me, I was going to pick this up, even if it is on current gen, I was going

1010
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,580
to pick it up, but now, I'm going to wait.

1011
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,240
I'm going to wait and get the one on the Wii, because I just have this feeling that there'll

1012
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,520
be something extra there, you know?

1013
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,040
It's alright, they're both coming out in October anyways.

1014
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:05,720
Well, maybe that one, but they're saying that Armageddon probably won't be out until early

1015
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,880
2007, or do you think there's something...

1016
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh, maybe, I don't know, they're pouring...

1017
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,680
Well, the GameCube one was delayed when they did not this one, but the last one.

1018
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,960
What was it? Deception? Deception was delayed on GameCube.

1019
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,320
I don't know. Whatever.

1020
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:29,400
Well, a little bit more Wii news? Wii bits of news!

1021
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,880
Okay.

1022
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,000
Wii Wii bits of news.

1023
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:37,480
It sounds like Ubi is going to be releasing seven Wii launch titles.

1024
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:47,160
so it looks did they say what titles we do have a we do have a list of Far Cry

1025
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:53,800
GT Pro Series Open Season Monster 4x4 World Circuit Rayman Raving

1026
01:01:53,800 --> 01:02:01,640
Rabbids and Red Steel is the list and Blazing Angels well that was also on the

1027
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,480
list too yeah that's gonna be awesome um well these are all gonna come out launch

1028
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,440
What when they say launch does that mean first quarter does that mean the day the wheeze on the shelves the all these games are?

1029
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,440
Gonna hit they have wow

1030
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,720
Didn't I make some bet on the show that there weren't gonna be more than 20 games when the system comes out

1031
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:22,040
I think that yes, you did. I might be in trouble. We owe some money to somebody no

1032
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,660
I think it was something to do a pudding or something, but wait wasn't

1033
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
$150 I thought the deal was

1034
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,640
It had to be first party game

1035
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,520
I'm gonna have to go back and find the show where I made the bet cuz I think it was 20 first party games well

1036
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:40,600
getting pretty close. I know, I'm starting to worry. I'm sure some listener's been keeping

1037
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:46,380
track of that. Well anyways, another Ubisoft game that they kind of snuck under the radar

1038
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:53,480
there. It was actually released on a French press release, and that would be Prince of

1039
01:02:53,480 --> 01:03:03,440
Persia. And they had it slated for probably in the United States in March 2007. So no

1040
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,320
No idea whether it's going to be just a port of Prince of Persia, the Sands of Time, anything

1041
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:15,580
from that series, but it should be interesting, I mean, I don't know, Prince of Persia had

1042
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:16,580
a lot of swinging around stuff.

1043
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,180
How about old school Prince of Persia?

1044
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,540
You know, where I actually swing my sword, you know?

1045
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,420
Maybe, I don't know, that'd be pretty cool.

1046
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:25,420
Maybe a hidden game, who knows.

1047
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:29,540
I was going to mention real quick another title that we had coming out, which I'm sure

1048
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:34,740
he'll be reading about on all the major press sites later on this week, as the trend seems

1049
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:40,740
to be. Anyways, I'm not sure if you're a big fan of fishing out there, but Rapala Pro,

1050
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:47,740
what was it, Trophies is going to be coming out on the Wii and on the Xbox 360, well,

1051
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,980
slated sort of in October, but you know, we'll have to wait and see, see when the actual

1052
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:58,300
you know, games come out. So that is one title that you can look for so you can get your

1053
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:03,400
fishing on your wiimote fishing I'm gonna have to eat the chat room is

1054
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,540
commenting on the pudding thing and it was not dance naked in pudding that

1055
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:11,340
would not happen on air I would not subject Loki and dark soccer to that it

1056
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:15,780
was $250 worth pudding it no I want it was not that either it was like something

1057
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:18,540
about a whole six-pack of pudding rubbing it on my chest or something on

1058
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:23,300
live on air but I don't even know where that came from but that was the bet but

1059
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,540
now they're not gonna be here for that show some folks are saying it was first

1060
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:28,500
First party, some folks are saying it wasnít.

1061
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,740
So Iíll go back and dig up that show and figure it out.

1062
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:35,220
So weíll see.

1063
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,300
I want to mention this though regarding the price of the Wii, you know $250 a pudding

1064
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,300
most people would say could also buy you a Wii.

1065
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:47,180
However there is a possible leak to the price of the Wii and itís coming through the most

1066
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,980
oddest of places, 7-Eleven.

1067
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,460
And no theyíre not going to be selling the Wii console but theyíre giving away some

1068
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,740
prizes and some of them are going to include Wii consoles.

1069
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:00,620
Well now, here's the deal.

1070
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:05,140
Inside when you run a contest, you have to give the manufacturer's suggested retail

1071
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:08,540
price or what have you of the console when you give it away.

1072
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,500
And they're giving away 711, get it, Nintendo Wii consoles and they say the average retail

1073
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,700
value is $299 US.

1074
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:22,900
But I don't know, take this with a grain of salt, I think they speculated it, I think

1075
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:28,100
they high balled it on purpose, and maybe it's because the cost of shipping is included

1076
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,260
there and who knows what else.

1077
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:36,740
I still think this is not the telltale end all be all sign of the WES prize.

1078
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,740
So we'll see.

1079
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:39,740
Come on, 7-Eleven?

1080
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:40,740
No.

1081
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:44,660
And I don't believe 7-Eleven would be the place that would announce that either.

1082
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:49,980
7-Eleven probably has no guess, you know, just like the rest of us do.

1083
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,020
The DMN in the chat room says it's approximate retail value, Rob, and that's correct.

1084
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,500
It's the approximate retail value.

1085
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Who knows?

1086
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,500
They're making an educated guess.

1087
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,140
We'll see.

1088
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,260
Educated or edumacated?

1089
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,700
Probably a little of both.

1090
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:08,280
Well, I have something that isn't an estimation.

1091
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,620
These are actual release dates in the UK.

1092
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,620
All right.

1093
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,980
Our UK friends and pals, what are they getting?

1094
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,060
Just a few releases.

1095
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:21,860
Coming out on the 11th is Dark Star 1 for PC, Panzer Elite Action for Xbox, and Siphon

1096
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:24,660
Filter Dark Mirror on PSP.

1097
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,140
So one of the things to look forward to coming up though is on the 25th Dig Dug Digging Strike,

1098
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:36,300
Reservoir Dogs on the 25th, that I think would be fairly interesting.

1099
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:42,040
And there's a few really good ones coming out next month too, because they get Dance

1100
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,040
factory in Star Fox Command.

1101
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:50,040
I'm sorry, there's also some

1102
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,040
cool, well not too much coming out in the US, but some good stuff though.

1103
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:58,040
Well let's start with the Game Boy Advance. Games Explosion which is coming out

1104
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:02,040
it's supposed to be a collection of card games and stuff. Rock'em Sock'em Robots

1105
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:06,040
Woohoo. Super Robot Tyson

1106
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,040
original generation which is supposed to be like a robot fighting game.

1107
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:17,140
more of a strategy-fighting game. Anyways, on the PC, a bunch of no-name stuff, but my

1108
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:21,880
favorite one on this list, though, is Pony Love, and I hope that's not what I think it

1109
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:27,640
is. Anyways, so on PlayStation 2... Maybe it's a game for little girls who have My Little

1110
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,340
Ponies, and you're making it and making it this sick, perverse thing that it doesn't

1111
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:37,980
have to be. It has to be. Anyways, D1 Grand Prix is going to be coming out on PlayStation

1112
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:41,540
to the official Drift racing game. Pirates of the Legend of the Black Buccaneer is going

1113
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:46,460
to be coming out on the Playstation 2 as well, and of course, the best game of the week,

1114
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,900
Dead Rising on the 360, which I will be hitting up and having a review for next week.

1115
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,900
Undead.

1116
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,420
Is that going to have online play?

1117
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:55,420
Um, no.

1118
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,540
Oh, that's a bummer.

1119
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:58,660
But, I've got some more dates for ya.

1120
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,660
Okay.

1121
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,540
Also, one of those things that you're going to be hearing I'm sure on other sides later

1122
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:03,540
on.

1123
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,060
Oh, kind of like the whole, uh, uh, what was it, Rampage?

1124
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:10,940
Oh, yeah, that's yeah that hit all those blogs this weekend

1125
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,220
I'm thinking didn't we cover that like two weeks ago on the program. Mm-hmm

1126
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:19,340
So here's the story you're gonna hear about in two weeks everywhere else exactly folks anyways

1127
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:26,180
Well, this is gonna have to do with some wonderful take two games and the take two games. I'm talking about of course our

1128
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:28,900
darkness and Bioshock

1129
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
Which are going to be coming out actually?

1130
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,660
next year

1131
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,300
2007 on

1132
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:42,700
around April 5th, so check those out. That's gonna be pretty cool. Also for you music gaming fans,

1133
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:46,460
I'll have you know that we have the date now for Guitar Hero 2,

1134
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,980
which is going to be coming out on November 8th.

1135
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:56,980
So check that out then. Also, which was also announced this week, Fusion Frenzy 2 coming out October 31st.

1136
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:00,020
It's going to be retailing for about $49.99 as well.

1137
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:05,920
And another thing that you might not have heard yet those Microsoft first-party games that were launched for the 360

1138
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:09,920
They have dropped down the dirt cheap project Gotham Racing 3 cameo

1139
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:18,280
And perfect dark zero now all retail for $29.99 as of now as of last week about Wednesday

1140
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,960
Really, but why didn't if that's the case if they dropped on Wednesday, why isn't anyone else pick this up yet? Because I'm

1141
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,440
Smooth like that. Okay. I hope you're right

1142
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:33,200
Otherwise, regardless, October and November are getting to be huge, huge release months,

1143
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,200
which is typical.

1144
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,680
But, you know, we've got a lot of big titles coming out in October.

1145
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,920
Well, hell, the Wii might be coming out in October, so we're still pretty convinced.

1146
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,440
And then we've got, you know, September, just tons and tons, or...

1147
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:44,680
September's not too bad.

1148
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,680
Hello, November!

1149
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,080
Tons and tons and tons of stuff.

1150
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,200
Yeah, November's pre-packed.

1151
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
We're gearing up, folks.

1152
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:55,320
We're getting closer and closer to some busy, busy, busy time for gaming.

1153
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,960
One thing that won't be busy though much longer are some of EA's servers.

1154
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,900
They're shutting down the servers for some of the old games and the good news is though

1155
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:10,580
it's mostly sports titles and I'm not trying to rub it in the sports fan's faces but the

1156
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:16,020
deal is that sports titles tend to cycle and they re-release games and they figure most

1157
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:20,940
people upgrade so there's not a lot of people that want to play the 2005 titles anymore

1158
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:22,900
and that's the brunt of what's getting shut down.

1159
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:27,020
For instance, if you're a FIFA Soccer 2005 player, you're not going to be around much

1160
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,020
longer.

1161
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,020
Buy the new game.

1162
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,980
Seriously, World Cup 2006 was like $29 bucks.

1163
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:31,980
I mean, come on.

1164
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:38,540
NCAA March Madness 2005, NBA Live 2005, and NBA Street version 3.

1165
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:48,140
NCAA Football 2005, NHL 2005, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005, and UEFA Champions League 2004-2005.

1166
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,200
All those games are getting shut off pretty soon.

1167
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:58,440
By the way, on October 1, 2006, Madden 2005 is going to be closing as well as NFL Street

1168
01:10:58,440 --> 01:10:59,680
2 Unleashed.

1169
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:04,200
I should also mention one big title I left out there, Need for Speed Underground 2 has

1170
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,340
also had their servers shut down.

1171
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:11,600
So if you're a fan of playing those older games, unfortunately, time to upgrade to the

1172
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,760
newer games.

1173
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,280
And to be really honest, I don't think anyone's playing those games online anymore.

1174
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:25,280
I mean, I don't know if you've ever tried to go play some older games on like multiplayer and stuff. There's no one on

1175
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,520
Yeah, so it's probably not going to be missed

1176
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,400
But anyways, although you know

1177
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,080
There's a couple people that are holding out that are holding on to those titles and you know

1178
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,240
The one or two people that are still playing them and they're gonna be pissed

1179
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,800
Write us angry emails. I don't know

1180
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,080
awesome

1181
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:49,500
Well, speaking of some hate going around, which is sad, apparently LocoRoco sucks in

1182
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Japan.

1183
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:51,500
Yeah.

1184
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,680
LocoRoco is biting the big one.

1185
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,560
No one likes it.

1186
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:02,420
Yeah, they actually advertised the hell out of this game.

1187
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,400
Sony thought it was going to be really cool.

1188
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,960
Their website was really cool.

1189
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,000
And well, when it went on sale on July 13th, it sort of was like, ehhh.

1190
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,200
So yeah, the critics were saying that it wasn't huge.

1191
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,680
It's hit bargain bins already.

1192
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,640
They packaged it with PSPs.

1193
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,040
It wasn't what they thought it was going to be.

1194
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,160
They thought it was going to be the next Katamari Damacy and it wasn't.

1195
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:30,160
Do you think it's because they tried too hard?

1196
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,320
The thing is that they didn't try to make Katamari Damacy a success.

1197
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,480
In fact, it almost seems like they wrote that title off,

1198
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,800
because it was a 1999 release, and it was just

1199
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,960
released under the table, practically,

1200
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,120
and became something huge.

1201
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,760
But Loco Roco, especially in Japan,

1202
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,080
they really pushed to try and make it the next Katamari.

1203
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,400
This is what I call the snakes on the plane syndrome.

1204
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,000
You can't force something to be a cult title.

1205
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,960
You release it, and people like it.

1206
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,560
Then it becomes a cult title.

1207
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,080
Well, even the critics were saying

1208
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,920
that they should have let it go as a sleeper,

1209
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,840
let it sneak out into the market.

1210
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,680
People go, oh, LocoRoco!

1211
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,600
You know, I honestly, I hope that, you know,

1212
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:15,600
they actually look at that tactic for a release over here,

1213
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,400
because I think it really...

1214
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,040
Do you think LocoRoco has a chance

1215
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,040
for more success here than in Japan?

1216
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,720
Because I've heard a lot of good things about it here.

1217
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,040
I love LocoRoco.

1218
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,880
I mean, I've played the hell out of the demo.

1219
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:27,780
I think if they released it at the right price point,

1220
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,200
it'd be good, like if it was $19.99 or something like that.

1221
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:35,520
It's it was a fun demo and stuff, but you know what?

1222
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,200
I don't think it's gonna keep me interested as long as like say, you know Scarface

1223
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:44,160
Which is coming out later that month or Godfather, which is also coming out later that month

1224
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,460
However, depending what you're into I sat with Loco Rocco with the demo for an hour screaming at it

1225
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:55,900
Well, they also have Capcom puzzle world coming out in September as well the same time around as Loco Rocco. So

1226
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:01,900
You know what? I played the demo at E3 and I wasn't feeling it.

1227
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,900
I'm still going to get LocoRoco.

1228
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,900
No, LocoRoco was cool. I was talking about Capcom Puzzle World.

1229
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:11,900
I was really close to importing it, and if it's as cheap as all that,

1230
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,900
I'm going to wait for the US release, but I'm thinking that we're going to see the Japanese release

1231
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,900
for all you import-crazy people. We're going to see it drop. That's my speculation.

1232
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:24,380
well speaking in our chat room just real quick vid power seems to think uh it seems like everything

1233
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:29,100
nowadays is trying to be the next katamari damashi uh and i believe from blaze's comment here in our

1234
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:33,580
chat room he thinks uh elite beat agents could be the next sleeper hit i think so jeremy todd

1235
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:37,740
one points out something good that you know that loco roco might not have also sold because the psp

1236
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:42,380
didn't do so well in japan i thought it did better over there than it did over here but i don't know

1237
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:45,740
i i think he was doing pretty good over there it seemed like it was doing okay over there

1238
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:48,980
I don't think the sales were what they speculated them to be.

1239
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,740
It was getting beat down majorly by the DS, but it was still doing good.

1240
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:58,380
The DS Lite had the craziness factor around it, whereas the PSP had a brisk sales factor

1241
01:14:58,380 --> 01:14:59,380
around it.

1242
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,380
Not the freaking craziness.

1243
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:04,620
I think the DS, especially in mind for the Japanese audience, I think that it really

1244
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:09,780
did cater more toward what is typically the more popular item.

1245
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:15,380
that may not be the most powerful thing but it's cute it's you know it's compact

1246
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:22,700
it's easy to use it's versatile and the fact that you're right and what let uh

1247
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:28,860
what are you going by now Junami what he said was you know that it's the new

1248
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:34,260
thing people it's innovative people jump on it well speaking of people jumping on

1249
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:40,420
stuff the UK police department they basically want to have Reservoir Dogs

1250
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:46,140
banned or you know the main concern of them is that the game glorifies killing

1251
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:49,740
of cops in it you know much like any other Grand Theft Auto type of game but

1252
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:56,980
you know West Yorkshire Police Federation chairman Tom McGee called the

1253
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,780
game a sickening glorification of violence against police officers and

1254
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:03,980
and says it's impossible to see how such a game

1255
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:08,060
can have anything other than a highly damaging effect on how people perceive

1256
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,900
and react to police officers. Yeah, the only problem is it's a game and people understand,

1257
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,100
well for the most part, at least I assume in the UK more than the US,

1258
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,780
that the game is fantasy and not reality.

1259
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:25,980
I mean, so they didn't really want it banned, they just wanted to basically kind of

1260
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:30,340
they were gonna make it unrated just because it was so violent.

1261
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,880
that's pretty much what it was is just because the game so freaking bloody

1262
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,460
and awesome bloody awesome but um yeah it's why they want to give it an

1263
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:44,260
unrated rating on it meanwhile ironically

1264
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:47,840
the Reservoir Dogs movie is still being sold in the UK

1265
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,660
hmm I say

1266
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:56,060
is it because the interactive element possibly possibly but it's still

1267
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,020
fiction people should be able to tell the difference

1268
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:03,260
There's a, you know, okay fine. So you can interact with the characters.

1269
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:07,220
Great. You don't have to kill the cop in the game. You don't have to do that.

1270
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,540
But here's the other thing too. The games don't look

1271
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:14,580
exactly as real as a movie. I mean the movie has real people in it.

1272
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,780
You know, performing simulated, you know,

1273
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,100
acts on people but it looks very realistic. Whereas a game

1274
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:25,500
looks like a game. You know, unless maybe the PlayStation 5 or something

1275
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:32,300
that may be a different story but for right now on playstation 2 and xbox i'm gonna look at that

1276
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:37,420
and go yeah it's a game i'm gonna know the difference i'm gonna know yeah it's okay for

1277
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,860
to kill a cop in the game because i know if i kill a cop in the game the police are not gonna

1278
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:47,180
be busting down my door you know in an hour to come kill me so it's fine it's acceptable

1279
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,940
all right well i think it's about time for us to take a little break here on the live show and that

1280
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,800
And that means the podcast gets broken up as well because we release in two parts every

1281
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,800
week.

1282
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,520
So we're going to take a break and we will be right back after this with more Orange

1283
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,080
Lounge Radio.

1284
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:07,480
