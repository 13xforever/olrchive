Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.760
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.760 --> 00:28.240
This is episode number 196 for this, August the 20th of 2006, and we're in part B of our

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
podcast.

00:29.240 --> 00:33.640
Thank you guys so much for downloading us on iTunes or Podcast Alley or Yahoo

00:33.640 --> 00:35.000
Podcast or whatever

00:35.000 --> 00:38.440
podcast program you decided to use to check us out. We really appreciate it.

00:38.440 --> 00:43.220
You're supporting independent radio and that is quite awesome so thank you guys

00:43.220 --> 00:43.720
very much.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.200
We're here to celebrate the gamer lifestyle and gaming culture

00:48.200 --> 00:52.280
and you know anybody can just repeat what you read on gamer blogs but

00:52.280 --> 00:55.040
you know when it's real people and real gamers who have been doing this for a while talking

00:55.040 --> 00:56.880
about it, we like to think it puts a different angle

00:56.880 --> 01:00.640
on everything so thank you guys for checking us out. So we're going to get right back into the

01:00.640 --> 01:01.680
news and

01:01.680 --> 01:05.120
kind of along with independent gaming I guess this kind of fits into that whole

01:05.120 --> 01:05.960
thing doesn't it Logie?

01:05.960 --> 01:09.360
Exactly because if you want to make an independent game

01:09.360 --> 01:14.440
and have it on live then you're in luck. Microsoft is actually releasing a new

01:14.440 --> 01:15.240
package called

01:15.240 --> 01:20.280
XNA that'll help you do that. It's going to be some development tools and libraries to help

01:20.280 --> 01:22.840
develop a game and actually eventually get it onto

01:22.840 --> 01:26.040
live arcade or you know something like that.

01:26.040 --> 01:41.040
It is going to cost you, though, to get it actually onto Live and all that stuff, $99 I believe, but you can develop for free and at least be able to, I think, upload it to your own, you know, Xbox or whatever, but yeah, it should be pretty cool.

01:41.040 --> 01:54.040
Details on it are a bit scarce right now, but they are going to be adding some info coming up in the next couple weeks here when it actually launches, so it's actually pretty cool, though.

01:54.040 --> 02:08.380
And basically, like I said, the $99 subscription or whatever, per year, allows you to become part of this Creators Club, which will offer you downloadable samples of games to help you get your stuff created.

02:08.380 --> 02:16.140
Also, well, unfortunately the games are not going to be outside the service, so it's pretty much, you know, to help you out with developing games.

02:16.140 --> 02:21.020
That might be kind of a fun thing to get into if I, you know, was more of a programmer.

02:21.020 --> 02:24.940
I hate programming, personally, nothing against you guys that love to program.

02:24.940 --> 02:27.980
I have a lot of respect for you guys because I found it to be tedious and boring as shit

02:27.980 --> 02:31.940
when I did it in college, but this is a neat idea.

02:31.940 --> 02:36.780
I really like the idea of, you know, some of these games that we see created could graduate

02:36.780 --> 02:41.620
to Xbox Live, essentially, and really buff up the Xbox Live community.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.020
I think it's a kind of a smart response in a way to Nintendo's Virtual Console

02:46.020 --> 02:46.780
which will have

02:46.780 --> 02:50.920
many many many games on it to start. It's kind of a way for Xbox Live Arcade to

02:50.920 --> 02:52.380
sort of buff up, so to speak.

02:52.380 --> 02:57.380
This also says that they're gonna, the subscription also gets you a copy of the

02:57.380 --> 02:59.300
runtime libraries for

02:59.300 --> 03:02.380
basically the 360, so

03:02.380 --> 03:05.580
yeah, pretty much you're gonna need those

03:05.580 --> 03:09.420
to make the games. But at least you can start designing, and I know there's a lot of creative

03:09.420 --> 03:10.220
people out there.

03:10.220 --> 03:15.140
It is going to be available, beta release of it, on August 30th.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.140
So look for those.

03:16.140 --> 03:18.540
Alright, going to comments from our chat room there.

03:18.540 --> 03:23.180
Cutris in our chat room says, it is tedious and boring as shit, referring to programming,

03:23.180 --> 03:25.300
and that's why some people like it.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.300
Well said.

03:26.300 --> 03:30.860
Black Wolf says, you can't send a game you wrote for the 360, send to someone who does

03:30.860 --> 03:33.420
not pay that $99 a year.

03:33.420 --> 03:36.900
True, but hypothetically, games made with this, what I was saying is that games made

03:36.900 --> 03:41.780
with this could, like the cream of the crop, could graduate to regular Xbox 360, right?

03:41.780 --> 03:42.780
Yeah.

03:42.780 --> 03:43.780
That's the idea.

03:43.780 --> 03:44.780
I hope.

03:44.780 --> 03:45.780
So that would be kind of neat.

03:45.780 --> 03:48.380
Yeah, so that's kind of what they're hoping for, at least.

03:48.380 --> 03:49.380
All right.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.980
Well, speaking of things that are fan-made, and sometimes these can be better than the

03:51.980 --> 03:56.580
ones that are Hollywood-made, that's right, I'm talking about movies.

03:56.580 --> 03:59.800
And there is a Devil May Cry fan movie being made.

03:59.800 --> 04:05.560
It's called Devil May Cry Sins Remembered, and it's something that Capcom execs are supposed

04:05.560 --> 04:08.960
to watch at Dragon Con in Atlanta later this year.

04:08.960 --> 04:13.600
It's being produced by an independent company called Shadow Motion Pictures in Atlanta and

04:13.600 --> 04:16.160
being directed by R.L. Scott.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.000
Evil Unleashed is a gaming site that has an interview with the director in which he talks

04:20.000 --> 04:24.640
about how it's been challenging to bring Devil May Cry to the screen.

04:24.640 --> 04:29.280
Quote, I did not want to see a film that was completely from their own writers as it would

04:29.280 --> 04:33.640
not be a pure representation of what I could offer them as a filmmaker.

04:33.640 --> 04:38.280
It's only going to be a 50-minute picture and it's basically kind of being used to sort

04:38.280 --> 04:42.740
of promote R.L. Scott as a filmmaker, but hey, it's Devil May Cry.

04:42.740 --> 04:48.800
He has worked on some other Hollywood productions as well, including The Legend of Bagger Vance

04:48.800 --> 04:51.900
and Underworld, so we'll see.

04:51.900 --> 04:56.380
He's going to be using this promo to try and sell a full-length feature called Devil Hunter,

04:56.380 --> 04:59.220
so we'll see how good this movie actually is.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.660
It sounds like it's going to be shown at Dragon Con.

05:00.660 --> 05:03.020
It should be interesting for those of you folks that are attending.

05:03.020 --> 05:06.520
And I understand our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf is actually going to be on a podcasting panel

05:06.520 --> 05:10.520
there, kind of similar to what we did at Fonami, and I think the whole thing is airing on all

05:10.520 --> 05:11.520
games.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.000
So, check that out a little closer to Dragon Con.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.800
Hmm, that's pretty cool.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.260
And especially if you're looking for the game movies, probably the biggest game movie you're

05:19.260 --> 05:26.960
going to be looking forward to I should say, well maybe not the biggest game movie, there

05:26.960 --> 05:32.360
is going to be a Hitman movie script that's actually leaked out and Latino review of course,

05:32.360 --> 05:36.280
the usual suspect for reviewing those types of scripts, since they actually reviewed,

05:36.280 --> 05:40.480
I think, the Halo 3 script, maybe, I can't remember. I know they've gotten their hands

05:40.480 --> 05:44.900
on like Transformers and stuff. But anyways, they have a review of the Hitman script and

05:44.900 --> 05:51.200
they said that it's actually going to be pretty good as far as the movie goes. You know, whether

05:51.200 --> 05:56.900
this is going to be one of the better adaptations out there right now. Of course, I think the

05:56.900 --> 06:00.440
mark's going to be set by Halo 3, whenever the hell that gets out. The mark will definitely

06:00.440 --> 06:06.320
not be set by Dead or Alive, the movie, because that's gonna suck. But, lots of DNA, I hope.

06:06.320 --> 06:13.320
But anyways, moving on, we've got some stuff for ChromeHounds, actually getting some more

06:13.320 --> 06:18.940
content. In fact, they had some more downloadable parts. Unlike the last one, though, these

06:18.940 --> 06:25.380
cost you money. And 100 Microsoft Points for some of the weapons, and I believe the other

06:25.380 --> 06:30.980
ones were for 60 Microsoft points. They add weapon spacers and whatnot, and I think a

06:30.980 --> 06:38.220
new camo package. But I don't know, do you guys think that actually buying parts for

06:38.220 --> 06:43.020
ChromeHounds is kind of a good thing? I like downloading the free parts because I know

06:43.020 --> 06:47.240
you can actually go to the online store in ChromeHounds once you've purchased them and

06:47.240 --> 06:51.680
like buy an infinite amount of them. I haven't really played enough ChromeHounds to really

06:51.680 --> 06:54.500
tell so why don't you answer that question because you've actually played

06:54.500 --> 06:57.960
crow mounds as well is it gonna be worth is it gonna be worth the points I don't

06:57.960 --> 07:02.640
know I mean I think a hundred points for like all of them would be good but it's

07:02.640 --> 07:08.040
like a hundred and sixty points for it each one and there's about you know well

07:08.040 --> 07:13.120
if people buy horse armor I mean there's gonna be somebody that buys this but you

07:13.120 --> 07:17.560
know what though a horse armors I don't know unless you're really hardcore in

07:17.560 --> 07:22.040
the armored core then maybe but the only thing I don't like about it is you don't

07:22.040 --> 07:26.000
really know what the parts are until you actually buy them so I mean you don't

07:26.000 --> 07:29.040
know what the stats are on them that's a little different and I think that's kind

07:29.040 --> 07:32.880
of one thing that you know maybe the PlayStation 3 will have an advantage of

07:32.880 --> 07:38.000
over like say the marketplace and on live right now you actually get to see

07:38.000 --> 07:41.740
you know say if you're gonna purchase tracks or whatever you can see it in the

07:41.740 --> 07:46.600
game and see the specs for it then use your Microsoft points to buy you know

07:46.600 --> 07:52.480
well, Sony points, whatever you're gonna call them, to buy those items, whereas this, it's

07:52.480 --> 07:58.720
kind of like, Light Arms I. Hmm, well what the hell is that? You know, so. Yeah, I'll

07:58.720 --> 08:02.280
probably buy them. Alright. Because I'm a sucker for that crap. Yeah, you are a sucker

08:02.280 --> 08:07.400
for that crap. Alright, well, one thing a lot of us is a sucker for is Guitar Hero II,

08:07.400 --> 08:12.880
and earlier this week, Joystiq reported that Red Octane is doing three new sequels to Guitar

08:12.880 --> 08:18.440
Hero and we've got Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero Encore, and Guitar Hero

08:18.440 --> 08:22.640
Axe Grinder are all titles that are under consideration. This isn't too much

08:22.640 --> 08:26.480
of a surprise when you consider we had a story about six months ago or so when

08:26.480 --> 08:29.740
Guitar Hero was first getting big that said they wanted to do a variety of

08:29.740 --> 08:34.680
sequels to Guitar Hero so I don't know is this gonna be over saturation? I

08:34.680 --> 08:38.600
wonder if they'll make a sequel and the game will actually be good. You're like

08:38.600 --> 08:42.800
the one person that doesn't like Guitar Hero. Why don't you like Guitar Hero? It's not fun and I

08:42.800 --> 08:46.640
hate the music but you like guitar freaks right I like it just a little

08:46.640 --> 08:51.820
more which means I still don't like it huh I just think that if I wanted to

08:51.820 --> 08:56.660
play frequency or amplitude I could play frequency or amplitude to have better

08:56.660 --> 09:01.040
songs but you were you ever the type as a kid like at any point in your life did

09:01.040 --> 09:04.260
you you know pretend to do the air guitar and I'll tend that you were a rock

09:04.260 --> 09:10.300
guitar guy no or did you pretend you were Madonna no I would have killed my

09:10.300 --> 09:13.700
I had to ask, I had to ask.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.060
No, they need the hat.

09:15.060 --> 09:18.880
They should have Madonna Hero. Somebody in the chat room agrees with me, Psycoon says

09:18.880 --> 09:23.260
Guitar Hero blows. That's two people. I'm sure that there is going to be a

09:23.260 --> 09:27.580
backlash against Guitar Hero because of the uber popularity the game has had.

09:27.580 --> 09:31.180
I like Guitar Hero, it's a great game. The only thing that

09:31.180 --> 09:34.780
ruffles my feathers is when people say it's this original new concept that's

09:34.780 --> 09:38.740
never been done before and I'm like... Well, that bugs me too. Or when people say that Beat

09:38.740 --> 09:42.460
Mania was a copy of Guitar Hero, I'm like, uh, no.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.880
I'll say it before, I'll say it again, Guitar Hero

09:45.880 --> 09:49.140
made music games like that accessible. Yeah.

09:49.140 --> 09:53.460
Made it mainstream. That's absolutely right. And of course there are other people who are gonna hate it

09:53.460 --> 09:56.620
because they're into Year of the Now because it made it into mainstream.

09:56.620 --> 09:59.940
Sad but true, it's a game where people are gonna look at it and they're not

09:59.940 --> 10:01.180
inclined to go,

10:01.180 --> 10:05.380
that's gay. Like, you know, when people are playing DDR you have the, you know,

10:05.380 --> 10:06.840
stupid a-holes that

10:06.840 --> 10:09.640
walk by the machine and look at the people playing DDR and go,

10:09.640 --> 10:11.000
that's gay.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.640
Yet, for some reason, playing a plastic guitar in the middle of your living room is not gay.

10:15.640 --> 10:21.080
Actually, that's funny because we have one of my bosses at work, he's a guitarist,

10:21.080 --> 10:26.120
and he, you know, when we did the interview with the local news station here,

10:26.120 --> 10:31.240
and I got a copy of the game finally, I showed him it and he's all pretty much,

10:31.240 --> 10:32.680
that's gay.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.880
So it kind of is funny when you think about it.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.880
That's crap. That's not a real guitar. That's a toy.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.880
How about with all these Guitar Hero sequels, we get Guitar Hero Gay?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.880
I mean, SingStar did it, right?

10:45.880 --> 10:47.880
Oh, God.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.880
We already have Karaoke Revolution for that.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.880
I don't know. The Karaoke Revolution is cool.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.880
And they have the country one, which would totally not be gay.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.880
Now, Karaoke Revolution American Idol...

10:58.880 --> 11:01.880
I don't know. Sounds pretty gay to me.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.880
You don't know the song list.

11:03.880 --> 11:09.960
I'm just wait for a song list. Okay. All right, right, but no no, that'd be that's clay. I'm

11:10.640 --> 11:16.540
You're an idiot. I'm assuming the song list is probably since it is like licensed through American Idol

11:16.540 --> 11:20.560
I'm assuming we've got Kelly Clarkson Clay Aiken Fantasia Ruben

11:20.560 --> 11:24.900
You can assume all you want but just hold your reservation

11:24.900 --> 11:25.200
All right

11:25.200 --> 11:31.440
Fine, I'll hold my reservations for a few more days and then once it gets like fully announced with a song list

11:31.440 --> 11:37.640
Then you can say well, it's a terrible game like I say, but until then you're not allowed to say that

11:39.720 --> 11:44.360
Harry K. Ames sums it up very well in our chat room people who use gay as an insult are gay

11:45.440 --> 11:49.800
But I don't use it as an insult Rob probably does I

11:50.560 --> 11:55.080
Do loser fine, but I wanna leave you like that's homosexual

11:55.080 --> 12:01.000
Then, you're from the Midwest.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.760
Gay means two things.

12:02.760 --> 12:09.800
Gay means happy, and gay is a man that likes to date other men, or a woman who likes to

12:09.800 --> 12:10.800
date other women.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.800
It's like a dual meaning thing.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
Hey, you know what?

12:12.800 --> 12:15.080
This is off topic, so why don't you get back on topic?

12:15.080 --> 12:16.080
Great!

12:16.080 --> 12:21.400
Alright, one thing that is definitely not gay is epics.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
Remember epics?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.480
They were a big company on the Commodore 64.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.480
Who?

12:25.480 --> 12:26.480
No.

12:26.480 --> 12:27.480
Okay.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.480
How about Impossible Mission?

12:28.480 --> 12:29.480
I don't know any of those games.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.480
California Games?

12:30.480 --> 12:31.480
I remember California Games.

12:31.480 --> 12:32.480
Never mind.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.480
There you go.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
Thank you.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.480
Okay, look.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.280
Epix has been dormant for a long, long time.

12:37.280 --> 12:43.000
System 3 is the development house that changed its name to Studio 3 and then back to System

12:43.000 --> 12:49.080
3, and they are bringing back the Epix name as well as Epix Games.

12:49.080 --> 12:54.440
In January, System 3 is going to release Impossible Mission for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo

12:54.440 --> 12:55.440
O.D.S.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.440
Stay wild.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.440
Stay forever.

12:57.440 --> 13:03.080
If you've ever played Impossible Mission, you'll get that.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.720
Oh god, that was like my favorite Commodore 64 game.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.640
That's what that does for me is nostalgia squee all over, definitely.

13:11.640 --> 13:17.600
Hopefully it's better than the Impossible Mission 2 that was on the Genesis, I think.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.600
It was pretty bad.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.320
It was a pretty bad translation.

13:20.320 --> 13:25.320
Anyway, there's also going to be a California Games coming to both systems in May.

13:25.320 --> 13:30.320
They won't be remakes of the original titles, they won't be 3D either.

13:30.320 --> 13:35.320
Quote, you got to keep the gameplay mechanics the same or else it ceases to be the original game

13:35.320 --> 13:37.320
and you're only using the game brand to sell games.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.320
It ceases to be Impossible Mission or California Games or what have you.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.320
What we're doing is we're incorporating the original gameplay and mechanics and bringing the gameplay up to date.

13:46.320 --> 13:47.320
I like this guy.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.320
I like this guy.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.320
I like this guy.

13:49.320 --> 13:53.760
You do not update a game like you update, say, NARC.

13:53.760 --> 13:54.760
That isn't the way you do it.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.000
You don't put Bill Bellamy in anything.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.160
This guy has got it.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.680
So I'm definitely looking forward to seeing what they produce.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.680
You know what?

14:02.680 --> 14:03.920
I'm going to write him a letter and try to get him on the show.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.000
I want to talk to this guy.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.240
I like the way he thinks.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.640
Anyways, I'm kind of on a completely different subject.

14:11.640 --> 14:16.480
And speaking of updating things, the FENTOM!

14:16.480 --> 14:23.120
is back. Um, they're actually going to be re-emerging the console as a PC download service.

14:23.120 --> 14:30.440
And um, yeah, so you'll actually be able to, um, download Phantom games to your PC. Which

14:30.440 --> 14:33.680
it was anyways, I mean, it was basically PC. Will they disappear as soon as I download

14:33.680 --> 14:41.680
them? No. But yeah, there's official relaunch going on over at the website phantom.net.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.200
yay do we care

14:45.200 --> 14:49.760
no you gotta give these guys credit because they just keep trying

14:49.760 --> 14:53.360
and trying and eventually something will happen

14:53.360 --> 14:58.320
what have they done they've tried they had a fun little booth at E3

14:58.320 --> 15:02.320
I really like their booth at E3 that was a nice booth to sit in

15:02.320 --> 15:06.160
I mean literally I could have set money on fire

15:06.160 --> 15:10.000
and that would have been fun too but you wouldn't want to sit on that

15:10.000 --> 15:13.240
interesting little flash video and I might add

15:13.240 --> 15:16.840
they probably spent more time on the flash video than they did the actual I

15:16.840 --> 15:17.760
don't know phantom

15:17.760 --> 15:21.280
I'm sorry I don't know how to spin this a nice way

15:21.280 --> 15:25.880
I'm not saying they're good people because they're obviously not good people

15:25.880 --> 15:29.520
well you can touch and play with the phantom lap board

15:29.520 --> 15:33.860
look no no no I'm saying the reverse I mean I don't blame the people I blame

15:33.860 --> 15:36.920
the management behind this whole thing in the marketing

15:36.920 --> 15:42.640
Obviously, I mean, I just think we're asked nice made that they think that somebody still cares and they're still trying

15:42.720 --> 15:49.200
You know what though if you're interested in checking out the phantom you can either check it out in Germany next week during

15:49.840 --> 15:51.520
Leipzig or

15:51.520 --> 15:56.480
You can check it out at digital life coming in October 12 through the 15th

15:56.780 --> 16:00.000
Blackwolf says they should put out a game called phantom vision. I

16:03.760 --> 16:05.200
Wouldn't play that

16:05.200 --> 16:10.200
Now what it boils down to is they can't make vaporware systems anymore

16:10.200 --> 16:15.480
So they're just gonna offer vaporware over the internet stuff. That's never going to ever be released

16:15.480 --> 16:19.660
I want to hey look if anyone from Phantom is listening and thinking we're giving you guys a bad rap

16:19.680 --> 16:22.040
Seriously, you are accordingly invited to come on the show and defend yourself

16:23.160 --> 16:28.040
I got it freedom of speech doesn't matter. They're going to release Duke Nukem forever on

16:28.680 --> 16:30.120
phantom online

16:30.120 --> 16:32.120
I've been Larry's

16:32.120 --> 16:37.400
you know they might be like trying to put out something eventually

16:37.400 --> 16:41.760
but you still give them credit for putting money into something that's not

16:41.760 --> 16:42.600
gonna work

16:42.600 --> 16:45.560
I like DJ Jinai's thought in chat here

16:45.560 --> 16:48.600
Fast and the Furious Oregon Trail Drift remix

16:48.600 --> 16:51.560
I guess that's a phantom game that's gonna come out

16:51.560 --> 16:56.560
If they released something that had an Oregon Trail in it you know it would sell like

16:56.560 --> 16:58.520
20 copies to the people that still share

16:58.520 --> 17:03.520
gang midnight Oregon Trail tune. Well look, Phantom, you're not alone in taking a lot

17:03.520 --> 17:11.320
of heat for being a console. The PlayStation 3! Some more news about the PlayStation 3.

17:11.320 --> 17:16.440
There was a report that was released this week that basically said, quote, by the time

17:16.440 --> 17:22.120
third generation consoles reach market maturity in 2011, the PlayStation 3 will once again

17:22.120 --> 17:26.420
be the market leader. Boy, I wish I could be an analyst. I get paid to talk out of my

17:26.420 --> 17:33.680
ass. I mean, maybe, I don't know, maybe, but based on what's there right now, I don't see

17:33.680 --> 17:38.760
it happening. According to the nieces, you talk out of your ass for free. Is this going

17:38.760 --> 17:45.920
to take them until 2011? But by then we'll all be rich, and that's why... Another thing

17:45.920 --> 17:51.320
that should be noted, PlayStation 3s have still not gone into production, and we're

17:51.320 --> 17:56.220
not that far away from the launch date. So as we get further and further out here, shortages

17:56.220 --> 17:58.980
become more and more likely.

17:58.980 --> 18:04.340
Please say you should three will dominate all.

18:04.340 --> 18:07.660
Oh, we haven't started making them yet.

18:07.660 --> 18:08.660
Don't worry.

18:08.660 --> 18:15.780
We'll stay up late the night before, we'll get them all then.

18:15.780 --> 18:23.740
Stories like these that just make no sense to all with us, I just learned how to talk

18:23.740 --> 18:24.740
tonight.

18:24.740 --> 18:33.740
that make no sense at all to us, make us angsty, or make us laugh, and brings on the FUs of

18:33.740 --> 18:44.740
the week.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.740
I'd like to start off tonight since Dark Sakura isn't here.

18:47.740 --> 18:52.820
I would like to give an FU to my bad grammar skills and give a big giant FU to Loki for

18:52.820 --> 18:56.580
for making fun of them and uh... laughing in my ear which throws me off

18:56.580 --> 18:58.580
a further that you

18:58.580 --> 19:01.480
will change the dick to any like span of vision

19:01.480 --> 19:03.660
i think that's a bad thing

19:03.660 --> 19:05.300
uh... low-key reviews the week

19:05.300 --> 19:10.340
after you stupid people who can't fucking pull up to the god damn stoplight

19:10.340 --> 19:11.420
or line

19:11.420 --> 19:14.300
i've seen people like six car length

19:14.300 --> 19:16.300
before the stop sign

19:16.300 --> 19:17.520
stoplight whatever

19:17.520 --> 19:19.380
there just stop there

19:19.380 --> 19:24.780
Talking on their cell phones, of course, because they're jackasses and not paying attention to where they need to be.

19:24.780 --> 19:32.080
Or the people that drive in the goddamn, like, bike lane, because they're not paying attention, or driving over the lane, all over the place.

19:32.080 --> 19:36.780
They should really ban cell phones while driving.

19:36.780 --> 19:38.180
Meagletob.

19:38.180 --> 19:39.980
Okay, I got two FUs for short.

19:39.980 --> 19:45.480
FU to eating rabbit, because rabbit actually ended up not tasting that great.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.680
I was very disappointed.

19:46.680 --> 19:54.040
however lamb is lamb is is worse than rabbit so lamb it tastes like dirty

19:54.040 --> 20:00.020
meat and I actually like my meat not from next to it. okay what is your other F.U. of Mr. Chumming

20:00.020 --> 20:03.520
Flash is the best game ever it's not the best game ever it's just really far up

20:03.520 --> 20:08.200
there my other F.U. goes to myself for not learning a certain toggle bell

20:08.200 --> 20:13.560
employees work schedule so I can stalk him effectively. F.U. to the fact he's

20:13.560 --> 20:20.640
probably under 18 and this is all being documented. He's so not under 18, and if he is, I can

20:20.640 --> 20:29.640
delete this. Drew, you're FU. Alright, FU to have a clean house, unrealization that

20:29.640 --> 20:35.660
yeah, he does the forest pretty well, but Mr. Clean's a dick. Before I saw all the allergies

20:35.660 --> 20:42.320
I ever had, and some I didn't know I had. FU to obligatory stupid drivers, especially

20:42.320 --> 20:47.680
in the country called Lanes area. Learn how to fuckin' park, would ya? I'm just tryin'

20:47.680 --> 20:53.680
to get in, out, no fuckin' about, and these people are just blocking the driveway. Yeah,

20:53.680 --> 20:56.080
that's about it. Alright.

20:56.080 --> 21:05.080
Anyway, speaking of stupid, there's a stupid idea going around on Kotaku here. Apparently

21:05.080 --> 21:10.160
people have been emailing them saying, Hey! You know that awesome movie Snakes on a Plane?

21:10.160 --> 21:16.700
Is there gonna be video game? No, no, there's not and they're like, well why the hell not so they propose that

21:17.300 --> 21:24.280
They make the snakes on play video game snakes in a game. I think I think it's stupid boo. I

21:25.440 --> 21:30.040
Feel like I'm like the only person my age who hasn't seen snakes on a plane. I haven't seen it

21:30.360 --> 21:33.000
No, you two are lame. Go see it

21:33.040 --> 21:37.340
Why if I was 10 years older and closer to your age is a lie

21:37.340 --> 21:42.880
You are not that much younger than I was are you saying I'll go see it. I am too. No, you're not. How old are you?

21:44.100 --> 21:50.620
old enough to be ten years younger than you would be 18 and it would be okay for you to be stalking the

21:52.060 --> 21:55.380
Taco Bell guy who's probably saying all right

21:56.700 --> 22:01.380
True you actually saw the movie right? Yeah, I was it worth the hype it kicked ass really. Yeah

22:02.100 --> 22:03.420
I'm at that point where I'm like

22:03.420 --> 22:06.220
I feel like Snakes on a Plane jumped the shark before it ever came out.

22:06.220 --> 22:11.020
It lived up to the hype in the sense that we knew it was going to be cheesy, we knew

22:11.020 --> 22:15.980
it was going to be a bad movie, but it has like the Rocky Horror appeal.

22:15.980 --> 22:17.720
It's best when it's seen in a theater.

22:17.720 --> 22:19.540
You have to have like the audience participation.

22:19.540 --> 22:24.480
For those that don't know, the show I was on before Orange Lounge Radio was Under Sedation

22:24.480 --> 22:29.020
Live which was born of a Rocky Horror thing, like this was born of a DDR thing.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.660
So I know very well the audience participation thing in and out.

22:31.660 --> 22:36.280
have to have the audience participation all right I'll give it a try but see now

22:36.280 --> 22:38.500
I'm worried that I missed opening weekend because no one will go see it

22:38.500 --> 22:42.700
with me that you know I'm gonna just kind of miss out on everything do you

22:42.700 --> 22:46.320
know you threw snakes at the but you went with yeah we know some of the

22:46.320 --> 22:51.820
something something awful kids yeah I went with a pair of goons we had rubber

22:51.820 --> 22:55.200
snakes around our necks who were at random points were just throwing snakes

22:55.200 --> 22:59.720
down into the crowd and the people are enjoying it everyone was heckling and

22:59.720 --> 23:03.460
riffing and throwing the snakes back and forth.

23:03.460 --> 23:08.840
It was a good time, but the movie itself will probably just lose its appeal when it's not

23:08.840 --> 23:10.600
in a theater.

23:10.600 --> 23:14.320
You know what movie was underappreciated for audience participation value?

23:14.320 --> 23:15.320
Showgirls.

23:15.320 --> 23:20.000
Ugh, absolutely frightening.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.400
Next up, that's pretty funny, Showgirls.

23:24.400 --> 23:29.940
Moving on to something that could be only popular as a cult phenomenon, the PlayStation

23:29.940 --> 23:30.940
3.

23:30.940 --> 23:32.160
Oh, we pick on them so much.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.160
I feel bad.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.160
I've really tried not to.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.520
I try to find positive stories.

23:35.520 --> 23:36.520
I do.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
I do too.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.520
But did they go and say we're not making them the other day?

23:39.520 --> 23:40.520
Well, this is good.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.920
I mean, okay, so the PlayStation 3 hasn't gone into development yet, but what happened

23:43.920 --> 23:48.940
recently is Sega had a PlayStation 3 day and there was a demo of Full Auto 2 battle lines

23:48.940 --> 23:53.900
and IGN got to take a peek at this and basically, to make a long story short, you know, obviously

23:53.900 --> 23:57.940
the dev kits are there the controller was smart enough to realize what system

23:57.940 --> 24:03.100
and what player it's connected to and the PlayStation Network appears to be up

24:03.100 --> 24:07.380
and running at this time so the PlayStation Network platform appears to

24:07.380 --> 24:09.940
be up and running because these folks were demoing the game on there and so

24:09.940 --> 24:14.100
the developers are able to use it so something's ready so I guess that's a

24:14.100 --> 24:19.380
good sign. Full Auto 2 wasn't bad I remember playing it at E3 it wasn't bad

24:19.380 --> 24:22.140
I like full auto. It was okay.

24:22.140 --> 24:25.060
It was okay. I don't know, I kinda think they'll be other driving games that'll make me go,

24:25.060 --> 24:27.580
wow, a little more, but you know.

24:27.580 --> 24:28.500
Like, uh, never mind.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.140
I don't know.

24:30.140 --> 24:34.660
Like, I wish... I'm not gonna say it, I swear to God I'm not gonna say it. I wish they could do like a Mario Kart,

24:34.660 --> 24:38.740
I mean it's inevitable we'll have a Mario Kart on the Wii, but like a Mario Kart

24:38.740 --> 24:42.760
in like super high def, 720 and all that, cause you know, obviously the Wii's not

24:42.760 --> 24:47.620
gonna support that. I would like to see a very pretty Mario Kart. We need to get in contact with Square and have him do

24:47.620 --> 24:52.060
Rad Racer 3. How about Chocobo Racing on the PlayStation, Chocobo Racing 2 on the

24:52.060 --> 24:53.680
PlayStation 3, that's what I'd like to see.

24:53.680 --> 24:56.700
That'd work. Alright, fine by me, we can agree on that.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.820
Speaking about the Wii and online,

24:59.820 --> 25:03.100
kind of the repeated something we were talking about earlier with Reggie

25:03.100 --> 25:07.060
and talking about how the online service is going to be free

25:07.060 --> 25:10.140
and basically kind of enhancing the way you're

25:10.140 --> 25:14.860
playing games, which you know, you've probably already been doing that on Xbox Live.

25:14.860 --> 25:24.860
But yeah, it's basically, it's gonna be massive amounts of hands-on activity as well as showcasing exactly how the Wii games are different.

25:24.860 --> 25:29.860
They're talking about the, of course, their brand new games and how they're gonna market them and stuff.

25:29.860 --> 25:40.860
And of course, we're gonna create advocacy and we're gonna make it so that everyone who tries the Wii experience talks to their friends and neighbors.

25:40.860 --> 25:45.660
So, of course they're gonna do that because they're not showing it to the press.

25:45.660 --> 25:48.860
They're showing it to secret parties of ravers.

25:48.860 --> 25:53.940
I'll get my pacifier and candy bracelets ready for the

25:53.940 --> 25:57.220
Wii bus to come by. No, but their online service is gonna be okay.

25:57.220 --> 26:01.020
I'll get my Darude CD. Look at the, I mean, here's the thing too.

26:01.020 --> 26:04.140
I mean, if you look about it, the

26:04.140 --> 26:08.740
DS Wi-Fi connect service, you know, we hear people talking about that and stuff,

26:08.740 --> 26:12.740
But we forget that PSP actually has their infrastructure

26:12.740 --> 26:15.740
mode that, you know, is Wi-Fi online too, but,

26:15.740 --> 26:19.140
I mean, you don't really see them pushing that very much,

26:19.140 --> 26:22.940
which I find very interesting that Sony's not even trying to say, hey,

26:22.940 --> 26:26.300
by the way, our games are also connected over the Internet

26:26.300 --> 26:30.140
as well, but they don't really have a service

26:30.140 --> 26:34.780
provided. I don't think they actually use Sony's servers or anything. Kind of like the PlayStation 2 does.

26:34.780 --> 26:38.500
So, I thought that was interesting.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.660
Well one new game that folks are going to be playing online and you know there's going to be some

26:43.140 --> 26:45.460
hardcore nerds that are going to be into this game

26:45.460 --> 26:50.100
And it's actually dark soccer and I got to check out this game at E3 and like a little behind the scenes thing and it's

26:50.100 --> 26:54.380
Pretty cool at Star Trek Legacy is going to be coming out and what was announced this week

26:54.380 --> 27:00.500
Is that all five original captains will be reprising their voices inside the game at E3

27:00.500 --> 27:04.940
They wouldn't really tell us like they said they couldn't comment on the voice acting but that they were trying to get some big names

27:04.940 --> 27:06.940
Well, it looks like they pulled it off

27:06.940 --> 27:13.120
Shatner, Patrick Stewart, Scott Bakula, Avery Brooks, and Kate Mulgrew have all stepped

27:13.120 --> 27:14.780
up to be in the game.

27:14.780 --> 27:18.220
That's right, Star Trek Legacy is kind of like a Star Trek fan's wet dream.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.340
You basically can command any of the spaceships in the Star Trek.

27:22.340 --> 27:29.460
When they say legacy, they are trying to encapsulate everything, and it's basically a ship strategic

27:29.460 --> 27:33.940
command fighting game, which I think a lot of people are going to be really into, especially

27:33.940 --> 27:38.020
the Star Trek fans, I think that kind of is a natural fit.

27:38.020 --> 27:41.820
And you know, in seeing the early demo, it looks really, really good.

27:41.820 --> 27:45.260
The game graphically is really well, and I kind of thought it was cool what they did

27:45.260 --> 27:49.620
in the demo, and this was all real time when they did it, they kind of duplicated the big

27:49.620 --> 27:54.740
fight from the end of Star Trek II Wrath of Khan, like the big Klingon fight at the end

27:54.740 --> 27:58.500
there, so that was kind of neat, to kind of watch that being recreated in this game.

27:58.500 --> 28:03.620
So if you're a Star Trek fan, you can't miss this one, you're gonna, especially with no

28:03.620 --> 28:08.700
show on right now. You can spend your Saturday and Sunday afternoons instead of watching

28:08.700 --> 28:11.620
the reruns. You can play some Star Trek Legacy and online.

28:11.620 --> 28:17.220
It's pretty awesome. One cool game that's also coming out here, or I should say is already

28:17.220 --> 28:23.900
out, by the creator of Warning Forever, you know, a fun game that I like to play, Rayhound.

28:23.900 --> 28:30.300
And Rayhound is actually pretty cool. It requires, you actually don't shoot any weapons in this

28:30.300 --> 28:40.300
What you have is these kind of turrets that are shooting at you, these lasers, and you can pull up a shield that causes the laser to basically spin around you in kind of an orbital fashion.

28:40.300 --> 28:45.300
And you use that to throw the lasers back into the actual turrets themselves.

28:45.300 --> 28:50.300
And each level as it progresses, more and more turrets are on the screen and gets more crazy.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.300
You know, it's the kind of simple gameplay that's fun.

28:52.300 --> 28:56.300
And what's great is you can actually download it for free.

28:56.300 --> 29:03.120
So what you need to do is definitely check out the game because I did and it's awesome. You can find it at

29:04.200 --> 29:09.680
www.18.big.or.jp and then the little

29:10.720 --> 29:12.360
ampersand symbol

29:12.360 --> 29:14.360
hiccoza.prod

29:15.040 --> 29:17.040
and then

29:17.080 --> 29:22.920
That should pull it up for you or just basically search for a warning forever in Rayhound and you'll find it in any search engine

29:22.920 --> 29:25.920
But it's pretty sweet. So check it out.

29:25.920 --> 29:30.200
Alright. Well, I said earlier

29:30.200 --> 29:33.440
during the bonus segment, which can only be heard live, but you folks on the

29:33.440 --> 29:34.800
podcast don't know it yet,

29:34.800 --> 29:39.160
we're going to be playing a game tonight in studio. The feedback to the match game

29:39.160 --> 29:40.840
last week was pretty...

29:40.840 --> 29:44.060
you guys seem to like that. So we want to do more of that here on the program.

29:44.060 --> 29:47.600
So we're going to do another game tonight, and this is a new game that we

29:47.600 --> 29:49.560
haven't done here on Orange Lounge Radio.

29:49.560 --> 29:53.560
and it's called beat the host with a stick

29:53.560 --> 29:57.240
K so we're gonna take a caller no because you might eat tonight you and

30:20.840 --> 30:25.160
How would you say your knowledge is on old-school video games?

30:27.240 --> 30:33.920
Super Nintendo finesse, I guess I guess pretty good. Okay, would you be willing to challenge one of our hosts tonight in?

30:34.600 --> 30:41.080
Exactly who's got more skill in identifying songs from old-school video games. Come on, you know, you want to throw down? Yeah

30:41.360 --> 30:46.280
Yeah, I'll try. All right, I'm pretty sure I know old-school video games. All right, Ravenstaufen

30:46.280 --> 30:48.960
And there's three people you can challenge tonight, you can't challenge me because I

30:48.960 --> 30:54.240
wrote the damn thing, but you can challenge Drunami, Miklotov, or Loki, who's it going

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240

30:55.240 --> 30:56.720
Oh my god, I want Loki.

30:56.720 --> 30:57.720
Alright!

30:57.720 --> 31:00.960
Raven's Dolphin is going to challenge Loki, Loki, I'm going to have to ask you to leave

31:00.960 --> 31:05.360
the studio, because you're going to have to come in second, so please go to our isolation

31:05.360 --> 31:08.440
room there, and you can come on back a little later.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.180
Raven's Dolphin, I have to ask you to leave our chat room.

31:11.180 --> 31:14.160
I see you logged in there right now, so I'm going to, actually I'm just going to go ahead

31:14.160 --> 31:16.960
kick you from chat cuz we can't have them helping you out.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.720
I'm kicking both those names from chat right now.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.760
Alright, you ready to play? No, I still haven't closed the

31:25.760 --> 31:30.120
chat client yet. Alright, that's right. I've booted you from the room so that you can't see.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.700
Now our chat room can play along here. Here's how it's gonna work.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.360
What we have is we have a one minute long

31:37.360 --> 31:40.440
clip of songs strung together from

31:40.440 --> 31:43.880
10 old 8-bit video games.

31:43.880 --> 31:47.560
now you're gonna hear this one minute clip and it feel free if you have a pen

31:47.560 --> 31:49.600
and pencil whatever you can start writing if you want

31:49.600 --> 31:53.620
K at the end of this you're gonna have 30 seconds to tell me

31:53.620 --> 31:56.680
what 10 games were in that clip

31:56.680 --> 32:01.560
K and whoever gets more wins and if you actually win tonight's game we will let

32:01.560 --> 32:02.120

32:02.120 --> 32:05.640

32:08.800 --> 32:13.120

32:14.440 --> 32:15.520
All right, well try your best.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.240
That's all we can ask.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.200
And of course, chat room, feel free to play along.

32:18.200 --> 32:19.560
You guys will actually get to hear this twice,

32:19.560 --> 32:21.280
because you'll get to hear it again when

32:21.280 --> 32:24.040
Logie comes back, and folks playing on the podcast as well.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.880
We have a lot of folks out there that I know

32:25.880 --> 32:28.760
think they could do really well on this, so see how well you do.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.260
All right?

32:29.260 --> 32:30.600

Uh, I sure I heard of what was it forget I told you

34:36.680 --> 34:38.860
okay here's how it's gonna work, Loki

34:38.860 --> 34:42.140
you're gonna hear a one-minute clip of ten

34:42.140 --> 34:45.800
old-school 8-bit Nintendo games music all strung together

34:45.800 --> 34:48.460
then you're gonna have 30 seconds after you hear the clip

34:48.460 --> 34:50.220
to repeat back to me

34:50.220 --> 34:53.180
the ten songs that you heard in the clip, alright?

34:53.180 --> 34:55.180
No. Any way you want, okay?

34:55.180 --> 34:55.680
Okay.

34:55.680 --> 34:56.680
Alright, so you ready?

34:56.680 --> 34:57.180
Yeah.

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
Here we go, you only get to hear this once.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.680
Now you can feel free, you can actually make notes, or make notes there if you want, okay?

35:01.680 --> 35:05.180
Because we let him write, but he wasn't allowed to be in the chat room to do that.

35:05.180 --> 35:05.680
Well, hold on.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.180
So you can't be in chat either, Loki.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.680
I'm not, well I'm not even watching chat, I'm just...

35:09.680 --> 35:10.180
Alright.

35:10.180 --> 35:10.680
Hold on, hold on.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.680
I want to kick you from chat anyway.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.680
Alright.

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
You're a bastard.

35:13.680 --> 35:14.680
Alright. You ready?

35:14.680 --> 35:15.680
Hold on.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.680
Alright.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.680
I don't...

35:18.680 --> 35:20.180
He's bringing up Notepad here.

35:20.180 --> 35:21.180
Yes I am.

35:21.180 --> 35:24.480
We are playing Beat the Host here on Orange Lounge Radio.

35:24.480 --> 35:28.520
Do you feel pretty confident about how you did Raven's Dolphin?

35:28.520 --> 35:31.340
Don't tell him the score, but do you think you feel confident with your score?

35:31.340 --> 35:33.420
I feel pretty.

35:33.420 --> 35:35.540
You feel pretty?

35:35.540 --> 35:37.100
I feel pretty too.

35:37.100 --> 35:38.100
You ready, Loki?

35:38.100 --> 35:39.100
I am.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.100
Quit wasting time here.

35:40.100 --> 35:41.100
Here we go!

35:41.100 --> 35:47.500
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

36:11.100 --> 36:36.820
All right, Loki, that was the clip.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.580
You have 30 seconds to say them back.

36:38.580 --> 36:39.580
Go.

36:39.580 --> 36:40.580
Yes.

36:40.580 --> 36:41.580
Final Fantasy.

36:41.580 --> 36:42.580
Yes.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.580
Ice Climber.

36:43.580 --> 36:44.580
Yes.

36:44.580 --> 36:45.580
Goonies 2.

36:45.580 --> 36:46.580
Yes.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.580
Uh, Metroid.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.580
Yes.

36:48.580 --> 36:49.580
And...

36:49.580 --> 36:50.580
Aw, crap.

36:50.580 --> 36:51.580
Um...

36:51.580 --> 36:52.580
I should write down more of these.

36:52.580 --> 36:53.580
That's all I got.

36:53.580 --> 36:54.580
You sure?

36:54.580 --> 36:55.580
You have 20 more seconds.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.580
I'm thinking.

36:56.580 --> 37:00.180
I only wrote down like half of them.

37:00.180 --> 37:03.020
Just start naming titles, you might get it.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.020
Time's almost up!

37:04.020 --> 37:05.020
No.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.020
Five seconds.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.020
That's true.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.020
And...

37:08.020 --> 37:09.020
Time's up!

37:09.020 --> 37:11.780
All right, yep, it's tied up.

37:11.780 --> 37:14.740
Ravenstaufen got five and Loki got five.

37:14.740 --> 37:16.380
So it's all tied up.

37:16.380 --> 37:17.740
And since I wasn't creative enough

37:17.740 --> 37:19.460
to think of a tiebreaker, it will just

37:19.460 --> 37:21.340
have to be a stalemate, OK?

37:21.340 --> 37:22.100
That's fine by me.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.060
All right, so Ravenstaufen, you know what?

37:24.060 --> 37:25.020
We could be nice.

37:25.020 --> 37:25.580
What do you think, Loki?

37:25.580 --> 37:27.140
Should we just give him the prize anyway?

37:27.140 --> 37:27.540
Sure.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.100
All right, Ravenstaufen, we'll see you back here in two weeks.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.100
You're going to help us out with the DDR Power Preview, OK?

37:33.100 --> 37:34.540
Ooh, can't wait.

37:34.540 --> 37:35.900
All right, sounds good.

37:35.900 --> 37:37.260
That's genuine excitement.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.820
But Ravenstaufen, I bet you're dying to know what the correct answers were.

37:40.820 --> 37:41.820
I'm dying.

37:41.820 --> 37:42.820
Alright, here we go.

37:42.820 --> 37:43.820
Here they are, chat room.

37:43.820 --> 37:44.820
Metroid.

37:44.820 --> 37:49.820
I can't believe no one got the next one.

37:49.820 --> 37:51.820
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!

37:51.820 --> 37:54.660
I forgot to write it down, that's why I did it by memory.

37:54.660 --> 37:56.660
Super Mario Bros. 3.

37:56.660 --> 37:57.660
Willow.

37:57.660 --> 37:58.660
Shadowgate.

37:58.660 --> 37:59.660
I should remember that.

37:59.660 --> 38:06.660
Shadow Gates.

38:10.380 --> 38:15.260
Final Fantasy.

38:15.260 --> 38:22.180
Ice Climber.

38:22.180 --> 38:29.180
Goonies 2

38:30.780 --> 38:35.100
Gyruss, which you DDR people should know. Gyruss.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.300
And lastly, Ninja Gaiden.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.740
That was the 10.

38:39.740 --> 38:43.480
You should be lucky that you did not pick me because I got 6.

38:43.480 --> 38:48.860
Oh, thank god. Well, I would have had 6 too had I wrote down all the titles instead of saying,

38:48.860 --> 38:50.220
I'll remember the first two.

38:50.220 --> 38:53.260
I think I would have got like three, so I was the easy kill.

38:53.260 --> 38:55.140
So you could have won flat out if you tried to do that.

38:55.140 --> 38:58.380
But I told the chatroom I knew a lot of them, so I saved face.

38:58.380 --> 39:01.820
But now that I admitted it, I lost my saving face.

39:01.820 --> 39:04.020
All right, chatroom once posted there,

39:04.020 --> 39:07.460
so I will post the list there on orangelaundraider.com.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.340
Click on Chat.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.940
There's the list for you folks in chat.

39:09.940 --> 39:11.760
Ravenstaufen, thanks so much for playing our dumb little game

39:11.760 --> 39:12.260
with us.

39:12.260 --> 39:14.500
Sorry you did not get to beat the host tonight,

39:14.500 --> 39:15.540
but maybe next time.

39:15.540 --> 39:16.880
You got to push him a little bit.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.500
It was a push.

39:18.500 --> 39:22.020
yeah that was fun all right anything else you want to share with listeners before we uh let you

39:22.020 --> 39:28.420
go and get back to the news snakes on a plane looks funny the way you said that was funny i

39:28.420 --> 39:34.100
have to say and it is funny in a very dark sort of way all right it's like a dark comedy it's

39:34.100 --> 39:38.900
great all right take care ravens dolphin have a good one bye that was really weird how he said

39:38.900 --> 39:45.060
that yeah he got really excited about that one he kind of sounded like um god what's that ashtin

39:45.060 --> 39:50.440
Kuchar when he said that a little bit anyway I was trying to see how well the

39:50.440 --> 39:52.860
chat room did there looks like some folks really like the game I want to see

39:52.860 --> 39:56.280
that again so we'll do that so it looks like willow is the big stumper for most

39:56.280 --> 39:59.760
people there but for what it's worth I thought the last one was double dragon

39:59.760 --> 40:03.320
not Ninja Gaiden I know very close for next time to write down everything I

40:03.320 --> 40:07.320
hear instead of just saying oh I'll remember those and not to go it's tough

40:07.320 --> 40:10.600
I figured folks in chat would really like that game and the folks listening

40:10.600 --> 40:13.280
on the podcast because you kind of get to play you should have done more random

40:13.280 --> 40:17.400
games like throwing a pickle cubicle or something like that. You know what, if we do it again,

40:17.400 --> 40:20.320
maybe it'll be Super Nintendo, maybe we'll be arcade. You know, if I wanted to be really

40:20.320 --> 40:27.560
mean, I'd do Commodore 64 games. Do Virtual Boy games. Alright. Maybe some other time

40:27.560 --> 40:31.760
we'll do Beat the Host with a stick, but for now we're going to get back into the gaming

40:31.760 --> 40:36.400
news. Anyways, there is a rumor going around this week that Walmart had stopped selling

40:36.400 --> 40:46.720
bully because of pressure from a certain somebody and we'll call him J.T. and rhymes with Fuck

40:46.720 --> 40:56.160
Omsen. Anyways, it's not. It didn't have anything to do with him and it says, it's actually

40:56.160 --> 41:02.180
because they decided as a company policy not to take pre-orders on titles that aren't rated

41:02.180 --> 41:08.900
yet and it was funny though because Walmart spokesperson John Simley he made

41:08.900 --> 41:12.380
a comment he saw I'd like to give credit to Jack Thompson but there are a lot of

41:12.380 --> 41:16.380
Jack Thompson's out there and we are just listening to our customers I think

41:16.380 --> 41:21.260
he means there are a lot of jack offs out there and it says the decision has

41:21.260 --> 41:26.740
not been made on whether the chain will which sells 127 million customers a day

41:26.740 --> 41:30.740
will carry boldly once it is rated and available for sale it says if it comes

41:30.740 --> 41:35.900
out as adults only. We think that's something that we're not going to carry. I think first

41:35.900 --> 41:39.740
we look at the rating, but more likely it's going to be mature.

41:39.740 --> 41:44.460
I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart anyway because indirectly you're supporting

41:44.460 --> 41:49.660
their electronics department, which would be the music as well, and I hate, hate, hate

41:49.660 --> 41:53.840
the fact they censor music the way they do. They refuse to sell CDs in the store unless

41:53.840 --> 41:59.540
there's like a clean version. It's like, you know, here at Walmart we're going to sell

41:59.540 --> 42:05.380
the statue of David, but we've put, you know, tighty-whities on it, you know, it's like,

42:05.380 --> 42:09.780
that's not, you've ruined the art, you know, I don't, anyway, this is kind of getting a

42:09.780 --> 42:12.860
little bit outside, but I'm not a big fan of buying games at Walmart, and I realize

42:12.860 --> 42:16.540
some folks feel they have no other choice, living in a remote area, you know, where maybe

42:16.540 --> 42:22.180
Walmart is the only big game retailer you have, but, online, my friends, seriously,

42:22.180 --> 42:25.140
I would rather buy my, even if I lived in the middle of nowhere, I would rather buy

42:25.140 --> 42:28.440
my games online than buy them at Walmart.

42:28.440 --> 42:31.460
And this show will never be carried to Walmart, thanks to my little rant there, but that's

42:31.460 --> 42:32.460
alright.

42:32.460 --> 42:33.460
I don't care.

42:33.460 --> 42:39.140
Oh, we're too far off the radar for Big Bad Walmart.

42:39.140 --> 42:44.380
I will admit I bought my copy of 99 Nights at Target, which probably isn't much better,

42:44.380 --> 42:49.620
but the other place I wanted to go to first was out of it, and I really wanted 99 Nights.

42:49.620 --> 42:53.540
Hey, Target got a mention in a Freezepop song that makes them okay by me.

42:53.540 --> 42:55.500
Call me a hypocrite if you want, I don't care.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.420
All right, this is some pretty interesting news

42:58.420 --> 43:02.420
here regarding the Xbox and the Xbox Live Vision camera.

43:02.420 --> 43:04.100
The Xbox Live Vision camera is going

43:04.100 --> 43:07.540
to come out with a game called Totem Ball.

43:07.540 --> 43:09.580
And when the Vision camera launches in September,

43:09.580 --> 43:11.180
this will be included with it.

43:11.180 --> 43:14.860
Totem Ball was developed by UK studio Strange Flavor

43:14.860 --> 43:17.780
and Freeverse, who made Toy Sight for the Apple Eye Sight.

43:17.780 --> 43:19.980
Was this the game we played at E3 for a little bit?

43:19.980 --> 43:20.740
I seem to remember.

43:20.740 --> 43:22.940
But it was on the PC camera, wasn't it?

43:22.940 --> 43:25.700
No, it was the Vision Camera.

43:25.700 --> 43:31.700
It just, it sucked because there's people walking behind you, so you had to raise like one hand to...

43:31.700 --> 43:34.740
It was, you used your hands, like think of Itoy, basically.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.940
It was like trying to play Itoy with the Today Show behind you,

43:37.940 --> 43:41.140
that whole set where they have all the people moving and it just throws everything off.

43:41.140 --> 43:41.860
You couldn't do it.

43:41.860 --> 43:45.020
However, though, there is some rumors, though.

43:45.020 --> 43:49.780
Actually, I should say that that might not exactly be true, that Totem Ball's coming with it.

43:49.780 --> 43:58.280
The reason being is that some of the Live Vision cameras have actually sneaked out in Toys R Us lately, and some people have already purchased them.

43:58.280 --> 44:08.780
And they said that it's included one month of Xbox Live Gold, as well as a registration key for UNO, as I previously said on a podcast.

44:08.780 --> 44:19.280
But, what you might end up finding out a little bit later on, as I think I mentioned before, there is two bundles that they're going to be having.

44:19.280 --> 44:26.380
one that's for $39.99 and one that's $79.99 and the $79.99 one might come with totem ball

44:26.380 --> 44:30.240
and I think it's supposed to come with a year of Xbox Live Gold as well.

44:30.240 --> 44:31.240
Interesting.

44:31.240 --> 44:36.520
All right, well we're going to go to the Skype line right now and take your calls.

44:36.520 --> 44:40.660
If you want to call our show, you can hit us up on the Skype line at interact with us

44:40.660 --> 44:47.160
over on orange launchradio.com or you can pick up the phone and call us, call us, 916-226-9067,

44:47.160 --> 44:51.300
But remember, that is not an 800 number, so if you're not paying the phone bill, you best

44:51.300 --> 44:52.420
be getting some permission.

44:52.420 --> 44:53.420
We already have a call.

44:53.420 --> 44:54.420
Let's go to the line.

44:54.420 --> 44:55.420
Hello?

44:55.420 --> 44:56.420
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

44:56.420 --> 44:57.420
Who's this?

44:57.420 --> 44:58.420
Hey, Rob.

44:58.420 --> 45:00.200
It's the other Drew.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.880
The other Drew.

45:01.880 --> 45:05.640
Is this the Drew that goes by Cutress online?

45:05.640 --> 45:06.640
That would be it.

45:06.640 --> 45:07.640
Hey, how you doing?

45:07.640 --> 45:08.640
Hey, it's Cutress.

45:08.640 --> 45:09.640
Hey, Shane.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.640
What's up?

45:10.640 --> 45:11.640
And Suikoden sucks.

45:11.640 --> 45:12.640
What?

45:12.640 --> 45:15.640
Kick him off right now.

45:15.640 --> 45:16.640
No, no, no.

45:16.640 --> 45:20.640
No, no, no. I gotta let him plug the site he works for.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.640
Shouldn't I boot in?

45:21.640 --> 45:25.640
No, we're good buddies with this site. So, Cutrus, where do you work, quote-unquote?

45:25.640 --> 45:28.640
I guess it's more of a hobby, but so is what we do.

45:28.640 --> 45:33.640
Oh, well, it's not like I was just calling in to plug DDRFreak, but yeah, there you go.

45:33.640 --> 45:39.640
All right, I wanted to let you plug DDRFreak, though. So, what are you calling in about tonight?

45:39.640 --> 45:44.640
Well, first off, I had to make sure that everyone knew that Sui Godin sucks.

45:44.640 --> 45:47.280
Why are you letting him still talk?

45:47.280 --> 45:48.280
Because it's funny.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.280
It's not.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.560
He's saying lies.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.560
Let's take a quick vote.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.560
How many people think...

45:53.560 --> 45:54.560
Me!

45:54.560 --> 45:55.560
And that's all I...

45:55.560 --> 45:56.560
No.

45:56.560 --> 45:57.560
Shh.

45:57.560 --> 45:58.560
How many people think Cutress is funny in the room?

45:58.560 --> 45:59.560
Let's see.

45:59.560 --> 46:00.560
Oh.

46:00.560 --> 46:01.560
Well, we got two.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.560
Oh.

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560
And how many people think Cutress is not funny?

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
And we have two.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.560
Me.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.560
Oh, and I break ties.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.560
No.

46:07.560 --> 46:13.780
Actually, the two full-time hosts here voted that he is funny and the two peon guests voted

46:13.780 --> 46:16.360
that he wasn't funny. I'm going to delete a lot of stuff off your

46:16.360 --> 46:19.820
computer tonight. Cutress, please stop poking me.

46:19.820 --> 46:23.320
Look, let's stop taking up his time. Cutress, please, whatever you want to say on your mind

46:23.320 --> 46:28.940
besides the fact that Suikoden sucks. Well, for one thing, next time you do the

46:28.940 --> 46:33.100
music game, you need to have Mega Man music in there because that's sort of mandatory.

46:33.100 --> 46:37.680
Look, I have to save something for next time. I couldn't blow the Blaster Master wad on

46:37.680 --> 46:42.180
the first go, okay? And Mega Man and all that other stuff.

46:42.180 --> 46:46.180
You know I love me some Mega Man and some Blaster Master, but I have to wait.

46:46.180 --> 46:50.180
Yeah, if you had gotten me in, I would have gotten seven of ten.

46:50.180 --> 46:54.180
Oh, looks like I do have some competition.

46:54.180 --> 46:58.180
A little Drew vs. Drew action, huh?

46:58.180 --> 47:01.180
That sounds like a porno, be quiet.

47:01.180 --> 47:02.180
That was the intent.

47:02.180 --> 47:05.180
What games have you been playing lately, Drew?

47:05.180 --> 47:09.180
Well, I just finished Dragon Quest a couple days ago.

47:09.180 --> 47:15.500
I'm pretty much wrapping up all the rest of the endgame stuff in that, and pretty much

47:15.500 --> 47:23.500
everything I have is packed up right now. I kept out Front Mission 4 and Curse of Darkness.

47:23.500 --> 47:24.500
Very cool.

47:24.500 --> 47:30.420
So that's basically all I've got until I move into my new house and unpack everything again.

47:30.420 --> 47:35.020
I just quit FF11 so that I could finally start playing my console games again.

47:35.020 --> 47:39.040
uh... i remember quitting final fantasy eleven to free myself to play other video

47:39.040 --> 47:41.640
games you come back you always do

47:41.640 --> 47:44.300
i remember when i quit also

47:44.300 --> 47:47.240
didn't happen last night or today

47:47.240 --> 47:50.820
yet by the way i think that's fine backup from has eleven last night

47:50.820 --> 47:54.460
because he's weak you we everybody he's weak

47:54.460 --> 47:55.660
we're going to see why

47:55.660 --> 47:56.900
that

47:56.900 --> 47:59.860
i've got to have this real quick

47:59.860 --> 48:01.740
he said is why you like secret

48:01.740 --> 48:03.620
i like sweet sweet cones

48:03.620 --> 48:07.380
Suikoden's good, it's not as good as Phom Pants. He's not getting this mic again as long as you're on the

48:07.380 --> 48:11.380
pipeline. Before, okay, before Miggletov cries and we have a scene, Cutress, I have to ask you, since you

48:11.380 --> 48:13.500
are, you know, the forum guy on DDR Freak,

48:13.500 --> 48:17.020
anybody who's on DDR Freak knows you, I gotta know, what do you think about

48:17.020 --> 48:18.140
DDR Supernova?

48:18.140 --> 48:22.820
You know, I've gotten to play it only once and I only played

48:22.820 --> 48:26.500
two games of it and basically I was just so out of shape and

48:26.500 --> 48:29.900
out of whack that I decided it wasn't worth playing anymore

48:29.900 --> 48:32.900
because I was taking up too much time from other people. I know people are

48:32.900 --> 48:37.220
complaining about the sink and everything, but I haven't noticed any problems myself.

48:37.220 --> 48:40.540
I'm enjoying it. It's fun. That's all there really is to it.

48:40.540 --> 48:45.100
No, I didn't notice the sink problems either. I have a life. But I agree with you on the

48:45.100 --> 48:49.060
fact that we all got out of shape because Konami didn't put out a new game for forever.

48:49.060 --> 48:53.780
We all got burned out on Extreme and now we're all fat and don't want to play DDR again.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.660
Wait, sink? Get it?

48:56.660 --> 48:57.500
Shut up!

48:57.500 --> 49:07.060
I'm not the sort of guy that runs vertex squared through my head when I'm having sex, so I

49:07.060 --> 49:08.700
don't notice these sync issues.

49:08.700 --> 49:10.220
Oh, and the group sucks.

49:10.220 --> 49:11.220
Wow.

49:11.220 --> 49:12.220
Okay.

49:12.220 --> 49:15.300
Cutress, anything else you want to share with our listeners so we can take more calls?

49:15.300 --> 49:19.580
No, just thanks for having me on the show again, and I wish I could hang out with you

49:19.580 --> 49:20.580
guys more.

49:20.580 --> 49:21.580
Not a problem.

49:21.580 --> 49:22.580
Come visit the Bay.

49:22.580 --> 49:25.180
It's a real bummer about E3, but maybe there'll be something.

49:25.180 --> 49:27.740
We should have a DDR con or something fun.

49:27.740 --> 49:28.660
Yeah, hopefully.

49:28.660 --> 49:30.300
I can't wait to hang out with you guys again.

49:30.300 --> 49:30.960
Sounds good.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.740
Have a good one, Cutrus.

49:31.740 --> 49:32.260
Take care.

49:32.260 --> 49:33.540
Bye.

49:33.540 --> 49:34.620
Bye-bye.

49:34.620 --> 49:36.860
All right, thank you, Cutrus, for being on the program tonight.

49:36.860 --> 49:37.860
Let's take another call.

49:37.860 --> 49:38.860
Drew, real quick.

49:38.860 --> 49:40.140
Yeah, how's that for new low?

49:40.140 --> 49:41.980
I'm actually making get it jokes on the air.

49:41.980 --> 49:42.620
Be quiet.

49:42.620 --> 49:43.660
Let's go to another call.

49:43.660 --> 49:45.080
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

49:45.080 --> 49:45.740
Who's this?

49:45.740 --> 49:46.380
It's Ronma.

49:46.380 --> 49:47.980
Who do you think it is?

49:47.980 --> 49:49.460
Hello, Ronma.

49:49.460 --> 49:51.580
God, you have a way of getting through every week.

49:51.580 --> 49:52.140
What's on your mind?

49:52.140 --> 49:54.460
We're getting hammered tonight, too, and you get through.

49:54.460 --> 49:58.820
Oh, I have three things I want to talk about, three things.

49:58.820 --> 50:00.380
Make them quick.

50:00.380 --> 50:01.380
Number one.

50:01.380 --> 50:05.660
First thing, this whole high def versus standard definition, fuck it.

50:05.660 --> 50:10.260
I have a nice 20 inch TV, it's standard def, it looks great.

50:10.260 --> 50:16.020
I don't care about this high def fly through, it's just a console, I mean, I just don't

50:16.020 --> 50:17.820
get it, you know, it's just...

50:17.820 --> 50:18.820
Okay.

50:18.820 --> 50:22.020
Rama, surely you've heard this old saying, okay, have you ever heard this old saying,

50:22.020 --> 50:26.460
once you go black you never go back. That's because we won't let you go free.

50:26.460 --> 50:31.100
Yeah, same, apply that thought to an HDTV,

50:31.100 --> 50:34.220
seriously, because like once I bought an HDTV

50:34.220 --> 50:37.740
I can't watch standard anymore. I know,

50:37.740 --> 50:41.820
I used to play my PS2 on a 55 inch high definition TV,

50:41.820 --> 50:46.020
but when I moved I had a 20 inch SD, standard deaf television,

50:46.020 --> 50:49.100
to me it just looks the same. I enjoyed both of it, you know?

50:49.100 --> 50:56.260
All right, well, you know, I I can appreciate that because that tells me that you are about the game first the graphic second

50:56.820 --> 51:00.620
Yes, definitely. All right. What's the second thing you want to call it about?

51:02.100 --> 51:08.140
I was kind of tired of the other DDR families in chat. Shut up. It's just a game

51:08.380 --> 51:14.780
What what were they saying in chat? I missed it. I mean, we're it was like if your announcement about DDR

51:15.340 --> 51:17.680
Somebody said you guys sold up the Konami. I'm like

51:17.680 --> 51:40.200
We are a radio station, and on radio stations they play music, DDR of which has a lot of

51:40.200 --> 51:41.240
music.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.240
This partnership makes a lot of sense to me.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.840
I don't know about the rest of you.

51:44.840 --> 51:48.960
This is something that we would have done for Konami three years ago, but whatever.

51:48.960 --> 51:49.960
It's finally happening now.

51:49.960 --> 51:50.960
It's great.

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
All right.

51:51.960 --> 51:52.960
Here you go.

51:52.960 --> 51:53.960
Number three.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.960
The last thing is the whole thing about the PS3.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.960
It's $400, $500.

51:57.960 --> 52:04.320
Some people are forgetting about another console that came out that was just as expensive.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.320
What's that?

52:05.320 --> 52:06.320
NeoGeo.

52:06.320 --> 52:07.320
Ah.

52:07.320 --> 52:11.160
But then again, the NeoGeo wasn't exactly...

52:11.160 --> 52:16.320
The Neo Geo was like the rich kid system, you know what I mean?

52:16.320 --> 52:18.840
Everybody knew some rich kid who actually had a Neo Geo.

52:18.840 --> 52:22.520
And the difference is, it had games that kicked major amounts of ass.

52:22.520 --> 52:27.040
It did, but it also, towards at least the end of the run, like you know the first wave

52:27.040 --> 52:30.200
of games was pretty cool, but towards the end of the run it was all Bust-A-Move, King

52:30.200 --> 52:32.440
of Fighters, you know, 99, all that stuff.

52:32.440 --> 52:36.240
I mean, that's all it ever was in the end, which is kinda sadder than something wrong

52:36.240 --> 52:37.240
with King of Fighters?

52:37.240 --> 52:40.720
No, but I'm just saying, I wouldn't buy a console just for King of Fighters.

52:40.720 --> 52:44.400
Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the Neo Geo, but I wouldn't have spent that much money

52:44.400 --> 52:45.400
on it.

52:45.400 --> 52:50.900
Yeah, exactly. I mean, all the Neo-Jillies is King of Fighters. You know what, fuck King of Fighters.

52:50.900 --> 52:55.900
I like King of Fighters, not some impact for the PS2, because it's got great graphics or whatever.

52:55.900 --> 53:01.900
Each version is just like, same thing, new characters. David, come on. Show me something I'm gonna enjoy.

53:01.900 --> 53:06.400
Neo-Wave, I was happy for it. It got ported back to SNK Arcade, but I mean, fuck, come on.

53:06.400 --> 53:11.900
What is Madden? What is Madden? It's the same game over and over with little upgrades, right?

53:11.900 --> 53:16.980
Thatís why I donít play men, I play Tecmo Bowl.

53:16.980 --> 53:17.980
Tecmo Bowl for life.

53:17.980 --> 53:18.980
Rama, weíve got to let you go.

53:18.980 --> 53:19.980
Take more calls.

53:19.980 --> 53:24.780
One more thing, rat race of three, PS2, thatís why I wonít, bye.

53:24.780 --> 53:28.700
With the 3D glasses, I hope.

53:28.700 --> 53:32.140
Your calls, weíre taking them tonight here on orangeloundrater.com.

53:32.140 --> 53:36.660
Go to www.orangeloundrater.com and click on ìinteract with usî or you can always pick

53:36.660 --> 53:41.420
up the telephone and call us that way, 916-226-9067.

53:41.420 --> 53:44.900
Hey, podcast listeners, are you pissed off at the call-in segment because it's always

53:44.900 --> 53:46.500
the same people calling in?

53:46.500 --> 53:48.380
Well, you should call us sometime.

53:48.380 --> 53:50.860
Hi, you're on Warner's Lounge Radio.

53:50.860 --> 53:51.860
Who's this?

53:51.860 --> 53:52.860
It's DMN.

53:52.860 --> 53:53.860
Hi, DMN.

53:53.860 --> 53:56.620
What's on your mind?

53:56.620 --> 53:57.740
Not much.

53:57.740 --> 54:03.620
I wanted to comment about the whole BDR TV show thing, too, but first I want to congratulate

54:03.620 --> 54:07.300
you guys on getting that association with Kami.

54:07.300 --> 54:09.380
I'm really excited about hearing the new music.

54:09.380 --> 54:10.380
We're excited about it, too.

54:10.380 --> 54:11.380
I think itís going to be a fun time.

54:11.380 --> 54:12.380
Thank you.

54:12.380 --> 54:16.900
Now, letís bag on the TV show a little bit.

54:16.900 --> 54:23.820
Iím going to be a bit of a devilís advocate about this whole slumber party gang thing.

54:23.820 --> 54:24.820
Fair enough.

54:24.820 --> 54:25.820
We need it.

54:25.820 --> 54:27.540
Youíve got to look.

54:27.540 --> 54:32.900
Whenever youíre at the arcade being the seasoned DVR veterans that all of us are, who do you

54:32.900 --> 54:37.700
see annoys the ever-loving shit out of you on those machines?

54:37.700 --> 54:39.860
The target audience is slumber party girls.

54:39.860 --> 54:48.220
I think Konami is targeting that demographic.

54:48.220 --> 54:49.580
I think they're doing it right.

54:49.580 --> 54:55.300
I think it's going to be a laughing stock set for the rest of us, but I think it'll

54:55.300 --> 54:59.220
catch whoever watches Saturday morning TV and it'll sell more copies, and that's what

54:59.220 --> 55:00.220
Konami wants to do.

55:00.220 --> 55:01.220
Right.

55:01.220 --> 55:03.060
And to play devil's advocate to devil's advocate.

55:03.060 --> 55:07.860
I understand what Konami is trying to do with that, and you do make a good point.

55:07.860 --> 55:14.660
But you can't help, but as a long-time DDR fan, before there were little girls everywhere,

55:14.660 --> 55:19.260
you can't help but cringe a little bit inside, because this doesn't help the whole people

55:19.260 --> 55:23.060
walking behind the machine going, that's gay thing that I was talking about earlier, you

55:23.060 --> 55:24.060
know?

55:24.060 --> 55:27.740
Yeah, well no, I cringe at the thought too, but I see where they're going from a business

55:27.740 --> 55:28.740
standpoint.

55:28.740 --> 55:32.500
So, I kind of wish if they're going to do this, that they would also do a DDR macho

55:32.500 --> 55:35.340
show on Spike TV as well or something.

55:35.340 --> 55:36.700
No, I don't know.

55:36.700 --> 55:44.740
I think you can't let society, and this goes with anything, you can't let society tell

55:44.740 --> 55:49.220
you what to do essentially, and if you enjoy something, you should wear it proud, you know

55:49.220 --> 55:50.220
what I mean?

55:50.220 --> 55:52.460
So even though we joke about, you know, we don't like the people that come behind the

55:52.460 --> 56:00.560
machine and go, that's gay, that's gay, I think that you should have enough confidence

56:00.560 --> 56:04.540
in yourself to be able to do whatever you want, you know what I mean?

56:04.540 --> 56:08.260
And I think if you do, and DDR is a very social game, a friendly game, and I remember some

56:08.260 --> 56:13.300
kid once did this to me when I was on the machine, and Jamie tore him a new asshole.

56:13.300 --> 56:15.860
He was like, do you want to challenge him on the game?

56:15.860 --> 56:16.860
Do you want to fight?

56:16.860 --> 56:21.760
Here, I will pay for you to play against Rob, and we'll see who does better on the game.

56:21.760 --> 56:24.520
So that situation has happened with all of us.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.740
That's why Jamie's on this program, by the way, because she has her moments of gold like

56:27.740 --> 56:29.460
that, which you just got to love.

56:29.460 --> 56:30.520
You just got to love.

56:30.520 --> 56:34.240
I think we should look on the bright side of this whole slumber party, girls, though.

56:34.240 --> 56:35.800
appeal to the uh...

56:35.800 --> 56:40.540
twenty-something female demographic who thinks it's oddly cute

56:40.540 --> 56:44.620
might get more of a turnout in the arcades there. Alright, DMN, anything else you want to share with the listeners?

56:44.620 --> 56:46.200
Um, go to PAX

56:46.200 --> 56:49.520
and the Wii's coming soon.

56:49.520 --> 56:53.640
Alright, thank you very much, we appreciate that. Alright. Alright, bye bye. Take care guys.

56:53.640 --> 56:57.240
Alright, let's do at least one more call here on Orange Lounge Radio and then we'll

56:57.240 --> 56:59.000
uh... probably go and tie up the show.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.360
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

57:01.360 --> 57:02.780
uh... yes this is bobby

57:02.780 --> 57:05.740
hi bobby you mean bobby blackwolf

57:05.740 --> 57:07.720
sure okay yes

57:07.720 --> 57:11.800
uh... bobby blackwolf who does a show on all games dot com sunday nights five

57:11.800 --> 57:13.520
o'clock pacific and hit

57:13.520 --> 57:15.480
uh... what's on your mind

57:15.480 --> 57:19.320
uh... well i just i wanted to share my opinion on something real quick lies

57:19.320 --> 57:22.740
these are lies that he's going to be talking about this game

57:22.740 --> 57:26.500
it is called sui coden ah yes sui coden i've heard of this game

57:26.500 --> 57:30.760
can we hang up on him please? didn't you get your name from a character in sui coden

57:30.760 --> 57:33.480
Yes, he's the best character ever.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.160
An ambiguously gay character.

57:35.160 --> 57:36.160
Ambiguous.

57:36.160 --> 57:40.280
Alright, uh, yes, Bobby, I'd love to know your thoughts on Sweet Coden.

57:40.280 --> 57:41.800
I thought it sucked.

57:41.800 --> 57:43.680
I think you suck.

57:43.680 --> 57:46.560
Okay, why does Sweet Coden suck?

57:46.560 --> 57:48.720
No, it's mainly just to piss Miklotov off.

57:48.720 --> 57:49.720
Yeah, oh okay.

57:49.720 --> 57:50.720
And it works.

57:50.720 --> 57:51.720
You actually think it's a good game?

57:51.720 --> 57:52.720
Deep inside?

57:52.720 --> 57:54.400
I like the first and the third one.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.800
What about two?

57:55.800 --> 57:57.160
Besides the translation.

57:57.160 --> 57:59.320
It was so hard to find.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.400
I haven't played it.

58:00.400 --> 58:05.120
I can't even find it. Oh, yeah, cuz it's like two hundred fifty dollars. Yeah, I'm not gonna pay 25

58:05.120 --> 58:07.120
I wrote that game really well

58:07.760 --> 58:09.760
All right

58:09.880 --> 58:12.280
Bobby anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

58:12.920 --> 58:16.360
No, that was it. I was just doing this for the chat room. All right, I appreciate it

58:17.960 --> 58:19.960
Take care Bobby

58:20.200 --> 58:25.480
Comedy gold you can hear little gems like that on his program. I like how people call in to make me wine

58:25.480 --> 58:30.560
That's why you're here, that's why you're here, because you're a whiner.

58:30.560 --> 58:35.960
All right, any last minute stories, folks, on Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

58:35.960 --> 58:36.960
But of course.

58:36.960 --> 58:37.960
Okay.

58:37.960 --> 58:42.400
So we'll start off with some wonderful homebrew programs, of course.

58:42.400 --> 58:47.480
If you are a fan of Metroid and you want to play a new side-scrolling version of Metroid,

58:47.480 --> 58:54.900
they have Metroid Return of the SA-X 2.0 for the PSP.

58:54.900 --> 58:59.660
And this one, of course, is still kind of a work in progress. They just now added a

58:59.660 --> 59:05.060
health bar and the ability to go into more than one room. So, yeah, that's interesting.

59:05.060 --> 59:12.060
But it's still in development, so look forward to more stuff from that. And, of course, if

59:12.060 --> 59:17.900
you're looking for a nice clone, in fact, I think a lot of people got in trouble for

59:17.900 --> 59:23.460
the Grid Wars. Now they have Trigonometry Wars, the final version, out for the PSP.

59:23.460 --> 59:30.460
and you download it on PSP updates. Definitely something fun if you like Geometry Wars.

59:30.640 --> 59:33.660
I heard about all the scandal going around there with Geometry Wars.

59:33.660 --> 59:37.220
Yeah. The clones at least. And people getting sued and stuff.

59:37.220 --> 59:40.980
I have one quick last minute story if you're done with that one. I just want to say real quick

59:40.980 --> 59:45.580
with Madden 07 coming out, Slashdot ran a recent

59:45.580 --> 59:48.980
piece reminding you that EA has a pretty

59:48.980 --> 59:52.940
interesting privacy policy on Xbox Live. Now you've probably heard this talked about

59:52.940 --> 59:56.020
about before on other shows, but remember, and I think we've talked about it too, but

59:56.020 --> 59:57.920
remember the Madden 07 is coming out soon.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.660
So when you sign on to an EA game on Xbox Live, you are automatically creating an EA

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:06.340
online account and granting Electronic Arts the ability to collect your name, address,

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.900
and credit card information, as well as a variety of demographic information about how

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:11.380
you use their products.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.140
Not only that, they explicitly say that they may tie these demographics to your personal

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.480
information.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.460
It's not anonymous here.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:22.860
Now a site called Gamers with Jobs actually cornered EA and Microsoft about these issues

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:27.820
and they were met with silence, probably because of the fact that Madden is coming out next

01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:28.820
week.

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:33.460
No official comment from the companies, which just goes to show that EA obviously must have

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.140
an evil, invasive privacy policy.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.580
So think twice before you play Madden Online.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:39.580
Yes, Drew.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.480
I do have an additional quickie.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.980
Just was released a couple days ago.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.280
We have the multiplayer version of F.E.A.R., F.E.A.R. Combat, has been released to the public

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.400
for free.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.180
You can sign up for a free CD key and a download of the game.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:58.800
I don't know the link offhand, but I know we have a link to it in our O.L. Army Clan

01:00:58.800 --> 01:00:59.800
section.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.360
I was going to say, there's already an O.L. Army Clan building up for this.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.960
I definitely want to check out the game next week.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.000
I just finished downloading and installing it.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.760
I'm going to be checking it out tonight.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.760
Very cool.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.600
Oh my god, I'm so scared of this game.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.600
I just saw...

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
What's that?

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:18.280
mentioned last week Happy Feet's coming out on the Wii. I've got happy feet

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:22.720
okay happy happy feet for those who don't know is kind of like a spoof of

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:29.200
will they have happy Wii okay no no no get this okay so happy happy feet

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:35.640
basically as you might know or not know it is a movie kind of spoofing the whole

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.920
March of the Penguins thing it's got penguins doing stuff however happy feet

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:47.480
the game is gonna be like DDR and with arrows and all so when I said you could

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:51.960
strap the Wii controller to your feet I I wasn't exactly too far off was I who

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.200
you were not interesting so that that's kind of interesting some other fun stuff

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:02.960
especially when again the speculation area here the PSP being redesigned kind

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:08.240
of almost like a PSP light supposed to be coming out in March you wonder where

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.520
got that idea. And, well, it says it's supposed to be like the PSP Lite, I didn't call it

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:19.520
the PSP Lite. Alright. Anyways, PSP 2 or whatever. It's gonna include 8 gigs of flash memory

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:28.120
for storing your wonderful movies and stuff on, as well as they're getting rid of the

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:34.400
UMD slot the way that it is now. You'll actually insert the UMDs into the system, like the

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:43.280
DS and just getting shrunken down like the DS and yeah so that's kind of

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.680
interesting and they're not really talking about how they're gonna oh a

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:52.280
second analog nub on there as well GS 68 in our chat room says please fix the D

01:02:52.280 --> 01:03:00.320
pad Sony um and then finally of course you gotta mention this speaking of

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:07.320
of speculation, the Xbox 360 is supposed to get another SKU. And apparently, rumor for

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:14.580
now, it's going to be a black Xbox 360 with a built-in HD DVD drive, an HDMI AV out, 250

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:21.400
gig hard drive, and PVR functions, like Xbox Live slash DirecTV or that kind of stuff.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.100
Planned for $600 U.S.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.320
Oh, yeah, that's a brilliant idea, Microsoft.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.960
This is in the official Xbox magazine, so, um, rumor for now.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.440
Wait, you had me going bullshit until you said it was in the official Xbox magazine?

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.040
Yeah, it's rumor though, probably.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.040
Okay.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.040
I don't know.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.880
A black Xbox 360, huh?

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:43.880
Something for the emo kids.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:44.880
Maybe, I don't know.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.560
It sounds a little weird, but, um, I don't know.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:53.600
And I finally, I thought I'd mention the lineup since Live Arcade Wednesdays is still going

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600
on.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.480
We had Texas Hold'em coming out free of charge, as we mentioned, for 48 hours.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:05.440
The week after that, though, we've seen some more stuff, including, I know, what was it,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440
Time Pilot?

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440
Yay!

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:08.440
Time Pilot, and then Scramble.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.440
Yeah, I can do without Scramble.

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.440
So.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:12.440
Yeah.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.440
That's it.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.440
Huh.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440
Interesting.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.440
As somebody mentioned in the chat room, and it's true, the black Xbox 360 isn't that special

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:22.120
because those are the dev kits, also.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.560
And you have the faceplates, too, right?

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.780
We mean you could make your Xbox 360 black looking with the new face

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:32.440
Well, I'm just saying we already have 360s in existence that are black

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:37.200
So it's not like a huge step up just like how the Xbox 1.0's

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.720
Dev kits were green like the halo Xboxes

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:44.080
Oh, I know I make sense and the better ones are the white ones are huge

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:50.920
I'd mention one last thing for the PSP another homebrew game our gear to tribute to our type and it looks fucking awesome

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.320
So go download it. All right, that's it. All right

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.000
Well, I guess it's about time to wrap up the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.400
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to us this week, but we do have one more story

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.240
for you guys tonight, Loki, and this is just, we saved this for the end because this is

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.200
just one of those WTF stories.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:15.080
Well, if you were a high school student, and of course in a math class you probably were

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:22.480
playing with a TI calculator, or TI-83 in this case, well, there's somebody creating

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:28.120
the homebrew Zelda game for it and yeah it's pretty much using some of the

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.920
sprites from like Link's Awakening and stuff and pretty amazing and I guess

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:41.640
apparently he's already done a port of Harvest Moon and so yeah it's 50% done

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.840
so far and it looks pretty cool. If I remember correctly they actually did

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:50.280
port Link's Awakening 2 at TI-83 back in the day. I remember the only completely

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.000
original Zelda game on a calculator?

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.160
The only good thing about the old graphing calculators was that, like, you could type

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.960
letters into them so you could essentially, like, I know I used to do this for calculus

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.800
tests all the time, I'd put in the notes in my calculator and cheat.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
Exactly.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800
Because I was smart.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.740
Well, I remember with, like, the TI-83, you know, big thing when I was just going in high

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:16.520
school is they actually, you know, finally got it to run assembly on there and then you

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:22.260
could do grayscale and just like crazy shit on a calculator I don't know I

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:26.780
remember that's how that's why I had to drop my calculus class because I was

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.540
programming games in it instead of listening a lot of ti-83 love in the

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:37.100
chat room gs68 says I use my ti-83 plus to play fire track kind of crappy shmup

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:42.220
and some folks are saying yay Zelda game and so on and so forth

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.740
evilcheese666 OMG I love those calculators

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:49.780
so a lot of love for the old graphing calculators alright

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.720
well that's about the end of the program but of course we have to go around to

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.380
get everybody's

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:57.780
final thought I'm sure if DarkSakura were here she would say reject faults

01:06:57.780 --> 01:06:58.500
icons

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:02.360
but she'll be back next week I should point out about next week

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.220
next week's show will not be taped live on Sunday night

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.980
this is because I know this is going to sound hella lame I have concert tickets on Sunday

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:14.460
that I got for my birthday but and the person didn't realize that I would have

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:17.920
orange lounge so of course I got to go because it's a birthday gift and I'm

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:22.860
going to see journey how cool is that I'm hoping they'll have the old-school

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:27.060
game there but yeah so we're gonna pre tape next week more news to come to the

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.260
live journal community we will probably pre tape live earlier in the week we'll

01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.020
let you know when as soon as we work it out between the three of us let's go

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.780
