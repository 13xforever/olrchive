Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, August 27th, 2006, Robin Loki Report on the Konami BBQ

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
How was that Nintendo press conference this week anyway?

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And how many Xbox Live points will you need to spend to play a full game of Luminous?

00:27.000 --> 00:36.240
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge

00:36.240 --> 00:37.240
Radio.

00:37.240 --> 00:41.840
We are that independent podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer

00:41.840 --> 00:42.840
lifestyle.

00:42.840 --> 00:43.840
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.520
You might know me as Sky and I'm here on this journey with you every single week.

00:47.520 --> 00:53.320
Also joining us in our party, say hello to our resident Black Mage, Dark Sakura, also

00:53.320 --> 00:58.920
known as Fuego. Jamie Summers. Fuego. Fuego3. Fern. Fern. Fern. See, that's why she's the

00:58.920 --> 01:04.920
Black Mage folks. And say hello to our resident treasure hunter, Loki. Hey. How you doing?

01:04.920 --> 01:10.640
Good. All right. Everybody have a good week? Yes? Oh, I sure did. Did you have a good week

01:10.640 --> 01:15.680
off, Dark Sakura? I went to Disneyland. Anything exciting going on Disneyland? Disneyland?

01:15.680 --> 01:20.520
We went to Disneyland during Bats Day. Bats Day? When the goth community of Los Angeles

01:20.520 --> 01:22.360
decides to take over Disneyland.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.200
You totally did that on purpose.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
No.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.960
She had had, we had this all scheduled out like months in advance before we even realized.

01:29.960 --> 01:33.860
So um, the baby bats came out in full force on uh, Sunday.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.560
So we avoided Haunted Mansion.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
And um.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.720
I could just imagine what Haunted Mansion looks like on Goth Day.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
They converged.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.180
While all the baby bats, there were a few legitimate old bats, but there were a lot

01:47.180 --> 01:50.280
of baby bats, you know, Hot Topic, Wannabe.

01:50.280 --> 01:55.000
I remember the old days when we used to have to shop in fetish stores and thrift shops

01:55.000 --> 01:57.680
and make our own clothes.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.320
But yeah, I rode pirates a bunch of times and like the second time we decided to sing

02:01.320 --> 02:08.600
through it and we called Barbossa Dreamboat Barbie because he was up on his boat.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.080
The changes they made to pirates were cool.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.920
Really because I thought most people have been saying they kind of suck because you

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
know.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.040
They did the PC changes and then they changed a few things back and added in the movie characters.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
Oh that's good.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.780
all the Jack stuff was like whoa Jack and then haunted mansion they actually

02:22.780 --> 02:26.180
changed part of it you've ever been in haunted mansion the attic with the bride

02:26.180 --> 02:31.760
where she's all tragic and sad instead now they've made her a bit more sinister

02:31.760 --> 02:37.260
where you go by different paintings of her and her various husbands and their

02:37.260 --> 02:43.020
heads all disappear and then you see a hologram of her holding an axe till

02:43.020 --> 02:50.500
death do us part okay well let's uh and um and Kristen pointed out something fun

02:50.500 --> 02:53.380
that the gardener before you go in the graveyard is wearing Walt Disney shoes

02:53.380 --> 02:58.020
huh I went on big Thunder Mountain was it fun oh yeah it's fun I couldn't see

02:58.020 --> 03:00.780
anything it's the new Space Mountain is cool oh we got to be careful not to

03:00.780 --> 03:03.620
become the amusement park podcast because we do want to get to games here

03:03.620 --> 03:06.820
so yeah all right tell us about it what's your gaming with was what you

03:06.820 --> 03:11.420
played this week um I played Dead Rising which was freaking rad and I'm not any

03:11.420 --> 03:17.480
good at it oops I died so many times and but I figured out that I like the size

03:17.480 --> 03:22.400
because it decapitates the undead and played in the Super Mario Brothers

03:22.400 --> 03:26.320
finally I got a free copy actually technically GameStop got a free copy and

03:26.320 --> 03:32.360
it became mine so I I played a bunch of that in the waiting room at the

03:32.360 --> 03:36.240
doctor's office good day because game boys are great to have in a doctor's

03:36.240 --> 03:44.160
office and I played some DDR and I'm kind of still okay at it sort of avoided

03:44.160 --> 03:50.120
the arcade though at Disneyland because it's like and the spawn of of people are

03:50.120 --> 03:54.160
hanging around and my quote from Disneyland though best quote ever this

03:54.160 --> 03:58.320
is totally makes me decide never to have children

03:58.320 --> 04:00.320
I wanna ride the teacups!

04:00.320 --> 04:06.320
Only the EHHH part was like a lot longer.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.320
Wow. Did you ride the teacups?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
Yes I did.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.320
That's my favorite.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.320
And I sang a merry end birthday while riding the teacups.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.320
Thank you for the lollipops by the way from Disneyland. I appreciate that.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.320
Aren't they fabulous?

04:16.320 --> 04:20.320
They're great. One of them is shaped very phallic-ly. Let's just leave it at that.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.320
I was like that one's for Rob.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.320
It's long. Anyway, any other games?

04:24.320 --> 04:26.320
I had lots of smoothies.

04:26.320 --> 04:34.900
Alright, Loki. Well, um, I played games this week. No, um, I was playing a lot of Xbox

04:34.900 --> 04:41.920
Live's demos, um, including Just Cause, which is awesome. It's very, I don't know, it's

04:41.920 --> 04:47.080
kind of like, not really Grand Theft Auto-ish, I mean, you can steal cars and stuff, but

04:47.080 --> 04:51.420
it reminds me if, like, you were to take Lord Croft Tomb Raider, replace Lord Croft with

04:51.420 --> 04:57.960
Antonio Banderas and then stick her in like a Grand Theft Auto game and then I don't know

04:57.960 --> 05:02.760
just add a bunch of stunts to it and that's pretty much the game because you can do a

05:02.760 --> 05:07.120
lot of like really cool stuff like jumping from car to car and it makes it really simple

05:07.120 --> 05:11.480
or you can steal a car jump onto the roof and then hit your parachute and just you know

05:11.480 --> 05:16.760
parasail around and just really crazy stuff and then there's a whole lot of like Mexican

05:16.760 --> 05:22.920
you know music blaring and like lots of VIVA LA REVOLUTION you know stuff like that so it's

05:22.920 --> 05:28.600
pretty cool and definitely worth picking up when it comes out and the demo is also pretty cool

05:28.600 --> 05:33.320
they've give you about you know four different people to kill and uh i got to the point where

05:33.320 --> 05:39.240
there's helicopters chasing after me and i blew up on the helicopters and it exploded very fiery

05:39.240 --> 05:45.560
and it was awesome so definitely recommend that and then of course um was it i tried a little bit

05:45.560 --> 05:50.140
of Texas Hole and played like a game and just said eh, and I'll play it later when it's

05:50.140 --> 05:56.600
not so buggy. And then, um, what else did I play? Oh yeah, I got a retail copy of Saints

05:56.600 --> 06:01.800
Row four days early, so I decided to play a little bit of that and I'll probably play

06:01.800 --> 06:08.080
more this weekend. And yeah, I think that, oh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

06:08.080 --> 06:13.080
because that's still fucking awesome and we're still gonna be playing it until Vice City

06:13.080 --> 06:16.440
these stories come out, and then we're going to have the official switching of the game

06:16.440 --> 06:22.320
and play that for a year until San Andreas Stories comes out.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.040
My gaming week was kind of not that eventful, I didn't actually play a whole lot.

06:26.040 --> 06:31.360
As far as new stuff goes, I checked out Texas Hold'em, which was free on Xbox Live, so I

06:31.360 --> 06:32.560
downloaded that and played it.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.720
You know, it's kind of funny, I just was randomly up really late on Tuesday, so at 1 AM when

06:36.720 --> 06:40.880
the game was released, I actually downloaded it, and of course, in not even like 10 minutes

06:40.880 --> 06:45.200
I get an invite into an Xbox Live game and it was actually being run by another podcaster

06:45.200 --> 06:48.800
Godfrey over at Gamertag, so it was kind of cool that like, you know, we were getting

06:48.800 --> 06:51.420
together and playing on the Xbox Live.

06:51.420 --> 06:56.560
As far as Texas Hold'em goes, how I like the game itself, I don't think it's something

06:56.560 --> 06:57.800
I would have spent ten bucks on.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.440
I'm kind of glad they had that free period because, you know, the game does seem to still

07:01.440 --> 07:07.640
be a little bit buggy and, I don't know, I'm just not that excited by Texas Hold'em Poker.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.840
I think the whole thing's a little bit saturated to me, you know, with all the specials they

07:10.840 --> 07:14.920
they have on TV and all the other 5,000 poker clones they have out. I mean yeah

07:14.920 --> 07:18.580
it's kind of nice to have it on Xbox Live and you know I suppose if you're a

07:18.580 --> 07:22.120
poker fan you know this will be a really easy thing for you to pick up and it's

07:22.120 --> 07:24.920
probably cheaper even ten dollars than anything else is out there on the market.

07:24.920 --> 07:29.280
I'm surprised that they put the game out now. It's being that there's also two

07:29.280 --> 07:35.920
more poker games coming out all in poker and was it no World's in World Series of

07:35.920 --> 07:40.040
Poker Tournament of Champions are both coming out. Granted they're both gonna be

07:40.040 --> 07:45.200
$39.99, but still, I mean, you have this free game for Texas Hold'em, why am I gonna go

07:45.200 --> 07:51.420
buy a $40 game now? I mean, yeah. And granted it might be more polished, but it's a free

07:51.420 --> 07:55.360
game, it's Texas Hold'em, I mean, you can't really jazz up Texas Hold'em too much.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.460
I guess the nicest thing about it is that most of my friends online have it, so there's

07:59.460 --> 08:03.360
always at least one game we can play together, but I don't know, I just, I wish the pacing

08:03.360 --> 08:07.840
of the game could be sped up, especially in single player. Like, if I've already folded,

08:07.840 --> 08:11.280
I just want them to run through it. I don't really want to watch bet.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.560
You know, maybe it's just because I don't really watch on ESPN. I don't get

08:14.560 --> 08:15.760
the thrill of watching it.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.960
I do like some of the little subtleties they put in. For instance, when everybody

08:18.960 --> 08:20.080
does go all-in,

08:20.080 --> 08:23.480
like it shows that percentage of like the odds that you have to win the hand.

08:23.480 --> 08:27.040
So, you know, I don't know. That was kind of neat. And I do like the concept of having one

08:27.040 --> 08:27.840
bankroll

08:27.840 --> 08:32.040
that you build and build through. So like when you make bets, you can't just restart

08:32.040 --> 08:32.360
with a

08:32.360 --> 08:35.880
brand new bank. Like if you make a bet, that will impact your

08:35.880 --> 08:39.280
entire history on xbox live you could bet it all away so I

08:39.280 --> 08:42.880
I like that concept that's kinda neat so I'll give the game credit for that

08:42.880 --> 08:46.040
and I guess it looks good for an xbox live game but yeah why does it always

08:46.040 --> 08:49.880
why does it always pan up on the table deal and then pan back down like every time

08:49.880 --> 08:53.640
I didn't get that at all this some of the weird things and I thought it was supposed to

08:53.640 --> 08:54.640
support the camera

08:54.640 --> 08:58.040
and I know Godfrey had a camera and he said it wasn't doing anything so I don't

08:58.040 --> 09:01.520
I don't know whatever it's free

09:01.520 --> 09:05.320
can't complain about free things so what can I say I mean it was worth checking out

09:05.320 --> 09:09.820
But if you haven't already downloaded it, I don't think it's worth the $10.

09:09.820 --> 09:15.320
Maybe download the demo, see if you like it, I don't know. Or if you're really into poker, maybe you'll like it.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.320
But you probably already got it if you're really into poker.

09:17.320 --> 09:24.320
I was just thinking something. There's that game that's coming out, or the collection, the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged that's coming out.

09:24.320 --> 09:29.320
And we know that Texas Hold'em is going to be probably patched later on.

09:29.320 --> 09:34.320
But Live Arcade Unplugged is for people that don't have Live or don't have an internet connection.

09:34.320 --> 09:38.480
So they're going to be buying this game and getting a really buggy copy.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.000
But they're only playing single-player anyway. Yeah, but still though,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.400
it's still buggy. I don't know.

09:44.400 --> 09:48.240
Alright, well let's go ahead and get into some gaming news tonight.

09:48.240 --> 09:52.000
And we're going to start it off with a little report on Konami's fourth annual Summer

09:52.000 --> 09:54.920
Barbecue.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.040
Loki and I were at the Konami Summer Barbecue this week. Yes.

09:58.040 --> 10:02.480
And we saw a lot of new games. Yeah, that's cool. So let me just throw some games out there,

10:02.480 --> 10:03.640
we'll talk about them a little bit.

10:03.640 --> 10:08.520
Death Junior 2 on the PSP. It looked pretty good. I played the first Death Junior for

10:08.520 --> 10:09.680
about maybe an

10:09.680 --> 10:12.920
hour and I got bored of it pretty quick.

10:12.920 --> 10:16.680
It looked a lot better. Definitely rebuilt from the ground up and looks

10:16.680 --> 10:18.080
like the graphics are a lot better.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.240
To be honest, I mean, I've kind of outgrown the platform games like that, so it's

10:23.240 --> 10:25.560
not really appealing to me, but if anybody, you know,

10:25.560 --> 10:29.760
really is into that stuff, I think it's definitely a game that will be worth picking up.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.800
Yeah, the game definitely looked more polished to me than the first game in the

10:32.800 --> 10:36.200
series that they released. I know fans of the series will be really happy that they

10:36.200 --> 10:40.800
can play as Pandora now. I know that they were talking about how they fixed a lot of

10:40.800 --> 10:44.820
the camera because of complaints in the first game, and the camera, you know, it felt like

10:44.820 --> 10:49.040
a typical platformer to me when I played it. I actually did get to put hands-on on it,

10:49.040 --> 10:51.400
and it was kind of nice. You could do, like, strafing and all this other stuff too that

10:51.400 --> 10:55.600
felt really good. I also thought it was neat because you can play co-op through the entire

10:55.600 --> 10:58.800
game. It's not just selected levels or modes, but you can play co-op with a friend through

10:58.800 --> 11:02.560
the whole game, and by the way, they hinted that there might be a cheat mode where you

11:02.560 --> 11:03.820
you can fight each other.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.280
Oops, that was supposed to be off the record.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.160
Sorry, I wasn't supposed to say anything about that.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.920
Oh, and there's chickens that fire laser beams

11:08.920 --> 11:09.920
from their eyes, that's cool.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.640
That's the coolest thing I've ever heard of.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.840
So if you have that Invader Zim style sense of humor,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.240
you'd get a kick out of Death Junior 2, probably.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.120
Yeah, especially since Pandora kind of reminds you

11:19.120 --> 11:21.080
of Gaz a little bit, so.

11:21.080 --> 11:26.000
Silent Hill Origins PSP, or should I say Silent Evil 4.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.360
Because it's very similar in look and feel

11:28.360 --> 11:29.940
to the Resident Evil 4, I thought.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.140
But I mean, it works.

11:31.140 --> 11:32.480
It works for Silent Hill.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.400
what you think? I really like what they did with it and more kind of it almost

11:35.400 --> 11:38.800
seems like they're going to be going more of an action route more Resident

11:38.800 --> 11:43.240
Evil type but it the game itself looks really good even though I mean it wasn't

11:43.240 --> 11:46.160
hardly done at all I think like 30% or something

11:46.160 --> 11:49.240
yeah a lot of placeholder stuff but it looked really good and I was very

11:49.240 --> 11:54.120
impressed by what they were showing us on the PSP. Fans of Silent Hill are

11:54.120 --> 11:56.280
actually gonna be really pleased it definitely you know even though we're

11:56.280 --> 11:59.080
joking a little bit about the whole over-the-shoulder camera switch it

11:59.080 --> 12:02.360
It definitely has that Silent Hill feel that you guys are used to.

12:02.360 --> 12:06.840
Fourteen new Akira Yamaoka songs, four of which have the vocals from Mary Elizabeth

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
McGlynn.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.340
So that's going to be awesome.

12:09.340 --> 12:13.500
One third of the town comes from the original game and then they added a new two thirds

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
to the town.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.400
So that's pretty cool.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.160
And it looked pretty cool just as far as I like the weapons that you can select and stuff.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.160
And how they have the automatic cameras for when you're going to different spots.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.760
will actually you know do the Silent Hill cameras you know where really high

12:29.760 --> 12:33.360
shot or low shot yeah that was kind of cool I like you could do the the whole

12:33.360 --> 12:37.480
camera switching a little bit it's not all over the shoulder they said that as

12:37.480 --> 12:41.000
far as the story goes it incorporates elements of the film but that doesn't

12:41.000 --> 12:44.480
disrupt the story of the other games so there will be elements of the film in it

12:44.480 --> 12:48.640
Travis is the name of the main character you do come into contact with Dahlia in

12:48.640 --> 12:52.960
the game and Alyssa is in the story but the connection of Silent Hill 1 not as

12:52.960 --> 12:58.200
strong as you might think by hearing that so they also said the outdoor area

12:58.200 --> 13:02.520
is kind of a sandbox type game with it leads into other interior areas which

13:02.520 --> 13:05.960
you know was kind of the way most of the others you know at least silent 2 and

13:05.960 --> 13:09.200
some of the other ones were anyway so that makes sense some of the melee

13:09.200 --> 13:13.980
weapons you'll get to use sledgehammer tire iron and shovel can't wait to a

13:13.980 --> 13:16.800
beat-up zombies with a shovel that should be fun I want to use a tire that's

13:16.800 --> 13:20.320
the thing that's the kind of thing it sort of is a little bit different to me

13:20.320 --> 13:24.800
from the other Silent Hills is where you've got this character, the lead is very strong.

13:24.800 --> 13:30.360
I mean, bludgeoning the crap out of, you know, creatures with a sledgehammer instead of,

13:30.360 --> 13:34.800
you know, maybe just, you know, a weak, you know, woman or something trying to beat up

13:34.800 --> 13:38.240
something, you know, with whatever, a stick or something.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.840
It's like, you know, this guy could kick ass, I mean, that's kind of cool.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
He's a trucker.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.840
Exactly.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.720
Marvel trading card game coming to DS, PSP, and the PC.

13:46.720 --> 13:52.200
You know, to be honest, I don't play the trading card games and I don't like, you know, Yu-Gi-Oh

13:52.200 --> 13:53.200
or anything like that.

13:53.200 --> 14:00.240
I did like the fact how they're talking about being able to play on the PSP versus PC, which

14:00.240 --> 14:02.680
is, you know, the first for that.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.480
And I'd like to see more games utilize something like that, because that's pretty cool.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.240
And the DS is going to use Wi-Fi, which is pretty cool too.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.240
That's pretty awesome.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.400
So, you know, if you're into those trading card games or you like the Marvel game, they

14:13.400 --> 14:16.360
they did say all heroes and villains in the card game will be in there and all

14:16.360 --> 14:19.400
the cutscenes were done by the Marvel artists and writers and they know it's

14:19.400 --> 14:22.200
gonna be authentic and they were also talking about the PC version being

14:22.200 --> 14:25.480
actually like a free almost like a handout at like comic cons and stuff

14:25.480 --> 14:28.520
like that where they would give the game out and basically you would go download

14:28.520 --> 14:32.620
a pack and it would be all kind of like e-content that you would download like

14:32.620 --> 14:34.640
cards and stuff so that's pretty cool

14:34.640 --> 14:38.240
all right try to say this next one three times fast you ready winning 11

14:38.240 --> 14:43.360
pro evolution soccer 2007 yes what did you think of what did you think of

14:43.360 --> 14:47.320
winning 11 pro evolution soccer 2007 um it looks pretty good actually for a

14:47.320 --> 14:50.360
soccer game I haven't really played too much of FIFA so I can't really compare

14:50.360 --> 14:55.120
it but just from like shots I've seen you have FIFA and kind of the way it's

14:55.120 --> 14:59.640
playing I mean I you know it's number one soccer game in the world right for

14:59.640 --> 15:02.520
a reason so you know I thought it was interesting because I guess the build we

15:02.520 --> 15:05.320
were looking at was pretty early it looked to be running off the pro evo 6

15:05.320 --> 15:10.400
engine so right wasn't that what it was yeah yeah so you know we were looking at

15:10.400 --> 15:12.720
an early build but we did get to see it with the next-gen graphics they were

15:12.720 --> 15:18.000
showing it on the 360 and so I loved how when you paused it you know I'm not

15:18.000 --> 15:21.120
really super into sports games but I do love me some soccer don't get me wrong I

15:21.120 --> 15:24.720
think it's a great sport I used to play when I was a kid little-known fact I do

15:24.720 --> 15:27.440
love the fact when you pause the game it's almost like remember when you

15:27.440 --> 15:30.800
pause the game in Super Smash Brothers Melee you could spin the camera around

15:30.800 --> 15:35.100
like anywhere you want and zoom in is it like it does that with the the soccer

15:35.100 --> 15:39.120
and you can slowly move it forward and slowly move it back and like it's so

15:39.120 --> 15:43.040
detailed that you see the eyes on the people's faces now the only problem in

15:43.040 --> 15:46.160
the build we saw was that all the background motions still kept going and

15:46.160 --> 15:49.840
even it was paused but it's so early build I probably shouldn't even say that

15:49.840 --> 15:53.680
it's really bill you know they're gonna fix that so not worried about that but

15:53.680 --> 15:57.760
yeah I thought it was pretty cool and again cross cross-platform online

15:57.760 --> 16:01.520
competition they said the PlayStation 2 and the PC they want them to be able to

16:01.520 --> 16:03.760
play each other haven't guaranteed it yet but that's what they're working

16:03.760 --> 16:08.600
towards thought that was very interesting yeah they also said the DS

16:08.600 --> 16:12.320
version of the game is going to be a little more kid-friendly kind of a

16:12.320 --> 16:16.520
throwback to the really old Pro Evo soccer soccer games where they want it

16:16.520 --> 16:19.960
to be like the enabler for the series you know what I mean like kind of a

16:19.960 --> 16:23.440
simplified version that gets people in the gateway soccer gateway soccer game I

16:23.440 --> 16:26.200
think they called it. I thought that was kind of neat.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.640
Shallon Showdown coming to a variety of platforms.

16:29.640 --> 16:36.640
You know the game looks very pretty and it's actually, you know, the animations are good

16:36.640 --> 16:40.800
and it's kind of fun to play but I don't get it. I don't get the point to it because the

16:40.800 --> 16:45.480
way the game is set up, I mean, it's almost like Power Stone where you're, you know, kind

16:45.480 --> 16:50.560
of fighting stuff but I don't know if it was just a demo I was playing but I kept killing

16:50.560 --> 16:54.320
robots and they just kept respawning and I did that for about 15 minutes and nothing

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
happened.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.800
Was it maybe just because it was like supposed to be a tech demo or like it wasn't really

16:57.800 --> 16:58.800
the game?

16:58.800 --> 17:02.080
That's why I was thinking I'm like I hope this is the case but by reading most of the

17:02.080 --> 17:07.200
descriptions of it, it sounds like that's not really the case and I mean it's really

17:07.200 --> 17:08.200
good looking.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.640
The game's supposed to be out November 14th.

17:09.640 --> 17:14.840
Yeah I mean it's really good looking I just I don't get it I mean maybe if maybe this

17:14.840 --> 17:18.640
is just part of the game and I'm not seeing you know I'm thinking that's probably what

17:18.640 --> 17:23.080
it was, you know, but it looks very good, I mean, and fans of the show will definitely

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
like it.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.560
Yeah, if you're a fan of the show, the head writers from the show wrote all the dialogue

17:26.560 --> 17:30.320
and there's six playable characters in the game, the four main characters to start, and

17:30.320 --> 17:32.520
you get two bad guys that are unlockable later on.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.560
I thought what was interesting about the DS version, they have a bunch of mini-games that

17:35.560 --> 17:39.840
use the stylus and the mic, kind of like Mario mini-games, but that's alright, it uses stylus

17:39.840 --> 17:44.200
and air hockey and the microphone to, like, blow a ship across the sea and all that stuff.

17:44.200 --> 17:48.000
They said the DS version of the game will have 30 hours of gameplay, which for a DS

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
is pretty huge, so it sounds like it might have a lot of appeal there, especially for

17:53.000 --> 17:55.260
fans of the show.

17:55.260 --> 17:59.060
Coded Arms Contingent I played the original Coded Arms, didn't

17:59.060 --> 18:04.280
care for it at all, and I'm liking how they're going to be actually, a couple things, they're

18:04.280 --> 18:10.260
doing more variety of environments, and they're actually set stages, so it's not all this

18:10.260 --> 18:14.920
random generated stuff, I mean, granted, the random generated stuff is kind of cool, and

18:14.920 --> 18:20.740
Maybe they have a mode like that or something separate from the game, but the actual game

18:20.740 --> 18:23.520
is not so good.

18:23.520 --> 18:28.720
I do like the new details that they added to it.

18:28.720 --> 18:33.680
It's a lot more polished in how you can map all your keys and stuff to your own configurations.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
It's pretty cool.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.700
Coded Arms is not my cup of tea either, but if you're a fan of the series, multiplayer

18:37.700 --> 18:40.940
is going to be up to 8 players from 4 players.

18:40.940 --> 18:45.180
The game is scheduled for March 2007, which is supposedly the time the PlayStation 3 version

18:45.180 --> 18:47.540
is coming out as well, but it is separate stories.

18:47.540 --> 18:52.560
The PSP and the PS3 versions are separate stories in the series.

18:52.560 --> 18:55.460
Lunar Knights from Kojima Productions on the Nintendo DS.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.220
Did you get a chance to look at that a little bit?

18:57.220 --> 19:01.260
I didn't really get a chance to play it, but I saw them showing it off and stuff.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.260
It looked pretty good.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.620
It reminds me of Mega Man Battle Network a little bit.

19:04.620 --> 19:05.620
It's Boktai.

19:05.620 --> 19:09.580
Seriously, if you played that one with the sun and everything, it's almost just like

19:09.580 --> 19:10.580
that.

19:10.580 --> 19:16.060
Okay, yeah, that's kind of why they have the Sun and the moon and interesting green interesting

19:16.140 --> 19:19.300
So yeah, you have some first-person modes in there as well

19:19.300 --> 19:25.700
They definitely heavily use the elements in the game you draw on the screen like like when you're using like an air element you kind

19:25.700 --> 19:29.300
Of twirl the stylus on the screen to create a tornado, which was kind of cute

19:29.780 --> 19:34.700
So I I played through the first level of the demo and it was it was pretty cool

19:35.220 --> 19:37.220
So awesome

19:37.260 --> 19:39.260
Metal Gear Solid portable ops

19:39.260 --> 19:44.140
Very very awesome to see and especially since you know, I don't know about a lot of people out there

19:44.140 --> 19:46.900
But I didn't like Metal Gear acid didn't care for it at all

19:46.900 --> 19:52.760
I'm kind of you know, hoping that they'd put out an actual metal your solid game on the PSP and this one looks really cool

19:52.760 --> 19:56.560
They're doing a lot of elements or adding a lot of things that they didn't have any other games like the

19:57.000 --> 20:00.260
Where you actually have a squad now three members. That was pretty cool

20:00.260 --> 20:07.600
Yeah, this is the Metal Gear game that fans wanted a year ago. So it takes place six years after the snake eater story

20:07.600 --> 20:14.000
Did you notice that in the little trailer, it looks like the cutscenes are borrowed from

20:14.000 --> 20:15.800
that comic book game they put out?

20:15.800 --> 20:16.800
Like the comic book Metal Gear?

20:16.800 --> 20:20.840
Yeah, I thought that was really cool, because I love that look that the Metal Gear comic

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
thing had.

20:21.840 --> 20:25.240
Yeah, and then you have the whole comrade thing where you build your own team.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.840
That seems to be kind of the niche of this game, that you build your own team of people

20:28.840 --> 20:34.400
and then you use people together, like you switch from one character to another and go

20:34.400 --> 20:39.160
go back and forth, and that's how you can take out, you know, other guys in the area

20:39.160 --> 20:42.800
that might be hard to get to, you know, a sniper who's got you in the sights, maybe

20:42.800 --> 20:46.200
use somebody else to take out the sniper, I thought that was kind of cool.

20:46.200 --> 20:51.520
Full voiceovers in the cinematics, the original voice actors are all back for this game, and

20:51.520 --> 20:56.680
just an FYI, there's supposedly a ninja character that I don't know if we're supposed to mention

20:56.680 --> 21:00.560
because they wouldn't say much about it there, but a whole lot more information is supposed

21:00.560 --> 21:02.280
to be released on this Tokyo game show.

21:02.280 --> 21:07.420
supposedly some sort of box hiding system yeah look if they said it I'm

21:07.420 --> 21:11.080
reporting on it I'm sorry you know unless they specifically said don't

21:11.080 --> 21:16.800
repeat this you know I if they let it slip out hey we got it we have a legal

21:16.800 --> 21:23.360
obligation to report on it all right now here's one I have a ton of things to say

21:23.360 --> 21:27.120
about Castlevania portrait or ruin what you think of this oh it's pretty good I

21:27.120 --> 21:31.720
liked the game a lot actually played it in quite a bit and you know typical

21:31.720 --> 21:35.240
Castlevania game, but it looks very good. I'm very impressed with what they've done

21:35.240 --> 21:40.760
with the DS. I mean, I was incredibly impressed that they had an anime cut intro, you know,

21:40.760 --> 21:43.680
it's like... What is up with Konami love for the handhelds

21:43.680 --> 21:48.560
this year? That's pretty much all we saw. Like every, like seriously, almost every game

21:48.560 --> 21:54.960
we saw had at least one version being made for the PSP or the DS. Yeah, every single

21:54.960 --> 22:00.480
game we saw, except for Elibits, the Karaoke Revolution game, and the DDRs. But, I mean,

22:00.480 --> 22:04.120
everything else had a handheld. Why would they even bother with the PSP since the sales

22:04.120 --> 22:09.140
are kinda crap in Japan? Well, you know, what it comes down to is, I think there was even

22:09.140 --> 22:14.600
some study out there that said that handhelds are actually more popular than console games,

22:14.600 --> 22:19.040
which, you know, the facts don't really show that, but, I don't know, I think it's just...

22:19.040 --> 22:24.440
A game like Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is going to sell PSPs. So, you know, maybe

22:24.440 --> 22:28.580
that's part of it. So, maybe because it's got the muscle there. And, what was the other

22:28.580 --> 22:33.740
thing about portable ops it utilizes the GPS supposedly yeah it's hot so

22:33.740 --> 22:39.700
Castlevania portrait of ruin so cool I mean I love you can use y okay first off

22:39.700 --> 22:43.540
you have to understand they've made some big changes to the basic formula now you

22:43.540 --> 22:48.060
swap between two characters at the touch of a button you swap between Jonathan

22:48.060 --> 22:51.540
who's kind of a traditional Belmont style character and then Charlotte who's

22:51.540 --> 22:55.340
like magic and intellect based and like I thought was kind of cool because you

22:55.340 --> 22:58.220
hold down the button to charge your magic and the longer you're able to hold

22:58.220 --> 23:01.220
it down, the more powerful the attack is and the graphics match that.

23:01.220 --> 23:02.900
I thought that was kind of neat.

23:02.900 --> 23:07.620
She can stop time, heal, boost stats, all that stuff, but by a touch of another button

23:07.620 --> 23:11.980
you bring them both on the screen at the same time to solve simple puzzles, which I thought

23:11.980 --> 23:12.980
was pretty cool.

23:12.980 --> 23:17.900
And then here's like the greatest thing, you finally get to go outside the damn castle.

23:17.900 --> 23:21.300
That's what the portraits are all about, is that the bad guy paints these portraits and

23:21.300 --> 23:23.420
I don't know, it's somehow how he has control over the castle.

23:23.420 --> 23:24.420
Mario did it!

23:24.420 --> 23:30.600
Whatever you go into these portraits and they take you to levels that are not inside a castle

23:30.600 --> 23:35.660
So you get to go to an Egyptian level that's called sandy grave you go to a town level

23:35.660 --> 23:40.260
That's called the city of Hays and it's all very Castlevania esque and it's it's quite cool

23:40.620 --> 23:45.320
And this is cool because there's two characters. This game is gonna support Wi-Fi

23:46.020 --> 23:48.580
local and internet Wi-Fi and get this

23:48.580 --> 23:54.580
multiplayer co-op now sorry kids not in the one-player mode but you can do the

23:54.580 --> 23:58.780
boss rush mode also something they weren't saying a lot of details about

23:58.780 --> 24:02.860
was the shop mode there's a shop mode that's going to be Wi-Fi as well that

24:02.860 --> 24:06.500
you're going to be able to trade items across the internet it sounds like they

24:06.500 --> 24:09.980
would be really sketchy details the people from what I was piecing together

24:09.980 --> 24:13.980
sounded like you'd be able to buy things from other people shops that you didn't

24:13.980 --> 24:17.380
want and but kind of make trades like that I gave out items or something you

24:17.380 --> 24:20.820
can sell them almost like an auction market type thing.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.820
More details to come at Tokyo Game Show.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.760
Pairs, by the way, seem to be a recurring theme in this game, because did you notice

24:25.760 --> 24:30.960
there were the vampire bad guys, where Stella and Loretta were some of these female vampire

24:30.960 --> 24:31.960
antagonist characters?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.660
I thought that was kind of interesting.

24:33.660 --> 24:36.460
So I think if you enjoyed last year's Castlevania, this one's going to up the ante.

24:36.460 --> 24:38.620
I think you're going to be very, very impressed.

24:38.620 --> 24:43.380
Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

24:43.380 --> 24:47.740
I think you're par for the Chorus Carry Revolution game with some added stuff.

24:47.740 --> 24:54.260
I liked how they have all the different responses to how you did and will actually look at different

24:54.260 --> 24:59.540
things including the costume of your character and your pitch and all that stuff.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.900
I think this game is going to be huge.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.980
And I don't think it's necessarily going to be the hardcore gamer crowd that gets into

25:04.980 --> 25:09.700
this game, but I just think this is going to be a very accessible game for mainstream

25:09.700 --> 25:13.000
especially the fact that it's you know based off American Idol and that they've

25:13.000 --> 25:17.540
integrated the show so well into karaoke revolution I mean it's just a perfect

25:17.540 --> 25:21.820
American and plus karaoke revolution was pretty much already that way though do

25:21.820 --> 25:24.740
wasn't pour some sugar on me in the game or something like that yeah crazy

25:24.740 --> 25:29.220
that's a crazy soul and also they've got it have a loan by heart which is like my

25:29.220 --> 25:32.940
favorite and they're gonna be launching it at the same time as this almost the

25:32.940 --> 25:36.660
start of the season so I think this game is going to begin him pin that thing on

25:36.660 --> 25:42.520
the show like crazy. The only thing that didn't make sense to me, PS2 only. And I thought

25:42.520 --> 25:46.260
the Xbox with the, you know, downloadable expansions and stuff was a great idea. So

25:46.260 --> 25:49.300
I guess if the game does well, they'll probably port it to other platforms, but...

25:49.300 --> 25:54.900
Well, I think the Xbox right now, they're kind of considering not doing that because

25:54.900 --> 25:58.540
the Xbox is pretty much at the end of its cycle. The PS2 is going to be going on for

25:58.540 --> 26:02.220
a while, but you don't want to put out a game that's pretty much, you know, who's going

26:02.220 --> 26:06.620
really buy everyone's transitioning over to the Xbox 360 and they're not ready

26:06.620 --> 26:10.920
to put out a next-gen version of it so you know that's kind of why that they're

26:10.920 --> 26:13.740
not doing see with the GameCube you know they're not doing anything like that oh

26:13.740 --> 26:17.280
by the way I have to say something about this because you know I can't keep my

26:17.280 --> 26:21.640
damn mouth shut okay you remember how our podcast once got a negative review

26:21.640 --> 26:25.140
because it was they were calling us a bunch of drunks or whatever and that

26:25.140 --> 26:28.200
gaming journalists should you know be professional or whatever and not get

26:28.200 --> 26:30.300
get drunk on air.

26:30.300 --> 26:35.260
Did you notice how wild and crazy a lot of people at that party were, especially during

26:35.260 --> 26:37.420
that American Idol contest and things of that nature?

26:37.420 --> 26:40.540
Did you notice the journalist from...

26:40.540 --> 26:44.660
I'm not 100% positive where he's from, so I shouldn't name it unless I have my facts

26:44.660 --> 26:48.900
proved, but he walks in and holds up this bottle of like 40 or something and everybody's

26:48.900 --> 26:49.900
cheering.

26:49.900 --> 26:54.340
I'm just thinking to myself, I was like, I didn't know what to think.

26:54.340 --> 26:55.340
One part of me thinks it's funny.

26:55.340 --> 26:56.340
How about hypocrite?

26:56.340 --> 26:59.500
But yeah, the other part of me thinks, this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever...

26:59.500 --> 27:00.500
Wasn't it weird?

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
Okay, here's the...

27:01.500 --> 27:03.300
Wasn't it weird being there, Loki?

27:03.300 --> 27:05.820
It was weird, and here's why it's weird.

27:05.820 --> 27:10.860
Because on the show, it's fine to fuck around every once in a while, because you make it

27:10.860 --> 27:11.860
a disclaimer.

27:11.860 --> 27:15.780
It's like, I wouldn't do that if I was on TV, maybe, because that might be a little

27:15.780 --> 27:16.780
weird.

27:16.780 --> 27:21.100
I mean, I don't know, getting drunk on live television probably wouldn't be good.

27:21.100 --> 27:27.520
But going to a press event where you're going there to do business, you're not going there

27:27.520 --> 27:30.560
to get drunk and fuck off.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.200
This isn't like a company barbecue.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.460
You can do that at your company barbecue, but you know what, you're going to do business

27:36.460 --> 27:37.460
here.

27:37.460 --> 27:38.460
This is a business thing.

27:38.460 --> 27:44.720
You're doing interviews, you're getting information to report to the press and stuff, you're not

27:44.720 --> 27:48.240
supposed to be look I got 40 let's get

27:48.240 --> 27:51.320
wasted man I know I was like that maybe like

27:51.320 --> 27:55.480
I just was in awe I didn't know what to think I was like I can't believe that's

27:55.480 --> 27:58.680
like I thought it was a joke that would be funny if I was you know

27:58.680 --> 28:02.880
not at a professional gaming event I thought it was a joke

28:02.880 --> 28:07.320
I mean at first but you know they actually were out in the parking lot drinking

28:07.320 --> 28:11.280
and I I kinda remember which outlet they're from but I

28:11.280 --> 28:14.560
I don't wanna know did you know okay did you know did you notice this too

28:14.560 --> 28:18.520
Now, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but I was the only person

28:18.520 --> 28:21.640
in the whole freaking building that was taking notes on a laptop.

28:21.640 --> 28:25.360
Now, granted, some of the other journalists were doing the old-fashioned pen and paper thing,

28:25.360 --> 28:26.640
but I'm thinking to myself,

28:26.640 --> 28:30.120
you all work for dot coms, and you're all like on the tech edge of things, and

28:30.120 --> 28:33.200
you know, I just thought it was really surprising, because I don't know,

28:33.200 --> 28:36.760
I personally, maybe it's a thing they teach you in journalist school, I don't know,

28:36.760 --> 28:41.840
but I think, I type fast, so if I want to be able to make a ton of notes, I'm going to type them out on my laptop.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.880
I'm not going to try and write everything, because my handwriting is god-awful.

28:44.880 --> 28:50.220
So I was kind of surprised that I was the only one that had a laptop there.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.880
Something is really wrong with the mainstreaming gaming press, you guys, and I'm not afraid

28:52.880 --> 28:53.880
to say it.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
So, whatever.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
That's it.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.280
There was a ton of people there from like IGN and 1UP and stuff, I mean, they have like

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
stacks of like 10 people.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.720
Yeah, it was the Ziff Davis, IGN, Bay Area, Dotcomer Club.

29:04.720 --> 29:09.280
Gosh, and you know, I do feel bad, I'm not sure how many small press were there, but

29:09.280 --> 29:12.640
I'm sure that, you know, I don't know if they were in the same boat we were, but we were

29:12.640 --> 29:16.840
like, you know, basically strong-armed out of the way for like, you know, the Wii game,

29:16.840 --> 29:17.840
Elibits and stuff.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
Yeah.

29:18.840 --> 29:19.980
I mean, whatever.

29:19.980 --> 29:23.560
You know, I guess we don't have three million unique visitors a month or whatever that-

29:23.560 --> 29:25.280
Elibits is pretty sweet, by the way, you know.

29:25.280 --> 29:26.280
Yeah, yeah, Elibits.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.280
What'd you think of Elibits?

29:27.280 --> 29:28.280
Elibits is pretty awesome.

29:28.280 --> 29:32.880
It reminds me of Katamari a little bit because basically you start off the game with this

29:32.880 --> 29:37.160
gun and you're able to, like, levitate objects with it, but as you collect Elibits, you gain

29:37.160 --> 29:41.880
wattage and you gain the ability to lift larger objects, kind of like, you know, katamari.

29:41.880 --> 29:47.200
And eventually if, you know, you collect enough, because each level has, you know, basically,

29:47.200 --> 29:51.640
you know, a checkpoint of you need to get so many elevates and so much wattage, and

29:51.640 --> 29:56.080
then you can keep continuing and doing different things, like you can, you know, for example

29:56.080 --> 29:59.320
they show us popping popcorn, you can grab popcorn and throw it in the microwave once

29:59.320 --> 30:03.800
you've got enough wattage to run the microwave, and then elevates pop out of the popcorn and

30:03.800 --> 30:08.660
you get more of them like that, but eventually you can lift the whole house or throw stuff

30:08.660 --> 30:12.880
around and they have some stealth stuff in there which was pretty cool.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
You know what though?

30:13.880 --> 30:18.600
As much as I appreciated this game a lot more, being able to see it a little closer and hands

30:18.600 --> 30:23.000
on than I did at E3, and it was kind of cool to be next to a Wii again without having to

30:23.000 --> 30:27.920
wait in a five hour line I have to admit, I don't think, like if this game came out

30:27.920 --> 30:33.320
for the same price as like Zelda, Metroid, Mario, there's no way I could justify buying

30:33.320 --> 30:34.320
I'm sorry.

30:34.320 --> 30:38.600
I mean, the game looked kind of fun, but it didn't look $39.99 fun to me.

30:38.600 --> 30:39.600
I don't know.

30:39.600 --> 30:43.720
Maybe it's just because we were only seeing one aspect of the game, but seriously, I hope

30:43.720 --> 30:46.820
that this game is a little bit lower of a price point.

30:46.820 --> 30:50.560
I think it will be much more successful if they aim that way.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.800
Well, I can tell you...

30:52.800 --> 30:54.520
Oh, you have it in your little database thingy?

30:54.520 --> 30:57.340
I can tell you exactly what the price is going to be on the...

30:57.340 --> 30:58.340
All right, cool.

30:58.340 --> 31:01.040
If I remember correctly, I think it was $49.99.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.040
If I remember...

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
No, see, it's too much.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
It's too much.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
Hopefully it changes.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.040
I don't know.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.720
Real quick housekeeping things while Loki looks that up.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.040
Is there anything else you want to say about the press event?

31:10.040 --> 31:11.040
I'm sorry.

31:11.040 --> 31:15.040
You know, I like it.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.240
I want to thank them first off for inviting us down there and actually...

31:18.240 --> 31:23.040
Yeah, thanks guys for taking a chance and inviting some of the independent press.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
We appreciate it.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.560
It was really cool to check it out and stuff.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.920
I love going to those things.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.280
But yeah, I don't know.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.080
I like gamers day better. I think gamers day was a little more. I was sad that DDR wasn't there

31:36.080 --> 31:40.480
I had to go to work. I know cuz well you have the time off for Disneyland

31:40.720 --> 31:44.780
Yeah, I I would have really enjoyed Disneyland. So, you know, I did

31:45.400 --> 31:50.320
Very much. I just want to say some real quick housekeeping things. Um, this tonight is a mini episode

31:50.320 --> 31:52.840
I should have said that at the top of the episode. There's not gonna be a part B tonight

31:53.240 --> 31:59.280
And the DDR power previews will start next week and that is only on the live stream

31:59.280 --> 32:02.620
You have to be listening live and you'll get to hear some brand new

32:02.880 --> 32:09.480
DDR songs from the ultra mix for v-rare and universe v-rare and I can't say anything about it

32:09.480 --> 32:13.160
You know, we're not supposed to talk about you know, what we're playing and all that stuff yet

32:13.160 --> 32:17.560
But you know, I can't help but say something cuz I got to hear some of the tracks and everything

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
One of the songs we're playing next week

32:21.320 --> 32:22.560
like

32:22.560 --> 32:27.720
Take a really dark DDR song and make it even darker like the remix

32:27.720 --> 32:31.680
so it's like oh it's so cool it's so cool so you'll hear it next week that's

32:31.680 --> 32:34.800
all I have to say I'm sorry they haven't set a price yet for elements okay thank

32:34.800 --> 32:39.440
you for the clarification all right so let's get into other gaming news from

32:39.440 --> 32:44.040
around the world well there is definitely other news first one up

32:44.040 --> 32:49.760
actually well you realize that Nintendo has been hanging out in Germany with

32:49.760 --> 32:53.180
their fun little press conference right no their game conference I should say

32:53.180 --> 33:00.520
yep well even though they are still not giving a definite price on the Wii there

33:00.520 --> 33:09.860
has been a slight leak from the the head of German operations saying they expect

33:09.860 --> 33:15.140
a price below 250 euros which would be three hundred and twenty one dollars and

33:15.140 --> 33:21.020
fifty cents basically it's still more of the same Nintendo still saying that they

33:21.020 --> 33:30.620
expect it to be, you know, as far as 25,000 yen in Japan, which is $223 here. So, no more

33:30.620 --> 33:34.820
than 250 in the U.S., so it's basically more of the same. Nothing specific.

33:34.820 --> 33:41.020
All right. Thoughts on that, anything? Not a lot of surprises there, you know. $250 is

33:41.020 --> 33:42.620
kind of the price we're all thinking anyway, so.

33:42.620 --> 33:46.700
They basically, if I think, come out and said the same thing, like, you know, no less than

33:46.700 --> 33:50.760
you know, 250, at least in the US, no less than 249 or whatever.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.660
But that was not the only news that they announced, well, or I should say that came from Let's

33:54.660 --> 33:56.540
Pick.

33:56.540 --> 34:01.800
They did announce two new games, Mario Strikers Charged and Battalion Wars 2.

34:01.800 --> 34:06.800
Of course, Mario Strikers Charged is a follow-up to the GameCube game and looks pretty awesome.

34:06.800 --> 34:09.900
Kind of a little edgy soccer game for them, I guess.

34:09.900 --> 34:14.940
And then Battalion Wars 2 is just awesome, and in fact, actually they have a kind of

34:14.940 --> 34:23.060
video footage on game trailers that I saw linked to on Kotaku and it looks pretty sweet.

34:23.060 --> 34:28.740
I mean, I never really got into the first Battalion Wars, but very cool little game

34:28.740 --> 34:34.900
and definitely shown off some pretty good graphics for the Wii, so I'm looking forward

34:34.900 --> 34:35.900
to that stuff.

34:35.900 --> 34:42.260
Of course, I like this, it's kind of referring to Battalion Wars 2 as B-Wii, you know, because

34:42.260 --> 34:50.660
you know too funny but um yeah it's supposed to be pretty cool very cool um

34:50.660 --> 34:54.900
there's more Nintendo news coming one thing that wasn't announced that

34:54.900 --> 34:58.100
everybody thought was going to be announced in Germany was the release date

34:58.100 --> 35:02.860
and the official price point yeah launch details promising that was gonna happen

35:02.860 --> 35:07.620
but your bad my bad your bad hey it made sense I mean hey look we already told

35:07.620 --> 35:15.620
you guys the Wii is coming out soon soon well soon will be answered on September

35:15.620 --> 35:21.980
14th we're pretty sure this is the real deal because Nintendo has sent out

35:21.980 --> 35:28.060
special invites for a celebration of video games and Nintendo of America

35:28.060 --> 35:33.860
president our dear buddy Reggie Phil's aim will be there in person and he's

35:33.860 --> 35:39.740
going to be promoting quote-unquote the upcoming lineup. Reggie? Yep. Where's our

35:39.740 --> 35:44.260
invite? I know, I don't know. No, I guess we don't get three million unique

35:44.260 --> 35:49.860
page views a month so we we have to stay home but I don't know how formal or

35:49.860 --> 35:54.540
informal this event's going to be but seriously you know since this is going

35:54.540 --> 35:59.740
to be a really big deal IGN I'd leave your 40s at home. Oh yeah I went there I

35:59.740 --> 36:07.100
I went there. You know what, I do believe, I can't remember what, there was one blog

36:07.100 --> 36:11.900
that had, it wasn't a blog or some site that had, you know, that thing about the invite

36:11.900 --> 36:18.680
and they were talking about drinking Reggie's beer. So, I don't know. Whatever, you know,

36:18.680 --> 36:25.680
do what you want if you make an ass of yourself. Such hypocritical, next story, whatever. Anyways,

36:25.680 --> 36:29.040
I don't care anymore, we're just going to do our thing.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.040
Who cares?

36:30.040 --> 36:35.280
Anyways, I don't know if you've looked in the forums lately, but we did start a brand

36:35.280 --> 36:39.600
new thread, thank you very much Rob, about stuff that we reported on the show that's

36:39.600 --> 36:42.120
kind of under the radar as we like to put it.

36:42.120 --> 36:48.040
This week, for example, they announced officially about the Xbox Live Unplugged Volume 1, as

36:48.040 --> 36:53.040
we reported weeks ago, and other things of that nature and stuff, and we're going to

36:53.040 --> 36:58.360
be continuing to add to that each week with new stuff and this week I want to point out

36:58.360 --> 36:59.720
this is not an ego thing.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.040
We are very humble people.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.240
We love the fact that we are independent.

37:04.240 --> 37:08.840
We have such great listeners and folks that listen to us.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.320
We just are keeping this list for ourselves.

37:11.320 --> 37:17.400
When people call us liars and we are full of shit over here, I just want it on the record

37:17.400 --> 37:18.480
somewhere.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.480
So that is what we are doing, so join in the fun.

37:21.480 --> 37:22.480
Go to the thread.

37:22.480 --> 37:27.400
And personally, my personal thing here is I don't like reporting something and then

37:27.400 --> 37:32.080
having another press outlet report the same thing and then it spreads like wildfire and

37:32.080 --> 37:36.600
everyone takes it as gospel as they were the first ones to have the story.

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
That's never happened to us ever.

37:37.600 --> 37:38.600
It's kind of an ego boosting thing.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.600
It's never happened.

37:39.600 --> 37:44.440
And anyhoo, anyhoo, okay, so that never happened when OneUp picked the Konami release date

37:44.440 --> 37:45.440
story out.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.440
I don't care tonight.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.440
I just don't care tonight.

37:47.440 --> 37:48.440
Whatever.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.440
Anyways.

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
We're independent.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.440
I don't care tonight.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.440
I seriously don't.

37:52.440 --> 37:57.720
a couple things. First off, you remember there's the news of Bullet Witch being put out in

37:57.720 --> 38:02.760
the United States by Atari. We've got a date for you. February 21st is when you can expect

38:02.760 --> 38:08.120
that game, assuming there's no date changes. And then of course a new Wii launch title,

38:08.120 --> 38:13.000
or in the launch window I guess as you would put it. Shrek Smash and Crash for the Wii,

38:13.000 --> 38:17.480
it's going to be a Mario Kart style game featuring Shrek characters. Whoopty shit. Whoopty shit

38:17.480 --> 38:25.360
Yes, but it is coming out on the Wii December 15th for $39.99 so look forward to that.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.600
But you know, you're here first.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.720
Any other US release dates that we should be aware of coming up?

38:31.720 --> 38:32.720
Of course.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.400
This week's is actually going to be pretty awesome.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
Lots of 360 stuff.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.560
Bomberman Act Zero is going to be coming out.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.560
You've also got Enchanted Arms coming out on the 360.

38:42.560 --> 38:43.800
Ooh, that's this week?

38:43.800 --> 38:44.800
Yes, that's this week.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.000
Ooh, I'm going to get that.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.640
Enchanted Arms got it said Enchanted Arms is good if you like RPG cliches

38:50.640 --> 38:56.440
because the game is I love RPG cliches then it's for you great and then my

38:56.440 --> 39:01.440
personal favorite which I already got some special of course Saints Row

39:01.440 --> 39:07.440
seriously tonight oh man all right whatever our egos need a lashing tonight

39:07.440 --> 39:13.840
seriously Jamie make fun of us please um you're gay thank you but anyways other

39:13.840 --> 39:20.520
other things. Yeah, Loki, you're gay. You're not gay. But we won't hold that against you.

39:20.520 --> 39:26.140
And this is another one for you, Rob. Star Fox Command comes out this coming week, which

39:26.140 --> 39:30.520
is going to be pretty awesome. No? Can I be honest? I kind of stopped caring about Star

39:30.520 --> 39:36.920
Fox a long time ago. Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox. Dude, yeah, exactly right.

39:36.920 --> 39:40.600
Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox. Hell no. Star Fox, did you play that abortion

39:40.600 --> 39:42.960
of a GameCube Star Fox game?

39:42.960 --> 39:46.840
Yeah, listen. Thank you. Star Fox 64. Can you see my enthusiasm?

39:46.840 --> 39:50.120
We used to play Star Fox 64 during lunches

39:50.120 --> 39:53.360
in high school. Multiplayer four-player death matches.

39:53.360 --> 39:57.400
That was the shit. I'll check it out but I'm not gonna spend... I want a demo.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.840
It's all about the Wi-Fi multiplayer death matches.

40:00.840 --> 40:04.080
Of course then again, you know Wi-Fi. You know what, Loki, why don't you buy it

40:04.080 --> 40:07.880
and then you can let me play it and then I'll let you borrow enchanted arms or something

40:07.880 --> 40:09.800
and you can have fun with your RPG cliches.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.800
Okay, fine. Alright, anyways.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.800
Well hey, there's other places in the world.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.800
To quote Eddie Izzard, are you aware there's other countries?

40:16.800 --> 40:20.800
Hold on, I still got some more. I'm almost done. Sorry.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.800
Xenosaga 3 is also coming out on PlayStation 2.

40:24.800 --> 40:28.800
Disgaea 2 is coming out this week, which is going to be pretty cool.

40:28.800 --> 40:33.800
One Piece, Grand Adventure, if you like anime fighting games, pretty cool.

40:33.800 --> 40:43.800
And if you're not into that kind of stuff, on the PSP there's going to be Def Jam Fight for New York, Take Over or Take Down. I can't remember which it was.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.800
Will be all coming out.

40:45.800 --> 40:46.800
Let's look for those.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.800
Thank you.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.800
They needed to do a game called Thingy.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.800
You could author the game, I don't know.

40:53.800 --> 40:58.800
I'll make a game. Someone should hire me to design a game.

40:58.800 --> 41:02.800
It'll be awesome. It'll be called Jamie's Awesome Game.

41:02.800 --> 41:09.680
Anyway, speaking of awesome, we have the release dates, uh, over in the UK, uh, I know I already

41:09.680 --> 41:14.720
went over them the week before, but, uh, I'll actually, um, today, which I, I touched on

41:14.720 --> 41:18.640
some last week too, so it's, which I guess would be yesterday now in the UK, oh yeah,

41:18.640 --> 41:22.080
we're pre-taping this week, so it's actually Friday night, Friday night, sorry, the Reservoir

41:22.080 --> 41:27.560
Dogs, Madden 2007, which was a big whoopty shit in my book, yeah, um, Dan had to be there

41:27.560 --> 41:33.380
for the Madden sale I thought it was funny let's make a soccer team and dig

41:33.380 --> 41:38.660
dug digging strike also now coming out on the first which is ironically my

41:38.660 --> 41:47.820
wedding anniversary Oh age of pirates Caribbean tails and d1 street ball

41:47.820 --> 41:56.840
birth of America damn snort at the end there I'm nothing is it funny because I

41:56.840 --> 42:03.460
that game's coming out of the UK. So it's kind of funny, it's like, you know, hey, Revolutionary

42:03.460 --> 42:09.720
War, the game, weeee. Let's kick some Yankee ass, whoo, accepts, whoops.

42:09.720 --> 42:16.720
Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New York, The Takeover on PSP, Dungeon Siege 2, Broken

42:16.720 --> 42:29.400
me snoozing the game, gatora man lives, woo, saints row, starfox command, test drive unlimited,

42:29.400 --> 42:37.960
gangs of london, and on the 6th the scramble, but I feel very sorry for everybody over there

42:37.960 --> 42:41.340
because they don't get dead rising until the 8th and that makes me cry because dead rising

42:41.340 --> 42:44.280
is awesome, at least they are getting it pretty soon, but they are getting ultimate ghosts

42:44.280 --> 42:48.280
Goblins on the 8th as well. At least they're not getting it 28 days later.

42:48.280 --> 42:51.800
You're so funny!

42:51.800 --> 42:55.880
Where's a gun? Alright, maybe we can whack him over the head with a Guitar Hero

42:55.880 --> 42:57.720
controller. Those things are pretty heavy.

42:57.720 --> 43:01.320
You may have remembered earlier in Orange Lounge Radio History we

43:01.320 --> 43:05.640
talked to you guys about GHOUL and everybody was wondering what the hell

43:05.640 --> 43:10.120
does GHOUL mean? Well guess what? We know now it's the Guitar Hero

43:10.120 --> 43:14.040
Organized Underground League. You remember how Red Octane like

43:14.040 --> 43:16.640
They kind of started before they were making Guitar Hero.

43:16.640 --> 43:19.040
They were like a DDR pad maker company, right?

43:19.040 --> 43:21.720
And they used to sponsor local tournaments.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.840
Well, they kind of took that, like local DDR tournaments,

43:23.840 --> 43:25.200
right, they kind of took that idea

43:25.200 --> 43:26.580
and applied it to Guitar Hero.

43:26.580 --> 43:28.640
This is a set of sponsored tournaments

43:28.640 --> 43:31.680
where you will do the organizing and promoting

43:31.680 --> 43:34.520
and then Red Octane gives you banners and prizes.

43:34.520 --> 43:37.400
So it's like the Guitar Hero tournament in a box.

43:37.400 --> 43:38.760
Kind of, or it's like the,

43:38.760 --> 43:41.080
it makes me think of the Xbox Live Pizza Party thing as well.

43:41.080 --> 43:41.920
Exactly.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.200
So that's kind of neat.

43:43.200 --> 43:50.160
Now Red Octane, by the way, is only going to do a limited amount of sponsorships, so

43:50.160 --> 43:54.080
look into that if you are curious and want some sponsorship there for your tournament.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.080
Awesome.

43:55.080 --> 43:59.360
And I think it's on their MySpace, which I assume is MySpace.com slash guitar hero,

43:59.360 --> 44:00.360
I think.

44:00.360 --> 44:01.360
Probably.

44:01.360 --> 44:04.320
Otherwise you can probably do MySpace.com slash Red Octane.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.880
I think they don't have an official Red Octane one.

44:06.880 --> 44:07.880
Ah, whatever.

44:07.880 --> 44:12.560
Anyways, speaking of really cool stuff, PAX is going on right now, and one of the big

44:12.560 --> 44:18.180
announcements at PAX was the Penny Arcade game and it looks pretty awesome

44:18.180 --> 44:22.700
just they have a little teaser image that came out for it and the name of the

44:22.700 --> 44:27.300
game is actually it's quite interesting because it looks like it's gonna be

44:27.300 --> 44:32.540
episodic content and stuff and anyways the name is Penny Arcade Adventures on

44:32.540 --> 44:37.780
the rain slick precipice of darkness and it will be a comic adventure games

44:37.780 --> 44:47.460
coming out on the PC, Mac OS X, and Linux and by the teaser image it shows giant glowing

44:47.460 --> 44:52.820
looks like eyes in the sky and says I'm coming and if anyone follows the strip very closely

44:52.820 --> 45:00.500
you'll remember a certain parody of a certain console preview video, the Wii, which had

45:00.500 --> 45:05.580
fruit fucker on there as the saying I'm coming in 2006

45:05.580 --> 45:09.220
and well fucking fruit fucker in a game

45:09.220 --> 45:13.840
penny arcade oh I gotta get this I am looking for this game

45:13.840 --> 45:16.860
like crazy why don't we go to penny arcade expo seriously

45:16.860 --> 45:21.140
I might you know what I at my respect for penny arcade goes like higher and

45:21.140 --> 45:24.420
higher like every time we do some time I really want to be honest I do wanna go

45:24.420 --> 45:25.180
next year

45:25.180 --> 45:28.860
and I do have a lot of respect for him they also announced was a ten thousand

45:28.860 --> 45:30.220
dollar scholarship for

45:30.220 --> 45:37.520
You know, students that are looking to go into a video game field in school and stuff.

45:37.520 --> 45:41.260
So that's pretty, I mean, that's kind of given back to the community.

45:41.260 --> 45:43.140
I like that a lot.

45:43.140 --> 45:46.340
And they've definitely kind of got a really good vibe going on with everything.

45:46.340 --> 45:50.940
It's kind of like a fun E3 where actually people are, I don't know, it's just the right

45:50.940 --> 45:53.300
kind of attitude to have in the industry.

45:53.300 --> 45:54.860
All right.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.860
Very cool.

45:56.860 --> 46:05.460
speaking of cool actually now I don't know if this is cool cool or sort of huh

46:05.460 --> 46:14.140
because it's just more Xbox 360 drama in my opinion you know they have their

46:14.140 --> 46:18.620
premium pricing for a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade well they're also

46:18.620 --> 46:25.740
giving luminous the same treatment where to play to play this 1200

46:25.740 --> 46:32.240
marketplace points, which is about $14.99, however, is that once you reach a certain

46:32.240 --> 46:36.840
number of points in mission or versus CPU modes of the game, you will be actually asked

46:36.840 --> 46:39.620
to pay another 700 points.

46:39.620 --> 46:45.720
I hope that is a gross misinterpretation somehow of what is really intended, because it would

46:45.720 --> 46:49.960
not be a surprise if they're charging additional points for new themes and skins, but to prevent

46:49.960 --> 46:55.460
you from going further in the game and points, having to spend more money, what is that?

46:55.460 --> 46:59.860
like a demo I'm paying for I'm hoping there's just like a gross

46:59.860 --> 47:03.300
misinterpretation of what they're charging for and even then you know if

47:03.300 --> 47:06.260
they're charging for extra levels and skins and things well it's not a big

47:06.260 --> 47:11.660
surprise what it might be is that the game you know has downloadable song packs

47:11.660 --> 47:15.660
or whatever in that case and that the single-player game goes you know so far

47:15.660 --> 47:20.500
say you start off with like 20 songs or something when you download the game and

47:20.500 --> 47:24.540
then later on when you buy that sound pack it will go to level 20 and then

47:24.540 --> 47:27.660
continue on like say with the five other songs that are in your song pack that

47:27.660 --> 47:32.700
would make more sense but I don't see how you would I mean I would think it's

47:32.700 --> 47:35.580
just like the one rumor that came out and I hope that's not true where you'd

47:35.580 --> 47:40.780
have to purchase like multiplayer for the game I mean it's kind of dumb I

47:40.780 --> 47:45.260
don't know just be you know what I realize luminous is this very popular

47:45.260 --> 47:50.020
in-demand thing but don't shoot yourself in the foot kids over at Xbox Live I

47:50.020 --> 47:53.180
I still wouldn't put it past them. This is a good...

47:53.180 --> 47:56.700
this is a prime way to make money. You know, people will pay for it. Yeah, and I will

47:56.700 --> 47:58.140
probably be one of them and I will

47:58.140 --> 48:01.420
punch myself in the face for doing it. Now, one thing to be pointed

48:01.420 --> 48:04.620
out is that they're doing all of their pricing in terms of points instead of

48:04.620 --> 48:05.660
putting the dollar point.

48:05.660 --> 48:09.900
They're putting the actual Xbox Live points to sort of...

48:09.900 --> 48:13.260
I honestly

48:13.260 --> 48:17.260
think that it's a way, and I agree with

48:17.260 --> 48:20.780
With this article because I got the information from wire.com

48:21.580 --> 48:23.140
I

48:23.140 --> 48:25.500
Do think that actually it's a way to subvert

48:25.860 --> 48:30.760
The overall price value of the game by giving it in terms of something abstract like points

48:31.020 --> 48:35.980
We do have a handful of people in our chat room right now that are listening live to us taping a little early on Friday

48:35.980 --> 48:41.480
Night and drew Nami's in there and makes kind of a good point. Yeah, I'd like to purchase world 2-1

48:42.660 --> 48:44.660
episodic content to the extreme

48:44.660 --> 48:48.620
Interesting comparison, like a Mario Brothers style game.

48:48.620 --> 48:51.840
There's going to be a point where people are just not going to pay for it anymore and

48:51.840 --> 48:55.340
you know that's I think I kind of got to that point you know with

48:55.340 --> 48:58.580
Elder Scrolls IV like I'm not going to go buy

48:58.580 --> 49:03.220
all the content and everything so I don't know.

49:03.220 --> 49:07.460
Well if you like downloading stuff on live

49:07.460 --> 49:10.660
Microsoft has a lot of plans coming for live

49:10.660 --> 49:15.640
and live anywhere. In fact, at Let's Big, they were talking about some of the stats

49:15.640 --> 49:21.260
including the attach rate, which right now is about 60%, which is a lot better than the

49:21.260 --> 49:28.600
10% that they had on the original Xbox. They said that more than 1 billion Microsoft points

49:28.600 --> 49:35.340
have been activated, which in the current exchange rate comes to $12.5 million in revenue,

49:35.340 --> 49:41.420
they said that the average Xbox Live user has downloaded about 25 pieces of content

49:41.420 --> 49:47.300
with about 45 million overall downloads. They were also pointing out that some of the first

49:47.300 --> 49:52.360
games to use the Xbox Live anywhere are actually going to be some of the Vista games including

49:52.360 --> 50:02.940
Shadowrun and Halo 2. So that's very cool. They didn't really specify on how it's going

50:02.940 --> 50:09.700
use live anywhere but um should be very interesting and um i can't wait for uh the live vision

50:09.700 --> 50:13.300
camera which they mentioned of course is coming out why what are you gonna do with your live

50:13.300 --> 50:21.300
camera what am i not gonna do with my life camera all right uh la la la la la uh yeah

50:21.300 --> 50:26.500
anyway um one thing i have been dying for and i know you uh america and the rest of

50:26.500 --> 50:31.940
the world that listen to this program i'm dying for is a pink nintendo ds light i am

50:31.940 --> 50:36.960
so excited this is being released a pink Nintendo DS light and a black one too

50:36.960 --> 50:42.380
are being released on September 13th in the US it's my understanding I

50:42.380 --> 50:45.440
believe I read somewhere the UK is getting the pink one as well so they are

50:45.440 --> 50:48.560
getting the pink one our buddies over there will get that as well but we get a

50:48.560 --> 50:51.160
black one well they already have the black one over there so yes exactly so

50:51.160 --> 50:53.900
now we're gonna match up finally we'll have all the colors and this is one of

50:53.900 --> 50:58.160
those instances where I'm very glad I did not splurge and get the white DS

50:58.160 --> 51:03.700
Because I would much prefer a black one or maybe a pink one depending on how I'm feeling on September 13th

51:03.700 --> 51:10.580
Well, that was not the only systems that were getting some pink makeovers including in the UK

51:10.700 --> 51:17.860
They are getting a PlayStation 2 the slim model. That's also gonna be in pink including they're gonna have some bundles

51:17.860 --> 51:20.300
They're gonna be discounted including two pink

51:21.060 --> 51:22.280
controllers

51:22.280 --> 51:24.280
and a pink memory card and

51:24.280 --> 51:29.840
And, you know, SingStarPop is going to be bundled in there as well.

51:29.840 --> 51:36.360
For the most flamboyant PlayStation 2 bundle that's out there, it should be noted, as we

51:36.360 --> 51:42.160
mentioned last week, that the US is getting a different colored PlayStation 2 slim model,

51:42.160 --> 51:46.960
a silver one actually, which I believe has been available in the UK already.

51:46.960 --> 51:50.200
They're also getting a pink PSP as well.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.520
Goody goody.

51:51.520 --> 51:55.960
So they think that that's going to appeal to women gamers because you know the only

51:55.960 --> 52:00.720
thing stopping women gamers out there from actually purchasing consoles was the color.

52:00.720 --> 52:04.800
Dark Sakura please explain the expression on your face because this is radio.

52:04.800 --> 52:08.120
That's the most retarded thing I think I've ever heard.

52:08.120 --> 52:12.080
Alright well speaking of colorful we certainly get emails every week and hopefully they've

52:12.080 --> 52:14.080
kept the language to a minimum in the emails.

52:14.080 --> 52:18.120
I don't know Dark Sakura did you have to suit up the asbestos this week for the email bag?

52:18.120 --> 52:22.480
You know it wasn't bad enough for the asbestos, I just went in with a gas mask and some hand

52:22.480 --> 52:23.480
sanitizer.

52:23.480 --> 52:27.720
Alright, well you can email us with your colorful thoughts at mailbag at orangeslawnsradio.com

52:27.720 --> 52:31.400
and DarkSakura will dip in there and pull out some emails like she's going to do right

52:31.400 --> 52:38.320
now.

52:38.320 --> 52:43.200
Well given the sort of short week for right now, and by the way, thank you for taking

52:43.200 --> 52:45.440
care of mail for me while I was at Disneyland.

52:45.440 --> 52:46.440
No problem.

52:46.440 --> 52:47.440
It was fun.

52:47.440 --> 52:52.380
actually let miklotov read oh fun oh we tried to give him the illusion of that

52:52.380 --> 52:55.420
he was an actual full-fledged co-host for a night it was fun why don't we

52:55.420 --> 52:58.980
downgrade him to dwarf host I don't know because he might he might bite you in

52:58.980 --> 53:05.560
an ankle no Pluto was downgraded so now so miklotov made a sci-fi joke I get it

53:05.560 --> 53:10.300
so miklotov is our dwarf host okay that's cool we could call him zena we

53:10.300 --> 53:15.980
can call him mini dark soccer okay I'll get into that during the f-use okay I

53:15.980 --> 53:19.620
wanted a planet named Xena. That's fine, that's fine. Anyway, um, first one is from

53:19.620 --> 53:25.780
Grin without a Cat, who I think is uber cool. Um, hey, I like that name because it

53:25.780 --> 53:29.980
makes me think of Alice in Wonderland. That's all. Don't get me started on the

53:29.980 --> 53:34.620
whole Alice Mad Hatter thing. Okay, um, hey Orange Challenge crew, you probably

53:34.620 --> 53:38.360
already heard of this one but I've just discovered Rhythm Tim Goku on the GBA

53:38.360 --> 53:41.500
for Nintendo. In fact, it's the same people who did WarioWare and it shows.

53:41.500 --> 53:44.980
If you haven't heard of it, there's some videos. It's actually on Nintendo.co.jp

53:44.980 --> 53:51.980
It looks great fun to me and I'm thinking of importing it but wanted to check on what

53:52.080 --> 53:56.380
you guys thought about the game and the possibility of it getting an English language release

53:56.380 --> 54:00.380
before I did since you were the expert on music games.

54:00.380 --> 54:04.760
Well I haven't heard of it getting an English release at all, I don't think it's coming

54:04.760 --> 54:09.660
out here, but I bet you it will if another certain Japanese import game does very well

54:09.660 --> 54:10.380
over here.

54:10.380 --> 54:16.680
Yeah, I think that if Oh Endon or Elite Beat Agents, I should say, does well over here, then...

54:16.680 --> 54:24.580
I think it's going to open the floodgates for music games on the handheld, so I think, you know, support Elite Beat Agents and I'll bet you anything, you're going to see a ton.

54:24.580 --> 54:28.280
Hopefully not cheap knockoff clones, but some good stuff.

54:28.280 --> 54:34.980
One music title that's kind of often overlooked is Electroplankton, because it was kind of a harder one to get. You had to get it on Nintendo Store and everything.

54:34.980 --> 54:37.180
Electroplankton was cool, though, from the demo.

54:37.180 --> 54:40.580
right it's not a rhythm game per se it's a music creation game

54:40.580 --> 54:43.860
but I think a lot of people that are into music and rhythm games are into it

54:43.860 --> 54:44.500
because

54:44.500 --> 54:47.580
of the fact that it feels like you're making music at least that's why like I

54:47.580 --> 54:49.260
love beatmania and you know

54:49.260 --> 54:53.140
2DX and all that stuff is I feel like I'm actually making music so definitely

54:53.140 --> 54:56.540
check out electroplankton I think you'll get a kick out of it. There's a little bit more to this email

54:56.540 --> 54:59.940
Oh sorry. Rob. Hey Rob.

54:59.940 --> 55:04.800
Just read the damn email. Hi. I missed you but my aim's improving

55:04.800 --> 55:11.100
This would probably make a boring question for the show as I expect many of the listeners

55:11.100 --> 55:14.960
to be pretty knowledgeable on the whole music genre, but I was wondering if you could help

55:14.960 --> 55:15.960
me out.

55:15.960 --> 55:20.580
I'm over in the UK and we don't get the choice in rhythm action genre that you guys in North

55:20.580 --> 55:21.860
America get.

55:21.860 --> 55:25.800
We do get quite a few of these games, Space Channel 5, Guitarman, Donkey Konga, and Guitar

55:25.800 --> 55:32.120
Hero for example, but we still miss out on things such as Beatmania and Drum Master,

55:32.120 --> 55:37.320
I guess that would be taiko. Thankfully both the DS and PSP are region-free, so I've been

55:37.320 --> 55:43.160
able to import great games such as Daigasou Bandbrothers, Osutatakai Oendan, and Drum

55:43.160 --> 55:48.280
Master Portable. I was wondering if you could recommend any music games that are available

55:48.280 --> 55:54.040
on either the GBA, DS, or PSP. I don't really know any Japanese, but I haven't had any problems

55:54.040 --> 55:57.880
working my way around the ones already mentioned. Keep up the great work, it's appreciated,

55:57.880 --> 56:00.640
grid without a cap. What a very humble email, I really appreciate

56:00.640 --> 56:03.160
Very humble attitude in that email.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.800
I think I just kind of recommended one there.

56:05.800 --> 56:10.480
We had the electroplankton was my suggestion there.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.200
Actually, you kind of name most of the big ones.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.080
There's not a whole lot that we get that you guys don't get.

56:15.080 --> 56:18.040
I mean, honestly, most of the ones you named, we also have.

56:18.040 --> 56:20.840
Handhelds, there's not a lot of music games on handhelds.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.240
The DDR games on handheld were poopy.

56:23.240 --> 56:24.080
You don't want those.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.940
Well, I would say the only one I can think of that he didn't

56:26.940 --> 56:29.200
mention, and it's not even out over here,

56:29.200 --> 56:32.840
and I don't know how well it would play on a PSP,

56:32.840 --> 56:33.760
DJ Maxx.

56:33.760 --> 56:35.680
Yeah, DJ Maxx has a big cult following.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.960
I know there's a couple folks on our forums.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.600
I want to say there's an OL Army that's being formed for DJ Maxx

56:40.600 --> 56:42.080
or something like that.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.840
That might be one you want to look into.

56:43.840 --> 56:46.000
I would say that if you're, honestly, there's not

56:46.000 --> 56:49.960
a good BeatMania for a handheld, except for the Wonderswan one.

56:49.960 --> 56:52.520
Which actually, I mean, I don't know if you have a Wonderswan,

56:52.520 --> 56:55.640
but it actually has a little scratch pad

56:55.640 --> 56:57.680
that you attach to it, and all the sound effects

56:57.680 --> 56:59.120
were digitized.

56:59.120 --> 57:01.620
So, it's the closest you can get to having the actual handle beating it.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.620
Yeah, I'm not a fan of beat-meaning on a handheld, though.

57:03.620 --> 57:06.120
I don't know, but DJ Max seems to be alright. I haven't played it in depth.

57:06.120 --> 57:10.620
Well, the one thing I liked about the Wonderswan version is that it played on the side, and you had enough buttons to accommodate the game.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.120
That was kind of neat.

57:12.120 --> 57:15.620
But, then again, the turntable didn't quite fit, because I have a Wonderswan color.

57:16.620 --> 57:17.620
Well, la-di-da.

57:17.620 --> 57:20.120
Well, I'm saying, that's the problem I had with it.

57:22.120 --> 57:27.620
I don't know if you're interested in it, too, but they also do make, sort of, like the Tiger Toy games.

57:27.620 --> 57:31.500
They have Beatmania and DDR Portable.

57:31.500 --> 57:32.940
There's even a Hello Kitty one.

57:32.940 --> 57:35.540
And it's just like the size of a Pokemon Pikachu.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.700
Cute.

57:36.700 --> 57:38.900
They actually, not meaning,

57:38.900 --> 57:40.700
I'm not actually saying this to actually plug a site,

57:40.700 --> 57:42.500
but it is the one site I know that you can order them.

57:42.500 --> 57:45.700
NCSX has them, and Toys and Joys.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.900
So, if you're interested in that type of thing.

57:47.900 --> 57:50.020
I'd say look through any of the importers list

57:50.020 --> 57:51.900
except for BuyRight, because they suck.

57:51.900 --> 57:53.540
But look through any of the importers lists.

57:53.540 --> 57:54.900
Didn't BuyRight go out of business?

57:54.900 --> 58:00.980
By right got shut down by the Better Business Bureau. All right next email. Hahaha. I was so happy

58:01.140 --> 58:03.140
Okay, it's actually the last one is

58:04.580 --> 58:06.580
From

58:08.220 --> 58:10.220
Surya noji sama 91

58:10.380 --> 58:14.480
From our chat. He was the phantom caller that didn't pick up for the music because it's my battery died

58:14.480 --> 58:17.620
Oh, I got to miss out on a fun contest last week

58:17.620 --> 58:20.020
Which by the way, we will do again because I got a really good reception

58:20.020 --> 58:23.420
And by the way, we had Jamie play tonight the game from last week

58:23.420 --> 58:29.460
If you're not even not sure we're talking about download part B of last week's show Jamie got six, so not too shabby

58:29.460 --> 58:34.860
I'll write more down next time. I didn't write anything down. Yeah, she just named him off the top her head

58:34.860 --> 58:42.660
So that was pretty good. It's pretty good as I'm hardcore. Okay, dear. Olr. I'm afraid I'm afraid for a lot of consumers

58:43.460 --> 58:47.640
Afraid that they're going to be screwed over by Sony during this next-gen console war

58:47.640 --> 58:51.640
I've been a loyal Sony fan over the years, maybe a little too loyal.

58:51.640 --> 58:56.520
I own both an import PS2 and an American PS2, and I also happen to own a Japanese PSP which

58:56.520 --> 58:57.800
I ordered at launch.

58:57.800 --> 59:01.920
I'm afraid of the future of Sony with their release to the PS3 because of the possible

59:01.920 --> 59:03.760
slip in sales due to the price tag.

59:03.760 --> 59:07.560
I know people are going to buy the PS3, and it's obvious that they are going to sell out

59:07.560 --> 59:13.080
at launch, but with their questionable market strategy releasing the PS3 under two SKUs

59:13.080 --> 59:17.160
at sky-high prices, charges

59:17.160 --> 59:20.920
for useless game content and the loss of sales at the UMD.

59:20.920 --> 59:25.000
Sony may be in deep doo-doo this go-round. I would like to know what your

59:25.000 --> 59:27.200
thoughts are about purchasing the PS3 and

59:27.200 --> 59:30.960
also if it will be in good investment or a possible, quote, dreamcast.

59:30.960 --> 59:35.000
Thanks, loyal fan. Ricky? You know what's funny is we had a very similar email last week.

59:35.000 --> 59:36.320
There's been a lot of Sony

59:36.320 --> 59:40.080
questioning going on lately, which isn't much of a surprise.

59:40.080 --> 59:44.460
I'm gonna stick by something I said kind of similar last week is that you know

59:44.460 --> 59:48.200
what I don't think it's something that I want to get on launch day but the end

59:48.200 --> 59:50.760
and get then again the PlayStation 2 wasn't really something I needed on

59:50.760 --> 59:55.560
launch day either so give it time see where it goes but for right now I don't

59:55.560 --> 59:58.840
see any need to run out and buy I realize there's been a lot of hype

59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.480
recently you know cuz the Xbox 360 had this huge launch thing and like that's

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.560
been like the big thing lately is launch day launch day but you don't have to buy

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.120
into that hype wait it's fine wait for the game you want to come out and then

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.480
make a decision I mean I'm waiting for Final Fantasy 13 or something else they

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.680
will grab my attention that same style then I will make a decision I still

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.980
stand by what I have always said since day one a system is only as good as the

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:28.240
games that are on it and from what I played it's crap even Sonic adventure as

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.640
for comparing it to the dreamcast I don't think that it's nothing is ever

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.600
going to be yeah because the dreamcast is kind of the other way around where

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.800
was just horribly underrated. But the system itself was so versatile. Yeah. I mean, hello

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:46.680
Bleemcast. You had a system that could run Playstation games. Did you notice the news

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.680
that was this week, um, that they were talking about? Remember Gran Turismo HD has a wor-

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.240
it was basically a tech demo? No, actually it's a full game. That's actually gonna be

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:04.720
now it is they have said it it is a port of Gran Turismo 4 all they did was

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:12.920
upscale the graphics and that is it so yay you can pay $59.99 for a freaking

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:17.000
game that is basically Gran Turismo 4 and by the way you can just get Gran

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.680
Turismo 4 and just put it in there and pretty much do the same thing Robway is

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.760
one of our loyals in chat right now and he says by the way a Best Buy HD DVD

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.020
outnumbers blu-ray two to run two to one so something to think about I so

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:36.500
remember DMN pointing out experience with comparing HD and blu-ray and HD

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.620
blowing away blu-ray all right oh you know what was pointed out to me and this

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.100
is actually this is our joke of the weekend

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.420
would me Kristen and Meg Z were hanging out our joke was that Ken kunaragi needs

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:53.740
oven mitts and a helmet and eats crayons because when asked what will you do if

01:01:53.740 --> 01:02:01.500
the blu-ray fails he said I don't understand how can it fail beta exactly

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:05.420
that's the same remember that's brave man even if the beta and that was also

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:09.700
Sony's format too even though the Betamax was technologically a superior

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:15.260
format it still failed against VHS hmm I could I could see Ken going you know what

01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:19.740
if the PlayStation 3 does not sell I'll go door-to-door and punch people in the

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:23.820
face you know make them buy it at gunpoint or whatever all right so

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:28.740
quote Junami inconceivable you keep using that word I do not think it means

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:32.460
what you think we need we need some good mails that hate on Nintendo and

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:37.460
Microsoft to be fair no so send some Microsoft and Nintendo hate if you're

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:42.220
feeling it be obvious over the mailbag and orange hundred our listeners I hope

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:46.100
I'm not assuming for all of you mind you but our listeners in general I've seen

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:51.880
more support for Nintendo and followed by Microsoft. I honestly am seeing... Truthfully

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.080
I do feel the same way, but I want to hear from the other side. I actually am having

01:02:55.080 --> 01:03:00.160
that same warm feeling in my heart for the Wii that the Dreamcast gave me. You know what?

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.920
I'll give you some hate news right here. The Wii is not going to have, the third party

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:11.580
Wii titles will not be online at launch. And that's because Nintendo is not giving out

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:18.300
the actual libraries to build online for the third-party titles until 2007 and the theory

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.800
is that they're trying to perfect the online with their first-party titles and once they

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.220
get that correct then they will, you know, release libraries.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:32.460
So if you're looking forward to playing some online Red Steel or online, you know, Tony

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:35.500
Hawk or whatever, nope, not gonna happen.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.880
Please don't make the same mistake you made with the GameCube Nintendo, that's all I have

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880
to say.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:39.880
Please do not make the same mistake.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.960
but I don't think they are but I just kinda

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.960
wish they would go online but whatever okay sir

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.720
their release in 2007 so at least it's on the horizon

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.540
will call him for DS didn't start online and it turned out okay so I'm and you

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.960
know what the night I was it

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.780
most the systems out there didn't start off online on the only accepted probably

01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.840
being the 360

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.360
to say so though the dreamcast did actually come with

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.720
a dial-up modem that's awesome

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.760
We paid for the broadband that only worked on Quake 3

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.560
All right, yeah, there's other people in this world who need oven mitts and a helmet

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:23.760
If you all would like to email us send us an email to mailbag at orange launch radio comm send a dark soccer your oven mitts

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:29.840
And helmets I do take worship too. All right. Well anyways, there are some interesting news coming out

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:33.640
I remember we talked about it. I think a little bit last week about how

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.200
some of the Toys R Us

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.200
Stores were actually selling the Xbox Live camera early.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:48.200
In fact, a few weeks early, because it's not supposed to come out until around the 19th and 20th of September.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.200
Well, some interesting news about that actually.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.200
One of the apparent readers of...

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.200
What was it?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.200
Xbox360.qj.net

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:09.200
read the headline on their site, and actually went down to a South Miami, Florida store

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.120
and purchased one of the cameras.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.080
And he was speaking to the clerk there and asked them why they were selling it two weeks

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080
early.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:21.800
And it says, he was told by Microsoft that they're releasing a limited number for selective

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.240
sales.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.840
And his assumption was, I can only assume that this was to start Buzz, in other words,

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:34.720
sort of viral campaign to basically get the buzz out there about the brand new camera.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:38.360
For all those people that play UNO online, they go, OMG I'm starting to see people with

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.360
cameras.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.720
Ooh, look, naked people.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.800
Well, anyways, if you are looking for some information about the camera, it is going

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.400
to be coming out in two different SKUs.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:52.960
There's going to be a cheaper one for $39.99, which is the camera, a live headset, in case

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.080
you don't have one, a free month of Live Gold and Uno, a card for the full game of Uno.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.380
And supposedly later on they're going to allow a free download for Totem Ball because not

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.740
only is it playable through the camera.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:12.440
Then there's one also for $70.99, or $79.99, and that also includes the camera, the headset,

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:20.560
a full year of Xbox Live Gold, and of course a free month, Uno, the full game, a to be

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:27.560
announced third game for the camera and 200 Microsoft points. So, very interesting.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.960
Huh. Too bad I already bought Uno.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:30.960
Yeah, same.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:31.960
Yeah, thanks Microsoft.

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:33.120
They should have just given us Microsoft points.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.240
Yeah, give us Microsoft points instead. Let's buy something else.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:41.600
Jerks! Well, yeah, the one thing you could have bought would be these new Xbox Live Arcade

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:47.480
games that are being developed. They're tabletop European game favorites that are being ported

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:52.160
over to Xbox Live Arcade. The Settlers of Catan is one game that's coming over to Xbox

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:57.840
Live and forgive me if I'm horribly mispronouncing these, I've never heard of these games before

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.680
in my life. Carcassonne is another game that's coming over and Alhambra are some games that

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.880
are coming over to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.940
Don't they bottle water?

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.180
Maybe in this country, but over there it's a board game. So that should be interesting.

01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:14.320
Where's Axis and Allies? That's one of those. And Risk.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:18.320
Imagine online multiplayer risk.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.520
You think Uno is bad? Draw four, bitch!

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.720
Or Monopoly. Monopoly would be ridiculous.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:30.640
Why can't they give us chess? Can you imagine how a hardcore

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.640
risk would be online? I just took Russia, bitch!

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:38.000
Or just like some board game collection like Connect Four

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.640
or like Battleship. I suck your battleship, bitch!

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.080
You have sunk my battleship!

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.400
Go back to the start, bitch!

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400
Do not-

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.200
Go directly to go, bitch!

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.080
Do not collect $200 or I kick your ass!

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:57.080
For great justice.

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.520
Or, as Drunami says in chat, I call the thimble, bitch!

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.520
He used the thimble?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.960
You gotta fuckin' shoot, bitch!

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960
Uh-uh!

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.960
Uh-uh!

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:07.960
It's the puppy!

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:08.960
I use a-

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.440
It's on with chutes and ladders, MF-er!

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:15.100
mom alright anyway that by the way the reason why we do that because if you've

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.840
ever actually like play it on Xbox live and listen to people like seriously they

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.580
trash-talk and everything everything this is why we play with the thing

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:27.400
turned off you need to put out like a strawberry I just feedback on everyone

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:33.700
I'm like you know I don't care this I'll be the test yeah I wish you could type

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:39.820
things in like eBay was fun to play with a plus plus plus would death match again

01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:45.400
you know what I want I really want like some multiplayer and Viva pinata I killed

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.660
your pinata bitch I mean just like the cute now give me

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:55.480
candy bitch the cutest like fucking game they need to just have an online death

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:00.760
match for and just be hilarious loco broken death match yeah all right

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:06.940
whatever keep it moving well as far as movements and this sort of makes me

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:11.200
think more of bowel movements that Louisiana game law business that we've

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.420
been hearing so much about hence the results of bowel movements making me

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:21.220
think of actually it got stopped the unstoppable you know law got stopped

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:25.580
yeah basically Jack Thompson was going around saying the law is constitutional

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.300
as it addresses all the complaints raised by federal courts which have

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.900
struck down other state video game laws that's what he's quoted as saying um yeah

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:40.580
know you're still a dumbass Jackie poo so uh it was basically shot down by a

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:45.420
federal judge said it was unconstitutional I think that that is

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.860
fabulous there's also I remember reading on game politics they're saying that

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:57.460
the video game industry filed for injunction against having it go into into

01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:04.100
law while or I should say practice while they're still undergoing the various

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:10.580
appeals and stop wasting our tax money seriously well the the bill sponsor was

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:15.940
saying was basically saying that he hoped testosterone would quote have the

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:20.660
additional adrenaline and testosterone needed in the upcoming cockfight over

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:25.540
the constitutionality of this bill anything that's going to attack our

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:32.860
right to express ourselves or even you know it's still somebody's creative work

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:39.980
and you're trying to censor how they are expressing their work it's still

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:44.380
somebody somebody sat and thought this idea up and you are suppressing this

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:49.980
idea now tell me what's constitutional about that Dark Sakura lay off the

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:55.640
Smackdown hmm interesting well I thought this was kind of funny and when I read

01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:00.400
this story I know we joked about this on another show like god damn it I'm not

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:05.280
buying that PlayStation 3 unless you know it cures cancer well they're gonna

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.700
be helping the cure cancer at the PlayStation 3 and the way they're doing

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:13.320
that is kind of been like a project that's been going on PC's right now with

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:21.600
the folding at home project basically using distributing power by while your

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.480
system is idle you can download a program or whatever and they'll

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:31.600
basically kind of compute I believe this is looking at some of the proteins or

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.760
whatever makeup I don't know it's computing something to basically help

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:41.900
cure cancer and they're going to be supposedly expecting to get 100

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:48.660
gigaflops with 10,000 ps3s churning away with this project so that's a lot of

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.780
processing power towards a very good cause hopefully I don't actually have to

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.020
you know run this no matter what but so is this how they justify the $600 price

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:04.900
tag is that if you buy one of these then you won't get cancer I mean is that they

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.780
actually have it is there is now the price tag sounds worth it again you can

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:14.280
guarantee me that. Maybe I can get my insurance to pay for it. I'm sorry, this actually reminds

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:20.720
me way too much of a book I read called, it's actually in the same series as Ring, Ring

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.600
Spiral and Loop. This makes me think a lot of loop because they, the premise of that

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:29.720
one is that they were building a society but it got infected like a virus and they're trying

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:34.480
to. Basically, yeah, they're crunching the math of folding proteins that hold the secret

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.200
to curing cancer. This is also like that old project study at home. One of the things I

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.720
thought was really funny, it was kind of a comment in this article, it says, but mom,

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.720
it cures cancer, if you don't buy it for me, granny will die. So I thought that was kind

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.800
of funny.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.200
Well, speaking of the Playstation 3, DarkSakura mentioned earlier that the lineup E3 for the

01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.140
Playstation 3 left a lot of people unimpressed. Well, there's going to be a whole lot more

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.720
shown at Tokyo Game Show. Sony's going to up it.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.960
Will they actually have systems?

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.940
uh... supposedly they're gonna have more stuff and they're gonna be showing a

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.100
whole lot of games

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.260
here's some stuff they're gonna be showing armored core four blade storm

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.220
haikunen sensu

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.900
uh... coded arms assault devil may cry four the eye of judgment fatal inertia

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:20.860
formula one world championship

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.300
genji working title

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.860

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.080

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.500
layer working title

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.140
mahjong takai four which probably won't come out here we ever got a mahjong game

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.460
actually come out in the u.s. we've had a couple of mahjong games

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:34.460
I've never seen one.

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:35.460
Mostly for PC.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:40.900
Mina no Golf 5, another working title, Mobile Suit Gundam Target in Sight, Motor Storm,

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:47.180
Railfan, Resistance, Fall of Man, Ridge Racer 7, and Warhawk are all going to make appearances

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:48.580
at the Tokyo Game Show.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:53.820
You know Genji, or not Genji, Mina no Golf actually sounds, it's a very cute, so it means

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.820
everybody's golf.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:55.820
Isn't that just hotshots?

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:56.820
Yeah.

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:57.820
Over there?

01:13:57.820 --> 01:13:58.820
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.180
Heavenly Sword reminds me of like a female, it's almost like crossing God of War with

01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.920
Yeah, pretty much. I'm looking forward to Devil May Cry 4.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:12.300
I need to get my Dante on. If Devil May Cry 4 is made of

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.900
awesome and win, will you maybe

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:17.140
find some love for PlayStation 3 in your black heart? Like I said,

01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:21.060
a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:24.460
Yes, ma'am. They need to fix Sonic Adventure, the bastards. Yes, ma'am.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:28.780
Would you notice it wasn't on the list? Yeah, that's because it's crap.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:32.780
Alright. Well, look, the fact that a lot of you folks are getting

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:37.140
to go to the Tokyo Game Show and we're not kind of makes us upset actually a

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.580
lot of our listeners probably aren't going

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:41.620
well we do have listeners in Japan so you know

01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:45.020
if you guys are going to the Tokyo Game Show we're a little jealous that we're

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:45.940
not getting to go

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:49.420
so that makes us a little bit angsty and you know what that means

01:14:49.420 --> 01:14:52.420
people die

01:14:52.420 --> 01:15:12.420
A big F.U. goes toward the astrological community, and I understand why Pluto was downgraded.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:18.820
For anyone who doesn't know, I love my geek science so much, and I understand the logic

01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:23.900
behind downgrading Pluto status to a dwarf planet you know you know it was

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.220
it was like a couple weeks ago that they were about to announce the 10th planet

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:32.860
planet Xena which I I was like I want they nicknamed as in warrior princess

01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:40.800
they nicknamed the the it was a larger ice mass that they were going to it was

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.860
nicknamed Xena and it's yes it's spelled the same way I was like I want planet Xena

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:50.900
that's cool now I do not get planet zena will the moon be planet Gabrielle it

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:57.500
should be you know Zena and Gabrielle leave it to the astro astronomy

01:15:57.500 --> 01:16:01.780
community to name planets after zena warrior princess characters that would

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:07.100
be awesome but but anyway there's a people who are saying oh so stupid you

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:12.860
know what look for you know first of all there was another planet before that

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:18.220
that existed in the 1800s that was actually downgraded to um i believe it was actually

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:23.580
figured out to be a comet instead of a planet it was downgraded in the 1800s we didn't get Pluto

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.700
until 1930 when it was just found and then they argued about it then too and then now that it's

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:35.340
Pluto they're saying oh you know what we changed our minds again you know 60 years later 70 years

01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:40.780
later you know this news makes Walt Disney roll in this grave some days i feel like Pluto i wonder

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:47.780
going to happen to Sailor Pluto? Is she going to shrink? Because she was really tall. Next

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:52.880
FU please. I have more on this, I have more on this. Well the whole reason being is that

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:58.200
one of the primary things is that the orbit of Pluto is elliptical and not circular in

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.960
general like most of the other planets. It actually intersects with Neptune. Which even

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.300
when I was a little kid was like, that's weird. So I agree with it, I understand. I just wish

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:13.620
people would just, you know, freaking understand that these new criteria that they have for

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:18.340
judging celestial bodies is actually sort of good and smart and should have been enacted

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.700
a long time ago. So, yeah.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:28.700
Lowkey, I don't care what you all say, the world's flat. Anyways, um.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:29.860
As flat as your ass.

01:17:29.860 --> 01:17:37.400
Thank you. I take that as a compliment. No, anyways, um, so, after you did drivers, because

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.400
As I was leaving here yesterday, see, we were supposed to be doing some important work,

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.400
um, interviewing a certain somebody, and the somebody decided to quit his company.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400
Grrr.

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:54.400
But anyways, so as I was leaving here, freaking crazy Asians in a goddamn little, like, Suzuki SUV thing,

01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.400
one of those mini-SUVs, blew through a goddamn stop sign, just WOOM, you know,

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400
and I honked my horn and they're like,

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.400
What happened? I don't know.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.960
So, you know, stupid drivers, I swear to God, they're like trying to kill me out there.

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:10.680
It's just, you know, you need to watch where you're going. I mean, as I mentioned-

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:13.760
Are you ever gonna have a week when you have an F.U. for something other than drivers?

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.640
I've had plenty of weeks where I've had things of, you know-

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.840
I actually did have an email received that was an F.U. toward Loki's F.U.s.

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:23.600
What the hell are those people? What is their problem?

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.280
Why do they get to choose what I'm angry at? I don't understand. That doesn't make

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.240
any sense, whatever.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:31.880
Alright. You know, F.U.s are the damn TV at work.

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:34.680
because I took my TV to work since I don't have a place to put my old TV

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:37.720
I have a sub F.U. to male drivers

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:42.040
as in people with small penises that drive big trucks

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:46.960
like the ones that tried to go past me until he with my faster Lancer got in front of them

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.360
and flipped them off hardcore

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:53.000
My F.U. of the week, I don't have a lot I'm not very anxious this week so I suppose my F.U.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.080
of the week would go to Jamie

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:57.880
because you went to Disneyland

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.380
I know.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.880
And he didn't take me.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.880
It was Girl Trip.

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.880
So?

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.880
I will petition next time that Rob gets to come on our next big gay trip.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.880
Thank you. Thank you.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880
I want smoothies too some days, you know.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880
Do you really?

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880
No.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:18.880
By the way, Robway in the chat room.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.880
Yeah, you did give me a smoothie today. Thank you.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
Robway in the chat room says,

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.380
On the Astronomy, after declaring Pluto not a planet, they voted on Goofy, not a dog.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:30.880
I thought it was funny.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:31.380
And not funny.

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:31.880
I got-

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:32.880
I thought it was funny!

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.380
I got to hug Goofy!

01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.880
I meant Goofy's not funny.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.380
Oh.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.380
I got to hug Goofy.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.880
Actually, no, what was funny was Goofy at Goofy's Kitchen.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.380
We went to a character breakfast, teasing Alice about having an affair with the Mad Hatter.

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:46.880
It was funny.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.380
Have you ever played Toontown?

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:49.880
No, I haven't.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880
Kind of seems like something you'd like.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.100
Anyway, I saw advertisements for that TV. I got my picture with the princesses

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.960
back to gaming

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:04.280
Yes back to gaming I know there's some really interesting news from SMK

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:10.640
Yes, there was if people would give me a chance to freak and pull up my thing. Okay, you guys

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.640
All right

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:18.980
Today's fake news is host of orange knows radio dark sakura goes crazy and kills her co-host with a tray. Thank you

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:25.040
No, actually she doesn't do that because she was distracted by the pretty princesses. Can we get through tonight's show in like under two hours?

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.520
It's a mini show tonight, right? I wasn't sure

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:31.820
Okay, I'm gonna put the pictures up on our forums cuz the Ariel was so pretty

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:33.820
I was like, I wanted to follow her around

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.400
Okay

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:42.140
SNK I could walk to Disneyland by the time she gets to her next fucking story, you know, what?

01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:48.900
I'm going to take this lollipop that's shaped phallically and shove it up your ass if you

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.380
don't get to the next story.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:56.500
Because the next story is about one of my sleeper favorite games ever, so you really

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:57.500
need to get to it.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.940
Okay, so shut up so I can.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.940
Alright.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:01.940
I'm shutting up.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.660
Mr. He of Big Mouth.

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:08.140
Let's talk shit about everybody today, oooh.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.180
Okay!

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:17.360
So SNK is coming to Live Arcade and everybody goes YAY!

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.020
So guess what's going to be showing up on Xbox Live Arcade since Capcom decided to give

01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:24.640
us Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.800
We will be getting Garo Densetsu Special aka Fatal Fury Special.

01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:37.040
That's badass because I can play, what was his name, Tung-Fu-Ruu on Xbox Live.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.040
That makes me all kind of happy.

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.400
I was a Mai player.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:40.960
Mai is awesome.

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.760
Mai is so- Mai frickin' would kick Chun-Li's ass any day.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.760
Seriously?

01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:49.260
She'd fuckin' take her out and beat her ass up and then go,

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.260
Me bouncy!

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:51.260
When she wins.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.480
No, she says me bouncy.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.160
No, she says me bouncy.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.160
That's what she says.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.160
She just bounces.

01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:00.720
Actually, now they're saying that on PS2 they had a non-playable demo of King of Fighters

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:07.280
98 Ultimate Match with a playable demo of Garo Densetsu Battle Archives 2.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.380
also talking about Metal Slug Complete for PSP what I actually even more than

01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:18.300
having a Fatal Fury special I really want to see one of the old school KOF

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.420
games because okay I'll tell you how hardcore of a KOF fangirl I am we have

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:30.540
we went out and bought King of Fighters 2000 for the Neo Geo as in the cartridge

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:39.980
Neo Geo. Jamie. What? Duck King. Ah! So awesome. Sorry. So what was your, what was your KOF,

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:43.620
what's your major KOF team? I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters. I, I pretty much

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.340
quit at Fale Fairy Special. Ah, sad. I played it a couple times. I'm pretty sure whatever

01:22:48.340 --> 01:22:55.820
team I was on. My, Leona, and then my alternating ones of either, um, Athena, or Kim Kefwan.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:59.340
I was gonna say Kim Kefwan, Kim Kefwan actually I would play more than my. I, I guess I love

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:06.340
his moves. He's an awesome fighter. Or Iori with his letter pants. Typical fangirl. Typical

01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:13.560
fangirl. You know what? I also used the little boy with the big hat. Alright. Hmm. Well that's

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:22.780
pretty cool. Anyways, I'm sorry I'm getting. Loki found sounds so enthusiastic. Hmm. Little

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.780
Oh boy. Sounds like fun.

01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.780
Listen, okay.

01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:28.780
I wasn't really a huge fan of Fatal Theory.

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.780
I mean, I think I may have played it once

01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:32.780
at, like, a supermarket when they had those, you know,

01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.780
the Neo Geo with the four games on there.

01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:36.780
You know, when I was, you know, bored of Magical Lord

01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.780
or whatever. But, um.

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.780
You mean Magician Lord? By the way.

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.780
That's how much I played Neo Geo.

01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.780
Chatroom brought up World Heroes. That's pretty hot, too.

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:46.780
Exactly.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:48.780
I played the hell out of World Heroes.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.780
World Heroes Jet.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:57.980
Special. Brain Age was bestowed with the Edge Award because I guess it's edgy. No just kidding.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:02.620
It's actually the award is for games that show their willingness to aim higher and try something

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:10.300
new or original. God damn it. Okay I don't know if these people were nominated but it says Brain

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:19.660
Age beat out cult hits like Guitar Hero and Oindon and Amp 3. Dragon Quest VIII, Electroplankton,

01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:24.580
Indigo Prophecy, and Killer7. Okay, here's my couple problems here. Ant 3, first of all,

01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:29.580
is a sequel to a snowboarding game. I mean, I guess cutscenes were kind of different,

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:35.140
so I guess that would be something, but it's a snowboarding game, come on. And Dragon Quest,

01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:41.500
you know, 8? I don't know, was that original of a game? Or whatever. Anyway, so 1, so that's

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:47.660
awesome and you know the comment here made by Nintendo UK general manager

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:57.380
David Yarton is only Nintendo could make arithmetic fun huh well we all know

01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:02.580
Konami made dancing fun and DDR supernova had its tracklist revealed

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.440
earlier this week and some controversial songs showing up in the game the fan

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.120
community has their panties in a bunch that fallout boy is showing up with a

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:14.080
the dance dance in the game but you know some old fan favorites are coming to the

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.480
game freckles

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.760
which you guys remember from DDR Max and let's see we also have some other songs

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.320
of course since you've been gone by Kelly Clarkson was already announced

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:22.760
before

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.340
I love this song if you haven't heard this song yet I'm you really should

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:29.800
it's called the other side by Paul Van Dyke featuring Wayne Johnson that's a

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:30.400
really good one

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.560
Franz Ferdinand with Do You Want To, full song list is available over at

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:39.080
orangelandtrader.com Jamie get this battle without honor or humanity

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:42.820
which was made popular in Kill Bill, is going to be in DDR.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.860
Isn't that kind of weird? That is pretty awesome. I can imagine the steps to that. That'd be actually pretty cool.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:53.580
Yeah. UltraMix 4 also had its song list revealed. Very diverse song list, I gotta say.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.020
Let me get the bad news out of the way. There's a Toby Max song in it which

01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:57.420
can't...

01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:03.060
which makes me go, huh? But otherwise the game does a lot of fan service.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:06.420
Waka Laka, which fans been demanding forever, It's Raining Men

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:11.940
is in the game as well, some old fan favorites, and some really good contemporary hits as

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.380
well showing up in the game.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:17.700
I know we had Don't Cha by the Pussycat Dolls, a remix showing up there.

01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:23.640
We had Free by Blue October, the liberation mix, and Juno Reactor with Masters of the

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:33.860
Universe, Prodigy with No Good, Start the Dance, and Nevaraca.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:36.180
Real Life did Oblivion, it was the Nevaraca mix.

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:38.940
Stray Cats with Rock This Town.

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940
That's cool.

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.940
That is very cool.

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:42.660
And get this, this is so cool.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.260
I know you can appreciate this too, Darsagra.

01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:49.020
Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo.

01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:52.220
Isn't that cool?

01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:53.220
I know!

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.420
I know!

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.780
Jamie has like her mouth wide, like jaw on four.

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.780
I know.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.780
What a cool.

01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780
Rad.

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.300
Ultramix 4 is made of awesome and win, and we'll be playing some of these tracks that

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.660
perhaps you have not heard yet.

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.700
I can't tell you which ones because then I'd be telling you what's on the viewer, but pretty soon

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:13.180
We're gonna be playing some of these tracks here on orange launch radio live not during the podcast though

01:27:13.180 --> 01:27:19.100
See orange launch radio comm for the details. That is pretty cool. Well speaking of other things that are cool

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:25.340
there the cast of family guy has signed up to do voices for a game and

01:27:26.340 --> 01:27:31.120
2k actually said that the entire cast was signed to do a game that's based on the series

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.320
Um, it's supposed to be out in the fall. And of course since it's Family Guy, it will be based on the series

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.440
I'm still given how some of the Simpsons games have looked out

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:49.740
I'm not sure but as it was described is that you'll be able to switch back and forth between three characters, which is Peter Griffin

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:52.360
Stewie and

01:27:52.360 --> 01:28:00.080
Brian really cuz I would have thought that you could have switched back and forth between the plot and really obscure pop-culture references

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:06.400
That's our show. I think there's actually more characters than that because I remember seeing a screenshot with oh

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:14.520
God, I'm drawing blanks now. They're fucking neighbor. Yeah, I'm like raised. Yeah, I can't remember racing after the nurses

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:21.600
I think that they're going to be characters you interact with. Well, I'm not sure but yeah, it's freaking sweet

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:29.200
I know it's coming out actually in October, October 18th, so that's actually pretty sweet.

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.960
But you know what to be honest though, the game didn't look that good, I mean really

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:33.680
it didn't look that good.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.820
But if that might not be the game for you, you may be a fan of say import games such

01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:44.360
like Disgaea, and I mentioned Disgaea 2 was actually coming out this coming week, however

01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:49.240
though if you may want something a little bit more portable, well fear not, well if

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:57.500
if you live in Japan at least Disgaea is actually heading to the PSP so you can check that out.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:03.440
It's actually set to release in Japan on November 30th and they're going to be offering two

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.360
packages one for 4,800 yen which will be the standard package and 6,800 yen for a limited

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.920
edition version and they haven't really announced yet what's going to be coming out in the limited

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:21.640
version so maybe an import since the PSP is fully region free.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:24.960
Now it's not uncommon for games to be remade for other systems.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:31.000
So one other interesting quote that has people buzzing this week regards GameCube games possibly

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.520
being remade for the Wii.

01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.320
Quote from Miyamoto in Nintendo Dream Magazine, quote, I'm also thinking I can remake some

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.560
of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.800
Of course you can wander into a secondhand shop and buy a lot of these games still, so

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.120
so I don't think we can release these Wii Makes

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.480
at a full price.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.080
Since a lot of the development cost

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:52.640
has already been accounted for,

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.800
we'd be able to release these

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.280
at a much more affordable price.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:56.840
And if others also take advantage of this

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:59.840
and release Wii Makes, there's a high possibility

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.960
of a lot of software from third parties as well.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:04.440
Can you imagine if it's like, say for example,

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:08.720
I don't know, maybe like release Mario Kart Double Dash

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.280
for the Wii, like 10 bucks or something.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.720
Hello, you have a virtual console.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.280
It wouldn't be that hard to get them out there, you know.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.080
Well, the Virtual Console would be a little tough because those games are going to be

01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:23.840
quite large on, you know, well granted they're on like mini-DVDs, but still, I mean, that's

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.400
pretty large. But still though, if they could release something, you know, say even just

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:34.280
like some of the Luigi's Mansion or something would be perfect for the Wii, maybe something

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:37.760
like that for like, you know, even 1999 would be pretty cool.

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.000
Dude, I actually think that game would be pretty cool with the Wii.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.080
I would think they would probably do a sequel to Luigi's Mansion

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.240
more like first person or something. Luigi's Mansion 2 the non-sucky version.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:52.560
Alright, we'll see what happens with that.

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:56.200
Speaking of things that don't suck, DarkSakura likes to surf the web

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.380
up and down and back and forth every single week and find a website that she

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:01.280
loves and adores that she wants to share

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.880
with you, the listener. We call it DarkSakura's website of the week

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.800
and here it is.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:15.800
Today's website of the week is otterpops.com.

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:18.800
Dude! Alexander the Grape!

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.800
I know!

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:30.800
Okay, when I was in middle school in the 80s, we could go by Otter Pops on Friday after P.E.

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:37.800
You realize that pretty much all Otter Pops are is like a double-strength Kool-Aid that's frozen?

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800
I know! It's so good!

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:43.220
with those stupid little characters on them like Alexander the grape and I love

01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:48.140
them I know but this is pretty cool because it has music from the otter pop

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:53.800
stars and you can meet the band and fun stuff you can actually get otter pop t

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:59.020
shirts I want to go on an otter pop diet do you think I'd lose weight on another

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:04.860
pop diet actually yes could Sir Isaac lime help me lose a weight keep in mind

01:32:04.860 --> 01:32:09.140
I think an otter pop is what a hundred calories for you to get

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:14.700
Your a basic a full two thousand calories. Keep in mind how many otter pops you have to eat ten

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:17.700
That's not that's not hard for me. Well, I think actually one otter pops

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:20.500
I think about a hundred calories. So ten otter pops would be a thousand calories

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.900
So you'd eat 20 otter pops to get the two thousand. I'd be on a diet

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.500
So I have to restrict myself to like 13, but you'd be getting no nutritional content

01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:33.440
So actually your body would would actually poop out the rest of the sugar and start eating your muscles

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.680
so you'd be emaciated. Well that's a pleasant thought.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:40.160
Mmm, emaciation. Is all this explained for me on OtterPops.com?

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:44.280
You'd look like Ally McBeal.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:48.320
That would be pretty morbid for OtterPops. At least I'd be beautiful.

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:51.800
But I think it's cool because the site's

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.280
like fully interactive and you can actually buy OtterPops online and stuff

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.360
and it makes fun noises too. I want to have a flat ass like Loki. I need to go on the

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:00.400
OtterPop diet.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:05.120
whatever I don't have a flat ass

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:08.200
I know that's why I said the earth is as flat as your ass

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.200
alright um

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:16.080
but no otter pops especially the blue raspberry

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:20.360
I really don't know how to do a segment and otter pops is all about pudding pops

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:23.720
pudding pops are back pudding pops are

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:28.040
I miss pudding pops look I really don't know how to transition from otter pops to

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:29.400
this so I'm just gonna say it

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:33.480
Final Fantasy 3 came out in Japan and

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:37.720
basically it was sold out within 30 minutes of when shops open for business

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:38.080
there

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.960
there were lines early in the morning going around the block

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.880
waiting for this game it's a beloved game in the series Final Fantasy 3 so

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:50.560
why are you smiling? It sold out faster than an auto-pop melting in the summer heat

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.880
That's a good connection!

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:57.240
Loki just got promoted to head writer ladies and gentlemen

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:00.560
Yes, and now we have to give him a mannequin head and a sharpie.

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.440
So there you have it. It's all that fun. Why don't people line up like that here?

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.600
Well, I guess they did for Madden 2007, didn't they? Because they're stupid!

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:12.000
And they do that for, like, episode 3.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Yeah! Which is stupid! People line up for all those movies and stuff, but

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.040
they don't really have that same crate. Well, I guess there was Xbox 360. That was pretty nutty.

01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:24.760
Wait for Halo 3. Oh, Jesus. On September 9th, 1999,

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:28.460
I was in line for a Dreamcast with nine other people. No

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.040
They had us wrapped around the outside of the mall Wow, and then let us inside

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:38.480
I will not be waiting for Halo 3 because I'm guessing Halo 3 will probably be one of those titles that we get early in

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:40.480
Which case I will have it four days in advance

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:45.360
We're like all over this old DDR bundle packets when we first got DDR

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.520
I ordered mine online from Konami and got it like in five days

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.160
hmm

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.400
anywho

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.760
Something that you might be lining up for well, I guess maybe I don't know

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.740
Well blizzard is playing on doing wizard or a world of warcraft expansions every year. So which is kind of nice. I mean kind of

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.080
typical for most MMOs out there and

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:12.680
Man, oh definitely the final fantasy 11. So new expansions every year

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:18.120
Awesome. And of course, I remember rumblings of possibly Starcraft 2 dear blizzard

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:23.400
please put pandarins in the next expansion love sky thank you hugs and

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:28.980
kisses I was I almost quit um World of Warcraft I'm about ready to but here's

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:32.520
the thing and you guys need to talk me out of this okay miklotov is trying to

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:36.680
get me back on Final Fantasy 11 no so why shouldn't I go back to Final Fantasy 11

01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.080
because it looks pretty it really died I kind of miss it some days he's our

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:45.480
universe that's hot that is true over that is true I'm or actually actually

01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:49.480
Yeah, the Japanese ones coming out like, very soon, like the 31st, right?

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:51.480
So Jamie's gonna quit World of Warcraft?

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.480
Yeah, you know what? Fuck Final Fantasy XI, Fantasy Star Universe for a little while for me.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.480
And Fantasy Star Universe? No cost to you as far as online goes because it's gonna be over live.

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:02.480
Oh, I love you Sega! Yay!

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:04.480
Sega is still our friend.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:07.480
Oh, Sega. At least I assume it's no cost.

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:13.480
I'm assuming because they have dedicated servers and stuff, I could be wrong, but I'm assuming it's no cost because it's over live and stuff.

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.480
Actually, I think I'm going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:16.480
Don't hold me to that.

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.480
Alright, alright, fine.

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:20.480
I think in the interim I am going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:25.480
But, um, yeah, I guess there is the PC version and they're not dedicated server.

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.480
Thank you for the, again, because now when Megalotov tries to pressure me to go back

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:31.480
to Final Fantasy XI, I'm just going to say, look, Phantasy Star, look, I can't, I can't.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:32.480
You'll quit too when Phantasy Star comes out.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:33.480
We need to go back to PS Opium.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.480
At least for a month.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.480
I can't wait to start the OL Army Guild on Phantasy Star Universe.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.480
That's going to be tons of fun.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.800
fun and if you want to join the O.L. Army on any variety of games it's growing and growing.

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:48.160
It's going to be Saints Row. I'm starting a gang in Saints Row. Yeah Saints Row is going

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.960
to be fun as well. And Saints Row is a game that I fucking own at so you know what I can't

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:58.360
with them fighting. Oh you're going to throw down the challenge to Scott and actually play

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.520
this time? Fuck that I'll do deathmatches by myself because I can guarantee that I will

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.400
be there but I can't guarantee a team match or something. We'll see maybe if we can build

01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:11.920
in a while army if we can get fucking it's just it's participation but one-on-one man or even like

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.120
in a you know throw down death match type thing i'm there because i've been i've been gearing up

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:22.800
with you know grand theft auto fuck dude if grand theft auto vice city stories on the psp were online

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:29.600
oh oh man i would just kick so much ass all right orange launcher trader.com if you want to uh join

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.960
into fun there. Any last minute stories kids? Oh yeah, got lots of fun stuff. One thing

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:43.960
that I was reading here on, it was actually xbox360.qj.net, they were talking about, there

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:50.000
was this story regarding the vision camera and the third packing game that we didn't

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.400
know what it was. Apparently, Robotron is the thought here and that comes from actually

01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:03.120
Xbox 365 so I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks now here's something very interesting

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.940
if you pre-order Ellibits one of the fun little prizes that you're gonna get is a stuffed

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:17.740
Ellibit so a little plushy thing for you and yeah that was pretty much my fun oh oh I wanted

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:22.180
to mention real quick actually I got a few more I forgot Crackdown that game's gonna

01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:27.340
be coming out actually November 1st and they've got some pretty cool stuff that they're going

01:38:27.340 --> 01:38:34.820
to be offering as downloadable content. One thing that they're talking about is a instant

01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:42.140
replay kind of program that will allow you to record your own replays, kind of like a

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:46.500
replay editor and be able to upload them and show them to friends and stuff. So that's

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:52.420
kind of cool and they're also talking about adding actual sections to the map as another

01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:58.220
kind of download because they built the game with that kind of stuff in mind. Some other

01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:03.500
things if you aren't getting cracked down and you happen to pick up a box of cereal,

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:10.140
Kellogg's is packing some really crappy Xbox mini games that you can check out including

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:19.420
Spaceship Blaster, Motorcycle Madness, Disco Mania, Robo Blast, and Mystic Castle, which I'm sure are worth every cent that you pay for them.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:25.940
And then the one I wanted to end with here, which I thought was very interesting, UiBol and his boxing matches.

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:33.100
Well, he's picked out the matches now, and they basically have the whole lineup, including

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:42.580
of course Richard Lotax from Something Awful, and Cool News writer Jeff Snyder, horror magazine

01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:50.220
Rue Morgue writer Chris Alexander, and a fifth opponent who it says, and this is from GameStop,

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.380
GameSpot has reason to believe is a minor.

01:39:53.380 --> 01:39:57.620
So Ooey Bowl is beating up children, excellent.

01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:00.340
Still a loser.

01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:06.260
Now I actually have a couple of stories, it actually, as they applied to our European

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:13.160
listeners, Microsoft actually cut the Xbox 360 core unit to 199 pounds.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:21.780
So it actually is, that actually was effective as of today, I should say yesterday.

01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:28.800
pounds lighter. It's on a diet. So yeah they've dropped the retail price so that it

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:34.740
would sell a little bit better I suppose. Also I believe that I read this right is

01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:42.160
that Eurogamer.de has launched. So for our German friends there is a

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.640
there's some good info there. They actually have pictures of Silent Hill

01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:51.120
Origins up there as well. Unfortunately I can read German but I do not

01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:58.320
understand it. I know what an S-Tet is though. The little B thing, it goes...

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:05.320
Alright. But I took German for three weeks and then had to change classes.

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:09.120
Alright, I have one last piece of news and it's actually regarding

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.620
Phantasy Star Universe. It's coming from the chat room. John F. is in chat

01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:16.320
right now and he's like a guru on Phantasy Star Universe. He's saying about

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:20.980
the pricing. It's unknown right now about the 360. It's rumored that Sega's

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.260
trying to work it out with Microsoft right now on the pricing there will be a

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:27.700
monthly payment for the PS2 and Windows version but if you just want to play

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:32.020
story mode and extra mode there's no fee there so just FYI. That was actually how

01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:37.220
a PSO was though on Xbox. Right. Until their billing messed up and a lot of

01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:38.860
people got their accounts for free.

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:45.340
Very cool. I know actually you cost me 19 Julie. She didn't pay for a PSO for

01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:46.100
three years.

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:47.100
Nice.

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.100
Nice.

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.260
Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.260
That's going to do it.

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:53.980
Remember, no Part B this week, folks.

01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.660
It's a mini episode because we're pre-taping.

01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.020
We will see you back here with a full episode next week, though.

01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.100
It should be a fun time.

01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.100
Power Preview will start next week.

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.100
It's going to be fun.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:02.100
Loki, final thought.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.900
I've got to play lots of Saints here this weekend.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.020
My final thought is I need to hurry up and schedule my next Street Fighter 2 match.

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:11.500
I forgot I was in that tournament until like two seconds ago when Arcade came up.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.860
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:16.780
I've been telling everybody give me money for Christmas so that I can buy a premium

01:42:16.780 --> 01:42:19.620
annual pass for Disneyland.

01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:21.140
That's what I want for Christmas from everybody.

01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.700
Alright, we'll see if she gets it.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.700
Till next time.

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:25.820
And reject false icons.

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:26.820
Till next time.

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:29.140
