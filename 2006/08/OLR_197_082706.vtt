00:14.019 --> 00:26.569
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, August 27th, 2006, Rob and Loki report on the Konami BBQ, how was that Nintendo press conference this week anyway, and how many Xbox Live points will you need to spend to play a full game of Luminous?

00:32.335 --> 00:36.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:36.856 --> 00:42.378
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that independent podcast dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle.

00:42.778 --> 00:43.759
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:43.779 --> 00:46.940
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky and I'm here on this journey with you every single week.

00:47.340 --> 00:52.061
[SPEAKER_05]: Also joining us in our party, say hello to our resident black mage, DarkSakura.

00:52.441 --> 00:52.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuego.

00:53.142 --> 00:55.062
[SPEAKER_05]: Also known as Jamie Summers.

00:55.102 --> 00:55.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuego.

00:55.682 --> 00:55.983
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuego 3.

00:56.043 --> 00:56.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Fern.

00:56.563 --> 00:56.863
[SPEAKER_03]: Fern.

00:56.943 --> 00:57.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Fern.

00:58.323 --> 00:59.384
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:25.690 --> 01:29.253
[SPEAKER_03]: We had this all scheduled out like months in advance before we even realized.

01:29.893 --> 01:35.438
[SPEAKER_03]: So the baby bats came out in full force on Sunday, so we avoided Haunted Mansion.

01:38.061 --> 01:41.604
[SPEAKER_05]: I could just imagine what Haunted Mansion looks like on goth day.

01:41.624 --> 01:42.545
[SPEAKER_03]: They converged.

01:43.145 --> 01:49.311
[SPEAKER_03]: While all the baby bats, there were a few legitimate old bats, but there were a lot of baby bats, you know, Hot Topic, Wannabe...

01:50.434 --> 01:56.338
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the old days when we used to have to shop in fetish stores and thrift shops and make our own clothes.

01:57.599 --> 02:01.822
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I read Pirates a bunch of times, and the second time we decided to sing through it.

02:03.403 --> 02:08.027
[SPEAKER_03]: And we called Barbossa Dreamboat Barbie, because he was up on his boat.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.028
[SPEAKER_03]: The changes they made to Pirates were cool.

02:10.643 --> 02:11.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

02:11.183 --> 02:13.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought most people have been saying they kind of suck.

02:13.585 --> 02:18.067
[SPEAKER_03]: They did the PC changes, and then they changed a few things back and added in the movie characters.

02:18.327 --> 02:18.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's good.

02:18.948 --> 02:20.789
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the Jack stuff was like, oh, Jack.

02:21.189 --> 02:23.390
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Haunted Mansion, they actually changed part of it.

02:23.911 --> 02:38.219
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've ever been in Haunted Mansion, the attic with the bride, where she's all tragic and sad, instead now they've made her a bit more sinister, where you go by different paintings of her and her various husbands and their heads all disappear.

02:39.048 --> 02:40.189
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:57.099 --> 02:57.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it was fun.

02:57.659 --> 02:58.359
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't see anything.

02:58.759 --> 02:59.820
[SPEAKER_03]: The new Space Mountain is cool.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.640
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to be careful not to become the amusement park podcast because we do want to get to games here.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:04.321 --> 03:04.941
[SPEAKER_03]: I do play games.

03:04.981 --> 03:06.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, tell us about what your gaming week was.

03:06.501 --> 03:07.221
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you play this week?

03:07.561 --> 03:09.762
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Dead Rising, which was freaking rad.

03:10.982 --> 03:11.802
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not any good at it.

03:14.003 --> 03:15.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, I died so many times.

03:15.923 --> 03:19.464
[SPEAKER_03]: But I figured out that I like the scythe because it decapitates the undead.

03:20.746 --> 03:22.448
[SPEAKER_03]: and played Super Mario Bros.

03:22.488 --> 03:22.828
[SPEAKER_03]: finally.

03:22.968 --> 03:23.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a free copy.

03:24.009 --> 03:26.952
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, technically GameStop got a free copy and it became mine.

03:27.773 --> 03:33.919
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a bunch of that in the waiting room at the doctor's office the other day.

03:34.785 --> 03:36.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Gameboys are great to have in a doctor's office.

03:38.409 --> 03:43.033
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some DDA and I'm kind of still okay at it.

03:43.553 --> 03:50.560
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of avoided the arcade though at Disneyland because it's like the spawn of people are hanging around.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.465
[SPEAKER_03]: And my quote from Disneyland though, best quote ever, this just totally makes me decide never to have children.

03:56.485 --> 04:00.449
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to wear the teacups!

04:04.457 --> 04:06.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the eh part was a lot longer.

04:06.838 --> 04:07.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

04:08.259 --> 04:09.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ride the teacups?

04:09.540 --> 04:10.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

04:10.120 --> 04:10.720
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my favorite.

04:10.881 --> 04:13.342
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sang a merry birthday while riding the teacups.

04:13.422 --> 04:15.003
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the lollipops, by the way, from Disneyland.

04:15.023 --> 04:15.383
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that.

04:15.403 --> 04:16.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they fabulous?

04:16.083 --> 04:16.684
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great.

04:17.604 --> 04:19.405
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them is shaped very phallically.

04:19.445 --> 04:20.406
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just leave it at that.

04:20.466 --> 04:22.147
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, that one's for Rob.

04:22.207 --> 04:22.627
[SPEAKER_05]: It's long.

04:22.707 --> 04:24.308
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, any other games?

04:25.248 --> 04:26.789
[SPEAKER_03]: I had lots of smoothies.

04:26.989 --> 04:27.590
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki.

04:28.670 --> 04:32.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I played games this week.

04:32.312 --> 04:33.433
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I played...

04:33.823 --> 04:39.126
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing a lot of Xbox Live's demos, including Just Cause, which is awesome.

04:39.646 --> 04:44.649
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very, I don't know, it's kind of like, not really Grand Theft Auto-ish.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.470
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can steal cars and stuff.

04:46.990 --> 04:56.456
[SPEAKER_04]: But it reminds me of, like, you were to take Lara Croft Tomb Raider, replace Lara Croft with Antonio Banderas, and then stick her in, like, a Grand Theft Auto game, and then...

04:57.679 --> 05:00.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, just add a bunch of stunts to it.

05:00.221 --> 05:01.502
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much the game.

05:01.882 --> 05:05.866
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can do a lot of really cool stuff like jumping from car to car.

05:05.926 --> 05:06.946
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it really simple.

05:07.307 --> 05:12.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can steal a car, jump onto the roof, and then hit your parachute and just parasail around.

05:13.234 --> 05:14.574
[SPEAKER_04]: and just really crazy stuff.

05:14.614 --> 05:22.137
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a whole lot of Mexican music blaring and lots of Viva La Revolucion and stuff like that.

05:22.257 --> 05:26.158
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty cool and definitely worth picking up when it comes out.

05:26.898 --> 05:28.579
[SPEAKER_04]: And the demo is also pretty cool.

05:28.739 --> 05:31.080
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you about four different people to kill.

05:31.600 --> 05:38.902
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to the point where there were helicopters chasing after me and I blew up one of the helicopters and it exploded very fiery.

05:39.434 --> 05:41.600
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was awesome, so definitely recommend that.

05:42.142 --> 05:42.723
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course,

05:44.570 --> 05:48.273
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried a little bit of Texas Hold'em and played like a game and just said eh.

05:48.293 --> 05:51.035
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll play it later when it's not so buggy.

05:51.516 --> 05:54.278
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what else did I play?

05:54.558 --> 05:57.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, I got a retail copy of Saints Row four days early.

05:58.321 --> 06:02.524
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to play a little bit of that and then I'll probably play more this weekend.

06:03.985 --> 06:12.012
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think that... Oh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories because that's still fucking awesome and we're still going to be playing it until...

06:12.768 --> 06:20.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice City Stories comes out and then we're going to have the official switching of the game and you'll play that for a year until San Andreas Stories comes out.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.235
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was kind of not that eventful.

06:24.255 --> 06:25.436
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't actually play a whole lot.

06:26.036 --> 06:32.421
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as new stuff goes, I checked out Texas Hold'em, which was free on Xbox Live, so I downloaded that and played it.

06:32.841 --> 06:38.386
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of funny, I just was randomly up really late on Tuesday, so at 1am when the game was released, I actually downloaded it.

06:38.846 --> 06:45.711
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, in not even like 10 minutes, I get an invite into an Xbox Live game, and it was actually being run by another podcaster, Godfrey.

06:46.181 --> 06:54.513
[SPEAKER_05]: Over at Gamertag So it was kind of cool that we were getting together and playing on the Xbox Live As far as Texas Hold'em goes How I like the game itself

06:56.056 --> 06:56.716
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:23.149 --> 07:24.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Even $10 than anything else that's out there on the market.

07:25.050 --> 07:27.211
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that they put the game out now.

07:27.571 --> 07:31.853
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being that there's also two more poker games coming out, all in poker.

07:32.693 --> 07:35.254
[SPEAKER_04]: And, what was it?

07:35.274 --> 07:38.816
[SPEAKER_04]: No, World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions are both coming out.

07:39.136 --> 07:44.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, they're both going to be like $39.99, but still, I mean, you have this free game for Texas Hold'em.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I going to go buy a $40 game now?

07:46.679 --> 07:49.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and granted, it might be more polished, but

07:51.064 --> 07:51.745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a free game.

07:51.765 --> 07:52.605
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Texas Hold'em.

07:52.645 --> 07:55.287
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can't really jazz up Texas Hold'em too much.

07:55.428 --> 08:01.873
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess the nicest thing about it is that most of my friends online have it, so there's always at least one game we can play together, but I don't know.

08:01.893 --> 08:06.236
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish the pacing of the game could be sped up, especially in single player.

08:06.516 --> 08:09.459
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if I've already folded, I just want them to run through it.

08:09.519 --> 08:11.000
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really want to watch bad...

08:11.431 --> 08:12.272
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:23.740 --> 08:25.280
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I don't know, that was kind of neat.

08:25.300 --> 08:29.461
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do like the concept of having one bankroll that you build and build through.

08:29.541 --> 08:33.142
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, when you make bets, you can't just restart with a brand new bank.

08:33.182 --> 08:38.384
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if you make a bet that will impact your entire history on Xbox Live, you could bet it all away.

08:38.724 --> 08:40.604
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I like that concept.

08:40.624 --> 08:41.264
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of neat.

08:41.384 --> 08:42.745
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'll give the game credit for that.

08:43.165 --> 08:44.965
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess it looks good for an Xbox Live game.

08:44.985 --> 08:49.026
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, why does it always pan up on the table, deal, and then pan back down?

08:49.066 --> 08:51.167
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, every time, I didn't get that at all.

08:51.967 --> 08:52.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the weird things.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.508
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought it was supposed to support the camera.

08:55.389 --> 08:57.410
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Godfrey had a camera, and he said it wasn't doing anything.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.870
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

08:59.851 --> 09:00.231
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

09:00.931 --> 09:01.371
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free.

09:01.451 --> 09:02.812
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't complain about free things.

09:03.012 --> 09:04.012
[SPEAKER_05]: So what can I say?

09:04.092 --> 09:05.273
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was worth checking out.

09:05.553 --> 09:09.155
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you haven't already downloaded it, I don't think it's worth the $10.

09:09.895 --> 09:11.516
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe download the demo, see if you like it.

09:12.196 --> 09:12.516
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

09:12.876 --> 09:15.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're really into poker, maybe you'll like it.

09:15.357 --> 09:17.338
[SPEAKER_05]: But you probably already got it if you're really into poker.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking something.

09:19.414 --> 09:24.356
[SPEAKER_04]: There's that game that's coming out or the collection of the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged that's coming out.

09:24.776 --> 09:28.757
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know that Texas Hold'em is going to be probably patched later on.

09:29.537 --> 09:33.899
[SPEAKER_04]: But Live Arcade Unplugged is for people that don't have live or don't have an internet connection.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.480
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to be buying this game and getting a really buggy copy.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.541
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're only playing single player anyway.

09:40.801 --> 09:42.782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but still though, it's still buggy.

09:43.102 --> 09:43.382
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

09:44.448 --> 09:44.948
[SPEAKER_05]: DeathJr2 on the PSP

10:13.742 --> 10:14.603
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked a lot better.

10:14.783 --> 10:17.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely rebuilt from the ground up and looks like the graphics are a lot better.

10:19.085 --> 10:24.248
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I mean, I've kind of outgrown the platform games like that, so it's not really appealing to me.

10:24.288 --> 10:29.631
[SPEAKER_04]: But if anybody, you know, really is into that stuff, I think it's definitely a game that would be worth picking up.

10:29.931 --> 10:33.913
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the game definitely looked more polished to me than the first game in the series that they released.

10:34.173 --> 10:37.635
[SPEAKER_05]: I know fans of the series will be really happy that they can play as Pandora now.

10:38.676 --> 10:42.758
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that they were talking about how they fixed a lot of the camera because of complaints in the first game.

10:43.086 --> 10:46.929
[SPEAKER_05]: And the camera, you know, it felt like a typical platformer to me when I played it.

10:46.969 --> 10:49.630
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did get to put hands on on it and it was kind of nice.

10:49.650 --> 10:52.552
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do like strafing and all this other stuff too that felt really good.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.675
[SPEAKER_05]: I also thought it was neat because you can play co-op through the entire game.

10:56.035 --> 10:59.277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just selected levels or modes, but you can play co-op with a friend through the whole game.

10:59.642 --> 11:00.742
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill Origins PSP Silent Evil 4

11:25.854 --> 11:27.476
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like what they did with it.

11:27.537 --> 11:30.821
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost seems like they're going to be going more of an action route, more Resident Evil type.

11:40.275 --> 11:44.579
[SPEAKER_04]: The game itself looks really good, even though it wasn't hardly done at all.

11:44.619 --> 11:45.960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like 30% or something.

11:46.460 --> 11:48.702
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of placeholder stuff, but it looked really good.

11:48.862 --> 11:52.865
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very impressed by what they were showing us on the PSP.

11:53.105 --> 11:55.887
[SPEAKER_05]: Fans of Silent Hill are actually going to be really pleased.

11:55.927 --> 11:58.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though we're joking a little bit about the whole over-the-shoulder camera switch,

11:59.013 --> 12:01.755
[SPEAKER_05]: It definitely has that Silent Hill feel that you guys are used to.

12:02.156 --> 12:08.381
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourteen new Akira Yamaoka songs, four of which have the vocals from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, so that's going to be awesome.

12:09.302 --> 12:15.147
[SPEAKER_05]: One third of the town comes from the original game, and then they added a new two thirds to the town, so that's pretty cool.

12:16.269 --> 12:21.672
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looked pretty cool just as far as, like, I like the weapons that you can select and stuff.

12:21.732 --> 12:25.575
[SPEAKER_04]: And how they have the automatic cameras for when you're going in different spots.

12:26.135 --> 12:30.798
[SPEAKER_04]: It will actually, you know, do the Silent Hill cameras, you know, where really high shot or low shot.

12:30.838 --> 12:32.579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was kind of cool how, like, you could do the...

12:33.035 --> 12:34.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

12:54.688 --> 12:56.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Sledgehammer, Tire Iron, Shovel

13:24.824 --> 13:36.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean bludgeoning the crap out of creatures with a sledgehammer instead of maybe just a weak woman or something trying to beat up something with whatever.

13:36.892 --> 13:38.653
[SPEAKER_04]: Marvel Trading Card Game coming to DS, PSP, and the PC

13:57.657 --> 13:58.818
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

14:18.752 --> 14:21.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 Winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007

14:42.762 --> 14:44.923
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of winning 11 Pro Evolution Soccer 2007?

15:06.778 --> 15:07.821
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:14.565 --> 15:20.450
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I love how when you paused it, you know, I'm not really super into sports games, but I do love me some soccer.

15:20.570 --> 15:21.871
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great sport.

15:22.351 --> 15:23.372
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to play it when I was a kid.

15:23.492 --> 15:24.072
[SPEAKER_05]: Little known fact.

15:24.713 --> 15:28.916
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love the fact when you pause the game, it's almost like, remember when you paused the game in Super Smash Bros.

15:28.956 --> 15:29.296
[SPEAKER_05]: Melee?

15:29.557 --> 15:32.739
[SPEAKER_05]: You could spin the camera around, like, anywhere you want and zoom in.

15:32.999 --> 15:35.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it does that with the soccer.

15:35.581 --> 15:38.163
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can slowly move it forward and slowly move it back.

15:38.423 --> 15:41.506
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, it's so detailed that you see the eyes on the people's faces.

15:41.526 --> 15:41.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?

15:41.986 --> 15:42.867
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:12.173 --> 16:14.134
[SPEAKER_05]: The Gateway Soccer Game Shallon's Showdown

16:35.513 --> 16:38.994
[SPEAKER_04]: The animations are good, and it's kind of fun to play, but I don't get it.

16:39.174 --> 16:54.840
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get the point to it, because the way the game is set up, I mean, it's almost like Power Stone, where you're kind of fighting stuff, but I don't know if it was just a demo I was playing, but I kept killing robots, and they just kept respawning, and I did that for about 15 minutes, and nothing happened.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.321
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it maybe just because it was supposed to be a tech demo, or it wasn't really the game?

16:58.621 --> 16:59.402
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was thinking.

16:59.442 --> 17:02.903
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I hope this is the case, but by reading most of the descriptions of it,

17:03.303 --> 17:07.964
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like that's not really the case, and, I mean, it's really good looking.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.764
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's supposed to be out November 14th.

17:09.864 --> 17:12.505
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, it's really good looking, I just, I don't get it.

17:12.825 --> 17:21.186
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe if, maybe this is just part of the game, and I'm not seeing, you know, I'm thinking that's probably what it was, you know, but it looks very good.

17:21.366 --> 17:23.346
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and fans of the show will definitely like it.

17:23.366 --> 17:32.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you're a fan of the show, the head writers from the show wrote all the dialogue, and there's six playable characters in the game, the four main characters to start, and you get two bad guys that are unlockable later on.

17:32.961 --> 17:33.001
[SPEAKER_05]: D.S.

17:33.021 --> 17:33.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Gameplay

17:54.932 --> 17:56.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Coated Arms Contingent.

17:57.414 --> 18:11.364
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the original Coated Arms, didn't care for it at all, and I'm liking how they're going to be actually... A couple things, they're doing more of a variety of environments, and they're actually set stages, so it's not all this random generated stuff.

18:11.785 --> 18:22.172
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, the random generated stuff is kind of cool, and maybe they have a mode like that or something separate from the game, but the actual game, it's not so good.

18:22.813 --> 18:24.214
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do like...

18:24.850 --> 18:25.430
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

18:26.830 --> 18:28.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of the new details that they added to it.

18:28.651 --> 18:33.032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot more polished in how you can map all your keys and stuff to your own configurations.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.032
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

18:34.172 --> 18:39.993
[SPEAKER_05]: Coated Arms, not my cup of tea either, but if you're a fan of the series, multiplayer is going to be up to eight players from four players.

18:40.594 --> 18:46.055
[SPEAKER_05]: And the game is scheduled for March 2007, which is supposedly the time the PlayStation 3 version is coming out as well.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.455
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is separate stories.

18:47.495 --> 18:50.956
[SPEAKER_05]: The PSP and the PS3 versions are separate stories in the series.

18:51.196 --> 18:51.316
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Lunar Nights from Kojima Productions

19:16.587 --> 19:19.509
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, you have some first-person modes in there as well.

19:19.589 --> 19:21.591
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely heavily use the elements in the game.

19:21.971 --> 19:29.417
[SPEAKER_05]: You draw on the screen, like when you're using an air element, you kind of twirl the stylus on the screen to create a tornado, which was kind of cute.

19:30.237 --> 19:34.781
[SPEAKER_05]: So I played through the first level of the demo, and it was pretty cool.

19:35.742 --> 19:36.622
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

19:37.383 --> 19:38.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.

19:39.665 --> 19:42.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very awesome to see, especially since, you know,

19:43.120 --> 19:51.125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about a lot of people out there, but I didn't like Metal Gear Acid, didn't care for it at all, and kind of, you know, hoping that they'd put out an actual Metal Gear Solid game on the PSP.

19:51.646 --> 20:00.371
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one looks really cool, they're doing a lot of elements, or adding a lot of things that they didn't have in the other games, like the, where you actually have a squad now of three members, that was pretty cool.

20:00.431 --> 20:04.254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is the Metal Gear game that fans wanted a year ago, so...

20:05.000 --> 20:07.721
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes place six years after the Snake Eater story.

20:08.842 --> 20:15.766
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like... Did you notice that in the little trailer, it looks like the cutscenes are borrowed from that comic book game they put out?

20:15.806 --> 20:16.826
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the comic book Metal Gear?

20:17.126 --> 20:18.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I thought that was really cool.

20:18.447 --> 20:21.469
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I love that look that the Metal Gear comic thing had.

20:22.349 --> 20:25.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and then you have the whole comrade thing where you build your own team.

20:25.211 --> 20:26.912
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems to be kind of the niche of this game.

20:27.292 --> 20:31.514
[SPEAKER_05]: You build your own team of people, and then you use people together.

20:31.534 --> 20:33.255
[SPEAKER_05]: You switch from one character to another.

20:33.795 --> 20:40.344
[SPEAKER_05]: and go back and forth and that's how you can take out other guys in the area that might be hard to get to.

20:40.804 --> 20:44.369
[SPEAKER_05]: Sniper who's got you in his sights, maybe use somebody else to take out the sniper.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.250
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of cool.

20:45.988 --> 20:47.570
[SPEAKER_05]: Full voiceovers in the cinematics.

20:47.610 --> 20:50.172
[SPEAKER_05]: The original voice actors are all back for this game.

20:50.673 --> 20:58.180
[SPEAKER_05]: And just an FYI, there's supposedly a ninja character that I don't know if we're supposed to mention because they wouldn't say much about it there.

20:58.820 --> 21:02.143
[SPEAKER_05]: But a whole lot of more information is supposed to be released on this Tokyo Game Show.

21:02.263 --> 21:03.665
[SPEAKER_05]: And supposedly some sort of box...

21:05.182 --> 21:06.003
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydeen Systems.

21:20.612 --> 21:20.892
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.774
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, here's one I have a ton of things to say about.

21:23.874 --> 21:25.314
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

21:25.334 --> 21:25.975
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you think of this?

21:26.315 --> 21:27.015
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

21:27.235 --> 21:28.576
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked the game a lot.

21:28.596 --> 21:29.996
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually played it quite a bit.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.758
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, typical Castlevania game, but it looks very good.

21:33.898 --> 21:35.959
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very impressed with what they've done with the DS.

21:36.099 --> 21:39.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was incredibly impressed that they had an anime cut...

21:39.881 --> 21:44.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Intro, you know, it's like... What is up with Konami Love for the handhelds this year?

21:44.063 --> 21:45.484
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much all we saw.

21:45.624 --> 21:53.207
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, seriously, almost every game we saw had at least one version being made for the PSP or the DS.

21:54.028 --> 21:59.270
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, every single game we saw, except for Elebits, the Karaoke Revolution game, and the DDRs.

21:59.870 --> 22:01.471
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, everything else had a handheld.

22:01.691 --> 22:05.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they even bother with the PSP since the sales are kind of crap in Japan?

22:05.578 --> 22:18.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, what it comes down to is, I think there was even some study out there that said that handhelds are actually more popular than console games, which, you know, the facts don't really show that, but I don't know.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.621
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just... A game like Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops is going to sell PSPs.

22:23.501 --> 22:25.161
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, maybe that's part of it.

22:25.221 --> 22:27.042
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe because it's got the muscle there.

22:27.402 --> 22:29.762
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was the other thing about Portable Ops?

22:29.962 --> 22:32.182
[SPEAKER_04]: It utilizes the GPS, supposedly.

22:32.242 --> 22:34.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's hot.

22:34.343 --> 22:35.323
[SPEAKER_05]: Castlevania Portrait of Ruin.

22:36.551 --> 22:37.071
[SPEAKER_05]: So cool.

22:37.171 --> 22:42.394
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I love, you can use, okay, first off, you have to understand, they've made some big changes to the basic formula.

22:42.854 --> 22:46.295
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, you swap between two characters at the touch of a button.

22:46.635 --> 22:53.418
[SPEAKER_05]: You swap between Jonathan, who's kind of a traditional Belmont-style character, and then Charlotte, who's like magic and intellect-based.

22:53.718 --> 23:01.202
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I thought it was kind of cool, because you hold down the button to charge your magic, and the longer you're able to hold it down, the more powerful the attack is, and the graphics match that.

23:01.242 --> 23:02.082
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of neat.

23:02.823 --> 23:05.346
[SPEAKER_05]: She can stop time, heal, boost stats, all that stuff.

23:05.787 --> 23:12.614
[SPEAKER_05]: But by a touch of another button, you bring them both on the screen at the same time to solve simple puzzles, which I thought was pretty cool.

23:12.914 --> 23:14.456
[SPEAKER_05]: And then here's the greatest thing.

23:15.036 --> 23:17.499
[SPEAKER_05]: You finally get to go outside the damn castle.

23:17.739 --> 23:21.103
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the portraits are all about, is that the bad guy paints these portraits and

23:21.403 --> 23:23.404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's somehow how he's cast control over the castle.

23:23.424 --> 23:23.945
[SPEAKER_05]: Mario did it!

23:24.185 --> 23:24.965
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

23:25.246 --> 23:30.609
[SPEAKER_05]: You go into these portraits and they take you to levels that are not inside a castle.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.411
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to go to an Egyptian level that's called Sandy Grave.

23:34.671 --> 23:36.973
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to a town level that's called the City of Haze.

23:37.433 --> 23:37.814
[SPEAKER_05]: Boss Rush Mode

23:56.673 --> 24:00.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, something they weren't saying a lot of details about was the shop mode.

24:00.296 --> 24:05.880
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a shop mode that's going to be Wi-Fi as well, that you're going to be able to trade items across the internet.

24:05.900 --> 24:07.942
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like really sketchy details.

24:09.243 --> 24:16.108
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I was piecing together, it sounded like you'd be able to buy things from other people's shops that you didn't want, but kind of make trades like that.

24:16.128 --> 24:19.931
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have items or something, you can sell them almost like an auction market type thing.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.601
[SPEAKER_05]: More details to come at Tokyo Game Show.

24:22.901 --> 24:25.161
[SPEAKER_05]: Paris, by the way, seemed to be a recurring theme in this game.

24:25.361 --> 24:27.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice there were the vampire bad guys?

24:28.282 --> 24:32.003
[SPEAKER_05]: Stella and Loretta were some of these female vampire antagonist characters.

24:32.163 --> 24:33.283
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was kind of interesting.

24:33.603 --> 24:36.404
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you enjoyed last year's Castlevania, this one's going to up the ante.

24:36.504 --> 24:37.844
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're going to be very, very impressed.

24:38.544 --> 24:40.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Karaoke Revolution American Idol.

24:41.605 --> 24:41.965
[SPEAKER_04]: You know...

24:42.608 --> 24:43.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this game is going to be huge.

24:43.869 --> 24:53.376
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's necessarily going to be the hardcore gamer crowd that gets into this game, but I just think this is going to be a very accessible game for mainstream America, especially the fact that it's based off American Idol.

25:12.734 --> 25:12.934
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 Only

25:42.185 --> 25:45.946
[SPEAKER_05]: and I thought the Xbox with the downloadable expansions and stuff was a great idea.

25:46.206 --> 25:48.967
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess if the game does well, they'll probably port it to other platforms.

25:49.067 --> 25:56.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the Xbox right now, they're kind of considering not doing that because the Xbox is pretty much at the end of its cycle.

25:56.949 --> 26:02.731
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS2 is going to be going on for a while, but you don't want to put out a game that's pretty much, you know, who's going to really buy it?

26:02.751 --> 26:08.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's transitioning over to the Xbox 360 and they're not ready to put out a next-gen version of it, so...

26:09.457 --> 26:10.377
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:30.203 --> 26:37.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you notice how wild and crazy a lot of people at that party were, especially during that American Idol contest and things of that nature?

26:37.670 --> 26:44.917
[SPEAKER_05]: And did you notice the journalist from... I'm not 100% positive where he's from, so I shouldn't name it unless I have my facts proof.

26:45.138 --> 26:49.122
[SPEAKER_05]: But he walks in and holds up this bottle of like 40 or something and everybody's cheering.

26:49.422 --> 26:50.443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just thinking to myself...

26:51.816 --> 26:53.658
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I didn't know what to think.

26:53.718 --> 26:55.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, one part of me thinks it's funny.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.000
[SPEAKER_03]: How about hypocrite?

26:56.241 --> 27:02.967
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the other part of me thinks this is the most hypocritical thing I've ever... Wasn't it weird being there, Loki?

27:03.327 --> 27:05.269
[SPEAKER_04]: It was weird, and here's why it's weird.

27:05.630 --> 27:11.455
[SPEAKER_04]: Because on the show, it's fine to fuck around every once in a while because you make it a disclaimer.

27:11.656 --> 27:15.659
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I wouldn't do that if I was on TV, maybe, because that might be a little...

27:16.385 --> 27:17.385
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:32.034 --> 27:33.034
[SPEAKER_04]: A company barbecue.

27:33.134 --> 27:35.415
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that at your company barbecue, but you know what?

27:35.515 --> 27:36.835
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do business here.

27:36.995 --> 27:37.936
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a business thing.

27:37.976 --> 27:39.376
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing interviews.

27:39.816 --> 27:42.617
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting information, the report to the press and stuff.

27:43.957 --> 27:47.598
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supposed to be... Look, I got 40s!

27:47.658 --> 27:49.419
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get wasted, man!

27:49.479 --> 27:52.340
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I was like, that is so... I just was in awe.

27:52.460 --> 27:53.380
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know what to think.

27:53.740 --> 28:01.342
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just like, I can't believe that's... That would be funny if I was not at a professional gaming event.

28:01.562 --> 28:02.223
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

28:18.562 --> 28:21.345
[SPEAKER_05]: in the whole freaking building that was taking notes on a laptop.

28:21.705 --> 28:43.046
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, granted, some of the other journalists were doing the old-fashioned pen and paper thing, but I'm thinking to myself, you all work for dot-coms, and you're all on the tech edge of things, and I just thought it was really surprising, because I don't know, I personally, maybe it's a thing they teach you in journalist school, I don't know, but I type fast, so if I want to be able to make a ton of notes, I'm going to type them out of my laptop, I'm not going to try and write everything.

28:43.226 --> 28:44.547
[SPEAKER_05]: because my handwriting is god-awful.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.989
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was kind of surprised that I was like the only one that had a laptop there.

28:50.030 --> 28:53.972
[SPEAKER_05]: Something is really wrong with the mainstreaming gaming press, you guys, and I'm not afraid to say it, so whatever.

28:54.492 --> 28:54.812
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

28:54.972 --> 28:58.474
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a ton of people there from like IGN and 1UP and stuff.

28:58.534 --> 29:00.695
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they had like stacks of like 10 people.

29:00.736 --> 29:04.578
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the Ziff Davis IGN Bay Area dot-commer club.

29:05.418 --> 29:07.319
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, and you know, I do feel bad.

29:07.339 --> 29:12.662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how many small press were there, but I'm sure that, you know, I don't know if they were in the same, but we were, but we were like

29:13.066 --> 29:13.666
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:40.575 --> 29:41.316
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

30:09.505 --> 30:12.247
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have some stealth stuff in there, which was pretty cool.

30:12.847 --> 30:13.448
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, though?

30:13.608 --> 30:24.275
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as I appreciated this game a lot more, being able to see it a little closer and hands-on than I did at E3, and it was kind of cool to be next to a Wii again without having to wait in a five-hour line, I have to admit.

30:25.990 --> 30:33.373
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, like if this game came out for the same price as like Zelda, Metroid, Mario, there's no way I could justify buying it.

30:33.513 --> 30:38.455
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I mean the game looked kind of fun, but it didn't look $39.99 fun to me.

30:38.795 --> 30:46.819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe it's just because we were only seeing one aspect of the game, but seriously, I hope that this game is a little bit lower of a price point.

30:46.919 --> 30:49.960
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will be much more successful if they aim that way.

30:50.520 --> 30:51.681
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, um...

30:53.262 --> 30:57.947
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you exactly what the price is going to be on this.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.489
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly, I think it was $49.99.

31:00.249 --> 31:03.773
[SPEAKER_04]: No, see, that's too much.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.475
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it changes.

31:05.595 --> 31:05.875
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

31:06.636 --> 31:08.318
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick housekeeping thing as well.

31:08.358 --> 31:10.040
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to say about the press event?

31:10.120 --> 31:10.420
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

31:11.962 --> 31:15.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I like it.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.343
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank them first off for inviting us down there.

31:17.363 --> 31:22.965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks guys for taking a chance and inviting some of the independent press.

31:23.005 --> 31:23.585
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

31:24.105 --> 31:26.445
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really cool to check it out and stuff.

31:26.825 --> 31:28.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I love going to those things.

31:28.766 --> 31:31.266
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I don't know.

31:31.546 --> 31:33.147
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Gamer's Day better, I think.

31:33.527 --> 31:34.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Gamer's Day was a little more.

31:34.587 --> 31:36.108
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sad that DDR wasn't there.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to go to work.

31:38.951 --> 31:40.492
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, because you had the time off for Disneyland.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.394
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have really enjoyed Disneyland.

31:44.534 --> 31:46.155
[SPEAKER_03]: I did enjoy Disneyland very much.

31:46.716 --> 31:49.077
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say some real quick housekeeping things.

31:49.177 --> 31:50.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight is a mini episode.

31:50.318 --> 31:51.558
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have said that at the top of the episode.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.580
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not going to be a Part B tonight.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.961
[SPEAKER_05]: And the DDR Power Previews will start next week.

31:57.042 --> 31:59.403
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is only on the live stream.

31:59.663 --> 32:06.487
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be listening live and you'll get to hear some brand new DDR songs from the Ultramix 4 VRare and Universe VRare

32:07.054 --> 32:35.594
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can't say anything about it you know we're not supposed to talk about you know what we're playing and all that stuff yet but you know I can't help but say something because I got to hear some of the tracks and everything one of the songs we're playing next week like take a really dark DDR song and make it even darker like the remix so it's like oh it's so cool it's so cool so you'll hear it next week that's all I have to say I'm sorry they haven't set a price yet for Elements okay thank you for the clarification

32:36.821 --> 32:40.062
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let's get into other gaming news from around the world.

32:40.162 --> 32:42.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is definitely other news.

32:43.222 --> 32:51.524
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one up, actually, well, you realize that Nintendo has been hanging out in Germany with their fun little press conference, right?

32:51.904 --> 32:53.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, their game conference, I should say.

32:53.844 --> 33:04.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even though they are still not giving a definite price on the Wii, there has been a slight leak.

33:05.265 --> 33:12.867
[SPEAKER_03]: from the head of German operations, saying they expect a price below 250 euros, which would be $321.50.

33:13.767 --> 33:19.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's still more of the same.

33:19.809 --> 33:27.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo's still saying that they expect it to be as far as 25,000 yen in Japan, which is $223 here.

33:27.830 --> 33:32.832
[SPEAKER_03]: And no more than 250 in the U.S., so it's basically more of the same.

33:33.372 --> 33:34.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing specific.

33:35.879 --> 33:36.159
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

33:37.300 --> 33:37.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts on that?

33:38.860 --> 33:39.820
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of surprises there.

33:39.840 --> 33:42.421
[SPEAKER_05]: $250 is kind of the price we're all thinking anyway.

33:42.601 --> 33:49.244
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically, if I think, come out and said the same thing, like no less than $250, at least in the U.S., no less than $249 or whatever.

33:50.706 --> 33:52.388
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was not the only news that they announced.

33:52.568 --> 33:55.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, or I should say that came from Let's Big.

33:56.511 --> 34:00.855
[SPEAKER_04]: They did announce two new games, Mario Strikers Charged and Battalion Wars 2.

34:01.796 --> 34:06.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Mario Strikers Charged is a follow-up to the GameCube game and looks pretty awesome.

34:06.701 --> 34:08.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a little edgy soccer game for them, I guess.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.765
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Battalion Wars 2 is just awesome.

34:11.785 --> 34:17.170
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, actually, they have some video footage on game trailers that I was

34:18.095 --> 34:46.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Saw on Link 2 on Kotaku And it looks pretty sweet I mean, I never really got into the first Battalion Wars But a very cool little game And definitely showing off some pretty good graphics for the Wii So, I'm looking forward to that stuff Of course, I like this It's kind of referring to Battalion Wars 2 as B-Wii You know, because, you know, too funny But, yeah, it's supposed to be pretty cool

34:48.578 --> 34:51.421
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii is coming out soon.

35:12.253 --> 35:12.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon.

35:12.653 --> 35:16.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, soon will be answered on September 14th.

35:16.435 --> 35:26.059
[SPEAKER_05]: We're pretty sure this is the real deal because Nintendo has sent out special invites for a celebration of video games.

35:26.579 --> 35:37.264
[SPEAKER_05]: And Nintendo of America president, our dear buddy Reggie, Phil's aim, will be there in person and he's going to be promoting, quote unquote, the upcoming lineup.

35:37.744 --> 35:37.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggie?

35:38.424 --> 35:38.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

35:39.505 --> 35:40.105
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's our invite?

35:40.806 --> 35:42.508
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

35:42.829 --> 35:47.695
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we don't get 3 million unique page views a month, so we have to stay home.

35:48.776 --> 35:57.887
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how formal or informal this event is going to be, but seriously, since this is going to be a really big deal, IGN, I'd leave your 40s at home.

35:58.928 --> 35:59.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, I went there.

35:59.909 --> 36:00.290
[SPEAKER_05]: I went there.

36:02.540 --> 36:05.843
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care anymore, we're just going to do our thing.

36:29.494 --> 36:30.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Who cares?

36:31.095 --> 36:41.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've looked in the forums lately, but we did start a brand new thread, thank you very much, Rob, about stuff that we report on the show that's kind of under the radar, as we like to put it.

36:42.062 --> 36:55.892
[SPEAKER_04]: This week, for example, they announced officially about the Xbox Live Unplugged Volume 1, as we reported weeks ago, and other things of that nature and stuff, and we're going to be continuing to add to that each week with new stuff.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.394
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I want to point out, this is not an ego thing.

37:00.214 --> 37:01.575
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very humble people.

37:01.955 --> 37:04.156
[SPEAKER_05]: We love the fact that we're independent.

37:04.196 --> 37:07.078
[SPEAKER_05]: We have such great listeners and folks that listen to us.

37:07.498 --> 37:10.880
[SPEAKER_05]: We just are keeping this list for ourselves.

37:11.120 --> 37:17.623
[SPEAKER_05]: When people call us liars and that we're full of shit over here, I just want it on the record somewhere.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.464
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're doing.

37:20.552 --> 37:21.353
[SPEAKER_05]: So join in the fun.

37:21.413 --> 37:21.954
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to the thread.

37:22.014 --> 37:22.274
[SPEAKER_04]: Have fun.

37:22.635 --> 37:35.034
[SPEAKER_04]: And personally, my personal thing here is I don't like reporting something and then having another press outlet report the same thing and then it spreads like wildfire and everyone takes it as gospel as they were the first ones to have the story.

37:35.652 --> 37:37.574
[SPEAKER_04]: That's never happened to us ever.

37:37.594 --> 37:39.555
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of an ego-boosting thing, but it never happened.

37:39.996 --> 37:44.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, anywho, okay, so that never happened when 1UP picked the Konami release date story.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.700
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care tonight.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.741
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't care tonight.

37:47.101 --> 37:47.421
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

37:47.502 --> 37:47.902
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

37:48.442 --> 37:49.123
[SPEAKER_02]: We're independent.

37:49.263 --> 37:50.224
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care tonight.

37:50.304 --> 37:50.984
[SPEAKER_04]: I seriously don't.

37:51.004 --> 37:51.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Not after Wednesday.

37:51.925 --> 37:53.086
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to report a couple things.

37:53.226 --> 37:58.911
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, you remember there's the news of Bullet Witch being put out in the United States by Atari.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.492
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a date for you.

38:00.936 --> 38:04.398
[SPEAKER_04]: February 21st is when you can expect that game, assuming there's no date changes.

38:05.119 --> 38:10.262
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, a new Wii launch title, or in the launch window, I guess, as you would put it.

38:11.182 --> 38:12.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Shrek Smash and Crash for the Wii.

38:13.003 --> 38:16.225
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a Mario Kart-style game featuring Shrek characters.

38:16.285 --> 38:16.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopty shit.

38:16.986 --> 38:24.210
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopty shit, yes, but it is coming out on the Wii December 15th for $39.99, so look forward to that.

38:25.290 --> 38:27.792
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you're here first, so.

38:28.553 --> 38:31.418
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other US release dates that we should be aware of coming up?

38:31.738 --> 38:32.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.482
[SPEAKER_04]: This week is actually going to be pretty awesome.

38:35.244 --> 38:36.365
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of 360 stuff.

38:36.405 --> 38:39.210
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman, Act Zero is going to be coming out.

38:39.510 --> 38:41.974
[SPEAKER_04]: You've also got Enchanted Arms coming out on the 360.

38:42.555 --> 38:43.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's this week?

38:43.877 --> 38:44.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's this week.

38:44.857 --> 38:45.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I'm gonna get that.

38:45.918 --> 38:53.300
[SPEAKER_04]: But Enchanted Arms got... It said Enchanted Arms is good if you like RPG cliches, because the game is... I love RPG cliches!

38:53.320 --> 38:54.420
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then it's for you!

38:54.560 --> 38:54.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Great!

38:55.341 --> 39:00.982
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, my personal favorite, which I already got because I'm special, of course, Saints Row.

39:01.963 --> 39:02.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously?

39:03.863 --> 39:04.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight?

39:04.403 --> 39:04.804
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

39:04.884 --> 39:05.544
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, whatever.

39:06.204 --> 39:07.564
[SPEAKER_05]: Our egos need a lashing tonight.

39:08.085 --> 39:08.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

39:08.905 --> 39:09.985
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, make fun of us, please.

39:11.646 --> 39:12.206
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gay.

39:12.708 --> 39:13.328
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

39:13.589 --> 39:15.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Loki, you're gay.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.051
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not gay.

39:18.712 --> 39:20.253
[SPEAKER_03]: But we won't hold that against you.

39:20.453 --> 39:22.074
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is another one for you, Rob.

39:22.654 --> 39:27.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Fox Command comes out this coming week, which is going to be pretty awesome.

39:28.523 --> 39:29.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be honest?

39:29.304 --> 39:32.187
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of stopped caring about Star Fox a long time ago.

39:32.467 --> 39:34.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.

39:35.350 --> 39:36.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly right.

39:36.752 --> 39:38.674
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is as cool as the first Star Fox.

39:38.694 --> 39:42.798
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you play that abortion of a GameCube Star Fox game?

39:44.652 --> 39:45.972
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen, Star Fox 64.

39:46.373 --> 39:51.234
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to play Star Fox 64 during lunches in high school.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Multiplayer, four-player deathmatches.

39:53.614 --> 39:54.475
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the shit.

39:54.515 --> 39:57.255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out, but I'm not going to spend... I want a demo.

39:57.616 --> 40:00.716
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about the Wi-Fi multiplayer deathmatches.

40:01.216 --> 40:09.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, then again, you know Wi-Fi... You know what, Loki, why don't you buy it, and then you can let me play it, and then I'll let you borrow Enchanted Arms or something, and you can have fun with your RPG cliches.

40:09.999 --> 40:10.399
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, fine.

40:10.539 --> 40:10.719
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

40:11.851 --> 40:13.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, there's other places in the world.

40:14.392 --> 40:16.893
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Eddie, are you aware there's other countries?

40:16.973 --> 40:17.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

40:17.693 --> 40:18.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I've still got some more.

40:18.874 --> 40:19.494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm almost done.

40:19.934 --> 40:20.194
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

40:21.094 --> 40:23.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenosaga 3 is also coming out on PlayStation 2.

40:24.936 --> 40:28.317
[SPEAKER_04]: Disgaea 2 is coming out this week, which is going to be pretty cool.

40:29.237 --> 40:33.359
[SPEAKER_04]: One Piece, Grand Adventure, if you like anime fighting games, pretty cool.

40:34.099 --> 40:40.381
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not into that kind of stuff, on the PSP, there's going to be Def Jam Fight for New York, the take

40:41.107 --> 40:43.048
[SPEAKER_04]: TakeOver, TakeDown, I can't remember which it was.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.170
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we also coming out?

40:45.990 --> 40:46.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look for those.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.173
[SPEAKER_03]: They needed to do a game called Thingy.

40:51.975 --> 40:53.436
[SPEAKER_05]: You could author the game, I don't know.

40:53.956 --> 40:55.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a game.

40:55.317 --> 40:58.299
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone should hire me to design a game.

40:59.120 --> 40:59.840
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be awesome.

41:00.401 --> 41:01.842
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be called Jamie's Awesome Game.

41:02.882 --> 41:07.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, speaking of awesome, we have the release dates over in the UK.

41:07.606 --> 41:07.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

41:09.160 --> 41:13.324
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I already went over them the week before, but actually today.

41:14.304 --> 41:15.565
[SPEAKER_05]: I touched on some last week too.

41:15.886 --> 41:18.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I guess would be yesterday now in the UK.

41:18.348 --> 41:20.449
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we're pre-taping this week, so it's actually Friday night.

41:20.469 --> 41:21.470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Friday night.

41:21.610 --> 41:25.293
[SPEAKER_03]: The Reservoir Dogs Madden 2007, which was a big whoopty shit in my book.

41:26.054 --> 41:28.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Dan had to be there for the Madden sale.

41:29.556 --> 41:30.357
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was funny.

41:31.898 --> 41:34.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's Make a Soccer Team and Dig Dug Digging Strike.

41:35.041 --> 41:35.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

41:36.011 --> 41:39.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Also now coming out on the 1st, which is ironically my wedding anniversary.

41:42.916 --> 41:49.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Age of Pirates, Caribbean Tales, AND1 Streetball, Birth of America.

41:49.301 --> 41:55.385
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that little snort at the end there?

41:55.625 --> 41:55.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

41:56.086 --> 41:59.948
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it funny because that game's coming out in the UK?

42:00.529 --> 42:01.369
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of funny.

42:01.430 --> 42:04.272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, you know, hey, Revolutionary War, the game.

42:04.332 --> 42:04.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Wee!

42:06.155 --> 42:08.796
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's kick some Yankee ass!

42:09.436 --> 42:30.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Factory, Def Jam Fight for New York The Takeover on PSP, Dungeon Siege 2 Broken World, Me Sneezing the Game, Guitar Man Lives, Saints Row, Star Fox Command, Test Drive Unlimited, Gangs of London.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.403
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the 6th, The Scramble.

42:35.164 --> 42:35.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

42:36.227 --> 42:41.930
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very sorry for everybody over there because they don't get Dead Rising until the 8th and that makes me cry because Dead Rising is awesome.

42:41.990 --> 42:43.091
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're getting it pretty soon.

42:43.271 --> 42:45.313
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're getting Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins on the 8th as well.

42:45.493 --> 42:47.794
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they're not getting it 28 days later.

42:48.455 --> 42:51.217
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so funny.

42:52.197 --> 42:52.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's a gun?

42:54.199 --> 42:56.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can whack them over the head with a Guitar Hero controller.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.301
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things are pretty heavy.

42:57.861 --> 42:58.061
[SPEAKER_05]: G-H-O-U-L

43:21.769 --> 43:24.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they kind of took that, like local DDR tournaments, right?

43:24.250 --> 43:26.350
[SPEAKER_05]: They kind of took that idea and applied it to Guitar Hero.

43:26.631 --> 43:34.053
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a set of sponsored tournaments where you will do the organizing and promoting, and then Red Octane gives you banners and prizes.

43:34.593 --> 43:37.134
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like the Guitar Hero tournament in a box.

43:37.434 --> 43:38.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of.

43:38.494 --> 43:41.055
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me think of the Xbox Live Pizza Party thing as well.

43:41.135 --> 43:41.555
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

43:41.695 --> 43:42.776
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of neat.

43:43.296 --> 43:47.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Red Octane, by the way, is only going to do a limited amount of sponsorships.

43:48.198 --> 43:49.578
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know...

43:50.069 --> 43:53.250
[SPEAKER_05]: Pax is going on right now, and one of the big announcements at Pax was the Penny Arcade game.

44:16.685 --> 44:18.467
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks pretty awesome.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Just they have a little teaser image that came out for it.

44:21.970 --> 44:29.736
[SPEAKER_04]: And the name of the game is actually... It's quite interesting because it looks like it's going to be episodic content and stuff.

44:29.896 --> 44:35.841
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyways, the name is Penny Arcade Adventures on the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness.

44:36.321 --> 44:37.843
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be a comic adventure game.

44:37.863 --> 44:41.506
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out on the PC, Mac OS X, and Linux.

44:42.447 --> 44:45.309
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the teaser image, it shows...

44:46.189 --> 44:47.750
[SPEAKER_04]: Giant Glowing Eyes I'm Coming

45:07.369 --> 45:09.090
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking fruit fucker in a game.

45:09.750 --> 45:10.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Penny Arcade.

45:10.870 --> 45:11.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I gotta get this.

45:12.291 --> 45:14.492
[SPEAKER_04]: I am looking for this game like crazy.

45:14.732 --> 45:16.232
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't we go to Penny Arcade Expo?

45:16.252 --> 45:16.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

45:17.753 --> 45:18.433
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

45:18.813 --> 45:21.474
[SPEAKER_05]: My respect for Penny Arcade goes like higher and higher.

45:21.534 --> 45:23.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every time we do some type of report that involves that.

45:23.235 --> 45:24.975
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I do want to go next year.

45:25.416 --> 45:27.096
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do have a lot of respect for them.

45:27.196 --> 45:33.559
[SPEAKER_04]: They also announced what was that $10,000 scholarship for students that are looking to go into a...

45:34.932 --> 45:37.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Video Game Field in school and stuff.

45:37.454 --> 45:41.258
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty, I mean, that's kind of giving back to the community.

45:41.318 --> 45:42.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot.

45:42.999 --> 45:46.242
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've definitely kind of got a really good vibe going on with everything.

45:46.282 --> 45:52.988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like a fun E3 where actually people are, I don't know, this is the right kind of attitude to have in the industry.

45:54.189 --> 45:55.230
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, very cool.

45:56.731 --> 45:58.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of cool...

45:59.424 --> 46:05.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, now, I don't know if this is cool, cool, or sort of, huh?

46:06.346 --> 46:11.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's just more Xbox 360 drama, in my opinion.

46:13.407 --> 46:18.249
[SPEAKER_03]: You know they have their premium pricing for a lot of the games on Xbox Live Arcade.

46:18.269 --> 46:27.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're also giving Luminous the same treatment, where to play it, it's 1,200 marketplace points, which is about $14.99.

46:29.026 --> 46:39.270
[SPEAKER_03]: However, is that once you reach a certain number of points in mission or versus CPU modes of the game, you will be actually asked to pay another 700 points.

46:39.770 --> 46:53.775
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that is a gross misinterpretation somehow of what is really intended, because it would not be a surprise if they're charging additional points for new themes and skins, but to prevent you from going further in the game in points, having to spend more money?

46:54.435 --> 46:55.195
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

46:55.295 --> 46:56.936
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a demo I'm paying for.

46:57.870 --> 47:02.515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping there's just a gross misinterpretation of what they're charging for.

47:02.535 --> 47:06.760
[SPEAKER_05]: And even then, if they're charging for extra levels and skins and things, that's not a big surprise.

47:06.920 --> 47:12.867
[SPEAKER_04]: What it might be is that the game has downloadable songpacks or whatever in that case.

47:13.277 --> 47:40.614
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the single player game goes so far say you start off with like 20 songs or something when you download the game and then later on when you buy that sound pack it will go to level 20 and then continue on say with the 5 other songs that are in your song pack that would make more sense but I don't see how you would I would think it's just like the one rumor that came out and I hope it's not true where you'd have to purchase like multiplayer for the game I mean it's kind of dumb

47:41.172 --> 47:41.552
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

47:41.752 --> 47:42.693
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be... You know what?

47:42.893 --> 47:49.837
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize Luminous is this very popular, in-demand thing, but don't shoot yourself in the foot, kids, over at Xbox Live.

47:50.137 --> 47:51.218
[SPEAKER_03]: I still wouldn't put it past them.

47:52.118 --> 47:56.061
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good... This is a prime way to make money, and you know people will pay for it.

47:56.121 --> 47:59.843
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I will probably be one of them, and I will punch myself in the face for doing it.

47:59.963 --> 48:09.369
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, one thing to be pointed out is that they're doing all of their pricing in terms of points instead of putting the dollar point, they're putting the actual Xbox Live points to sort of...

48:11.720 --> 48:20.928
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly think that it's a way, and I agree with this article because I got the information from Wired.com.

48:23.310 --> 48:30.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that actually it's a way to subvert the overall price value of the game by giving it in terms of something abstract like points.

48:31.451 --> 48:36.275
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a handful of people in our chat room right now that are listening live to us taping a little early on Friday night.

48:36.635 --> 48:38.497
[SPEAKER_05]: And Drew Nami's in there and makes kind of a good point.

48:38.817 --> 48:44.481
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd like to purchase World 2-1 episodic content to the extreme.

48:45.962 --> 48:46.923
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting comparison.

48:47.263 --> 48:48.584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a Mario Brothers style game.

48:48.685 --> 48:51.086
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a point where people are just not going to pay for it anymore.

48:51.607 --> 48:56.050
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think I've kind of got to that point, you know, with Elder Scrolls 4.

48:56.431 --> 49:00.674
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not going to go buy all the content and everything, so...

49:02.799 --> 49:03.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

49:26.006 --> 49:34.388
[SPEAKER_04]: They said that more than 1 billion Microsoft points have been activated, which in the current exchange rate comes to $12.5 million in revenue.

49:35.008 --> 49:44.269
[SPEAKER_04]: Including, they said that the average Xbox Live user has downloaded about 25 pieces of content with about 45 million overall downloads.

49:45.209 --> 49:54.491
[SPEAKER_04]: They were also pointing out that some of the first games to use the Xbox Live anywhere are actually going to be some of the Vista games, including Shadowrun and Halo 2.

49:56.069 --> 49:58.132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's very cool.

50:00.934 --> 50:06.520
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't really specify on how it's going to use live anywhere, but it should be very interesting.

50:06.800 --> 50:11.725
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't wait for the live vision camera, which they mentioned, of course, is coming out.

50:12.005 --> 50:12.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

50:12.145 --> 50:13.747
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do with your live camera?

50:14.808 --> 50:16.570
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I not going to do with my live camera?

50:16.870 --> 50:17.231
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

50:18.628 --> 50:20.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink Nintendo DS Lite

50:31.815 --> 50:32.856
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so excited.

50:32.896 --> 50:33.857
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being released.

50:33.957 --> 50:35.718
[SPEAKER_05]: A pink Nintendo DS Lite.

50:36.098 --> 50:37.039
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and a black one too.

50:37.059 --> 50:37.860
[SPEAKER_05]: Black one.

50:38.220 --> 50:41.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Are being released on September 13th in the U.S.

50:41.683 --> 50:43.584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding, I believe I read somewhere the U.K.

50:43.704 --> 50:44.985
[SPEAKER_05]: is getting the pink one as well.

50:45.025 --> 50:46.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they are getting the pink one.

50:46.226 --> 50:47.987
[SPEAKER_05]: Our buddies over there will get that as well.

50:48.067 --> 50:48.948
[SPEAKER_05]: But we get a black one.

50:48.968 --> 50:50.249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they already have the black one over there.

50:50.529 --> 50:51.070
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.

50:51.090 --> 50:52.271
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we're going to match up finally.

50:52.291 --> 50:52.971
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have all the colors.

50:53.371 --> 51:00.357
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is one of those instances where I'm very glad I did not splurge and get the white DS because I would much prefer a black one or...

51:00.984 --> 51:03.725
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a pink one, depending on how I'm feeling on September 13th.

51:03.885 --> 51:25.531
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was not the only systems that were getting some pink makeovers, including in the UK, they are getting a PlayStation 2, the slim model, that's also going to be in pink, including they're going to have some bundles that are going to be discounted, including two pink controllers and a pink memory card and, you know,

51:26.198 --> 51:34.542
[SPEAKER_04]: SingStarPop is going to be bundled in there as well for the most flamboyant PlayStation 2 bundle that's out there.

51:35.103 --> 51:38.945
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be noted, as we mentioned last week, that the U.S.

51:39.005 --> 51:45.508
[SPEAKER_04]: is getting a different colored PlayStation 2 Slim model, a silver one actually, which I believe has been available in the U.K.

51:45.628 --> 51:45.988
[SPEAKER_04]: already.

51:46.869 --> 51:49.871
[SPEAKER_04]: They're also getting a pink PSP as well.

51:50.051 --> 51:50.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Goody, goody.

51:51.981 --> 51:59.973
[SPEAKER_04]: They think that's going to appeal to women gamers because the only thing stopping women gamers out there from actually purchasing consoles was the color.

52:00.614 --> 52:03.699
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, please explain the expression on your face because this is radio.

52:04.600 --> 52:07.104
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most retarded thing I think I've ever heard.

52:08.086 --> 52:14.028
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, speaking of colorful, we certainly get e-mails every week, and hopefully they've kept the language to a minimum in the e-mails.

52:14.108 --> 52:17.749
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, DarkSakura, did you have to suit up the asbestos this week for the e-mail bag?

52:18.069 --> 52:19.669
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't bad enough for the asbestos.

52:19.729 --> 52:23.030
[SPEAKER_03]: I just went in with a gas mask and some hand sanitizer.

52:23.050 --> 52:31.693
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, you can e-mail us with your colorful thoughts at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and DarkSakura will dip in there and pull out some e-mails like she's going to do right now.

52:38.206 --> 52:45.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, given the sort of short week for right now, and by the way, thank you for taking care of mail for me while I was at Disneyland.

52:45.452 --> 52:46.253
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

52:46.413 --> 52:46.893
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

52:46.953 --> 52:48.675
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually let Miklatov read.

52:48.915 --> 52:49.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun.

52:49.996 --> 52:50.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fun.

52:50.676 --> 52:54.540
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to give him the illusion of that he was an actual full-fledged co-host for a night.

52:54.560 --> 52:54.980
[SPEAKER_05]: It was fun.

52:55.100 --> 52:57.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we downgrade him to dwarf host?

52:57.322 --> 52:59.564
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because he might bite you in the ankle.

52:59.784 --> 53:00.404
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

53:00.524 --> 53:02.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Pluto was downgraded.

53:02.706 --> 53:05.168
[SPEAKER_03]: She made a sci-fi joke.

53:05.228 --> 53:05.589
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

53:05.889 --> 53:07.070
[SPEAKER_03]: So Miklatov's our dwarf host.

53:07.392 --> 53:08.172
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's cool.

53:08.592 --> 53:09.553
[SPEAKER_03]: We can call him Xena.

53:10.253 --> 53:12.614
[SPEAKER_05]: We can call him Mini DarkSakura.

53:12.674 --> 53:13.634
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pissed off about that.

53:13.834 --> 53:15.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll get into that during the FUs.

53:15.575 --> 53:15.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

53:15.695 --> 53:17.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I wanted a planet named Xena.

53:17.195 --> 53:17.895
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, that's fine.

53:17.935 --> 53:22.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, first one is from GrinWithoutACat, who I think is uber cool.

53:24.838 --> 53:27.058
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that name because it makes me think of Alice in Wonderland.

53:28.079 --> 53:28.359
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.

53:29.079 --> 53:31.120
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started on the whole Alice Mad Hatter thing.

53:31.500 --> 53:31.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

53:32.812 --> 53:39.155
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Orange Challenge Crew, you probably already heard of this one, but I've just discovered Rhythm Tengoku on the GBA from Nintendo.

53:39.215 --> 53:41.596
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's the same people who did WarioWare and it shows.

53:42.056 --> 53:43.496
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't heard of it, there's some videos.

53:43.576 --> 53:48.178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually on Nintendo.co.jp, so search for it there.

53:48.998 --> 53:58.702
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great fun to me, and I'm thinking of importing it, but wanted to check on what you guys thought about the game and the possibility of it getting an English language release before I did, since you were the expert on music games.

54:00.223 --> 54:00.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, um...

54:02.287 --> 54:04.069
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't heard of it getting an English release at all.

54:04.109 --> 54:05.130
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's coming out here.

54:05.410 --> 54:10.014
[SPEAKER_05]: But I bet you it will if another certain Japanese import game does very well over here.

54:10.461 --> 54:19.766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that if Owendon, or Elite Beat Agents, I should say, does well over here, then... I think it's going to open the floodgates for music games on the handhelds.

54:20.606 --> 54:24.428
[SPEAKER_05]: So support Elite Beat Agents, and I'll bet you anything you're going to see a ton.

54:24.709 --> 54:27.090
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not cheap knockoff clones, but some good stuff.

54:28.491 --> 54:33.393
[SPEAKER_05]: One music title that's kind of often overlooked is Electroplankton, because it was kind of a harder one to get.

54:33.413 --> 54:34.854
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to get it on Nintendo Store and everything.

54:35.374 --> 54:37.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Electroplankton was cool from the demo.

54:37.295 --> 54:37.495
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

54:37.535 --> 54:39.375
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a rhythm game per se.

54:39.415 --> 54:40.496
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a music creation game.

54:40.736 --> 54:46.738
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think a lot of people that are into music and rhythm games are into it because of the fact that it feels like you're making music.

54:46.778 --> 54:51.760
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's why I love Beatmania and 2DX and all that stuff is I feel like I'm actually making music.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.320
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely check out Electroplankton.

54:54.340 --> 54:55.141
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you'll get a kick out of it.

54:55.421 --> 54:56.441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little bit more to this email.

54:56.701 --> 54:57.041
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

54:57.802 --> 54:58.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

54:59.122 --> 54:59.422
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

54:59.722 --> 55:00.403
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

55:00.563 --> 55:01.363
[SPEAKER_05]: Just read the damn email.

55:01.983 --> 55:02.383
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

55:03.203 --> 55:04.704
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed you, but my aim's improving.

55:07.062 --> 55:15.409
[SPEAKER_03]: This would probably make a boring question for the show, as I expect many of the listeners to be pretty knowledgeable on the whole music genre, but I was wondering if you could help me out.

55:15.790 --> 55:21.254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over in the UK, and we don't get the choice in rhythm action genre that you guys in North America get.

55:21.835 --> 55:32.144
[SPEAKER_03]: We do get quite a few of these games, Space Channel 5, Guitar Man, Donkey Konga, and Guitar Hero, for example, but we still miss out on things such as Beatmania and Drum Master.

55:32.164 --> 55:33.465
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that would be Taiko...

55:34.826 --> 55:41.312
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, both the DS and PSP are region-free, so I've been able to import great games such as Daigaso, Band Brothers, Osu!

55:41.352 --> 55:43.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Tatakai Oendan, and Drum Master Portable.

55:45.215 --> 55:51.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you could recommend any music games that are available on either the GBA, DS, or PSP.

55:51.861 --> 55:55.945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know any Japanese, but I haven't had any problems working my way around the ones already mentioned.

55:56.245 --> 55:56.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the great work.

55:57.046 --> 55:57.726
[SPEAKER_03]: It's appreciated.

55:57.786 --> 55:58.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Grin without a cap.

55:58.715 --> 55:59.695
[SPEAKER_05]: What a very humble email.

55:59.735 --> 56:00.636
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate that.

56:00.696 --> 56:01.996
[SPEAKER_05]: Very humble attitude, that email.

56:03.836 --> 56:05.837
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I just kind of recommended one there.

56:05.857 --> 56:09.898
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the Electroplankton was my suggestion there.

56:10.618 --> 56:12.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you kind of named most of the big ones.

56:12.219 --> 56:15.060
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a whole lot that we get that you guys don't get.

56:15.100 --> 56:17.420
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, most of the ones you named, we also have.

56:18.220 --> 56:20.561
[SPEAKER_05]: Handhelds, there's not a lot of music games on handhelds.

56:20.921 --> 56:23.162
[SPEAKER_05]: The DDR games on handheld were poopy.

56:23.262 --> 56:23.962
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want those.

56:24.162 --> 56:27.323
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would say the only one I can think of that he didn't mention...

56:27.763 --> 56:28.224
[SPEAKER_04]: and DJ Maxx.

56:44.088 --> 56:58.295
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that if you're, honestly, there's not a good Beatmania for a handheld, except for the WonderSwan one, which actually, I mean, I don't know if you have a WonderSwan, but it actually has a little scratch pad that you attach to it, and all the sound effects were digitized.

56:59.164 --> 56:59.544
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerToyGames

57:27.674 --> 57:31.478
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Beatmania and DDR Portable.

57:31.498 --> 57:32.659
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even a Hello Kitty one.

57:32.959 --> 57:35.261
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like the size of a Pokemon Pikachu.

57:35.542 --> 57:35.802
[SPEAKER_05]: Cute.

57:36.423 --> 57:42.448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not actually saying this to actually plug a site, but it is the one site I know that you can order them.

57:42.548 --> 57:47.734
[SPEAKER_03]: NCSX has them, and Toys and Joys, if you're interested in that type of thing.

57:47.994 --> 57:51.217
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say look through any of the importers list except for Buy Right, because they suck.

57:51.932 --> 57:53.392
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's do any of the importers lists.

57:53.412 --> 57:54.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't Byright go out of business?

57:54.993 --> 57:58.354
[SPEAKER_03]: Byright got shut down by the Better Business Bureau.

57:58.374 --> 57:59.314
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, next email.

57:59.754 --> 58:01.055
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha, I was so happy.

58:01.435 --> 58:02.895
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's actually the last one.

58:03.556 --> 58:11.338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from SurunojiSama91 from our chat.

58:11.378 --> 58:14.499
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the phantom caller that didn't pick up for the music because his phone battery died.

58:15.001 --> 58:17.643
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw, I got to miss out on a fun contest last week.

58:17.683 --> 58:20.085
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, we will do again because I got a really good reception.

58:20.105 --> 58:23.448
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, we had Jamie play tonight the game from last week.

58:23.488 --> 58:26.150
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not sure what we're talking about, download Part B of last week's show.

58:26.491 --> 58:27.231
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie got six.

58:27.912 --> 58:29.593
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not too shabby.

58:29.833 --> 58:31.234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll write more down next time.

58:32.095 --> 58:32.996
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't write anything down.

58:33.636 --> 58:34.917
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she just named them off the top of her head.

58:34.937 --> 58:35.578
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was pretty good.

58:35.678 --> 58:36.098
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty good.

58:36.219 --> 58:37.159
[SPEAKER_03]: As I'm hardcore.

58:37.560 --> 58:40.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Dear OLR, I'm afraid.

58:40.762 --> 58:42.704
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid for a lot of consumers.

58:43.749 --> 58:47.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Afraid that they're going to be screwed over by Sony during this next-gen console war.

58:48.314 --> 58:51.677
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a loyal Sony fan over the years, maybe a little too loyal.

58:52.077 --> 58:54.560
[SPEAKER_03]: I own both an import PS2 and an American PS2.

58:54.600 --> 58:57.462
[SPEAKER_03]: I also happen to own a Japanese PSP, which I ordered at launch.

58:57.923 --> 59:03.829
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm afraid of the future of Sony with their release of the PS3 because of the possible slip in sales due to the price tag.

59:04.069 --> 59:08.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people are going to buy the PS3, and it's obvious that they're going to sell out at launch.

59:08.713 --> 59:23.644
[SPEAKER_03]: But with their questionable market strategy, releasing the PS3 under two SKUs at sky-high prices, charges for useless game content, and the loss of sales with the UMD, Sony may be in deep doo-doo this go-round.

59:24.124 --> 59:30.829
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know what your thoughts are about purchasing the PS3, and also if it will be a good investment, or a possible quote, dreamcast.

59:31.029 --> 59:32.090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, loyal fan.

59:32.390 --> 59:32.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Ricky.

59:32.878 --> 59:33.458
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

59:33.478 --> 59:35.019
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a very similar email last week.

59:35.039 --> 59:39.122
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of Sony questioning going on lately, which isn't much of a surprise.

59:39.842 --> 59:47.467
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to stick by something I said kind of similar last week, is that, you know what, I don't think it's something that I want to get on launch day.

59:47.915 --> 59:51.499
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, the PlayStation 2 wasn't really something I needed on launch day either.

59:51.899 --> 59:57.224
[SPEAKER_05]: So give it time, see where it goes, but for right now, I don't see any need to run out and buy it.

59:57.284 --> 01:00:04.852
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize there's been a lot of hype recently, you know, because the Xbox 360 had this huge launch thing, and that's been like the big thing lately is launch day, launch day.

01:00:05.232 --> 01:00:07.234
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't have to buy into that hype.

01:00:07.595 --> 01:00:07.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait.

01:00:08.175 --> 01:00:08.596
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fine.

01:00:09.116 --> 01:00:11.739
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait for the game you want to come out, and then make a decision.

01:00:12.199 --> 01:00:16.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Like me, I'm waiting for Final Fantasy XIII or something else that will grab my attention in that same style.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:18.163
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I will make a decision.

01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:21.365
[SPEAKER_03]: I still stand by what I have always said since day one.

01:00:21.725 --> 01:00:23.746
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:00:24.186 --> 01:00:25.947
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I played, it's crap.

01:00:26.788 --> 01:00:27.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Sonic Avenger.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:35.793
[SPEAKER_03]: As for comparing it to the Dreamcast, I don't think that nothing is ever going to be... Yeah, because the Dreamcast is kind of the other way around where it's just horribly underrated.

01:00:36.694 --> 01:00:39.576
[SPEAKER_03]: But the system itself was so versatile.

01:00:40.156 --> 01:00:41.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hello, Bleemcast.

01:00:42.466 --> 01:00:44.567
[SPEAKER_03]: You had a system that could run Playstation games.

01:00:45.107 --> 01:00:48.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice the news that was this week that they were talking about?

01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:53.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Gran Turismo HD as a work, it was basically a tech demo?

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:54.930
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually it's the full game.

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:56.471
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually going to be coming out.

01:00:56.631 --> 01:01:03.353
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, they have said it, it is a port of Gran Turismo 4.

01:01:04.053 --> 01:01:06.134
[SPEAKER_04]: All they did was upscale the graphics.

01:01:06.674 --> 01:01:07.254
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:10.195
[SPEAKER_04]: So yay, you can pay $59.99 for a

01:01:12.642 --> 01:01:14.283
[SPEAKER_04]: HD, DVD, Outnumbers, Blu-ray, 2 to 1

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:39.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand how can it fail?

01:01:59.364 --> 01:01:59.684
[SPEAKER_04]: Beta.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

01:02:02.127 --> 01:02:04.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the Betamax.

01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:06.570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was also Sony's format, too.

01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:12.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the Betamax was technologically a superior format, it still failed against VHS.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:23.165
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see Ken going, you know, if the PlayStation 3 does not sell, I'll go door-to-door and punch people in the face and make them buy it at gunpoint or whatever.

01:02:23.686 --> 01:02:26.188
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote Junami, inconceivable!

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:27.930
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep using that word.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:29.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think it means what you think it does.

01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:33.933
[SPEAKER_05]: We need some good males that hate on Nintendo and Microsoft, to be fair.

01:02:34.293 --> 01:02:34.573
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:02:34.653 --> 01:02:37.935
[SPEAKER_05]: So send some Microsoft and Nintendo hate, if you're feeling it.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:38.775
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be obvious.

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:40.276
[SPEAKER_05]: Over to Mailbag and OrangeHunter.com.

01:02:40.376 --> 01:02:49.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Our listeners, I hope I'm not assuming for all of you, mind you, but our listeners in general, I've seen more support for Nintendo followed by Microsoft.

01:02:50.293 --> 01:02:54.255
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly am seeing... Truthfully, I do feel the same way, but I want to hear from the other side.

01:02:54.315 --> 01:02:58.216
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually am having that same warm feeling in my heart for the Wii that the Dreamcast gave me.

01:02:58.996 --> 01:02:59.477
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:03:00.217 --> 01:03:01.817
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you some hate news right here.

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:07.420
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii is not going to have... The third-party Wii titles will not be online at launch.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:16.763
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because Nintendo is not giving out the actual libraries to build online for the third-party titles until 2007.

01:03:16.803 --> 01:03:17.423
[SPEAKER_04]: And the theory is that

01:03:19.164 --> 01:03:19.625
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:03:34.384 --> 01:03:35.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Not gonna happen.

01:03:35.405 --> 01:03:37.526
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't make the same mistake you made with the GameCube, Nintendo.

01:03:37.546 --> 01:03:38.246
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say.

01:03:38.526 --> 01:03:39.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do not make the same mistake.

01:03:40.127 --> 01:03:45.270
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think they are, but I just kind of wish they would go online, but whatever.

01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:46.630
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it's their call.

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.632
[SPEAKER_05]: They're releasing 2007, so... At least it's on the horizon.

01:03:50.553 --> 01:03:54.174
[SPEAKER_05]: DS didn't start online, and it turned out okay, so I'm gonna give it to them.

01:03:54.274 --> 01:03:54.915
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

01:03:54.935 --> 01:03:59.137
[SPEAKER_04]: 99%... Most systems out there didn't start off online, the only exception would probably be in the 360.

01:03:59.197 --> 01:03:59.257
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:05.301
[SPEAKER_03]: To say so, though, the Dreamcast did actually come with a dial-up modem.

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:07.643
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.

01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:10.805
[SPEAKER_03]: We paid for the broadband that only worked on Quake 3.

01:04:13.227 --> 01:04:13.508
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:04:13.888 --> 01:04:16.590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's other people in this world who need oven mitts and a helmet.

01:04:18.011 --> 01:04:22.275
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would like to email us, send us an email to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:04:22.315 --> 01:04:24.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Send DarkSakura your oven mitts and helmets.

01:04:24.436 --> 01:04:25.417
[SPEAKER_03]: I do take worship, too.

01:04:25.697 --> 01:04:25.978
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:04:26.558 --> 01:04:27.559
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways...

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:29.985
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some interesting news coming out.

01:04:30.186 --> 01:04:40.093
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we talked about it, I think, a little bit last week about how some of the Toys R Us stores were actually selling the Xbox Live camera early.

01:04:41.213 --> 01:04:47.738
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, a few weeks early, because it's not supposed to come out until around the 19th or 20th of September.

01:04:48.399 --> 01:04:51.901
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, some interesting news about that, actually.

01:04:53.202 --> 01:04:55.324
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the apparent readers of...

01:04:59.247 --> 01:05:10.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox360.qj.net read the headline on their site and actually went down to a South Miami, Florida store and purchased one of the cameras.

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:17.692
[SPEAKER_04]: He was speaking to the clerk there and asked them why they were selling it two weeks early.

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:22.333
[SPEAKER_04]: He was told by Microsoft that they're releasing a limited number for selective sales.

01:05:23.473 --> 01:05:25.594
[SPEAKER_04]: His assumption was, I can only assume that

01:05:26.195 --> 01:05:27.696
[SPEAKER_04]: This was to start buzz.

01:05:28.097 --> 01:05:33.982
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, some sort of viral campaign to basically get the buzz out there about the brand new camera.

01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:38.446
[SPEAKER_05]: For all those people that play UNO online, OMG, I'm starting to see people with cameras.

01:05:38.767 --> 01:05:39.908
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, look, naked people.

01:05:40.874 --> 01:05:46.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyways, if you are looking for some information about the camera, it is going to be coming out in two different SKUs.

01:05:47.237 --> 01:05:58.702
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a cheaper one for $39.99, which is the camera, a live headset, in case you don't have one, a free month of live gold, and Uno, a card for the full game of Uno.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:02.844
[SPEAKER_04]: And supposedly later on, they're going to allow a free download for Totem Ball, because not only is it

01:06:03.484 --> 01:06:30.594
[SPEAKER_04]: Playable through the camera Then there's one also for $79.99 And that also includes the camera, the headset, a full year of Xbox Live Gold And of course a free month Uno, the full game A to-be-announced third game for the camera and 200 Microsoft points So, very interesting Too bad I already bought Uno Yeah, same

01:06:31.202 --> 01:06:31.603
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Microsoft.

01:06:31.624 --> 01:06:33.109
[SPEAKER_05]: They should have just given us Microsoft points.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:35.117
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, give us Microsoft points instead.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:35.780
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's buy something else.

01:06:36.302 --> 01:06:36.664
[SPEAKER_05]: Jerks.

01:06:37.557 --> 01:06:42.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, the one thing you could have bought would be these new Xbox Live Arcade games that are being developed.

01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:48.599
[SPEAKER_05]: They're tabletop European game favorites that are being ported over to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:52.500
[SPEAKER_05]: The Settlers of Catan is one game that's coming over to Xbox Live.

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:56.460
[SPEAKER_05]: And forgive me if I'm horribly mispronouncing these.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.101
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never heard of these games before in my life.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:01.661
[SPEAKER_05]: Carcassonne is another game that's coming over.

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.822
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alhambra are some games that are coming over to Xbox Live Arcade.

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:05.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they bottle water?

01:07:06.794 --> 01:07:08.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe in this country, but over there it's a board game.

01:07:09.655 --> 01:07:11.055
[SPEAKER_05]: So that should be interesting.

01:07:11.075 --> 01:07:12.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Axis and Allies?

01:07:12.316 --> 01:07:12.896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those.

01:07:12.956 --> 01:07:15.256
[SPEAKER_03]: And Risk.

01:07:15.717 --> 01:07:18.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine online multiplayer Risk.

01:07:18.957 --> 01:07:19.918
[SPEAKER_05]: You think Uno's bad.

01:07:20.018 --> 01:07:21.298
[SPEAKER_05]: Draw four, bitch!

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Or Monopoly.

01:07:24.299 --> 01:07:25.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Monopoly would be ridiculous.

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't they give us chess?

01:07:28.615 --> 01:07:31.776
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you imagine how hardcore Risk would be online?

01:07:31.956 --> 01:07:33.477
[SPEAKER_05]: I just took Russia, bitch!

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:39.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just like some, just a board game collection, like Connect Four, or like Battleship.

01:07:39.719 --> 01:07:41.440
[SPEAKER_04]: I suck your battleship, bitch!

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.121
[SPEAKER_04]: You have sunk my battleship!

01:07:46.022 --> 01:07:47.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Go back to start, bitch!

01:07:49.303 --> 01:07:51.224
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not pass the show!

01:07:51.264 --> 01:07:52.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Go directly to go, bitch!

01:07:52.904 --> 01:07:54.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not collect $200, or I kick your ass!

01:07:56.026 --> 01:07:56.666
[SPEAKER_03]: For great justice.

01:07:57.478 --> 01:08:00.321
[SPEAKER_05]: or as Drunami says in chat, I call the thimble, bitch.

01:08:01.422 --> 01:08:02.444
[SPEAKER_03]: He used the thimble?

01:08:03.645 --> 01:08:05.427
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta fucking shoot, bitch.

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:07.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-uh, uh-uh, it's the puppy.

01:08:08.711 --> 01:08:11.193
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on with chutes and ladders, MF-er.

01:08:11.334 --> 01:08:11.874
[SPEAKER_05]: Your mom.

01:08:12.315 --> 01:08:12.855
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, anyway.

01:08:13.536 --> 01:08:18.762
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, the reason why we do that is if you've ever actually played on Xbox Live and listened to people, like, seriously.

01:08:19.758 --> 01:08:20.979
[SPEAKER_05]: They trash talk and everything.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:21.900
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything.

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:23.923
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we play with the thing turned off.

01:08:23.943 --> 01:08:26.065
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to put out like a strawberry shortcake happy game.

01:08:26.085 --> 01:08:27.486
[SPEAKER_05]: I leave feedback on everyone.

01:08:27.526 --> 01:08:29.208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you know, I don't care.

01:08:30.109 --> 01:08:32.552
[SPEAKER_05]: This person is an ass.

01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:34.394
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish you could type things in.

01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:35.475
[SPEAKER_05]: Like eBay.

01:08:36.256 --> 01:08:37.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Was fun to play with.

01:08:37.597 --> 01:08:38.699
[SPEAKER_05]: A++++.

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:39.880
[SPEAKER_05]: Would deathmatch again.

01:08:40.674 --> 01:08:41.515
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I want?

01:08:41.775 --> 01:08:44.577
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want some multiplayer in Viva Pinata.

01:08:45.058 --> 01:08:46.819
[SPEAKER_04]: I killed your pinata, bitch!

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Now give me candy, bitch!

01:08:50.882 --> 01:08:56.127
[SPEAKER_04]: The cutest fucking game they need to just have an online deathmatch for.

01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:57.688
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be hilarious.

01:08:57.768 --> 01:08:59.009
[SPEAKER_03]: Loco Broco deathmatch.

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:01.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, whatever.

01:09:01.431 --> 01:09:02.732
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's keep it moving.

01:09:03.363 --> 01:09:17.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as movements, and this sort of makes me think more of bowel movements, that Louisiana game law business that we've been hearing so much about, hence the results of bowel movements making me think of, actually, it got stopped.

01:09:18.058 --> 01:09:21.120
[SPEAKER_03]: The unstoppable law got stopped.

01:09:21.761 --> 01:09:30.707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, basically Jack Thompson was going around saying the law is constitutional as it addresses all of the complaints raised by federal courts which have struck down other state video game laws.

01:09:30.847 --> 01:09:32.108
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he's quoted as saying.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:35.030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know you're still a dumbass, Jackie Poo.

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:43.756
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was basically shot down by a federal judge said it was unconstitutional and

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop wasting our tax money.

01:10:08.059 --> 01:10:22.782
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, well, the bill's sponsor was basically saying that he hoped testosterone would, quote, have the additional adrenaline and testosterone needed in the upcoming cockfight over the constitutionality of this bill.

01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:37.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that's going to attack our right to express ourselves, or even, it's still somebody's creative work, and you're trying to censor how they are expressing themselves.

01:10:38.394 --> 01:10:38.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Their work.

01:10:39.495 --> 01:10:44.859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still somebody sat and thought this idea up and you were suppressing this idea.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:46.781
[SPEAKER_03]: Now tell me what's constitutional about that.

01:10:48.982 --> 01:10:50.623
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura lay off the SmackDown.

01:10:52.225 --> 01:10:52.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

01:10:53.325 --> 01:10:55.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought this was kind of funny.

01:10:55.327 --> 01:10:58.610
[SPEAKER_04]: When I read this story, I know we joked about this on another show.

01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:04.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, goddammit, I'm not buying that PlayStation 3 unless, you know, it cures cancer.

01:11:04.234 --> 01:11:04.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Well,

01:11:05.060 --> 01:11:07.061
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be helping to cure cancer at the PlayStation 3.

01:11:07.901 --> 01:11:22.546
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they're doing that is kind of been like a project that's been going on PCs right now with the Folding at Home project, basically using distributing power while your system is idle.

01:11:22.806 --> 01:11:27.668
[SPEAKER_04]: You can download a program or whatever, and that will basically kind of compute.

01:11:27.728 --> 01:11:32.690
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe this is looking at some of the proteins or whatever make up

01:11:33.052 --> 01:11:33.352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:47.096
[SPEAKER_04]: It's computing something to basically help cure cancer and they're going to be supposedly expecting to get 100 gigaflops with 10,000 PS3s churning away with this project.

01:11:47.176 --> 01:11:51.057
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a lot of processing power towards a very good cause.

01:11:52.257 --> 01:11:56.198
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully I don't actually have to run this no matter what.

01:11:56.678 --> 01:11:59.419
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this how they justify the $600 price tag?

01:11:59.459 --> 01:12:01.380
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that if you buy one of these then you won't get cancer?

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:02.360
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that...

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:05.274
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:12:20.606 --> 01:12:21.526
[SPEAKER_03]: Ring, Spiral, and Loop.

01:12:21.807 --> 01:12:35.993
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes me think a lot of Loop, because the premise of that one is that they were building a society, but it got infected like a virus and they're trying to... Basically, yeah, they're crunching the math of folding proteins that hold the secret to curing cancer.

01:12:36.153 --> 01:12:38.414
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also like that old project study at home.

01:12:38.434 --> 01:12:43.536
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I thought was really funny, it was kind of a comment in this article, it says, but mom, it cures cancer.

01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:46.397
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't buy it for me, granny will die.

01:12:47.278 --> 01:12:48.418
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought that was kind of funny.

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:49.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha ha ha.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:58.202
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, speaking of the PlayStation 3, DarkSakura mentioned earlier that the lineup E3 for the PlayStation 3 left a lot of people unimpressed.

01:12:58.562 --> 01:13:01.424
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's going to be a whole lot more shown at Tokyo Game Show.

01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:02.524
[SPEAKER_05]: Sony's going to up it.

01:13:02.764 --> 01:13:03.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they actually have systems?

01:13:04.545 --> 01:13:07.746
[SPEAKER_05]: Supposedly, they're going to have more stuff, and they're going to be showing a whole lot of games.

01:13:08.186 --> 01:13:09.327
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's some stuff they're going to be showing.

01:13:09.507 --> 01:13:11.788
[SPEAKER_05]: Armored Core 4, Bladestorm...

01:13:12.368 --> 01:13:29.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Haikunen Sensu, Coated Arms Assault, Devil May Cry 4, The Eye of Judgment, Fatal Inertia, Formula One World Championship, Genji, Working Title, Gran Turismo, Heavenly Sword, Lair, Working Title, Mahjong Takai 4, which probably won't come out here.

01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:31.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we ever gotten a Mahjong game actually come out in the U.S.?

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.861
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a couple of Mahjong games.

01:13:35.141 --> 01:13:48.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Minono Golf 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, Target in Sight, Motorstorm, Railfan, Resistance, Fall of Man, Ridge Racer 7, and Warhawk are all going to make appearances at the Tokyo Game Show.

01:13:50.065 --> 01:13:54.626
[SPEAKER_03]: Minono Golf actually sounds very cute, so it means everybody's golf.

01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:56.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that just hot shots?

01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.630
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:13:56.711 --> 01:13:56.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Over there?

01:13:56.971 --> 01:13:57.751
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:13:57.791 --> 01:14:03.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Heavenly Sword reminds me of like a female, it's almost like crossing God of War with Blood Rain.

01:14:04.433 --> 01:14:05.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

01:14:06.394 --> 01:14:07.574
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to Devil May Cry 4.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:09.035
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, see now, see?

01:14:09.555 --> 01:14:10.655
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to get my Dante on.

01:14:10.755 --> 01:14:15.977
[SPEAKER_05]: If Devil May Cry 4 is made of awesome and win, will you maybe find some love for PlayStation 3 in your black heart?

01:14:16.157 --> 01:14:21.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:14:21.179 --> 01:14:21.499
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.

01:14:21.519 --> 01:14:23.840
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to fix Sonic Adventure, the bastards.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:24.320
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, ma'am.

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:25.274
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

01:14:59.711 --> 01:15:01.531
[SPEAKER_05]: FUs of the week time, DarkSakura.

01:15:02.512 --> 01:15:05.672
[SPEAKER_03]: A big FU goes toward the astrological community.

01:15:06.933 --> 01:15:11.614
[SPEAKER_03]: And not really... I understand why Pluto was downgraded.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:16.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for anyone who doesn't know, I love my geek science so much.

01:15:17.175 --> 01:15:21.936
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand the logic behind downgrading Pluto's status to a dwarf planet.

01:15:23.677 --> 01:15:28.238
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a couple weeks ago that they were about to announce the 10th planet, planet Xena.

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:30.319
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Planet Xena!

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:31.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the moon be Planet Gabrielle?

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:31.821
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be.

01:15:52.938 --> 01:16:01.548
[SPEAKER_05]: Zena and Gabriella Leave it to the astronomy community to name planets after Zena Warrior Princess characters.

01:16:01.568 --> 01:16:02.429
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be awesome.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:06.875
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, there's people who are saying, oh, that's so stupid.

01:16:07.055 --> 01:16:07.515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:16:08.477 --> 01:16:08.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Look,

01:16:09.702 --> 01:16:20.632
[SPEAKER_03]: Before, you know, first of all, there was another planet before that that existed in the 1800s that was actually downgraded to, um, I believe it was actually figured out to be a comet instead of a planet.

01:16:21.333 --> 01:16:22.874
[SPEAKER_03]: It was downgraded in the 1800s.

01:16:22.894 --> 01:16:26.037
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get Pluto until 1930 when it was just found.

01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:27.538
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they argued about it then, too.

01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:32.903
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now that it's Pluto, they're saying, uh-oh, you know what, we changed our minds again, you know.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:34.641
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 years later.

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:35.642
[SPEAKER_03]: 70 years later.

01:16:35.682 --> 01:16:38.105
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this news makes Walt Disney roll in his grave.

01:16:38.505 --> 01:16:39.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Some days I feel like Pluto.

01:16:40.607 --> 01:16:42.289
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what's going to happen to Sailor Pluto.

01:16:42.309 --> 01:16:45.933
[SPEAKER_03]: Is she going to shrink?

01:16:45.953 --> 01:16:46.814
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she was really tall.

01:16:47.555 --> 01:16:48.416
[SPEAKER_05]: Next FU, please.

01:16:48.436 --> 01:16:48.656
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:49.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more on this.

01:16:49.777 --> 01:16:50.318
[SPEAKER_03]: I have more on this.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:59.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the whole reason being is that one of the primary things is that the orbit of Pluto is elliptical and not circular in general, like most of the other planets.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:05.270
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually intersects with Neptune, which even when I was a little kid, I was like, that's weird.

01:17:06.071 --> 01:17:07.371
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with it.

01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:07.991
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

01:17:08.031 --> 01:17:19.013
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish people would just, you know, freaking understand that these new criteria that they have for judging celestial bodies is actually sort of good and smart and should have been enacted a long time ago.

01:17:19.813 --> 01:17:19.973
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

01:17:21.687 --> 01:17:22.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:17:23.408 --> 01:17:23.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:25.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what you all say.

01:17:25.309 --> 01:17:26.249
[SPEAKER_04]: The world's flat.

01:17:26.829 --> 01:17:27.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:29.711
[SPEAKER_03]: As flat as your ass.

01:17:31.131 --> 01:17:31.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:17:31.892 --> 01:17:32.932
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that as a compliment.

01:17:33.472 --> 01:17:34.433
[SPEAKER_04]: No, anyways.

01:17:34.973 --> 01:17:46.178
[SPEAKER_04]: So, F you to drivers, because as I was leaving here yesterday, see, we were supposed to be doing some important work, interviewing a certain somebody, and the somebody decided to quit his company.

01:17:47.379 --> 01:17:47.679
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways,

01:17:48.044 --> 01:17:58.871
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I was leaving here, freaking crazy Asians in a goddamn little Suzuki SUV thing, one of those mini SUVs, blew through a goddamn stop sign.

01:17:58.952 --> 01:18:02.194
[SPEAKER_04]: I honked my horn and they're like, what happened?

01:18:02.294 --> 01:18:02.834
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:18:03.435 --> 01:18:06.817
[SPEAKER_04]: So stupid drivers, I swear to God, they're trying to kill me out there.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, you need to watch where you're going.

01:18:09.721 --> 01:18:13.663
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as I mentioned... Are you ever going to have a week when you have an FU for something other than drivers?

01:18:13.863 --> 01:18:19.705
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had plenty of weeks where I've had things, you know... I actually did have an email received that was an FU toward Loki's FUs.

01:18:21.106 --> 01:18:22.046
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell are those people?

01:18:22.086 --> 01:18:22.987
[SPEAKER_04]: What is their problem?

01:18:23.747 --> 01:18:25.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they get to choose what I'm angry at?

01:18:25.948 --> 01:18:26.688
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.129
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make any sense whatever.

01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:18:28.889 --> 01:18:31.850
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, FUs are the damn TV at work.

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:34.632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I took my TV to work, since I don't have a place to put my old TV.

01:18:35.332 --> 01:18:35.452
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

01:18:36.192 --> 01:18:37.633
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a sub-FU to male drivers.

01:18:39.133 --> 01:18:41.915
[SPEAKER_03]: As in, people with small penises that drive big trucks.

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:48.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the ones that tried to go past me until me with my faster Lancer got in front of them and flipped them off hardcore.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:54.000
[SPEAKER_05]: My FU of the week, I don't have a lot, I'm not very angsty this week, so I suppose my FU of the week would go to Jamie.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:55.621
[SPEAKER_05]: You bitch!

01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:57.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, well, because you went to Disneyland.

01:18:58.162 --> 01:18:58.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

01:18:58.462 --> 01:18:59.202
[SPEAKER_05]: And you didn't take me.

01:19:00.123 --> 01:19:01.063
[SPEAKER_03]: It was girl trip.

01:19:02.284 --> 01:19:02.584
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:09.842
[SPEAKER_03]: I will petition next time that Rob gets to come on our next big gay trip.

01:19:09.963 --> 01:19:10.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

01:19:11.043 --> 01:19:12.684
[SPEAKER_05]: I want smoothies too some days, you know.

01:19:13.785 --> 01:19:14.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you really?

01:19:14.905 --> 01:19:15.045
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:19:16.706 --> 01:19:21.609
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Robway in the chatroom, yeah, you did give me a smoothie today, thank you.

01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:28.193
[SPEAKER_05]: Robway in the chatroom says, on the astronomy, after declaring Pluto not a planet, they voted on Goofy not a dog.

01:19:30.494 --> 01:19:31.354
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was funny.

01:19:31.635 --> 01:19:32.876
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was funny.

01:19:33.216 --> 01:19:34.697
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hug Goofy.

01:19:34.757 --> 01:19:36.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I meant Goofy's not funny.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.439
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hug Goofy.

01:19:37.779 --> 01:19:43.484
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, what was funny was Goofy at Goofy's Kitchen, we went to a character breakfast, teasing Alice about having an affair with Mad Hatter.

01:19:46.106 --> 01:19:46.887
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

01:19:47.367 --> 01:19:48.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever played Toontown?

01:19:49.269 --> 01:19:49.849
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't.

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:51.050
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of seems like something you'd like.

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:53.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I saw advertisements for that on TV.

01:19:53.292 --> 01:19:55.173
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my picture with the princesses.

01:19:56.354 --> 01:19:57.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to gaming.

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:04.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, back to gaming I know there's some really interesting news from SNK

01:20:05.117 --> 01:20:09.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was if people would give me a chance to freaking pull up my thing.

01:20:10.020 --> 01:20:10.860
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you guys.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:11.400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:18.444
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's fake news is host of Orange Nails Radio, DarkSakura, goes crazy and kills her co-host with a tray.

01:20:18.684 --> 01:20:19.044
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

01:20:19.144 --> 01:20:21.986
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, she doesn't do that because she was distracted by the pretty princesses.

01:20:22.186 --> 01:20:25.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we get through tonight's show in like under two hours?

01:20:25.468 --> 01:20:26.668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mini show tonight, right?

01:20:26.968 --> 01:20:27.549
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't sure.

01:20:27.609 --> 01:20:31.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to put the pictures up on our forums because the Ariel was so pretty.

01:20:32.091 --> 01:20:33.532
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like I wanted to follow her around.

01:20:34.654 --> 01:20:35.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:20:36.676 --> 01:20:37.616
[SPEAKER_03]: SNK!

01:20:37.716 --> 01:20:41.059
[SPEAKER_05]: I could walk to Disneyland by the time she gets to our next fucking story.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:42.220
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:43.221
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob.

01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:43.621
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:20:43.981 --> 01:20:44.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

01:20:44.622 --> 01:20:50.546
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna take this lollipop that's shaped phallically and shove it up your ass if you don't get to the next story.

01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:57.151
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the next story is about one of my sleeper favorite games ever, so you really need to get to it.

01:20:57.772 --> 01:20:59.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so shut up so I can.

01:20:59.713 --> 01:21:00.053
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:21:00.714 --> 01:21:01.314
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm shutting up.

01:21:01.395 --> 01:21:03.116
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. He of Big Mouth.

01:21:04.542 --> 01:21:06.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk shit about everybody today.

01:21:06.424 --> 01:21:06.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh.

01:21:07.685 --> 01:21:08.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:21:10.147 --> 01:21:15.131
[SPEAKER_03]: So SNK is coming to Live Arcade and everybody goes, Yay!

01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:23.878
[SPEAKER_03]: So guess what's going to be showing up on Xbox Live Arcade since Capcom decided to give a Street Fighter 2 Hyper Fighting.

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:27.901
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be getting Garou Densetsu Special, a.k.a.

01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:28.842
[SPEAKER_03]: Fatal Fury Special.

01:21:29.605 --> 01:21:36.691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's badass because I can play, what was his name, Tung Fu Ru on Xbox Live.

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:37.792
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me all kind of happy.

01:21:37.812 --> 01:21:38.473
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a Mai player.

01:21:39.374 --> 01:21:40.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Mai is awesome.

01:21:40.935 --> 01:21:45.600
[SPEAKER_05]: Mai is so... Mai freaking would kick Chun-Li's ass any day.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:46.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously?

01:21:46.721 --> 01:21:50.684
[SPEAKER_05]: Just fucking take her out and beat her ass up and then go, me bouncy, when she wins.

01:21:51.305 --> 01:21:52.706
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she says me bouncy.

01:21:52.806 --> 01:21:53.947
[SPEAKER_05]: No, she says me bouncy.

01:21:54.107 --> 01:21:54.568
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what she says.

01:21:54.588 --> 01:21:55.048
[SPEAKER_03]: She just bounces.

01:21:55.549 --> 01:21:55.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

01:21:56.659 --> 01:22:01.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they're saying that on PS2 they had a non-playable demo of King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match.

01:22:02.763 --> 01:22:05.824
[SPEAKER_03]: with a playable demo of Garou Densetsu Battle Archives 2.

01:22:07.185 --> 01:22:10.666
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also talking about Metal Slug Complete for PSP.

01:22:10.886 --> 01:22:18.729
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, even more than having Fatal Fury Special, I really want to see one of the old school KOF games.

01:22:20.409 --> 01:22:22.770
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you how hardcore of a KOF fangirl I am.

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:28.032
[SPEAKER_03]: We went out and bought King of Fighters 2000 for the Neo Geo.

01:22:29.512 --> 01:22:31.353
[SPEAKER_03]: As in the cartridge Neo Geo.

01:22:33.015 --> 01:22:33.415
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie.

01:22:33.735 --> 01:22:33.976
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:22:34.296 --> 01:22:34.876
[SPEAKER_05]: Duck King.

01:22:36.097 --> 01:22:36.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah!

01:22:36.317 --> 01:22:36.897
[SPEAKER_05]: So awesome.

01:22:37.938 --> 01:22:38.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

01:22:39.419 --> 01:22:40.980
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your major KOF team?

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:42.941
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't play a lot of King of Fighters.

01:22:43.201 --> 01:22:44.722
[SPEAKER_05]: I pretty much quit at Fail Fury Special.

01:22:45.683 --> 01:22:46.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, sad.

01:22:46.423 --> 01:22:47.584
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it a couple times.

01:22:47.644 --> 01:22:49.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure whatever team Mai was on.

01:22:49.445 --> 01:22:55.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Mai, Leona, and then my alternating ones of either Athena or Kim Kephwan.

01:22:55.869 --> 01:22:58.511
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, Kim Kephwan, actually, I would play more than Mai.

01:22:58.711 --> 01:22:59.852
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I love his moves.

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:00.932
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an awesome fighter.

01:23:00.992 --> 01:23:01.533
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Iori.

01:23:02.073 --> 01:23:02.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

01:23:03.166 --> 01:23:04.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

01:23:04.588 --> 01:23:05.749
[SPEAKER_05]: Typical fangirl.

01:23:06.150 --> 01:23:07.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Typical fangirl.

01:23:07.252 --> 01:23:07.892
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:23:08.974 --> 01:23:13.380
[SPEAKER_03]: I also used the little boy with the big hat.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:14.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:17.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's pretty cool.

01:23:18.323 --> 01:23:21.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I'm sorry, I'm getting... LokiFound sounds so enthusiastic!

01:23:21.806 --> 01:23:25.089
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, little boy, sounds like fun!

01:23:25.109 --> 01:23:29.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, okay, I wasn't really a huge fan of Fatal Fury.

01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:34.718
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I may have played it once at like a supermarket when they had those, you know, the Neo Geo with the four games on there.

01:23:35.194 --> 01:23:36.115
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:05.677 --> 01:24:06.397
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.

01:24:07.378 --> 01:24:15.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I don't know if these people were nominated, but it says Brain Age beat out cult hits like Guitar Hero and Oindun and Amp 3.

01:24:17.883 --> 01:24:21.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Dragon Quest VIII, Electroplankton, Indigo Prophecy, and Killer7.

01:24:21.544 --> 01:24:23.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's my couple problems here.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.226
[SPEAKER_04]: Amp 3, first of all, is a sequel.

01:24:26.047 --> 01:24:26.968
[SPEAKER_04]: To a snowboarding game.

01:24:27.288 --> 01:24:30.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess cutscenes were kind of different, so I guess that would be something.

01:24:31.512 --> 01:24:33.133
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's a snowboarding game.

01:24:33.333 --> 01:24:33.794
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

01:24:34.094 --> 01:24:35.455
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dragon Quest, you know, 8?

01:24:37.677 --> 01:24:37.957
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:24:37.977 --> 01:24:39.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the original of the game?

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:39.879
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

01:24:40.119 --> 01:24:40.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so it won.

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.100
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's awesome.

01:24:42.781 --> 01:24:53.270
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the comment here made by Nintendo UK General Manager David Yarton is, Only Nintendo could make arithmetic fun.

01:24:56.839 --> 01:25:06.143
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we all know Konami made Dancing Fun, and DDR Supernova had its track list revealed earlier this week, and some controversial songs showing up in the game.

01:25:06.183 --> 01:25:11.565
[SPEAKER_05]: The fan community has their panties in a bunch that Fallout Boy is showing up with Dance Dance in the game.

01:25:11.985 --> 01:25:14.546
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, some old fan favorites are coming to the game.

01:25:14.786 --> 01:25:19.768
[SPEAKER_05]: Freckles, which you guys remember from DDR Max, and let's see, we also have some other songs.

01:25:19.808 --> 01:25:22.610
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, Since You've Been Gone by Kelly Clarkson was already announced before.

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:24.030
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this song.

01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:26.191
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't heard this song yet, you really should.

01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:29.571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called The Other Side by Paul Van Dyke featuring Wayne Johnson.

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:30.291
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good one.

01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:32.772
[SPEAKER_05]: Franz Ferdinand would do you want to.

01:25:32.853 --> 01:25:35.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Full song list is available over at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:25:35.794 --> 01:25:36.514
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, get this.

01:25:37.074 --> 01:25:38.895
[SPEAKER_05]: Battle without honor or humanity.

01:25:39.795 --> 01:25:40.576
[SPEAKER_05]: Waka Laka Raining Men

01:26:07.154 --> 01:26:08.997
[SPEAKER_05]: is in the game as well, some old fan favorites.

01:26:09.457 --> 01:26:13.122
[SPEAKER_05]: And some really good contemporary hits as well showing up in the game.

01:26:13.883 --> 01:26:17.068
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we had a Don't Ya by the Pussycat Dolls, a remix showing up there.

01:26:17.668 --> 01:26:20.552
[SPEAKER_05]: We had Free by Blue October, the Liberation mix.

01:26:21.193 --> 01:26:21.293
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

01:26:22.114 --> 01:26:32.657
[SPEAKER_05]: Juno Reactor with Masters of the Universe, Prodigy with No Good, Start the Dance, Oblivion by Never Rocka did that song.

01:26:33.057 --> 01:26:34.838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, no, no, Real Life did Oblivion.

01:26:34.878 --> 01:26:35.838
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Never Rocka mix.

01:26:36.038 --> 01:26:38.039
[SPEAKER_05]: Stray Cats with Rock This Town.

01:26:38.719 --> 01:26:39.319
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

01:26:39.339 --> 01:26:40.220
[SPEAKER_05]: That is very cool.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.520
[SPEAKER_05]: And get this.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:42.400
[SPEAKER_05]: This is so cool.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.881
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you can appreciate this too, DarkSakura.

01:26:46.141 --> 01:26:48.022
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead Man's Party by Oingo Boingo.

01:26:48.042 --> 01:26:48.102
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

01:26:50.976 --> 01:26:51.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that cool?

01:26:52.357 --> 01:26:52.877
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:26:53.718 --> 01:26:54.078
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:26:54.498 --> 01:26:56.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie has like her mouth wide, like jaw on floor.

01:26:56.919 --> 01:26:57.219
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:26:57.419 --> 01:26:57.900
[SPEAKER_05]: What a cool.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:58.640
Rad.

01:26:59.421 --> 01:27:01.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultramix 4 is made of awesome and win.

01:27:01.201 --> 01:27:04.683
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll be playing some of these tracks that perhaps you have not heard yet.

01:27:04.703 --> 01:27:07.185
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't tell you which ones because then I'd be telling you what's on the viewer.

01:27:07.465 --> 01:27:11.627
[SPEAKER_05]: But pretty soon we're going to be playing some of these tracks here on Orange Launch Radio live.

01:27:12.307 --> 01:27:13.268
[SPEAKER_05]: Not during the podcast though.

01:27:13.308 --> 01:27:15.089
[SPEAKER_05]: See orangelaunchradio.com for the details.

01:27:15.789 --> 01:27:17.070
[SPEAKER_05]: That is pretty cool.

01:27:17.264 --> 01:27:25.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of other things that are cool, the cast of Family Guy has signed up to do Voices for a Game.

01:27:26.727 --> 01:27:31.188
[SPEAKER_03]: 2K actually said that the entire cast was signed to do a game that's based on the series.

01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:36.350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be out in the fall, and of course, since it's Family Guy, it will be based on the series.

01:27:39.091 --> 01:27:43.995
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still... Given how some of the Simpsons games have looked out, I'm not sure.

01:27:44.656 --> 01:27:52.982
[SPEAKER_03]: But as it was described, you'll be able to switch back and forth between three characters, which is Peter Griffin, Stewie, and Brian.

01:27:53.503 --> 01:27:53.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

01:27:53.743 --> 01:28:00.168
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I would have thought that you could have switched back and forth between the plot and really obscure pop culture references.

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:01.869
[SPEAKER_04]: That's our show.

01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:05.732
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's actually more characters than that, because I remember seeing a screenshot with...

01:28:07.549 --> 01:28:09.671
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, I'm drawing blanks now.

01:28:10.132 --> 01:28:12.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Their fucking neighbor, the guy with sex craze.

01:28:12.674 --> 01:28:13.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't remember.

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:14.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Chasing after the nurses.

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:18.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're going to be characters you interact with.

01:28:18.861 --> 01:28:21.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not sure, but it's freaking sweet.

01:28:22.024 --> 01:28:24.366
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's coming out actually in October.

01:28:25.307 --> 01:28:26.128
[SPEAKER_04]: October 18th.

01:28:26.929 --> 01:28:28.190
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually pretty sweet.

01:28:29.159 --> 01:28:31.241
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, to be honest though, the game didn't look that good.

01:28:31.562 --> 01:28:32.823
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, it didn't look that good.

01:28:33.544 --> 01:28:43.454
[SPEAKER_04]: But, if that might not be the game for you, you may be a fan of, say, import games such like Disgaea, and I mentioned Disgaea 2 was actually coming out this coming week.

01:28:44.135 --> 01:28:48.199
[SPEAKER_04]: However, though, if you may want something a little bit more portable, well, fear not.

01:28:49.127 --> 01:28:57.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you live in Japan, at least, Disgaea 2, or Disgaea is actually heading to the PSP, so you can check that out.

01:28:57.433 --> 01:29:15.345
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually set to release in Japan on November 30th, and they're going to be offering two packages, one for 4,800 yen, which will be the standard package, and 6,800 yen for a limited edition version, and they haven't really announced yet what's going to be coming out in the limited version, so...

01:29:16.508 --> 01:29:20.969
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe an import, since the PSP is fully region-free.

01:29:21.609 --> 01:29:24.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, it's not uncommon for games to be remade for other systems.

01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:32.592
[SPEAKER_05]: So, one other interesting quote that has people buzzing this week regards GameCube games possibly being remade for the Wii.

01:29:33.132 --> 01:29:41.014
[SPEAKER_05]: A quote from Miyamoto in Nintendo Dream Magazine, quote, I'm also thinking I can remake some of my GameCube games for Wii, making use of the Wiimote.

01:29:41.554 --> 01:29:48.919
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can wander into a second-hand shop and buy a lot of these games still, so I don't think we can release these Wii Makes at a full price.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:55.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Since a lot of the development cost has already been accounted for, we'd be able to release these at a much more affordable price.

01:29:55.384 --> 01:30:01.868
[SPEAKER_05]: And if others also take advantage of this and release Wii Makes, there's a high possibility of a lot of software from third parties as well.

01:30:01.888 --> 01:30:09.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine if, say, for example, I don't know, maybe release Mario Kart Double Dash for the Wii...

01:30:10.034 --> 01:30:11.055
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:25.134 --> 01:30:32.822
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, though, if they could release something, you know, say even just like some of the Luigi's Mansion or something would be perfect for the Wii.

01:30:33.342 --> 01:30:37.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe something like that for like, you know, even 1999 would be pretty cool.

01:30:38.027 --> 01:30:41.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually think that game would be pretty cool with the Wii.

01:30:42.191 --> 01:30:46.895
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think they would probably do a sequel to Luigi's Mansion, more like first person or something.

01:30:47.115 --> 01:30:49.097
[SPEAKER_03]: Luigi's Mansion 2, the non-sucky version.

01:30:49.117 --> 01:30:49.798
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:30:50.339 --> 01:30:51.900
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, well, we'll see what happens with that.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:31:02.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of things that don't suck, DarkSakura likes to surf the web up and down and back and forth every single week and find a website that she loves and adores that she wants to share with you, the listener.

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:05.586
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it DarkSakura's Website of the Week, and here it is.

01:31:09.848 --> 01:31:18.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's Website of the Week is... OtterPops.com Dude, Alexander the Grape!

01:31:19.433 --> 01:31:19.793
I know!

01:31:21.056 --> 01:31:30.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, when I was in middle school in the 80s, we could go by Otter Pops on Friday after P.E.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:37.586
[SPEAKER_05]: You realize that pretty much all Otter Pops are is like a double-strength Kool-Aid that's frozen?

01:31:37.806 --> 01:31:39.127
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, it's so good.

01:31:39.347 --> 01:31:42.249
[SPEAKER_05]: With those stupid little characters on them, like Alexander the Grape?

01:31:42.269 --> 01:31:43.810
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I love them.

01:31:44.010 --> 01:31:44.670
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, who doesn't?

01:31:44.710 --> 01:31:48.733
[SPEAKER_03]: But the site is pretty cool because it has music from the Otter Pop stars.

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:52.493
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can meet the band and fun stuff.

01:31:52.513 --> 01:31:54.114
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually get Otter Pop t-shirts.

01:31:55.075 --> 01:31:56.536
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go on an Otter Pop diet.

01:31:57.876 --> 01:31:59.718
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think I'd lose weight on an Otter Pop diet?

01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:00.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, yes.

01:32:01.098 --> 01:32:04.160
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Sir Isaac Lime help me lose weight?

01:32:04.341 --> 01:32:07.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that I think an Otter Pop is, what, 100 calories?

01:32:07.903 --> 01:32:09.264
[SPEAKER_03]: For you to get...

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:10.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:32:38.027 --> 01:32:40.549
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to have a flat ass like Loki, I need to go on the Otter Pop Diet

01:33:03.447 --> 01:33:21.705
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, I don't have a flat ass I know, that's why I said the earth is as flat as your ass alright, um but no, Otter Pops especially the blue raspberry I really don't know how to do a segment and Otter Pops is all about Pudding Pops Pudding Pops are back!

01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:23.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Pudding Pops.

01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:25.050
[SPEAKER_03]: I miss Pudding Pops.

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:29.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I really don't know how to transition from Otter Pops to this, so I'm just going to say it.

01:33:29.611 --> 01:33:37.953
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy III came out in Japan, and basically it was sold out within 30 minutes of when shops opened for business there.

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:43.054
[SPEAKER_05]: There were lines early in the morning going around the block waiting for this game.

01:33:43.094 --> 01:33:46.735
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a beloved game in the series, Final Fantasy III, so why are you smiling?

01:33:47.035 --> 01:33:50.476
[SPEAKER_04]: It sold out faster than an Otter Pop melting in the summer heat.

01:33:52.282 --> 01:33:53.823
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good connection!

01:34:12.839 --> 01:34:17.384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, people line up for all those movies and stuff, but you don't really have that same crate.

01:34:17.404 --> 01:34:19.285
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess there was Xbox 360.

01:34:19.325 --> 01:34:20.046
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty nutty.

01:34:20.086 --> 01:34:21.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait for Halo 3.

01:34:21.688 --> 01:34:22.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Jesus.

01:34:22.749 --> 01:34:26.593
[SPEAKER_03]: On September 9th, 1999, I was in line for a Dreamcast.

01:34:26.713 --> 01:34:28.014
[SPEAKER_05]: With nine other people?

01:34:28.394 --> 01:34:28.554
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:34:29.415 --> 01:34:30.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

01:34:50.987 --> 01:34:52.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Blizzard!

01:35:18.623 --> 01:35:20.917
[SPEAKER_05]: Please put Pandarins in the next expansion.

01:35:21.179 --> 01:35:22.044
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, Skye.

01:35:22.523 --> 01:35:22.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:23.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Hugs and kisses.

01:35:24.605 --> 01:35:27.247
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost quit World of Warcraft.

01:35:49.687 --> 01:35:51.388
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jamie's going to quit World of Warcraft.

01:35:51.408 --> 01:35:51.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know what?

01:35:51.989 --> 01:35:54.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fuck Final Fantasy XI, Phantasy Star Universe for a little while for me.

01:35:54.551 --> 01:35:59.234
[SPEAKER_04]: And Phantasy Star Universe, no cost to you as far as online goes because it's going to be over live.

01:35:59.835 --> 01:36:01.376
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I love you, Sega.

01:36:01.876 --> 01:36:02.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

01:36:02.436 --> 01:36:04.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega is still our friend.

01:36:04.698 --> 01:36:05.379
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Sega.

01:36:05.919 --> 01:36:07.180
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I assume it's no cost.

01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:09.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming because they have dedicated servers and stuff.

01:36:10.142 --> 01:36:13.785
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be wrong, but I'm assuming it's no cost because it's over live and stuff like that.

01:36:14.165 --> 01:36:15.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think I'm going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

01:36:15.765 --> 01:36:16.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't hold me to that.

01:36:17.146 --> 01:36:17.686
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, alright.

01:36:17.886 --> 01:36:19.867
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the interim I am going to go back to playing Blue Burst.

01:36:20.647 --> 01:36:25.468
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, I guess there is the PC version and they're not dedicated servers.

01:36:25.488 --> 01:36:31.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the, again, because now when Miklatov tries to pressure me to go back to Final Fantasy XI, I'm just going to say, look, Phantasy Star, look, I can't, I can't.

01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:32.750
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll quit too when Phantasy Star comes out.

01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:33.670
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have to go back to PS Opium.

01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:34.631
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for a month.

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:39.184
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to start the OL Army Guild on Phantasy Star Universe.

01:36:39.204 --> 01:36:40.785
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be tons of fun.

01:36:40.925 --> 01:36:44.808
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to join the OL Army on any, a variety of games, it's growing and growing.

01:36:44.828 --> 01:36:45.789
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be Saints Row.

01:36:45.809 --> 01:36:47.189
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting a gang in Saints Row.

01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:48.991
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Saints Row is going to be fun as well.

01:36:49.991 --> 01:36:53.173
[SPEAKER_05]: And Saints Row is a game that I fucking own at, so you know what?

01:36:53.313 --> 01:36:53.734
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

01:36:53.754 --> 01:36:53.974
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't.

01:36:53.994 --> 01:36:54.494
[SPEAKER_05]: Them's fighting.

01:36:54.694 --> 01:36:58.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're going to throw down the challenge to Scott and actually play this time?

01:36:58.977 --> 01:36:59.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:04.601
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do death matches by myself because I can guarantee that I will be there, but I can't guarantee a team...

01:37:05.021 --> 01:37:05.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:37:24.975 --> 01:37:25.155
[SPEAKER_04]: RoboTron

01:37:52.797 --> 01:37:53.998
[SPEAKER_04]: is the thought here.

01:37:54.158 --> 01:37:57.459
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes from actually Xbox 365.

01:37:57.999 --> 01:38:00.440
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess we'll find out in a couple weeks.

01:38:01.481 --> 01:38:03.061
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's something very interesting.

01:38:03.222 --> 01:38:09.444
[SPEAKER_04]: If you pre-order Elebits, one of the fun little prizes that you're going to get is a stuffed Elebit.

01:38:10.325 --> 01:38:12.025
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little plushy thing for you.

01:38:14.656 --> 01:38:20.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was pretty much my... Oh, I wanted to mention real quick, actually, I got a few more, I forgot.

01:38:20.821 --> 01:38:24.584
[SPEAKER_04]: Crackdown, that game's going to be coming out, actually, November 1st.

01:38:25.405 --> 01:38:30.329
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got some pretty cool stuff that they're going to be offering as downloadable content.

01:38:30.949 --> 01:38:36.234
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that they're talking about is an instant replay, kind of...

01:38:37.765 --> 01:38:38.325
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:56.913
[SPEAKER_04]: and because they built the game with that kind of stuff in mind.

01:38:57.974 --> 01:39:16.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other things, if you aren't getting cracked down and happen to pick up a box of cereal, Kellogg's is packing some really crappy Xbox minigames that you can check out, including Spaceship Blaster, Motorcycle Madness, Disco Mania, Robo Blast, and Mystic Castle, which I'm sure...

01:39:17.219 --> 01:39:18.040
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:39:32.572 --> 01:39:52.807
[SPEAKER_04]: including, of course, Richard Lotax from Something Awful, and Cool News writer Jeff Snyder, Horror Magazine, Rue Morgue writer Chris Alexander, and a fifth opponent who, it says, and this is from GameSpot, has a reason to believe is a minor.

01:39:53.328 --> 01:39:55.169
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Uwe Boll is beating up children.

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:55.909
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

01:39:57.411 --> 01:39:58.171
[SPEAKER_03]: Still a loser.

01:39:59.052 --> 01:39:59.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

01:40:00.293 --> 01:40:02.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I actually have a couple of stories.

01:40:02.875 --> 01:40:11.121
[SPEAKER_03]: As they applied to our European listeners, Microsoft actually cut the Xbox 360 core unit to 199 pounds.

01:40:13.283 --> 01:40:15.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

01:40:15.444 --> 01:40:16.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.

01:40:17.246 --> 01:40:19.608
[SPEAKER_03]: That actually was effective as of today.

01:40:20.108 --> 01:40:21.509
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say yesterday.

01:40:21.529 --> 01:40:22.610
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 pounds lighter.

01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:24.371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on a diet.

01:40:24.571 --> 01:40:25.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:40:26.779 --> 01:40:31.022
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, they've dropped the retail price so that it would sell a little bit better, I suppose.

01:40:31.983 --> 01:40:36.927
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I believe that I read this right, is that Eurogamer.de has launched.

01:40:39.049 --> 01:40:44.313
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our German friends, there's some good info there.

01:40:44.333 --> 01:40:47.956
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have pictures of Silent Hill Origins up there as well.

01:40:48.456 --> 01:40:51.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I can read German, but I do not understand it.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.181
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what an estet is, though.

01:40:55.618 --> 01:41:04.379
[SPEAKER_03]: The little B thing, it goes... But I took German for three weeks and then had to change classes.

01:41:06.341 --> 01:41:09.964
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one last piece of news, and it's actually regarding Phantasy Star Universe.

01:41:10.004 --> 01:41:10.865
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming from the chat room.

01:41:11.846 --> 01:41:15.168
[SPEAKER_05]: John F. is in chat right now, and he's like a guru on Phantasy Star Universe.

01:41:15.849 --> 01:41:17.070
[SPEAKER_05]: He's saying about the pricing.

01:41:17.530 --> 01:41:18.731
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unknown right now about the 360.

01:41:19.152 --> 01:41:23.275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rumored that Sega's trying to work it out with Microsoft right now on the pricing.

01:41:23.555 --> 01:41:29.721
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a monthly payment for the PS2 and Windows version, but if you just want to play story mode and extra mode, there's no fee there.

01:41:30.301 --> 01:41:31.202
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just an FYI.

01:41:31.222 --> 01:41:34.845
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually how PSO was, though, on Xbox.

01:41:35.693 --> 01:41:39.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Until their billing messed up and a lot of people got their accounts for free.

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:40.074
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

01:41:40.954 --> 01:41:45.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Kasumi19, Julie, she didn't pay for PSO for three years.

01:41:46.216 --> 01:41:47.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

01:41:48.756 --> 01:41:50.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:41:51.117 --> 01:41:51.957
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to do it.

01:41:51.997 --> 01:41:53.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, no Part B this week, folks.

01:41:53.938 --> 01:41:55.578
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mini-episode because we're pre-taping.

01:41:55.618 --> 01:41:58.099
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see you back here with a full episode next week, though.

01:41:58.119 --> 01:41:58.939
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be a fun time.

01:41:58.979 --> 01:42:00.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Power previews start next week.

01:42:00.139 --> 01:42:00.679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be fun.

01:42:01.099 --> 01:42:01.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, final thought.

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.560
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to play lots of Saints Row this weekend.

01:42:04.882 --> 01:42:07.863
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is I need to hurry up and schedule my next Street Fighter 2 match.

01:42:08.084 --> 01:42:11.245
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot I was in that tournament until like two seconds ago when Arcade came up.

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:12.686
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:18.008
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been telling everybody give me money for Christmas so that I can buy a premium annual pass for Disneyland.

01:42:19.128 --> 01:42:19.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:42:19.489 --> 01:42:20.889
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want for Christmas from everybody.

01:42:21.469 --> 01:42:21.730
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:22.930
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see if she gets it.

01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:24.291
[SPEAKER_05]: Till next time.

01:42:24.331 --> 01:42:25.251
[SPEAKER_03]: And reject false icons.

01:42:25.731 --> 01:42:26.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Till next time.

01:42:26.512 --> 01:42:28.773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys so much for downloading us and tuning in to us.

01:42:29.093 --> 01:42:32.114
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate you guys listening to us and supporting Independent Radio.

01:42:32.134 --> 01:42:33.035
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are awesome.

01:42:33.055 --> 01:42:34.055
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

01:42:34.551 --> 01:42:38.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay great throughout the week and we'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio.
