A recent horror game causes controversy in Rome

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We are that video game radio program

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And tonight's probably going to be a little bit of randomness too

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Because we have a very very full house

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Say hi everyone

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hi

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We've got a very full house tonight

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Obviously it's a big big week for gaming

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So let's get right into it

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
First let's introduce ourselves

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm one of your co-hosts

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Rob Roberts

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Say hello as well to Miss Dark Sakura

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Jamie Summers

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Bwar

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How you doing?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So freaking worn out

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're worn out?

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're tired?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Exhausted?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well somebody was asleep in his warm bed

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright we'll get to that in a minute

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How you doing sir?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm doing fine

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Alright, right on

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Joining us tonight

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We have a variety of special guests

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
First let's introduce those folks that you know

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You've met before

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And you know quite well

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Say hello over there to Drunami

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's up?

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Or as he might be called tonight

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Drunawee

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't know

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Wee

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Say hello to the Orange Lounge Radio

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
One and only lesbian

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Say hello to Chris

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The official lesbian

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The official lesbian

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well you have to share that title with Magsy

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's the roaming lesbian

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She's the roaming?

58
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm the in-house lesbian

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh I see

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're our in-house

61
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She's our field lesbian

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah she's the field lesbian

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
From the far off land of Wisconsin

64
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Or the Isle of Lesbos

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
As I was saying over dinner

66
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright anyway

68
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Also say hello to somebody who's come from a long way away

69
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Certainly not the Isle of Lesbos

70
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But the Isle of Redmond Washington

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Say hello to Mr. DMN John

72
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hi everybody

73
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And you guys know John

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Because he calls into our show like all the freaking time

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh I don't

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And yes you do

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And now he's here in studio

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
With us

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm gonna

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm actually gonna call

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When the sky blinds open

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What

85
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm gonna do it right now hold on

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No no no no no

87
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No no no

88
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day

89
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And where do you work for our first time?

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I work at the magical land where Wii's flow like wine Nintendo

92
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Really?

93
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes

94
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Last I checked

95
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I sometimes have Wii flow when I drink a lot of wine but I don't

96
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alright forget it bad joke

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days

98
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're all gonna just die

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So anyway well welcome to the show DMN

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you thank you for having me

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And you know just having him here in the studio

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And like hanging out with us all weekend

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It just proves Orange Launch Radio listeners

104
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Stalking us works

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It really does

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here he is

108
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And he violated me last night

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And it was no I'm just kidding

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm totally chill

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's not what you said

112
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You were

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You were

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can I say that?

115
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And it's a family show boys and girls

116
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sort of

117
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I know it's not really

118
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No it's not

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alright look

120
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know we might have gotten some new listeners this week

121
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You know not just because you know iTunes

122
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And all the great reviews you guys have been leaving for us there

123
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I've been you know up in our ranking and stuff

124
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And XB stream and the cool people over there at us

125
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Default podcasts

126
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just everywhere else we've been listed

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And then locally this week we got some support as well

128
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll talk about that in a little bit

129
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So if you're new to Orange Launch Radio

130
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And want to say hey and welcome

131
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And we're just a program

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We go on for like two and a half three hours

133
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We're gamers just like the rest of you guys

134
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We don't get paid for this

135
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
At least not yet

136
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We've been doing this almost five years

137
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In May it'll be five years

138
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So about four and a half years we've been doing this

139
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We started as a program dedicated to

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Dance Dance Revolution

141
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And music based video games

142
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Parappa amplitude things of that nature

143
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But you know we found that

144
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It kind of ended up being a little too limiting

145
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Especially when there was a very slow period

146
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Think of the period before DDR Supernova

147
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Before Guitar Hero

148
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There was a very slow period of music gaming

149
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So we thought you know we're video game nuts first

150
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So we started doing a general video game show

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So that's where we're at now

152
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Because we're all nerds

153
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And we invite you guys to be nerdy with us

154
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So please come to our chat room

155
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you're listening to us live here on Sunday night

156
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If you're not listening to us on our audio blog

157
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You can come join us in the chat room

158
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's chat.orangelaunchradio.com

159
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And guess what

160
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you're listening live on this Sunday night

161
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You definitely want to be here tonight

162
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because DMN what did you bring with you

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
For one of our random chatters tonight?

164
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I brought a Wii

165
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not my Wii you sickos

166
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Get your head out of the gutter

167
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No a Wii and a box with the Wii Sports

168
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And all that fun stuff

169
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And I do know we have a worldwide audience

170
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But it should be said

171
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is a US region Wii

172
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah this is a region one Wii

173
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I'm really sorry to all you

174
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Japanese, South American, Antarctica

175
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
European listeners

176
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It probably won't do you much good

177
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But if you want to win it that badly

178
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You gotta be in chat

179
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's gonna be at some point tonight

180
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
More rules to come later

181
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But first

182
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We usually start off the show with a little bit of

183
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How was your gaming week

184
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted

185
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
By other madness going on out there

186
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And that would be the craziness going on around

187
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The Playstation 3 and Wii lineups

188
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So first off, Playstation 3

189
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know a lot of us here in this room

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Weren't really gonna do the campout thing

191
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
For the Playstation 3

192
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You know I've voiced previously on the program

193
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not ready for Playstation 3

194
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's just there's no game out right now

195
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I really want

196
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wake me when Metal Gear Solid 4

197
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Final Fantasy 13

198
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Some of the big franchises are on their way

199
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But I'm not into PS3 right now

200
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think Loki's in a very similar camp

201
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But DarkSakura has expressed on a previous show

202
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That she was already signed up

203
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thanks to her husband for a Playstation 3

204
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So what happened?

205
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How did that go down?

206
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Did he just bring it home magically one day

207
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Or did you guys wait anywhere?

208
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No because it was an employee purchase

209
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's gonna be on the next shipment

210
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Which is fair

211
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You know he got to reserve it first

212
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We were guaranteed one

213
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But now Dan's like

214
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Maybe I'm just gonna cancel my reserve

215
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm like the hell you will

216
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait you see

217
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't understand DarkSakura

218
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Cause you tend to go back and forth

219
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're like some days you're very anti-PlayStation

220
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Some days you're very like

221
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You better bring me that damn Playstation

222
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No

223
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I hate it okay

224
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I hate it

225
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I have to have every video game system

226
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That comes out

227
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I see

228
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it's the collector in me that says

229
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want

230
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And besides that I'm gonna play White Knights

231
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When it's out

232
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And

233
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why the hate for Sony Playstation right now?

234
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cause Ken Kuragi eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet

235
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And is leased to the jungle gym

236
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I see

237
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I see

238
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you Magsy

239
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But certain games are gonna change your mind

240
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Like White Knights and things are gonna change your mind later

241
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well White Knights I definitely wanna play

242
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There's a few other things that I'm sorta curious about

243
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But right now not curious enough

244
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That I would go out and wait in line for a PS3

245
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date

246
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wow

247
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm going to interview him Monday

248
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Was your coworker

249
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Now was your coworker

250
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now this is a lot of controversy going around around the Playstation 3 launch

251
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Did your coworker actually wait in the line to get a Playstation 3 to play

252
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Or were they getting one to sell

253
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He was getting one to play

254
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh well that's admirable

255
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He got Madden

256
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay I see

257
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So sports game fan you know obviously

258
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah I can see that if you're a hardcore sports game

259
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You wanna have the up graphics and all that cool stuff

260
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That comes with you know the new system

261
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay I see that

262
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Alright so more to come on Playstation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers

263
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And you know I can say this

264
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I did touch the demo station they had at Target

265
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I randomly went to Target on I think it was Wednesday I went there

266
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wednesday night I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house

267
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like shampoo and stuff

268
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And there was already a line forming for the Playstation 3

269
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And I just said hi

270
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I was like Playstation 3 right

271
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They're all yeah

272
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So you know they were you know having fun just camping out

273
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't ask the eBay question but I went in the store

274
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And they actually had a demo station there to play

275
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So I picked up MotorStorm

276
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And just played that a little bit

277
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And I gotta be honest guys I'm not feeling it

278
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it

279
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I mean again I'm playing this in a Target

280
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm not sitting down on my couch

281
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My you know surround and the HD and all that stuff

282
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I just I wasn't feeling it

283
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I feel like I don't know burnouts more of a racer for me

284
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or even test drive was better

285
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I just wasn't feeling the MotorStorm

286
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I mean granted it's a different

287
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's you know a very different type of racer

288
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
But even it felt kind of slow to me

289
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Kind of clunky I don't know

290
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I wasn't really feeling the love with MotorStorm

291
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry to say

292
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I did see the basketball game which is NBA 07 yes

293
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And that looked very nice

294
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I thought it was a very good looking game

295
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And pretty slick

296
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So if I were going to be getting a Playstation 3 at launch

297
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That would because you know I like basketball more than any other sport

298
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That probably is the game I would pick up

299
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It would be that game but

300
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah well I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards

301
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The sports gamers and the hardcore

302
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Because you usually see the people who

303
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Especially the sports games who just come

304
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And will buy it without hesitation

305
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
They always have the stupid Madden day

306
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where people I've heard camp out for it

307
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If that is the case

308
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's kind of sad but

309
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah I see your point

310
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well so that was pretty much Playstation 3

311
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Loki did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week

312
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Did you play a demo station or anything

313
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I watched I went by the best buy actually

314
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Today it was funny because I went down there

315
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And it was completely dead and the station was open

316
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I saw MotorStorm but I mean it looks exactly the same

317
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
When I saw it at E3

318
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Although the videos I've seen online look really cool

319
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it made me want to get it at some point

320
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But I don't know

321
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Then we saw that lair demonstration thing going on

322
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
At Walmart that was frozen on Saturday

323
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So yeah I don't really know

324
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How well the demo kiosks were working

325
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen

326
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So I don't know

327
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Alright well let's go to the chat room

328
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Over at chat.orangelandtrader.com

329
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
For some comments from our chatters

330
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're like the invisible guests

331
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We love to be an interactive show

332
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there

333
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's see

334
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
JeremyTau1 says

335
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mirror toy?

336
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Not when there's a profit to be made

337
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
As some people found out with Playstation 3

338
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That was really their mirror motivation

339
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's like hey I make more money doing this than I do at my job

340
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know

341
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Me personally I don't know

342
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The little angel that sits on my shoulder says

343
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Not a good idea

344
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So I don't do it

345
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things

346
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
BlackLab in our chat room says

347
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot

348
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We have some crazy news about those Playstation 3 lines

349
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We'll get to a little bit later

350
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay so after the Playstation 3 launch

351
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Obviously then the Wii line started forming

352
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And that's kind of where we come in

353
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because I think we've also voiced previously on the program

354
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That we have played Wii

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wii is the cheaper option

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And as we said earlier in the program

357
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You know we do this show as a hobby not a job

358
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So you know our day jobs only give us so much money

359
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So the Wii is really realistically

360
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
In my eyes the more affordable console anyway

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up

362
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But Loki you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii

363
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You had a Wii before a lot of people did

364
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How did this happen?

365
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because I work for a video and game distributor

366
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And of course we get ours in early

367
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Like on Wednesdays when we got them in

368
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So that we could ship them to our customers

369
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So that they would have them for the street date

370
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And me being the greedy bastard that I am

371
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City

372
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And so I had mine on Thursday

373
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And playing it ever since

374
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So you know what this meant boys and girls

375
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Party at Loki's house on Friday

376
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So right on

377
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So yeah we played a little bit of the Wii there

378
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So then flash forward to last night

379
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When the real camping started

380
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Some of us were at dinner

381
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And we were at Strings

382
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And this little local Italian place

383
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I keep forgetting we're an international show

384
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So not everybody knows that

385
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And we were just sitting around

386
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I don't know like lightning just kind of struck

387
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And we were just kind of like

388
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Dude let's go like buy cookies and orange soda

389
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And go around to lines and just hand out goodies

390
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's just go and like talk to gamers

391
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And Loki can tape it

392
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Maybe we can do a YouTube thing

393
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And we'll just hand him stuff

394
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because you know you read all those reports

395
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
About people getting shot and stuff

396
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line

397
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That a lot more people were being very cordial

398
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So we were like

399
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's go have fun

400
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's go meet some more nerds

401
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So we did

402
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We hit up

403
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We started at a local Target

404
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We went to a Walmart

405
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We went to GameStop

406
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Where people were lining up for the midnight launch

407
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That they already had pre-ordered

408
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We went to another Target

409
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The Great Land or Super Target

410
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Whatever it's called

411
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We went to like a Best Buy

412
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Circuit City

413
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We went all around

414
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We went to Toys R Us too

415
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That was fun

416
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah the one guy at Toys R Us

417
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That looked very scary

418
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He was like throw the cookie and drive

419
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
DMN what did you think about our little experience

420
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Doing the Cookie Patrol?

421
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought that was a lot of fun

422
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You got to interact with a lot of people

423
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii

424
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I honestly think that most of those people in that line

425
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Were there to play it

426
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Not to eBay it

427
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Where as opposed to the PS3 people

428
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Are thinking

429
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh I can make double what I bought off this

430
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line

431
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A lot of these people were really good in line

432
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
They had a lot of fun

433
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
They seemed to be very grateful for the cookies

434
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So if any of you are listening

435
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hi and we love you

436
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Alright very cool

437
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So anyway

438
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
One of our favorite lines

439
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Now we liked a lot of the people that we met

440
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I mean it was kind of weird

441
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Because we would walk up at first

442
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And some people were like

443
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are these guys going to do to us

444
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do they have BB guns

445
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Or what's going to happen

446
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're poisoning the cookies Rob

447
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're poisoning the cookies

448
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So you can get your weegee

449
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That was my running joke throughout the whole night

450
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is that people went you know

451
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'd say oh the cookie

452
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The arsenic in the cookies

453
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Will kick in about 15 minutes

454
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Have your wallets out

455
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Wait wait wait

456
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Arsenic?

457
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I thought it was laxative

458
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Whatever it was I don't know

459
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Whatever the joke was

460
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So we went to all these people

461
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We met a lot of great people

462
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But we

463
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know what it was

464
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
About the line to target Great Land

465
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But maybe it was the fact that like

466
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Somebody in that line there

467
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Actually listened to the program

468
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And like knew who we were

469
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And that was kind of cool

470
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And then there was just a

471
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Like there was another girl

472
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That you ended up giving your hat to

473
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right

474
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Even though everybody everywhere

475
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Was asking for your wee hat

476
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My jacket too

477
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
God

478
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What made you give it to that girl

479
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
She seemed really genuinely interested in the wee

480
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And she seemed pretty hardcore

481
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right on

482
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah she was

483
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And so getting back into this

484
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where Chris and Jamie

485
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No it's cool it's cool

486
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So I called Jamie on my phone

487
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Because I really

488
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I asked the target Great Land line

489
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I go

490
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How many units are you guys getting here

491
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And they're like 60

492
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And I'm looking at the line

493
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm like

494
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's only like 25 people in this line

495
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is like a great opportunity to line up

496
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I called Jamie on my cell

497
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I said

498
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Girl if you want a wee

499
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Get your butt down here

500
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can get a wee

501
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So what happened

502
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I interrupted something you were doing

503
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Somebody else had

504
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This was just basically me being exhausted already

505
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And somebody else said

506
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Oh yeah

507
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The target Great Lands are doing

508
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The target Great Lands are doing a midnight launch

509
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Which part of my brain went bullshit

510
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But the rest of me was so tired

511
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That I was like

512
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah I'm gonna go

513
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
We were actually

514
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My friend Marissa

515
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Who I mentioned on the show a few times

516
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
She was in town

517
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And she's a singer-songwriter from LA

518
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And there was a

519
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Singer-songwriter convention going on

520
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Just actually a few

521
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
At the

522
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What was it

523
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The Marriott

524
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah the Marriott

525
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It was the Marriott

526
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Chris we don't need to tell them all where I live

527
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sorry

528
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's alright

529
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So we were

530
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You know we were exhausted

531
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It was very claustrophobic

532
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They had blocked off an entire section

533
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Just for the musicians

534
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And everyone was like

535
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh man

536
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then Jamie calls me on my phone

537
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
She's like

538
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Where are you

539
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm like

540
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm at the end of the hall

541
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
She's like

542
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We need to go to Target

543
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Right now

544
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm like

545
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Are you sick or something

546
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I was just like

547
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Where am I gonna get a wee

548
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm like

549
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay

550
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And since I'm hanging out with her

551
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I kind of

552
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She's my ride

553
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And I wasn't really expecting

554
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
To get one

555
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And part of me was excited too

556
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
About because Megsy called earlier

557
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Oh yeah Megsy

558
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
And was humping her wee

559
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah she's like

560
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm touching it

561
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm touching it

562
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ah

563
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That was her on the phone

564
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It was really really funny

565
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Funny enough that's not the first time they had that conversation

566
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,000
I was getting all excited and all that

567
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So we

568
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You had wee fever

569
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We ran down there

570
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Weaver fever

571
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We pulled up to the

572
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Weevil

573
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We pulled up to the line

574
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And Jamie rolled down the window

575
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And screamed out

576
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Orange Little Dream

577
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And someone at the front yelled

578
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Dark Sakura

579
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was really really funny

580
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And then she parked and said

581
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Can we hang out with you guys

582
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And then someone like

583
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She wasn't really in the zone

584
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So let me clarify

585
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Dark Sakura used her celebrity to cut in line

586
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yeah

587
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You're a bitch Jamie

588
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm not a bitch

589
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No no

590
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She wouldn't have done it if

591
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I mean they were getting 60

592
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And there was only like 20 people in line

593
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So you know nobody was getting hurt so

594
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But we ended up going there

595
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And slowly it dawned on me

596
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is not a midnight launch

597
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Cause it was like a half an hour till midnight

598
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was like 1130 something

599
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And it was

600
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And Jamie

601
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm like Jamie

602
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This isn't a midnight launch

603
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
She's like

604
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not

605
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So we ended up

606
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I was

607
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I was

608
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Again already tired of having been around that many people

609
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It was really claustrophobic

610
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We were with Marissa

611
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But we jumbled things around

612
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We ended up

613
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What we were gonna do

614
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is we were gonna go back

615
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wait with them until morning

616
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is like at one o'clock

617
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
We were gonna wait with them

618
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
And then at one point

619
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was gonna go for coffee and donuts

620
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Which started off really weird

621
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I just like

622
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Cause we had to leave and go get stuff

623
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And I'm like

624
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Does anybody want anything while I'm gone?

625
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And someone's like

626
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The eyes kind of looked and went

627
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Huh?

628
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Someone's getting something?

629
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm like

630
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Does anyone want coffee?

631
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
And everybody went

632
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Me?

633
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think one thing we've kind of discovered

634
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Through this whole process

635
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Is that

636
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
People are really not used to

637
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Other people just wanting to do nice things for them

638
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Everyone was so shocked

639
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That I offered to get

640
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Someone actually brought up their money

641
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm like

642
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No no it's on me

643
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And they're like all

644
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They looked at me with like the weirdest look

645
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Like I was giving them a razor

646
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It was so

647
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah that kind of razor

648
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like killing killing yourself razor

649
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Not the phone

650
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But it's

651
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So

652
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah

653
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
By the time we got back

654
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And we waited for

655
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Until like

656
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Like 3.30

657
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I said

658
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Alright I'm gonna go get coffee

659
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I counted how many people were in line

660
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
And it was like

661
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Something like

662
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Just under 30

663
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But to be safe I said 35

664
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
So I went to the shell station

665
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Down the street

666
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And said

667
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I need 35 cups of coffee

668
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And they

669
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They gave me

670
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They gave me free

671
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A powdered creamer

672
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And free sugar

673
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You know the stuff that they have

674
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
For that store only

675
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
For the shell station

676
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Cause like if you buy

677
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
35 cups of coffee

678
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You get this free

679
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm like

680
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay

681
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So

682
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I got some other creamer

683
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
And I came back

684
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
And everyone was like

685
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh coffee

686
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
They were really really really happy

687
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm like courtesy

688
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Of Orange Land Jameo

689
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yeah nice pimping for the show by the way

690
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Props to Chris

691
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I mean she

692
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
She did this for no reason

693
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Other than she just thought it would be fun

694
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
To just buy people coffee

695
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's actually the reason why I was in line

696
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Is I was looking forward to the fact

697
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Actually I was really tired

698
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I was more tired than Jamie

699
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm like

700
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Do I really want to wait outside

701
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But then I offered to get coffee

702
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And it's just the light in people's eyes

703
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Went

704
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And so I said

705
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay I get coffee

706
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But it didn't end there

707
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Because you got doughnuts too

708
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How did you

709
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I got crispy

710
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I got

711
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I got six

712
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well what happened was

713
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I had bought too much coffee

714
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And right

715
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There's

716
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where the Target is

717
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There's a Best Buy

718
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Just like

719
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
In the same parking structure

720
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
So I'm like

721
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well I've got too much coffee

722
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So I'm gonna go see if they want some coffee

723
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And sure enough

724
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The

725
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh my gosh

726
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That line

727
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah when we went to Best Buy

728
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
With the cookies

729
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They were running from the back

730
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
To the front

731
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm like

732
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Dude we're gonna come up the line

733
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They were cool

734
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I like the Best Buy line too

735
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They had a big sign that said

736
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We spawn's here

737
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I asked the guy

738
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm like

739
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What the hell does that mean

740
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And they're like

741
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Get it

742
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Because it's gonna spawn here

743
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
In a couple hours

744
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm like

745
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh my god

746
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Meanwhile

747
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
And I thought

748
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I was a nerd for doing a radio program

749
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
On the internet

750
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Meanwhile while Chris is running around

751
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
In my car

752
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Which I'm like

753
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
My baby

754
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Your baby's fine

755
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Some kid asked to borrow my DS

756
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And then I pulled up my micro

757
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
To play

758
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh can I play your micro

759
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What's this

760
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
So I had to explain the micro

761
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a dead system basically

762
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Here

763
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And play

764
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have Puzzle Fighter

765
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What else do you have

766
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Uh

767
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I have Kingdom Hearts

768
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I wanna play Puzzle Fighter

769
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts

770
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Anyway

771
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So uh

772
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah

773
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So I got too much coffee

774
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I went over to the Best Buy line

775
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And they swarmed me

776
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm like

777
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm coming back

778
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I had to make

779
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I think five trips

780
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
To Shell Station

781
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Oh my god

782
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
To get that much cups of coffee

783
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And then I'm like

784
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Does it

785
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then I called out

786
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Does anyone want donuts

787
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone perked up

788
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Donuts

789
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There was a security guard at Best Buy

790
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And he was like

791
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh can you get me the cream filled one

792
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The security guard was so cute

793
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He looked so tired

794
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And he's like

795
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh he's like

796
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Can you get me a coffee

797
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm like

798
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yeah I'm coming back with more

799
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And um

800
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
People just liked it

801
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I bought six dozen donuts

802
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And six dozen plus one for the guard

803
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I got the little

804
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I made sure I got him the cream

805
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That is so cute

806
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And all the time I said

807
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio

808
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You gave mad pimpage to our show Chris

809
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And for that we love you

810
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But you weren't doing it just

811
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean

812
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The promo for the show was just a bonus right

813
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah well I was

814
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You know I'm not really on this show that often

815
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge

816
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Because I was hanging out with Jamie

817
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And I really wanted to you know

818
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's like you guys have been sweet to me

819
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So I figured hey you know

820
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's like I'm doing something nice

821
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm here representing your show

822
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So here by from here on out folks

823
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We're gonna refer to Chris as Saint Chris

824
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Because she

825
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No she did this out of the goodness of our she

826
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
She went and got donuts and coffee

827
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
For two lines

828
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Of people waiting for the wee

829
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So a little gesture goes a long way

830
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
So good for you Chris

831
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We love you

832
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
They look so cool

833
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But they looked at me crazy

834
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Some guy went up to me and goes

835
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Why are you doing this

836
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And this is like

837
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Well you guys look cold

838
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The goodness of my heart

839
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Doesn't factor in at all

840
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But you know

841
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Guys there's a couple old people

842
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
In the Best Buy line

843
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And they were so grateful for that coffee

844
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It made my day

845
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Dude one guy in the Great Land line

846
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Had a beer

847
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I saw that

848
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Somebody offered it back

849
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There was a guy there who said

850
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey he's really cool

851
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know we were talking about like

852
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
ThinkGeek and different t-shirts

853
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And you know

854
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The joys of Firefox

855
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
And he's like

856
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I got some beer if you want some

857
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
And I was like

858
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What kind?

859
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Bass

860
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Oooh

861
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Because for anyone who doesn't know

862
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I love beer a lot

863
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And I'm trying to cut down on my beer

864
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Consumption

865
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So I was sorely tempted

866
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I was like

867
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Bass

868
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I love you

869
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Give me beer

870
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh wait no

871
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Because the whole problem with that is

872
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The guys are going around the corner to pee

873
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't have the equipment

874
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
To go around the corner and pee

875
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Well you could

876
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
No

877
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But it's just not a cemetery

878
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No

879
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay I'm in an awkward position on the floor

880
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Right next to Rob's legs

881
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But somebody in the chatroom asked me

882
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
How much money I spent

883
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't tell who that is

884
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I

885
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Footy something?

886
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oh footy monster probably

887
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Footy monster

888
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They asked me how much money I spent

889
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Enough

890
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Enough

891
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was my money though

892
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
So Orange Lounge will continue to

893
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Spend all of the money that they get

894
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
On our crackin' booths

895
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
On your crackin' booths

896
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I would also like to add something

897
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's kind of funny

898
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
According to nextgenwars.com

899
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Uh

900
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It looks like Wii is beating up PlayStation 3

901
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well they have more units at launch

902
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I mean that's kind of

903
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I mean to be fair

904
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Well they

905
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I mean they've basically got a greater market share

906
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well we'll see

907
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
We'll see

908
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I mean we'll see

909
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's still a long ways to go

910
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's still a long ways to go

911
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I mean I'm not

912
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm just trying to be fair

913
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Extifer I brought you in for a minute

914
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
My roommate Extifer

915
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Who's co-host on the Wednesday show

916
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Who's a little sick from camping out

917
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
All this morning

918
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yeah

919
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Now you went and met

920
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Jamie

921
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And Chris at one point

922
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I slept in his car

923
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I did

924
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was hopped up on AMD

925
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
That's fine

926
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
At the time

927
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
No

928
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Extifer was really cool

929
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because I had pretty much

930
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Roto

931
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I didn't feel like camping out

932
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I was like

933
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know

934
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I like my warm bed

935
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'll just pick up a Wii

936
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
At the second shipment

937
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They're gonna keep coming

938
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm cool

939
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But Extifer was like

940
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'll get him out

941
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you want one

942
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm like

943
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay

944
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Here's money

945
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Have fun

946
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So you did it

947
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I love spending money

948
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
When it's somebody else's

949
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I do

950
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I found that

951
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Spending money

952
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
When it's not your own

953
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Is very

954
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a very nice thing

955
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Now

956
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Before I forget

957
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
By the way

958
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Bandit sent me the link

959
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay

960
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I gotta start wrapping this up

961
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So we can keep getting into game news

962
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But

963
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I've heard on other podcasts

964
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I wanna say it was

965
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
It was one of the other all game shows

966
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I wanna say it was

967
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Alon from Chatterbox

968
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I apologize if I'm misappropriating this

969
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
But

970
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
He had a horrible target experience

971
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
With the Xbox 360

972
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Like

973
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
They gave out tickets

974
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And didn't even honor him

975
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And all this junk

976
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So

977
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I have to admit

978
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You hearing these stories on the internet

979
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
About stores that had failed launches previously

980
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Made me a little bit nervous

981
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But

982
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You came back

983
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You walked through the door

984
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And you were like

985
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I love Target

986
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I love Target

987
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What made it so great

988
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What happened

989
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
How did it go down

990
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
First of all

991
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The store manager himself

992
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Was outside

993
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And letting everybody know

994
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Exactly what's gonna happen

995
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Before the store opened

996
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And

997
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Excuse me I have to burp

998
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And

999
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is great right here

1000
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And so

1001
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Sorry I just took some Airborne

1002
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Man you can't blame me

1003
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No I

1004
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I went and

1005
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So basically the store manager

1006
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You know

1007
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Explained everything

1008
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And then he

1009
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Then

1010
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
We

1011
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You know

1012
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Were in line

1013
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
They handed out things

1014
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
For us to fill out

1015
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
As to which games we wanted to get

1016
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And then

1017
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They kind of

1018
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Escorted us into the

1019
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Into the store

1020
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Where we handed them the flyer

1021
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
That we filled out

1022
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
And then they got everything for us

1023
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And then sent us to a register

1024
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It was very very very very

1025
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Organized

1026
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Well organized

1027
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
No glitches

1028
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Nobody you know upset

1029
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Everybody knew they were gonna get one

1030
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
That was gonna get one

1031
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Yeah

1032
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It was wham bam

1033
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Thank you ma'am Chris

1034
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Right

1035
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It was very very convenient

1036
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Yes it was

1037
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
And I even told the lady

1038
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That walked me over to the register

1039
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
That I was very

1040
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I appreciated

1041
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
That

1042
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
What

1043
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What the hell

1044
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Um

1045
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And uh

1046
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And so that's the end

1047
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Bye

1048
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Alright well thank you

1049
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Extover for sharing that

1050
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I just got linked to the best site ever

1051
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Did you

1052
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Did you also

1053
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Your website the weeks later in the show

1054
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Did you

1055
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
No this is

1056
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I might make this next weeks

1057
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Alright did

1058
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Did you find the process to be just as great

1059
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh yeah

1060
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Very smooth

1061
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But I laughed at the stupid woman

1062
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh my gosh

1063
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So

1064
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Uh

1065
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Somebody

1066
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
The prissiest looking woman

1067
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
There were like

1068
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Actually walks up from her SUV

1069
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Here you go

1070
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Okay

1071
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And she's all in her skirt and her high heels

1072
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Looking all prissy prissy prissy

1073
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And she walks to the end of the line

1074
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And she walks with an attitude

1075
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Like I didn't have to wait

1076
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I didn't have to wait

1077
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I didn't have to wait

1078
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And walk all the way back there

1079
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And she went back and they basically said

1080
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh we're the last ones to get it

1081
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
And she walks back looking so pissed off

1082
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I was like

1083
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Ha ha

1084
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There were like a few people who showed up

1085
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Thinking they can just jump in the line

1086
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And the guy said I'm sorry

1087
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We don't have anymore

1088
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
We're the only people

1089
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You know that was probably gonna be me

1090
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
If extra had been so volunteer

1091
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
But I would have been okay

1092
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I wouldn't have left away in a huff

1093
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I would have understood

1094
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You know

1095
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I would have been okay

1096
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm going to Kmart

1097
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Cause no one shops at Kmart

1098
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
But anyway

1099
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We gotta keep moving

1100
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Cause we wanna get in the show

1101
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But we wanna give a great big round of applause

1102
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
To the line at Target Greatland and Citrus Heights

1103
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And the great staff there

1104
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
For making the relaunch good

1105
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Yay

1106
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And I also wanna give a round of applause

1107
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
To the guy at the front of the line

1108
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
At Walmart in Rancho Cordova

1109
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The grandpa

1110
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday

1111
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid

1112
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Not to sell it on eBay

1113
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But he looked like the nicest guy in the world

1114
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
So I wanna give him a round of applause too

1115
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Cause I liked him a lot

1116
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And I liked all the gamers we met

1117
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He didn't take your cookie though

1118
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
No he didn't take the cookie

1119
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
But that's okay

1120
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I understand

1121
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And I'm not gonna force people to take the cookies

1122
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Alright so anyway

1123
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chatroom

1124
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Why are they even

1125
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
That was Shadow Charlie

1126
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
But why are they even talking about Paris Hilton

1127
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh cause

1128
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one

1129
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Well we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems

1130
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Use their celebrity to get systems

1131
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We'll talk about that later

1132
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free okay

1133
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Alright

1134
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii

1135
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Fireboma says Paris Hilton

1136
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature

1137
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Of the Wiimote easily

1138
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Anyway

1139
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Let's get into another favorite segment

1140
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We like to do here on Orange Land Australia

1141
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
This is usually how we kick off the show

1142
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And we don't have launch party stories to tell

1143
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh I forgot to add

1144
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh I'm so sorry

1145
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I didn't even ask

1146
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You guys all camped in the line for the Wii

1147
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
What did you get?

1148
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What games did you end up getting?

1149
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Dark Soccer

1150
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I got

1151
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Well I actually got another Wiimote

1152
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And then I got Zelda Excite Truck

1153
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
And Trauma Center

1154
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Which

1155
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Those are the exact same three games I got by the way

1156
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck and Zelda

1157
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Loki?

1158
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I feel so bad but

1159
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I got Zelda Excite Truck

1160
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Rayman's Raving Rabbids

1161
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Red Steel

1162
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

1163
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I think that was it

1164
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Did you get Spongebob?

1165
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I did not get Spongebob

1166
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I will talk about it in a little bit but

1167
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used

1168
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Pretty quick at a GameStop

1169
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Ouch ouch

1170
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Not sounding like some good reviews there

1171
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I want to say this comment from chat though real quick about the Wii lines

1172
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Rama said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems not sell them

1173
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Another very interesting observation

1174
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I have noted this observation was made on blogs where you know

1175
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Most of the people on the Playstation 3 lines were eBay profiteers

1176
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Most of the people on the Wii lines actually plan on playing them

1177
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I asked you know and I didn't expect people to be honest with me but I asked straight up

1178
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I said who is selling the Wii on eBay

1179
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
And only one person kind of fessed up so that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay

1180
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Like their friend ratted them out

1181
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
That was it

1182
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
One guy at Best Buy

1183
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Fessed up and said yeah I bought two Playstation 3's and I sold them both on eBay for a profit

1184
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And I am using that money to buy the Wii and I am like what are you selling the Wii too?

1185
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Give me back the cookie

1186
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And he is like

1187
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He said no I actually want to play the Wii

1188
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This is very interesting

1189
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people have

1190
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Pooeater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports

1191
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:57,000
My girlfriend Migzy she has been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop

1192
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And she says it has actually gotten kind of boring

1193
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Really?

1194
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I mean it is good for like to learn how things go I guess

1195
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But it is not really a you know

1196
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I got to agree Wii Sports is pretty much a

1197
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Look it is a glorified tech demo

1198
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
But I could see that as a good multiplayer game especially with like Wii Bowling

1199
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
It strikes me as a good party game and a good thing to like just show somebody the Wii to get into

1200
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You know what I mean like if I wanted to take it over and show my sister who maybe does not play video games

1201
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Say hey you want to check out what I just got fire it up here you go

1202
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Pass it off to Drew Nami for a minute because I want to ask

1203
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room

1204
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
And you played Wii Sports what was your impressions?

1205
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Just pick it up and go

1206
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
There is nothing to it at all

1207
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing but everything else was easy

1208
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Alright

1209
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
We have been putting off long enough

1210
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
We are already like more than 20 minutes into the show

1211
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Let us talk about how is your gaming week

1212
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And since there is a lot of us we want to kind of keep it a little bit brief

1213
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But I know some people like Loki got like 7 games

1214
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
So Dark Sakura how is your gaming week?

1215
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Well actually I did not play the Wii yet

1216
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Because I was so tired that we went right to bed pretty much

1217
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But I have been playing Cooking Mama

1218
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Which I found a used one

1219
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I was so happy

1220
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And every time I tried to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted

1221
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So I have not actually gotten started yet

1222
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I played some Mario

1223
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But mostly I was playing Cooking Mama

1224
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And I have my Elite Beat Agents today

1225
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you

1226
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Alright that is it

1227
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Very cool

1228
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Have fun with it

1229
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Play lots of the Wii for next week

1230
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
And pinball

1231
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Like real pinball not virtual console pinball

1232
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I had a pinball party last night so I have actually

1233
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Well of course we were not there

1234
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But I was playing some of the machines

1235
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
While Sauce was here last week too

1236
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about

1237
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Before we got into how is your gaming week

1238
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
But I got to read these

1239
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Robway in our chatroom says

1240
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I think less people want to resell the Wii

1241
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling

1242
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Plus I am not buying from the eBay scum

1243
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Megzi says

1244
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Megzi said I showed the parentals Wii Sports

1245
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
They were like speechless in awe

1246
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Megzi!

1247
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Kind of interesting

1248
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

1249
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
My gaming week was great

1250
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Especially with the Wii on Thursday

1251
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We started off with Wii Sports

1252
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And that was actually pretty fun

1253
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The Wii Tennis was really cool

1254
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I mean everyone really had fun with it

1255
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Then tried a little bit of Wii Boxing

1256
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Which is a little weird

1257
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Because I did not really read the manual on how to play it

1258
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
So could not quite get it to work correctly

1259
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
But it was still fun

1260
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Wii Golf was kind of okay I guess

1261
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And then Wii Bowling did not really try that too much

1262
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And then the baseball I think is way too damn hard

1263
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous

1264
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend

1265
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Been playing lots of that

1266
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That game is really fun

1267
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That is the best way to describe it

1268
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Although the music is so goddamn horrible

1269
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You really need the SD memory card

1270
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And just load your own MP3's

1271
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I tell you once you do that

1272
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It makes the game completely better

1273
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
It is a really fun game

1274
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Then moving on

1275
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz

1276
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If you played Monkey Ball before

1277
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And you were used to it

1278
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Then you probably liked this game

1279
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I thought that the original Monkey Ball was too hard

1280
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Or at least it was too frustrating for me to put more attention towards it

1281
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
So I got really sick of the game really quick

1282
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
And this is after level 7

1283
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And it was pretty damn hard

1284
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
And I was just like fuck this

1285
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I do not want to play this

1286
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
And the minigames to be honest

1287
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I did not like them

1288
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I did not like them too much

1289
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So it is not something I would play by myself

1290
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Maybe a good party game

1291
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
But money is better spent elsewhere

1292
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits

1293
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Because if you are really interested in a minigame type of game

1294
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That is the one for you

1295
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Because it is just insane

1296
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I mean the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim

1297
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Just how off the wall weird they are

1298
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
My favorite was the eating one

1299
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That you trace the food

1300
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And like one of the foods was a baseball

1301
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
The guy would eat

1302
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I was like what the hell he is eating a baseball

1303
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It is excellent

1304
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So definitely you are going to need to check that out

1305
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Zelda is pretty awesome

1306
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But I mean what do you expect from a Zelda

1307
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It is just pretty neat

1308
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So Zelda yay

1309
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And then of course

1310
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Tony Hawk's Downhole Jam

1311
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I bought this thinking it is going to be like SSX

1312
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because I love SSX

1313
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It is not SSX

1314
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It is not even close to being SSX

1315
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And I got really frustrated this right away

1316
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Because to be honest

1317
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I do not know if it was my TV

1318
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But the cables I had the detail on it

1319
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I had trouble seeing some of the tracks

1320
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And I just

1321
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I want a game that I can get into and have fun with

1322
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And Excite Truck was that

1323
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Tony Hawk was not

1324
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So I would not recommend it

1325
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I mean unless you are a really big Tony Hawk fan

1326
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I really would not recommend it

1327
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
So yeah

1328
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And then of course finally

1329
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Virtual Console Games

1330
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I tried Mario 64

1331
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Which is ok with the classic controller

1332
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I wonder how well it will look with the component cables

1333
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But it looks just like it did before

1334
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
And then Zelda

1335
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Seemed a bit dark to me

1336
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But I guess that was because it was from the collection disc

1337
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Or something that came out of the GameCube

1338
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Not too long ago

1339
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Now it makes sense

1340
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Because hey it is already imported right

1341
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Exactly

1342
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I wish it was brighter though

1343
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Because like all those games we saw at E3

1344
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Were very vivid and bright

1345
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
And that is what I kind of liked about them

1346
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And now

1347
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I mean I think it is all about the cables though

1348
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Right now

1349
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So

1350
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That was pretty much it

1351
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah of course you know the usual suspects

1352
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Call of Duty 3

1353
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
On the 360

1354
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And

1355
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Gears of War a little bit

1356
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And other scrolls

1357
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Finally finished it

1358
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
SSJ100Matt wants to know

1359
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
What does Nellie, Loki's wife

1360
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Have to say about Loki playing all those games this week

1361
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Now here is the funny thing

1362
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
About that actually

1363
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Nellie originally

1364
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
If you have her as a friend on LiveJournal

1365
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You would have seen that she wrote

1366
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Some pretty negative reviews on the Wii

1367
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Saying if I really wanted to exercise

1368
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I would go to the gym

1369
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I won't play the Wii

1370
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Ironically enough though

1371
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Once she picked up Excite Truck

1372
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
She has been playing it

1373
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
She played it for five hours yesterday

1374
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And a couple hours today

1375
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So

1376
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And she has actually finished

1377
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
All the four different cups in it

1378
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
All the way up through the platinum cup

1379
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
She is all finished with it

1380
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Now she is going back to get S-Rank games

1381
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
On all the other tracks

1382
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I haven't even played it that much

1383
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
So that is how much she is like this

1384
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And she loves the game

1385
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
She says it is like

1386
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It is basically like

1387
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Women driver the game

1388
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Because it allows you to crash through trees

1389
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And just drive aimlessly

1390
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And you get points

1391
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
You get rewarded

1392
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Yeah you get rewarded for driving recklessly

1393
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So she loves the game

1394
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Sail at Mervyn's

1395
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But you know what

1396
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You know what I like though

1397
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Playing on there

1398
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Is the Mii Channel

1399
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I like creating stupid Miis

1400
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That I sent to Rob

1401
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Which is great

1402
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh gosh

1403
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I went into my Mii Channel

1404
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And suddenly like

1405
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Eight new Miis

1406
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
All dropped in my little thing

1407
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Loki sent you this

1408
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Loki sent you this

1409
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And he sent him and Nellie

1410
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And then he sent like

1411
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Damian

1412
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side

1413
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Or what you did

1414
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
To get those horns

1415
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't know what you did

1416
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And then he just

1417
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
He sent me a guy with a giant afro

1418
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And called it Afro

1419
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It is from DDR

1420
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I get it

1421
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I get it

1422
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Alright

1423
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Alright

1424
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Let's talk to our guests

1425
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Oh I got to say

1426
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
My gaming week

1427
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I'll make it quick

1428
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Phantasy Star Universe

1429
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Before the

1430
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You know

1431
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Mass hysteria of the Wii launch

1432
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I played a lot of Phantasy Star Universe

1433
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Online mode

1434
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Because they opened up some new areas

1435
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
In online

1436
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Motube is a new planet you can go to

1437
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And some new missions are available as well

1438
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I got my butt handed to me

1439
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
In Motube though

1440
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Because the missions

1441
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Even though they're level 15

1442
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
They're a little bit harder

1443
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Than the ones on New Days

1444
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
So

1445
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's good though

1446
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm glad they're keeping it fresh

1447
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
With new content

1448
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Let's hope

1449
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Sega gets it right this time

1450
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And consistently gives us the new stuff

1451
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I'll be a very happy camper if so

1452
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
When it came to the Wii

1453
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I would say

1454
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Trauma Center

1455
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Is a very overlooked launch title

1456
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I didn't play the one on the DS

1457
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I just heard a lot of people rave about it

1458
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And you know

1459
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I hate those Discovery Channel shows

1460
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
That are all about surgery

1461
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Because I get like

1462
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I'm a big wimp

1463
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
When it comes to blood

1464
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And things like that

1465
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But I love Trauma Center

1466
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's so fun

1467
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And it's

1468
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
When I get mad at the patients

1469
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I stab them with my scalpel

1470
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And just kill them

1471
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I have a review from Meg Z

1472
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
She said

1473
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
The Trauma Center for the DS

1474
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Makes you want to hit yourself with a brick

1475
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
It's hard

1476
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's a really hard game

1477
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And you have to like remember

1478
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's almost like Simon says

1479
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I don't know if like Simon says

1480
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But you have to remember like

1481
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Okay

1482
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
First I got to drain it

1483
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Then I got to scalp it

1484
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Then I got to take it out with a thing

1485
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then I got an antibiotic

1486
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And you have to remember

1487
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Like what order you have to do everything in

1488
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's crazy

1489
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
But it's fun

1490
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And DMN

1491
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
You watched me play it

1492
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I was like

1493
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Stressing out

1494
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I was like

1495
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That was hilarious

1496
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That was cool

1497
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I had a good time

1498
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But yeah

1499
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's kind of an overlooked launch title

1500
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I think it's kind of fun

1501
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
$50?

1502
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't know

1503
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm still not loving these high prices for games

1504
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
But

1505
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Whatever

1506
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It's

1507
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You know I guess I could always trade it back

1508
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Or whatever

1509
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You know

1510
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Rampage is $29.99

1511
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
But it's Rampage

1512
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
How many times have I played Rampage

1513
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
In whatever

1514
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Incorations

1515
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
I have no interest in it

1516
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm sorry Midway

1517
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
But I'm just

1518
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You know

1519
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Get a new franchise

1520
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I will pick a Mortal Kombat though

1521
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So

1522
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm totally being a hypocrite

1523
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat

1524
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
When it comes out of the way

1525
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
DMN

1526
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
How was your gaming week?

1527
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Well I

1528
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Played a bunch of games at work

1529
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
That I can't talk about

1530
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
But

1531
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Let's see

1532
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
At home

1533
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I actually busted out the Super Nintendo

1534
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Played some Tecmo Super Bowl

1535
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Wario's Woods

1536
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Actually when I got here

1537
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP

1538
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I played a lot of Luminous 2

1539
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Played a lot of Burnout Revenge

1540
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
On his 360

1541
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
And this is actually the first time

1542
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I've actually gotten to play the Wii

1543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And play it on my own terms

1544
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Rather than

1545
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You're playing this for 8 hours

1546
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Have fun

1547
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
But

1548
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun

1549
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
With the system

1550
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Trauma Center is just funny

1551
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Again

1552
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
The stabbing people

1553
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Excite Truck is pretty fun

1554
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I actually did not like

1555
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Raving Rabbids

1556
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I just thought it was stupid

1557
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But

1558
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Yeah

1559
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
That's about it

1560
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm boring like that

1561
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh wait wait wait wait

1562
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Elite Beat Agents

1563
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah

1564
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I played a lot of that

1565
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Alright

1566
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Right on

1567
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Chris

1568
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I know you don't usually play

1569
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
A whole lot of games

1570
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
But did you try out anything this week

1571
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That you liked?

1572
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Well

1573
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I got Cookie Mama

1574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So that was really good

1575
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I haven't played the Wii yet

1576
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Which I got

1577
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Which is a surprise to me now

1578
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I didn't expect to get it

1579
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I did however

1580
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I got Sims 2 Pets

1581
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 Pets

1582
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And you can kill animals

1583
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And turn them into ghost animals

1584
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But no

1585
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It's actually really fun

1586
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
All the animals

1587
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You can't actually tell the animals

1588
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What to do

1589
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
But

1590
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
They have their own personalities

1591
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And they just kind of run around

1592
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You can tell them not to do something

1593
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
All my cats

1594
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
That I have for my Sims

1595
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
They don't

1596
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
They are on the furniture all the time

1597
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And I can't get them to stop

1598
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But

1599
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And I also played Pokemon Ranger

1600
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
That game is weird

1601
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's like

1602
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm old school Pokemon fan

1603
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Like the trainer games

1604
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Those are the only ones I like

1605
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't have pinball or anything like that

1606
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
And I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that

1607
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's not

1608
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's kind of weird

1609
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's like

1610
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You have to make the Pokemon think you're a friend

1611
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So you draw a circle around it

1612
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
With your stylus

1613
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Many many times

1614
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But it will get pissed off

1615
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And hurt your stylus circle

1616
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And then you have to try again

1617
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And your stylus will die

1618
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And then you have to start over

1619
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But you get a friend

1620
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You get a friend that travels with you nonstop

1621
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Which is

1622
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I have no idea what that Pokemon is

1623
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's the plus minus Pikachu thing

1624
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Oh

1625
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Plus one minus

1626
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah that thing

1627
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I have plushies of those

1628
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah they

1629
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's always with you

1630
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But you can get

1631
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Like the friends that you make

1632
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Follow you around

1633
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Until you're done with them

1634
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
And you can use your Pokemon

1635
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So it's even worse than training them

1636
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
You use them

1637
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You use

1638
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
It's like

1639
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
You get that for me

1640
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And they get the hell out

1641
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But

1642
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So that's

1643
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Wow

1644
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
That's a weird game

1645
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I mean if you like Pokemon anyway

1646
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I mean I guess it's a really cool game

1647
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But I like training them

1648
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I like using them for purposes of battle

1649
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I like trying to kill my Pokemon

1650
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
PETA doesn't like me I don't think

1651
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
So

1652
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Okay that was my gaming week

1653
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Right on

1654
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Drewnami

1655
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Drew I really really like your shirt

1656
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It says noob

1657
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Noob

1658
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's what's for dinner

1659
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And it has a noob

1660
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It has a noob assuming the position

1661
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Cut up like the

1662
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Cuts a meat chart

1663
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah that's so funny

1664
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Drewnami

1665
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Or Drewnawee

1666
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
How was your gaming week?

1667
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I actually decided to kick a little bit old school

1668
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Because I didn't get

1669
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Didn't get any of the next gen stuff

1670
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So I went back to my old

1671
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
MechWarrior games

1672
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Just started playing MechWarrior 3

1673
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
MechWarrior 4

1674
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
MechCommander 2

1675
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That kind of stuff

1676
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Didn't do much else except

1677
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Guitar Hero

1678
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And they really ramped up the difficulty

1679
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
On expert mode

1680
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Which is almost impossibly hard

1681
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
When you get to the stuff like Miserloo

1682
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Ugh

1683
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Other than that not much else

1684
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Alright very cool

1685
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know what's funny is that you know

1686
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Earlier in the show I was talking about

1687
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Our history as a music gaming network

1688
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I think you're the only

1689
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Oh no

1690
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Dark Soccer played Guitar Hero 2 last week

1691
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Cause I haven't played it yet

1692
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I've played a bunch of that too

1693
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
What's your favorite spot?

1694
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Pandora is hot

1695
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Pandora is fucking hot

1696
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Pandora makes me fail songs

1697
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Alright

1698
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Well that was our gaming week

1699
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well

1700
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Whether you were in the Playstation 3 camp

1701
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Or the Wii camp

1702
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Or the F the next generation camp

1703
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Or maybe 360

1704
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You're just there holding out on 360

1705
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Whatever hope you had a good gaming week as well

1706
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We gotta get into some gaming news

1707
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So real quick housekeeping

1708
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Real quick

1709
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Just wanted to say

1710
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
For those that have been saying

1711
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Why do you put out part B so late in the week

1712
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Why do we have to wait so long for part B

1713
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Okay

1714
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
We're gonna try a new thing

1715
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And we're gonna put out part B a little bit earlier

1716
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So look for it this week

1717
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
There's another podcast out there

1718
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's another show that's syndicated on all games like we are

1719
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Our show replays on all games on Monday

1720
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And there's a show on Thursday

1721
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I think on all games

1722
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I apologize if I mess that up

1723
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Called Game Addict Hotline

1724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
There's a spinoff show from that called Cross Platform

1725
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Where they have multiple people come together

1726
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
From different podcasts and magazines and stuff

1727
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
And just talk about random stuff

1728
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So the guy there, Luke

1729
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I've been chatting with for a little bit

1730
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So he had me on episode four and five

1731
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000

00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000

1735
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
For being excited about Blue Dragon

1736
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,000

1738
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Gamer Andy

1739
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's all I have to say

1740
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
No

1741
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
All the Final Fantasy people

1742
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You know what a Final Fantasy whore I am

1743
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
No

1744
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000

One other thing I want to say real fast

1749
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
DMM

1750
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Do you have anything you want to share with our listeners?

1752
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000

00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Of the live listeners

But um

1856
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
We look forward to being

1857
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
A part of the Orange

1858
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000

A lot of fun with it

1861
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So when's that start

1862
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Thursday after Thanksgiving

1863
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Right

1864
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yes it will be the

1865
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
First Thursday after Thanksgiving

1866
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We're shooting for an evening

1867
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Sort of time

1868
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So people can uh

1869
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
You know

1870
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
We're gonna have it

1871
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
At three in the morning

1872
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Alright

1873
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Alright now

1874
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Is it seven o'clock

1875
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I think it's gonna be seven

1876
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah I think we're gonna be at seven

1877
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Most of the other shows

1878
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Are at seven or seven thirty

1879
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
So probably in that window

1880
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Somewhere so

1881
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Alright um

1882
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Just real quick

1883
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I wanna say one more time

1884
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Okay

1885
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Okay

1886
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Ask an OP

1887
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
If you need to know

1888
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
How to private message

1889
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Somebody in chat

1890
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Um

1891
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The folks in chat

1892
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Would request that if you

1893
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Already have a Wii

1894
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You don't enter the contest

1895
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But since there's no way

1896
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
For us to verify it

1897
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Maybe you know someone

1898
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
In need of a Wii

1899
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So we're not gonna stop

1900
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
People that already have one

1901
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
From entering

1902
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
But you know

1903
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You know

1904
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
You win brownie points

1905
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Use your best judgement

1906
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Yeah

1907
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
So

1908
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Only PM me

1909
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
When I say to

1910
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And after a certain period

1911
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Of time

1912
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
One number

1913
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Yes

1914
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So it's not the first person

1915
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
To PM me

1916
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
It's one number

1917
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
From someone who PMs me

1918
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Yes

1919
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Will be drawn at random

1920
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yes

1921
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Okay

1922
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
And by the way

1923
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
If you're PMing me

1924
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Other things during the show

1925
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Cause there's a lot of people

1926
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In chat tonight

1927
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I can't look at them right now

1928
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Cause there's too much else

1929
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Going on

1930
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I'm very sorry folks

1931
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But you have to

1932
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
No love letters

1933
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
General chat

1934
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Or

1935
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I don't know

1936
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
See if

1937
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
See if Loki or DarkSakura

1938
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Can answer

1939
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Or ask

1940
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
One of your friendly OP's

1941
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Alright

1942
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So

1943
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I know we haven't given

1944
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The 360 a lot of love tonight

1945
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But Loki can you change that

1946
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
For us a little bit

1947
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Of course I can

1948
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I love the 360

1949
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And I'll still be playing

1950
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Plenty

1951
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Anyways

1952
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Um

1953
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So

1954
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
On the 15th

1955
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You know

1956
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
There's a big anniversary

1957
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The 5th year anniversary

1958
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Of Halo

1959
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And of course

1960
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
To commemorate the 5th anniversary

1961
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Of Halo

1962
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
They announced some more things

1963
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
About Halo 3

1964
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And some stuff for Halo 2

1965
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Um

1966
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So starting things off

1967
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Halo 3 is going to be getting a multiplayer beta

1968
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
In the spring of 2007

1969
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Which uh

1970
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
If I remember correctly

1971
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I think that they

1972
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That news came out a while ago

1973
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
At least it was rumored to be happening

1974
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So

1975
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
There will be

1976
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Some sort of demo coming out

1977
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Spring of 2007

1978
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Um

1979
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No word on

1980
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What you know

1981
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
That will consist of

1982
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And whether it will be free

1983
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
So

1984
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I don't know

1985
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Something coming out though

1986
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Spring 2007

1987
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
So that's pretty cool

1988
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Um

1989
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Halo 2 is actually

1990
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Going to be getting some

1991
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Xbox 360 exclusive maps

1992
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Um

1993
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Brand new multiplayer maps

1994
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Also coming out in the spring

1995
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Um

1996
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Exclusively for Xbox 360 players

1997
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So

1998
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You know

1999
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Sorry if you have just an Xbox

2000
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Um

2001
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Also

2002
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
The first Halo 3 television ad

2003
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Will air

2004
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Um

2005
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
During ESPN Monday Night Football

2006
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
On December 4th

2007
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And it will be a 60 second spot

2008
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Um

2009
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
So that will be very interesting

2010
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
You know

2011
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Checking

2012
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Or tune into that to watch it

2013
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Or catch it on YouTube

2014
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
The day after

2015
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So

2016
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Alrighty

2017
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Sorry

2018
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I haven't been having to

2019
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Argue a little bit

2020
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
With some people in chat room

2021
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They're like

2022
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Look the rules are the rules

2023
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And it's DMN's Wii

2024
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
And he can do whatever he wants

2025
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
To give it away

2026
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Because he doesn't have to be doing it

2027
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So

2028
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
That's it

2029
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Yeah it's a very massive Wii

2030
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You have there DMN

2031
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Anyway

2032
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I wanted to say real quick

2033
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,000
On the Halo 3

2034
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So

2035
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
The beta coming out in spring

2036
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Now you have said

2037
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
In the previous episodes

2038
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You are convinced

2039
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
That the game is coming out in

2040
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
What?

2041
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
March?

2042
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
April?

2043
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Somewhere in that window?

2044
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Uh huh

2045
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?

2046
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,000
No

2047
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
They beta tested

2048
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Fantasy Star Universe

2049
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Right before it came out

2050
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
What's the big deal?

2051
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I mean

2052
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It doesn't have to be beta tested

2053
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Months in advance

2054
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
In fact

2055
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
The only exception I've seen so far

2056
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Um

2057
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
With demos and Xbox Live

2058
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Would probably be the stuff from E3

2059
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You know

2060
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Lost Planet got a demo

2061
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And Test Drive Unlimited

2062
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And stuff like that

2063
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I mean

2064
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That stuff was way early

2065
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
But then again

2066
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It was also already done

2067
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
For that show

2068
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So they didn't have to really

2069
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Work on it

2070
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Um

2071
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
So yeah

2072
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
It makes perfect sense

2073
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Why would you have a beta test

2074
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
For something

2075
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And then wait like six months

2076
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
To put it out

2077
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm still telling you

2078
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
End of March

2079
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
So

2080
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Whatever

2081
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Alright

2082
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You all will see

2083
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
We shall

2084
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
We shall see

2085
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Uh

2086
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Speaking of things

2087
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
That need to be beta tested

2088
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Perhaps the PlayStation 3

2089
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Backwards compatibility

2090
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Should have been play tested

2091
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm sure you guys have been

2092
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
hearing reports about

2093
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I think we got into it

2094
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
A little bit last week

2095
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Some of the games

2096
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Don't work right

2097
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Uh

2098
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They have little bugs

2099
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I don't know if any

2100
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Are any of them

2101
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Rendered unplayable

2102
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That you've heard of

2103
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I don't think any of them

2104
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Are necessarily unplayable

2105
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I don't know about

2106
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Unplayable

2107
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
But you've got graphical

2108
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Audio bugs

2109
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Quite a bit

2110
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But it's very interesting

2111
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Because there was an interview

2112
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
With Sony Computer

2113
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Entertainment America exec

2114
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Jack Trettin

2115
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And he made this

2116
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Very interesting

2117
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And bizarre quote

2118
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
In response to the question

2119
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Do you have a response

2120
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
For people experiencing

2121
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Backwards compatibility

2122
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Issues and or television

2123
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Upscaling problems

2124
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Quote

2125
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I would like my car to fly

2126
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And make me breakfast

2127
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
But that's an unrealistic

2128
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Expectation

2129
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
We've reported problems

2130
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
On only 200 of the

2131
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
8000 PlayStation 1 and 2 games

2132
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I would challenge the average

2133
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Consumer to say

2134
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
There are significant problems

2135
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
With any of the games

2136
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
In their library

2137
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
If you look at our competitors

2138
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
One machine has zero

2139
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Backwards compatibility

2140
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And one only has it

2141
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
With a third of their games

2142
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Someone needs to notify him

2143
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That the Wii will actually

2144
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Play all GameCube games

2145
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But

2146
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And then also

2147
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
The older games

2148
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Here's the other thing

2149
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That's kind of funny

2150
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
200 games so far

2151
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Out of the 8000

2152
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Because it's only been

2153
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Released in one region

2154
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So far

2155
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
You do realize

2156
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
There are other games

2157
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
In other regions

2158
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Of course

2159
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
He might not realize that

2160
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Since he thinks that

2161
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
The Wii doesn't play

2162
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Any other games

2163
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
But

2164
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
I know

2165
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And Fireball Man

2166
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Chatroom says

2167
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
That's just giving

2168
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
A big fuck you

2169
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
To the gaming community

2170
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And I tend to agree

2171
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
I mean that's a very

2172
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Snide thing

2173
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I want a flying car

2174
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
To fix them

2175
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
We'll fix them

2176
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Our bad

2177
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I want to get

2178
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
A big

2179
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Pro-tip

2180
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
For every single

2181
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Higher up

2182
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
At every single

2183
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Video game company

2184
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
You don't know

2185
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
What the fuck

2186
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You're talking about

2187
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Shut the hell up

2188
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Hello

2189
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
This includes mine too

2190
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I know you're listening

2191
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Perrin

2192
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Now

2193
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
They are working on

2194
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Patch to fix this stuff

2195
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
It's

2196
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
You know

2197
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
To be fair

2198
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Microsoft

2199
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Their games

2200
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Aren't

2201
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Backwards compatible

2202
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Not all of them

2203
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I mean

2204
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
They have about

2205
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
They have as many

2206
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Backwards compatible games

2207
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
As Sony has

2208
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Games that aren't working

2209
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
In backwards compatibility

2210
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I mean

2211
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
It's about

2212
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
About that

2213
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So

2214
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
It'll be fixed

2215
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
In a patch

2216
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You know

2217
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
People can quit

2218
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Their bitching

2219
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Granted

2220
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
There's still gonna be

2221
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Other problems

2222
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
But

2223
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That's why they have

2224
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
These updates

2225
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
And firmware updates

2226
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And stuff like that

2227
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
So

2228
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Not a huge deal

2229
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I mean

2230
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
It's going to be in the library

2231
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I mean

2232
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
The percentage of

2233
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Games that aren't working

2234
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Is about like

2235
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
2%

2236
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's really

2237
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Not that big

2238
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Of a deal

2239
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So

2240
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It will

2241
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Be fixed soon

2242
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I mean

2243
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
At least

2244
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
They could have said

2245
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
At least

2246
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Hey we're

2247
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We're doing better

2248
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Than 360

2249
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Granted

2250
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah

2251
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
This guy

2252
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Is an idiot

2253
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I mean

2254
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
They do not

2255
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Need people like

2256
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Him

2257
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You know

2258
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,280
familiar sounding name, says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.

2259
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,120
It's very rude. It's just rude. It's horrible PR.

2260
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,080
It is a little bit. Considering they're relying on these people

2261
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,600
to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they're

2262
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,240
really rude to them at launch. Interesting words.

2263
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,080
What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for

2264
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,160
the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound

2265
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,200
like pricks. Them's fighting words.

2266
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,360
Those are fighting words. I still, despite all this crap, I do still

2267
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,040
consider myself a Sony fanboy. I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.

2268
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,320
So, you want to go outside? You want to go to the parking lot?

2269
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,040
You want to go get Todd a lesson? All right. Fight. Fight.

2270
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,040
I might shoot him. Okay.

2271
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,360
I get to stop. Anyway.

2272
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:07,860
Speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.

2273
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,320
Well, not really got shot. Well, actually, in other states they got shot.

2274
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,520
But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their

2275
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:25,400
PS3. Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game

2276
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
system. It's not the whole diamond.

2277
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,120
It's $599 US dollars. I don't fucking care.

2278
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,380
$600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay. But there's people getting shot over this

2279
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:43,400
and I'm like, you people are pathetic. Wait.

2280
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,840
Let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up a mic again.

2281
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,560
Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.

2282
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:02,720
You smart ass. I'm just all, you know, it's, they were shooting

2283
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,880
people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.

2284
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,400
I guess the PS3 must be the must own console because that's, you know, every year you hear

2285
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,440
about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking

2286
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,840
each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them.

2287
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:25,720
My mom did that. My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle

2288
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,180
Me Elmo. That's hot.

2289
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,560
And now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation threes.

2290
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,920
It's crazy. You know what?

2291
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,080
I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back

2292
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:46,280
to any of those assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis

2293
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,800
shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and boric acid poured over the stump.

2294
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,280
You know, that's probably someone's fetish. You know, while having to watch Bad Santa.

2295
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,800
No, while having to watch Manos, the Hands of Fate.

2296
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:05,080
You know, Jamie is starting to sound a little angsty. And you know what happens when Jamie

2297
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,240
gets angsty? People die?

2298
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,280
Well, suddenly background music starts coming in and we get into a regular segment of the

2299
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,280
show. Oh, look, right on cue.

2300
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:29,960
FUs of the Week time, Dark Sakura. A big flippin' FU to Sony. All-encompassingly.

2301
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:34,880
And all of your retarded, as you may notice, I'm saying retarded fanboys, as in not that

2302
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,680
all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.

2303
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:49,560
All those, I guess it's stupid men, really. But it's rather like, oh, we're going to sell

2304
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:56,080
it on eBay. You people are disgusting. And I have a secondary FU that I think is going

2305
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,160
to go in line with somebody else's in this room. FU to Art Thieves.

2306
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:12,800
FU to Nintendo, Mad Catz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.

2307
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:21,520
Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday or today? Whatever. Why do

2308
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:29,560
I have to wait? I cannot stand composite cables. I need higher def cables. How will I live

2309
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:39,440
in a high def world with standard composite cables? It's barbaric. And besides, why do

2310
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,200
I have to wait until December? I don't want to wait.

2311
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:51,920
My FU of the Week goes to Dark Sakura, Chris, and Extrofer, and the entire line at Target

2312
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:59,600
Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my

2313
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:05,000
bed, warm and toasty asleep. And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache,

2314
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,760
so FU to my toothache. No. If we really wanted to effect revenge on you,

2315
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,280
we would have dumped some ice water on you, too.

2316
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,600
I would have locked the door to my house so you couldn't do that.

2317
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,240
If it makes you really better, I thought about pulling you at five.

2318
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,120
So, no, I'm teasing. Of course, they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little

2319
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,400
bit of sand in my vagina this week. DMN, your FUs of the Week.

2320
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:35,120
My first FU of the Week goes to T-Mobile because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation

2321
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,560
with money to spend, and then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money, and

2322
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,160
you're going to fucking hate your weekend. But thankfully, I have friends who help me

2323
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,440
out, but they don't get FUs. But T-Mobile does. If you ever take my fucking money without

2324
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,440
my permission again, people will die. And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR

2325
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,680
the other day. I've totally pwned you a butterfly.

2326
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,160
We're going to... I want to play you a... Rematch, bitch, right now.

2327
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,720
Right now. Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did.

2328
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,360
I will still get Laquisha. It's already been brought in.

2329
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,080
All right. Chris, your FUs of the Week. All right, then Drew. Drew, your FUs of the

2330
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,080
Week. You guys serve.

2331
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:18,080
Okay, FU to Dimash Marketing Strategies. Why do we have just not enough game systems for

2332
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:24,320
everyone who watches it the first time around? It still makes no fucking sense to me.

2333
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:28,480
FU to the ramped up difficulty levels of Guitar Hero 2. What the hell? I mean, I know you're

2334
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,160
going to make it harder, but Jesus. Miserloo on Expert? What the hell?

2335
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:39,200
Also, FU to the DMV. I know everyone shares FU. Now they have to have your birth certificate

2336
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,040
even though you've been through the whole thing before just for a new something. So

2337
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,040
you get to stand in line not once, but twice. Isn't it lovely? Ain't it grand?

2338
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,040
Fine. Chris, your FUs. Well, Jimmy kind of already stated my FU.

2339
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:57,960
FU to Art Thieves. My art was stolen on DeviantArt. That was fun.

2340
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,200
Why would somebody steal art? You know, well, it was kind of funny because

2341
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,960
it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school

2342
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,360
publicly, so I'm not that great, but it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown

2343
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:15,880
enough that she thought no one would recognize it, but somebody did and they informed me

2344
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:21,640
and she did it on both her accounts and she actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's

2345
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:27,640
member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description too. Word for word. It was really,

2346
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:31,480
really funny. What a hooker.

2347
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,520
I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thieves. My bad.

2348
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:39,040
Oh, no. I draw, so. I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an

2349
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:45,000
FU, but a kind of confused why don't you notice is all the people who asked me why are you

2350
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:52,400
doing this online when I was handing out coffee. I'm kind of not pleased that people have just

2351
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,080
lost faith in humanity. It's like I know you read about all these things happening, it's

2352
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:01,160
like people are killing each other for a PS3, but there are nice people left and they're

2353
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:09,680
all gay. I love you, Drew.

2354
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:17,000
Wow. They knew me as the lesbian in line.

2355
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:22,080
That's how they knew you on the show too. We love you. You're much more than a lesbian.

2356
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,440
You're also the chick with blue hair. All right.

2357
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:29,040
And I feed you sugar. I give you sugar.

2358
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:38,680
Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week. A pregnant

2359
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:46,080
woman actually was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey, and she says nine months

2360
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:51,000
pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried

2361
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,960
to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's

2362
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:02,760
father, and her younger brother. Okay, yeah, you're really...

2363
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:07,720
You're stupid. That is pretty stupid.

2364
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,160
Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.

2365
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,300
Why are you allowed to be pregnant? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is where I'm going off

2366
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,860
because this is one of the things I hate. I hate when stupid people breed. When people

2367
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:28,080
exist only on this earth to start out babies. Jamie, she really, really, really, really

2368
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,080
wanted one. No. No, no, no. Seriously, what is more important,

2369
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,560
the birth of your child or a video game system? You are a disgusting person, and I hope your

2370
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,760
child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.

2371
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:45,980
Depends. How ugly is your child? Wow. Wow.

2372
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:51,160
It depends on if she was at Walmart or not. Landmine Fairy in Chat says, WTF, is she going

2373
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:55,440
to play Trauma Center while in labor? No, no, no. She will not be playing Trauma

2374
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,040
Center. Trauma Center is not on PlayStation 3.

2375
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh, that's right. Oh, snap. She'll be playing one of the 15 games that

2376
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:07,560
came out before and that's about it. No, she won't let me play Motorstorm until

2377
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:10,800
March. She will be playing Rises of the Old Man.

2378
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,360
She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spiderman impregnated her. I don't

2379
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,440
know. To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel

2380
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:24,520
very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.

2381
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:31,960
I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child,

2382
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,480
you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.

2383
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,320
No video game system is worth your child's life.

2384
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:46,800
All right. I love the chat room. SSJ100Matt says, Loki,

2385
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:54,240
it's New Jersey after all. I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.

2386
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,560
I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once. It was fun.

2387
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,720
All right. For all you people in Jersey, that's loki

2388
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,680
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. There you go. Send the hate mail. Fire away.

2389
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,880
I'm just reading the chat room, okay? I didn't say it.

2390
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,960
To one very strange incident in a line, to a line that was complimented on a very big

2391
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:22,360
blogging site, Joystiq, gave kudos to Best Buy in the landmark center, Best Buy in Boston,

2392
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:25,680
where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.

2393
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:32,520
What happened is that, okay, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event

2394
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,120
the next day. What happened is that at 11 p.m. the night

2395
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,760
before, the general manager walked over to the line and told them he didn't care whatever

2396
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,400
system they wanted to use. So they formed this list. There was a line

2397
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:49,760
and you had to check in every hour. They had roll call every half hour, whatever,

2398
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,240
for the line. And if you weren't there, you were out.

2399
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,660
And so what happened is that there was, I guess, 40 people in line.

2400
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,860
And then what happened, by 3 p.m. they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.

2401
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:07,540
So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.

2402
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:12,320
They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just

2403
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:16,560
come back and get their system. And anything that was left over was automatically

2404
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,900
raffled off. So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager

2405
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:24,580
that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's

2406
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,920
interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.

2407
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,560
Good for them. So it's good to hear that not every line was

2408
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:36,640
just, you know, fucking nuts. So good for you guys in Boston.

2409
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:41,840
Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and

2410
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,400
Wii launches. Basically doing this in conjunction with the

2411
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:53,240
law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.

2412
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,320
So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going

2413
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,880
on in regards to the system launches elsewhere. That's pretty good.

2414
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:07,400
I know it wasn't with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles.

2415
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,800
It's real chaos. But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this

2416
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,240
week at launch, you may be in luck. There may be some more coming in next week

2417
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:22,680
for Black Friday. So if you really want to fight the chaos in

2418
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:29,920
the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more

2419
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,240
systems out there for next week and stuff. I don't know, personally, I don't think that

2420
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,200
there's a real big need for it right now. With only 15 games going to be out before

2421
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,720
the end of the year, I mean, you probably could wait.

2422
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,840
You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.

2423
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,560
I mean, what's coming out next month anyways? Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.

2424
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,960
Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.

2425
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,240
Yeah, so it's not a huge deal. But that's cool at least that they're shipping

2426
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:03,520
them relatively quick. Do you think this is going to drive the eBay

2427
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,280
prices down as the market gets more deluded? It already has actually, from what I was reading.

2428
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:16,920
They're going for about $1,500 now. That's also another reason I think you're

2429
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:22,960
probably not seeing a lot of Wees on eBay, because their shipments are going to be coming

2430
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,680
in around the same time. I think we heard that we're getting our next

2431
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,840
shipment after Thanksgiving. So, yeah, they're going to have systems out

2432
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,520
there, and people don't really need to spend tons of money.

2433
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,920
Rama just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.

2434
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,040
What's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?

2435
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,240
Two gunshots to the head. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2436
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,800
Hey, look, I didn't write them. I only read them.

2437
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:57,280
You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.

2438
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:02,320
You guys remember John Edwards? He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.

2439
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,080
He ran with John Kerry, right? Well, there was a story circulating around

2440
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:09,480
the Internet that what happened. Now, what's interesting to note about John

2441
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:15,320
Edwards is he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know,

2442
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:20,120
and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart, so he's kind of in

2443
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,240
that camp and it's one of his platforms or whatever.

2444
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:29,980
What happened is that according to a statement that he made, his wife told him, his wife

2445
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:34,920
Elizabeth said, hey, we want to get a PlayStation 3 for the young kids.

2446
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,120
What happened is that she made the comment, and again, this is according to a statement,

2447
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,400
in front of one of the staff people. Well, the staff people mentioned it then in

2448
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:46,500
front of a volunteer, and the volunteer started to make all efforts to get one, and so who

2449
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,320
did the volunteer call? Walmart, and tried to use John Edwards' name

2450
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,760
to say, hey, this guy wants a PlayStation 3, you should help us out.

2451
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:59,520
So of course, Walmart used the opportunity to put out their own release and say, well,

2452
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:06,900
Edwards is here criticizing us and now he wants a PlayStation 3 and he's being a little

2453
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,920
bit hypocritical, huh? So it's very interesting back and forth.

2454
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,520
Obviously, there's the he said and they said type things, so it's really hard to know who's

2455
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,640
right, but if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little

2456
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,040
unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little

2457
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:28,040
silly. One of his staffers is fired?

2458
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,520
Yeah, one of his staffers is probably fired. Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively

2459
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,960
soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.

2460
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,840
Interesting. What's this quote from Walmart?

2461
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,880
Oh, here's the quote from Walmart. Quote, while the rest of America's working

2462
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,920
families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.

2463
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,860
Ouch. Certainly not good if he's trying to run

2464
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:53,760
for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?

2465
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,480
Most people will probably forget. I don't know, I don't know.

2466
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,120
I'm just thinking, you know, it's a while ago, and I will say, we'll see.

2467
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:09,200
On a small political note, he made a joke about George Bush, and everyone took it to

2468
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,480
be a joke about him insulting the troops. They're going to play that too.

2469
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,880
That was Kerry, not Edwards. Oh, that was Kerry?

2470
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah. He did that in Seattle, and I thought it

2471
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,240
was the funniest thing ever. He's not running anyway, because he's associated

2472
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:26,760
with John Kerry. All right, this isn't Crossfire, boys and

2473
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,920
girls. We've got to keep it moving. We're just going to have to go to a different country

2474
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,940
or something to get us off of this tangent. Well, there's a country that I would certainly

2475
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:39,680
love to visit if somebody would like to send me a plane ticket there, but in the interim,

2476
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:47,080
I will just have to cover news there. Basically, the PS3 folks are, it's, stupid

2477
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:54,400
freaking Sony, but there's a company that's placing ads in London train stations saying

2478
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:59,120
that they will be able to sell a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.

2479
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:03,440
The thing is, is that Sony's cracked down on all of the shipping.

2480
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:10,480
They're saying Play Asia is not sending any Sony products to Europe.

2481
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:18,520
eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done, but there is a company that's advertising

2482
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:25,360
in these stations stating PS3, order now for Christmas, and they're given a premium, one

2483
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:32,120
fifty minute phone number to call to leave details on the phone service to where they'll

2484
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:39,040
be called back when the systems are available. A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently

2485
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,580
investigating it further. We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and

2486
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:49,200
urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.

2487
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:54,760
A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff

2488
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,880
going on just to get their hands on the PlayStation 3.

2489
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,240
Jesus Christ, Sony, what are you trying to hide from Europe? Let them import the goddamn

2490
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:06,560
systems. But I still think that this stinks of scam.

2491
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,640
Oh no, I don't doubt that one bit. I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up,

2492
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,640
and scammers, shut the fuck up. Scammers just die.

2493
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,760
You should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story. No, I'm kidding. You

2494
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:27,520
know I love you, DMN. Anyways, sorry. So, it's kind of funny though,

2495
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:33,920
I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart, and it's

2496
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,800
really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going

2497
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:44,360
there with a PlayStation 3 in there, and well, basically they found out it's not running

2498
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:49,200
actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's

2499
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:56,960
actually PlayStation 3 live footage. So, oops, I guess that sucks, but that was actually

2500
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:05,080
coming from GamerAndy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there, one for the TV,

2501
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:11,680
one for a DVD player. Is this, I'm just asking this question hypothetically

2502
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:17,720
to bring up debate, is this necessarily such a bad thing though? I mean, if that's what

2503
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:23,260
Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine? I mean, if that's

2504
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:25,360
how they want to do it? That's fine, but I still think it's funny

2505
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,760
how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk. It's authentic, I'll

2506
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,120
give them that. You're harsh, you're harsh. Alright, well,

2507
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:42,000
you know, Sony may not be the only thing, only folks experiencing some broken things

2508
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,120
here at launch. Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just

2509
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,520
yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually just before we went live, and I think it missed

2510
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,900
the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are

2511
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:57,640
breaking down, but, you know, any launch console is going to have their issues where certain

2512
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,740
ones don't work, so that's inevitable. But what should be interesting to note is that

2513
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,780
some of the stuff they said was going to be available on the Wii isn't really quite ready

2514
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,880
yet. What's interesting is that the forecast channel is not actually going to show up until

2515
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:17,240
December 20th, and the news channel will not actually start until January 27th of next

2516
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,880
year, so two of these things they were touting at E3 just for whatever reason, not ready

2517
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,480
to go just yet. It should be noted, it's kind of interesting,

2518
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,320
I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't

2519
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,020
available either. You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop

2520
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:36,040
channel, and some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that

2521
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:40,080
because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now. All those people

2522
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,680
that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today, so, you know, everybody's

2523
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:47,880
trying to download that at once, and thankfully I didn't have a problem. I guess we're lucky

2524
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:53,200
in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores, but, yeah, you know,

2525
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,880
certainly interesting that they have all these updates.

2526
01:16:54,880 --> 01:17:01,200
Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not

2527
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:05,480
detrimental to the system's operation. It is first and foremost a gaming console. I

2528
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,480
honestly think that the news channel's coming out a little later because it was announced

2529
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,520
that they're partnering with CNN, and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out

2530
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,240
yet. I have no idea about the forecast channel, but, yeah, it was interesting to see that

2531
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,200
firmware update right out of, I don't want to say right out of the box, but when you

2532
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,160
connected to the internet.

2533
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:30,400
Mikew0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down. Well,

2534
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,800
yeah, that's because it happened to me, so I was pissed, of course, and if my Wii breaks,

2535
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,840
I'm going to be pissed, too. But, no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay, but

2536
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,040
it's kind of one of the things, like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point,

2537
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:49,360
you know, every launch console has bugs, but, you know, in the first wave, no matter what,

2538
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,000
this isn't PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.

2539
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,360
Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?

2540
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,440
I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and, again, this was so new, it didn't make

2541
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:07,800
our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like, it said, you

2542
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,960
need to eject the disk and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things

2543
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,440
like that, and lots of, like, discrete errors, yeah, little things like that, so.

2544
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:22,120
That's not the amount that Sony is supposedly reporting, right?

2545
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,400
Well, but I don't know, who's tracking it? We don't know, you know, no one's tracking,

2546
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,880
and keep in mind, Sony doesn't have as many consoles out there, so I don't know, until

2547
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,220
we see some hard figures, and are these companies going to release statistics on how many broken

2548
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:35,940
machines they have? Probably not, so I don't know if this is on the same level as Three

2549
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:41,720
Rings of Death or not, on 360, so who knows? Who knows?

2550
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:47,760
I'm going to chat room to read more comments, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

2551
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,880
Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat, do you really want news or weather?

2552
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:58,560
No, I don't, but I would like the internet browser, yeah, I would like that, definitely.

2553
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,800
I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like

2554
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,320
it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.

2555
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,880
I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry, I still have no one to play.

2556
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,080
Honestly, if you want to know what the weather's going to look like, it's called looking out

2557
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,080
the fucking window.

2558
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,080
Open a window.

2559
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,120
I can't open the window, the sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.

2560
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:21,120
Oh, touche.

2561
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:27,960
That's why I live in Seattle, where it's cloudy and rainy all day.

2562
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,280
At least you know what it's always going to be like there.

2563
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:35,880
Well, at any rate, you know, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for

2564
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,920
is music.

2565
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:45,240
And there's going to be an MP3 player out, in Europe anyway, on 8th December, that will

2566
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,160
be 20 pounds.

2567
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,880
It's for the Game Boy Advance and DS, that's supposed to be just like the Playon.

2568
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:59,600
It has a 512 megabyte SD card that lets you load music files onto it via your PC, then

2569
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:06,960
you plug in the adapter into your Game Boy SP, your Game Boy Micro, or Nintendo DS, and

2570
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,240
you can listen to songs on the go.

2571
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,480
Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting.

2572
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:20,280
Well, if it is a redo of the Playon, it will also have a, the Playon had a capacity to

2573
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,720
take a 2 gigabyte SD card, so.

2574
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,600
I thought they already had something like that already.

2575
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,600
That was the Playon.

2576
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:34,120
No, here, it's not the Playon or whatever, it's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.

2577
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:40,720
They use it mainly for, I don't know, pirating games and other things, but it's also meant

2578
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,720
for media.

2579
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,440
And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte, like hard drive, micro

2580
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,440
drive in there.

2581
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,920
Well, this one's official.

2582
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,840
All right, interesting.

2583
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:55,160
I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick, Miek Latov

2584
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:58,080
PM'd me and he said his Wii froze up today.

2585
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,200
He was exiting the Mii channel and it just froze.

2586
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:06,240
He had to turn it off and on, so there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get

2587
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,240
patched or something.

2588
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:11,760
Mine froze up once, but it, well actually it didn't really freeze up, it just seemed

2589
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:18,160
like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system before they

2590
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:20,080
launched the internet thing.

2591
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,080
So yeah, I didn't like it.

2592
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:26,040
Well, I tried to do the shop channel today and it just, it froze up when I was trying

2593
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,640
to go into shop channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.

2594
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,080
Yeah, mine kind of a little delayed today too, so.

2595
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,640
I mean, I can let little web errors slide because those are at least fixed in an hour,

2596
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,760
you know, just depending on the issue.

2597
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,600
Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues for like, ever since the damn game came out,

2598
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:50,240
so I don't know, a World of Warcraft, long queue times and all that fun stuff, so.

2599
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:55,920
Anywho, so you know, of course you can get issues with a console like this and you know,

2600
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,920
I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they'd cut out, like

2601
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,880
you know, DVD playback and stuff like that, but not a big deal.

2602
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,040
But actually they were aiming for even lower price point than $249, they would have liked

2603
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,180
to have seen it at under $100 according to Miyamoto.

2604
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:17,440
And his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money

2605
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,720
could be spent on proving the interface and software.

2606
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:25,760
And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and

2607
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:32,040
photos and other pricey parts, they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.

2608
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:37,280
And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for

2609
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,280
$99?

2610
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:46,840
I mean, as it is, they're flying off the shelves pretty quick, but $99 is just stupid low.

2611
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,360
Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted

2612
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,600
as the revolution, that the revolution was going to be $99?

2613
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,200
I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone

2614
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,160
made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?

2615
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,160
I do think.

2616
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:05,360
But I don't know, I think $249 is pretty good.

2617
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,320
Definitely it's different.

2618
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,600
A lot of people though, I think their competition is going to be saying, well, our graphics

2619
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,600
are better.

2620
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,800
You know, we can do HD movies, but yeah.

2621
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:17,800
So what?

2622
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,840
You know, I just, I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like

2623
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,520
it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.

2624
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:33,120
I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me, so whatever.

2625
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:41,520
All right, moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you

2626
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,920
know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.

2627
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,840
I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming, and you know what?

2628
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,800
Hey, you know, Drew's waving his hand over there.

2629
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,480
What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?

2630
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:56,560
Is it just the cost, or what's the deal?

2631
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,040
Right now it's the cost, and I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.

2632
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:08,600
Like Final Fantasy 13, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side

2633
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,760
Super Smash Bros. Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

2634
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:15,080
I'm just waiting for the big name titles.

2635
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,280
Well, what current gen systems do you have?

2636
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,280
Do you have a Dreamcast?

2637
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,280
I have a PS2.

2638
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,280
I want a Dreamcast.

2639
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,640
Well, you probably still get one cheap, and good news for you Dreamcast owners, there

2640
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,320
is another Dreamcast game coming out.

2641
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:32,020
Play Asia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December

2642
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,020
October.

2643
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:35,560
It's a side-scrolling space shooter.

2644
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:40,840
It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.

2645
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:44,640
It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured,

2646
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:47,480
distributed, or endorsed by Sega.

2647
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:51,400
One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo

2648
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:55,840
AES and NBS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.

2649
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,840
Oh, interesting.

2650
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:57,840
I didn't even catch that.

2651
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:58,840
I went to the website.

2652
01:24:58,840 --> 01:24:59,840
Ah, very cool.

2653
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:06,040
I just want to give the website real quick, if anyone's interested, www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com.

2654
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:10,440
The one thing about it, though, is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other

2655
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:17,600
Neo Geo carts, so yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo, unless

2656
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,440
you get CD or Dreamcast.

2657
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,760
Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince,

2658
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,640
that OLR reported on a few months ago.

2659
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,640
Yeah, that's true.

2660
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,640
Remember the Genesis game?

2661
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:29,640
Yeah, very cool.

2662
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:36,200
All right, well, we're going to move on, and I was thinking we were going to do the drawing

2663
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,240
very soon, but now there was just a net split, so we have to wait for that situation to clear

2664
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,320
itself out before we can do the giveaway, so I'll have to wait a little bit on that,

2665
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:50,240
but definitely make your way on over to chat.orangelaungeradio.com when the situation resolves a little later

2666
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,240
on in the evening.

2667
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:55,500
We'll be doing that Wii giveaway, but for now, we've got to do one of our favorite segments

2668
01:25:55,500 --> 01:26:00,560
here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that is Dark Sakura's very own website of the week.

2669
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,940
She surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and left and right, and finds a

2670
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:07,480
website that she deems worthy of your attention.

2671
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,120
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be looking at this week?

2672
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:21,280
My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.

2673
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
It's smashmyps3.com.

2674
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:30,760
Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have

2675
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
Smash My PS3.

2676
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:38,680
And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed

2677
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:45,760
young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation

2678
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:53,760
3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting and waiting and waiting for

2679
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,320
their very own PlayStation 3.

2680
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:05,520
Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several

2681
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:13,760
different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said

2682
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:20,920
PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.

2683
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,640
Translated, that means they smash that thing to the ground.

2684
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:30,240
It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.

2685
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:37,040
At abstract translation, a method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.

2686
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,920
Now I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe they did take the second

2687
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:41,920
one and sell it.

2688
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:46,400
Now that their conscience cleared a little bit, out of curiosity, will you be visiting

2689
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,400
SmashMyWe.com?

2690
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:48,400
The sequel?

2691
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,400
No, that will make me cry.

2692
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:56,520
No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny, because there's people who are so

2693
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:02,640
freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.

2694
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:10,600
Yeah, I actually, there's a, you can't get laid, Jiranami, there's actually, there was

2695
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:14,400
a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.

2696
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,960
The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool,

2697
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,960
and I'm looking forward to it.

2698
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,840
There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.

2699
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,960
Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!

2700
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:26,960
Let's pray.

2701
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,240
Say it in commands that I give my soul to Sony.

2702
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:35,560
Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like watching someone

2703
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,360
smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point?

2704
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,480
Wait, does that mean that Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?

2705
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,480
I haven't seen that.

2706
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,680
No, I love Little Nicky!

2707
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:47,680
Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.

2708
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:51,840
Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes, he eats crayons.

2709
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,680
He's like the Pooh of Cthulhu.

2710
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:00,160
He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his

2711
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,200
fecal matter.

2712
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,680
Wow, that's interesting.

2713
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:12,040
Alright, what we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip

2714
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:16,520
here, and it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having

2715
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,560
to hold off on the contest a little bit here.

2716
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,400
We'll fill you in after this taped segment, what we're going to do, we're hoping the rest

2717
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,400
of chat comes back in.

2718
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,520
Rob broke the internet.

2719
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,520
I didn't break it.

2720
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:26,840
I have a backup plan just in case.

2721
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,080
I'll run it by DMN, but we're going to go to this taped bit.

2722
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,440
Dark Soccer and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland, and they

2723
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:37,280
thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?

2724
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,160
So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different

2725
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,160
people.

2726
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,800
So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?

2727
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,560
Well, in the car we were thinking, hey vehicle, I did interview people to see why they're

2728
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,560
out in line.

2729
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:55,900
So I was like, Jamie was keeping our place on the line, and I was going to go play reporter.

2730
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,880
And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.

2731
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,800
I don't like talking to new people.

2732
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,800
I'm pretty shy.

2733
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,120
I am pretty shy around new people.

2734
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,240
So I walked up and I was representing Orange Land.

2735
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:12,080
So I'm like, hi, do you mind if I interview you for orangelandradio.com?

2736
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,080
It's a video game.

2737
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,700
You know, I went through the whole thing, and most of them went, uh, sure.

2738
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,920
So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.

2739
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:21,920
So I'm sorry.

2740
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,160
I'm sorry you have to listen to those.

2741
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,160
No, it's cool.

2742
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,680
So yeah, DMN?

2743
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:30,640
So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.

2744
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:31,640
Good job.

2745
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,640
Oh, yeah.

2746
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,440
Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.

2747
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:41,520
This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Land Radio message line from the line outside Target

2748
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,520
in Citrus Heights, California.

2749
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,520
Say hi, everybody.

2750
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:51,480
So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the

2751
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:52,480
night.

2752
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
So, well, done by our house lesbian.

2753
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,480
Hi.

2754
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:56,480
Hi.

2755
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,480
And, uh, stay tuned to listen.

2756
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,480
Okay, bye-bye.

2757
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:03,840
Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Orange Land Radio.

2758
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,640
I am Chris, also known as DisneyPunk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target

2759
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:10,640
Garden Center, actually.

2760
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,600
We're under the sign that says Garden Center, and there's probably looks to be about 30

2761
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,600
people online.

2762
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,600
I'm going to start at the end, because the end rules.

2763
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,600
Huh.

2764
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,600
It's girls and acts.

2765
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,600
The girls.

2766
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,800
I'm right in front of a guy and a girl, one's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black

2767
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,800
hats on.

2768
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:26,800
One's got an Alcatraz office on.

2769
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,800
That's great.

2770
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,800
So we're going to ask a couple of questions.

2771
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:29,800
First of all, can you state your name?

2772
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,800
Jamie.

2773
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:31,800
Jamie?

2774
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:32,800
Our co-star, Focker, actually, is named Jamie, too.

2775
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:33,800
No, I'm kidding.

2776
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Can I have your name?

2777
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
Aaron.

2778
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
Aaron.

2779
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:46,800
Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at,

2780
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,800
what is it, two, two o'clock in the morning?

2781
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,800
Well, it's my birthday today.

2782
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,800
Thanks.

2783
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,800
I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.

2784
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,000
I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones, because the

2785
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,800
codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.

2786
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:06,800
Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?

2787
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,800
No.

2788
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,800
Definitely not.

2789
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:09,800
Definitely not.

2790
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:10,800
Why not?

2791
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,800
I'm not as interested, really, right now.

2792
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:16,800
Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.

2793
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:17,800
Fair enough.

2794
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:20,800
And can I ask you guys a random question?

2795
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,800
What's your favorite color?

2796
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:23,800
Blue.

2797
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:24,800
Green?

2798
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,800
Okay, those were both wrong answers and you failed.

2799
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:28,800
I'm kidding.

2800
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:29,800
Orange.

2801
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:30,800
Orange, okay.

2802
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,800
Can I ask you, sir, what's your name?

2803
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,800
Nathan.

2804
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,800
Nathan?

2805
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,800
Okay, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?

2806
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,800
Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan,

2807
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:42,800
I grew up on it.

2808
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,800
All right, old school fan.

2809
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,800
Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?

2810
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:49,800
No, absolutely not.

2811
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,800
Okay.

2812
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,800
And here's your obligatory question.

2813
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:56,800
That's a good one.

2814
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,800
I can't really think of an obligatory question.

2815
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,800
What's your favorite color?

2816
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,800
Red.

2817
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,800
Red?

2818
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:02,800
Okay.

2819
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:03,800
That was the right answer.

2820
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,800
You win.

2821
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:07,800
All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.

2822
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,800
There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here and there isn't a big line,

2823
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,800
so good luck.

2824
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,800
Good evening, radio fans.

2825
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:20,800
And this is Kristin again with your Wii.

2826
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:24,800
I guess it would be our cast of our Wii.

2827
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,800
I don't know what you call it.

2828
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,800
But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.

2829
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,800
And I'm here with, can you state your name?

2830
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,800
Sarah.

2831
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,800
Sarah.

2832
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,800
I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line,

2833
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,800
and now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.

2834
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:42,800
But she's probably got the most awesome hat here.

2835
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,800
It's a white hat, like, baseball cap with a Wii.

2836
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,800
It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.

2837
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,800
So can I ask you, she's actually great.

2838
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,800
What's your shirt?

2839
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,800
Donkey Kong.

2840
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,800
That's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.

2841
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:56,800
That's awesome.

2842
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,800
So can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

2843
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,800
Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?

2844
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,800
Actually, how long have you been here?

2845
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:09,800
I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.

2846
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,800
Not too terribly long, yeah.

2847
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:12,800
That's not bad.

2848
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,800
Why do you think the Wii is waiting for just early in the morning?

2849
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,800
Twilight Princess, first of all.

2850
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:23,800
Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while,

2851
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:26,800
and I think it's certainly worth the wait.

2852
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,800
Yep.

2853
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:28,800
Did you get a PS3?

2854
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,800
Oh, hell no.

2855
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,800
Do you see a difference, or is it just the price?

2856
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:40,800
I would not pay $600 to test out an unproven format of disc, no.

2857
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,800
They're getting too big for their shorts.

2858
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:47,800
Oh, you are loved by many Orange Los Angeles nerds.

2859
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,800
Are they all bashed on you all the time?

2860
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,800
And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?

2861
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,800
Blue.

2862
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,800
You fail and lose.

2863
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:58,800
I'm sorry.

2864
01:34:58,800 --> 01:34:59,800
I meant to say orange.

2865
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,800
I meant to say orange.

2866
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,800
Okay, you survived.

2867
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,800
All right, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii,

2868
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:07,800
but I don't think it will be that bad.

2869
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,800
There's not that many people in line.

2870
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,800
Thank you very much.

2871
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:11,800
You're welcome.

2872
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:15,800
Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?

2873
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,800
What is your quest?

2874
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,800
You.

2875
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,800
Cake or death.

2876
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:21,800
Cake, please.

2877
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:22,800
Very well.

2878
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,800
I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question.

2879
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,800
I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions,

2880
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,800
but I was so nervous.

2881
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:34,800
I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them,

2882
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,800
and I just kept, what's your favorite color?

2883
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:38,800
It's all right.

2884
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,800
It's an internet radio show.

2885
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,800
You don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie.

2886
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,800
You still are.

2887
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,800
You're Saint Chris, remember?

2888
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,800
She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.

2889
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,800
No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line

2890
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,800
if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.

2891
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,800
I wanted to, they both, I was trying to help your radio.

2892
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,800
It's fun.

2893
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,800
No, it's funny.

2894
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,800
I like it, because I like hearing people's reactions to it.

2895
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:02,800
No.

2896
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,800
Hell no.

2897
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:06,800
But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later,

2898
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,800
but I just had to interrupt to say that, because that was funny.

2899
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,800
So back to the tape.

2900
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:14,800
Hello, radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people,

2901
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:16,800
in line for the Wii.

2902
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:17,800
Can you guys speak your name?

2903
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
Stella.

2904
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,800
John.

2905
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,800
How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?

2906
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,800
Since, like, nine.

2907
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,800
About, like, eight.

2908
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,800
Okay.

2909
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,800
What's your name?

2910
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,800
Kyle.

2911
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:30,800
Kyle?

2912
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,800
How long have you been here?

2913
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:32,800
Just kind of.

2914
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:37,800
What do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

2915
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,800
What?

2916
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?

2917
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,800
What's so special about it?

2918
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,800
Because it's so kick-ass, and there's Zelda.

2919
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,800
I'm just picking it up for a friend.

2920
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:48,800
Wow.

2921
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,800
Damn, he must owe you, or you owe him.

2922
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,800
Do you owe him money?

2923
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,800
Okay.

2924
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,800
I'm just here for kicks.

2925
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,800
You're just hanging out in the cold.

2926
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,800
All right.

2927
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:05,800
David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?

2928
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,800
No.

2929
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,800
Not unless you drop the prize.

2930
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,800
Okay.

2931
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:14,800
He's just here for kicks.

2932
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:15,800
All right.

2933
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,800
And your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?

2934
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:19,800
Green.

2935
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,800
Plaid.

2936
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,800
Yellow.

2937
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,800
Yellow?

2938
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:23,800
Okay.

2939
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:24,800
You win.

2940
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:25,800
Plaid wins.

2941
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:26,800
All right.

2942
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,800
Well, thank you, guys.

2943
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,800
If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock

2944
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
tonight, or we're on podcast.

2945
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,800
You can download it on iTunes.

2946
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,800
Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, so it should be fun.

2947
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,800
Yay, Wii.

2948
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,800
Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but this is the next one.

2949
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,800
This is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.

2950
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:46,800
But we're interviewing people at the Wii.

2951
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,800
So, Jamie, stop talking to people.

2952
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,800
What?

2953
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,800
Okay.

2954
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,800
State your name, please.

2955
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,800
DarkSlashTheGreatAndMighty.

2956
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,800
That was pretty pathetic.

2957
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:58,800
Write my act.

2958
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,800
Literally?

2959
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:00,800
Yeah.

2960
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:01,800
In public.

2961
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:02,800
Okay.

2962
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,800
And you get to be asked these questions, too.

2963
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,800
First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

2964
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,800
I was bored.

2965
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:10,800
Okay.

2966
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:13,800
Yeah, you're not bad at it.

2967
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:14,800
All right.

2968
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:15,800
Are you getting a PS3?

2969
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:16,800
Yeah.

2970
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:17,800
Okay, okay.

2971
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:25,800
We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a traitor and preordered one, but right before

2972
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:26,800
he clicked GameStop.

2973
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:27,800
You guys actually get it?

2974
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:28,800
No, we're getting a second shipment.

2975
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,800
I don't care, because Sony sucks my butt.

2976
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,800
Here from her.

2977
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,800
Sony sucks.

2978
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,800
Your obligatory question.

2979
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:33,800
Can you peel potatoes correctly?

2980
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:47,800
You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama,

2981
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:51,800
and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.

2982
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:55,800
Nintendo, please give her money.

2983
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:59,800
Better living than Nintendo, I'm now the aluminum chef.

2984
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:00,800
Uh-huh.

2985
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,800
Hey, Jory.

2986
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,800
Thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.

2987
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,800
I go on to the next step.

2988
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:11,800
Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the Wii line at Target.

2989
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:15,800
And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are, or one of them at least, who's apparently

2990
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:18,800
a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second.

2991
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:19,800
I want to get closer to him.

2992
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,800
They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.

2993
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,800
I've lost five of them.

2994
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:24,800
Yeah, a lot of them.

2995
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,800
I just think that that's like old school.

2996
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:28,800
Yeah.

2997
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,800
All right, all right.

2998
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,800
Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.

2999
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,800
What's your name?

3000
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,800
Jory.

3001
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:37,800
Jory.

3002
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,800
What's your name?

3003
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,800
ratio.

3004
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:40,800
Jory started laughing.

3005
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,800
Jordan.

3006
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:42,800
Okay, Jordan.

3007
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:53,800
All right, can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at two in the morning?

3008
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,800
We want the Wii.

3009
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,800
We want the Wii.

3010
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,800
We want the Wii.

3011
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,800
Why do you want the Wii so badly?

3012
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:58,800
Twilight Princess.

3013
01:39:58,800 --> 01:39:59,800
Twilight Princess.

3014
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,800
And you?

3015
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,800
Twilight Princess.

3016
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,800
Twilight Princess.

3017
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:03,800
That's right.

3018
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:04,800
Cora!

3019
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:05,800
Can I get your name?

3020
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,800
Kristen.

3021
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,800
Travis?

3022
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:08,800
Travis.

3023
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:12,800
Why are you out here?

3024
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,800
Did you get a Wii for his brother?

3025
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,800
He owe him money?

3026
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,800
No, I'm just a good friend, and that's broke.

3027
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:44,080
I'm going to ask you guys to get a PS3, or planning on getting a PS3?

3028
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,080
Maybe $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.

3029
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:49,080
That's the only game I will be getting today.

3030
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,080
Now.

3031
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,080
Now.

3032
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,080
I'll borrow his metal gear.

3033
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,080
Yeah, I'll borrow mine.

3034
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,080
No.

3035
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,080
No PS3.

3036
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:56,080
No.

3037
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,080
Yeah.

3038
01:40:57,080 --> 01:40:58,080
Final fantasy is 13.

3039
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:59,080
To be 18 to mark.

3040
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:00,080
Alright.

3041
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,080
And here's your biggest question.

3042
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,080
What's your favorite color?

3043
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,080
Blue.

3044
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:04,080
No.

3045
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:05,080
Brown.

3046
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,080
You fail.

3047
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,080
You fail.

3048
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,080
Green.

3049
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,080
Okay, that's correct.

3050
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:10,080
Blue.

3051
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,080
No, you don't.

3052
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:12,080
Fail.

3053
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,080
Fail.

3054
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,080
Fail.

3055
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,080
Fail.

3056
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,080
Fail.

3057
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:17,080
Fail.

3058
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:18,080
Fail.

3059
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,080
Fail.

3060
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,080
Fail.

3061
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,080
Fail.

3062
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,080
Fail.

3063
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,080
Black.

3064
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,080
Ah, that's.

3065
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,080
Baby blue.

3066
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,080
No.

3067
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,080
Oh, I like you.

3068
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,080
Alright.

3069
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:34,360
Alright, I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a dark soccer fanboy

3070
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,360
apparently.

3071
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,360
So, I'll be there in a second.

3072
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,360
Hello, radio listeners.

3073
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:42,480
I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized

3074
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:44,480
Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.

3075
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,800
So, can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?

3076
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,920
Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.

3077
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:51,920
You're not in the chat at all?

3078
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:52,920
Okay, but you are a listener?

3079
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:53,920
Archive listener.

3080
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:54,920
Awesome.

3081
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:58,920
Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m. for a week?

3082
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,920
Oh, wait.

3083
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:00,920
The we?

3084
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:01,920
I thought it was in the PHP line.

3085
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,920
No, I'm getting a we.

3086
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:03,920
Okay, why are you getting a we?

3087
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:04,920
Spongebob.

3088
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:05,920
Wait, wait.

3089
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:06,920
I also hear Zelda's pretty good.

3090
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:07,920
Zelda's.

3091
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,920
Okay.

3092
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:09,920
Well, we'll buy that.

3093
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,920
Alright.

3094
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:11,920
Are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?

3095
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:12,920
I'll probably buy a PS3.

3096
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:18,920
My friends get it all the way but I'm not gonna buy it myself.

3097
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:19,920
Okay.

3098
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:20,920
I see.

3099
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:21,920
What's your favorite color?

3100
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:22,920
Brown.

3101
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:23,920
Brown, yeah.

3102
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:24,920
No, hold on.

3103
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:25,920
I put white.

3104
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,920
Loki is displeased with you.

3105
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:27,920
Loki is displeased with you.

3106
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:28,920
He's a Microsoft fan.

3107
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:35,920
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.

3108
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,480
Loki is displeased with you.

3109
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,080
Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.

3110
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,240
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.

3111
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,840
I like Microsoft.

3112
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:45,040
Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?

3113
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,760
It's amazing.

3114
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,440
What's your favorite part?

3115
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:50,680
I like Epus of the Week.

3116
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,080
Jamie has just informed us that he came up with that.

3117
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:55,160
It's funny because I always talk about the roads

3118
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,720
of Sacramento.

3119
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,400
I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.

3120
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:58,720
So it's pretty cool.

3121
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,760
Awesome.

3122
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:03,560
Is there anything you can, any advice you'd want to give Rob,

3123
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:05,880
Jamie, and Loki?

3124
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,840
Yeah, I'd love to go snowboarding.

3125
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,640
Yeah, I'd go snowboarding more often.

3126
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:13,760
More snowboarding inside the gaming news.

3127
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:14,720
I see.

3128
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:19,800
Can I give you a hint of another thing to mention to them?

3129
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,720
To any of you guys, I would mention more lesbians

3130
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,200
on the show.

3131
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,040
Oh, yeah, I'd love to do it now.

3132
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:26,960
Aw.

3133
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,200
All right, we have to move on.

3134
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,680
I've got another group of people to answer that.

3135
01:43:30,680 --> 01:43:33,680
More lesbians.

3136
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:34,520
Aw, that didn't work.

3137
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:35,720
OK.

3138
01:43:35,720 --> 01:43:37,400
All right, I'll move on to the next group.

3139
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,080
Thank you, guys.

3140
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:39,480
Hello, Orange Land listeners.

3141
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,400
I am at the front of the line.

3142
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:46,520
Somebody just yelled something.

3143
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:47,360
That was interesting.

3144
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,560
Anyway, I am at the front of the line

3145
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,160
with some people playing monoculars.

3146
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,680
And I actually haven't gotten an OK to interview all of them,

3147
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:54,560
but let's start.

3148
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,200
Can I interview her?

3149
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:56,720
OK.

3150
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:57,680
Can I get your name?

3151
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:58,680
I'm Nick.

3152
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:00,520
Nick, I got some logo t-shirts.

3153
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,560
Rod.

3154
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,640
Barnsworth.

3155
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,840
Hey, Eric.

3156
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:06,400
Katie.

3157
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,360
Katie.

3158
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,640
I like to go by Eepus.

3159
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,640
Eepus?

3160
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:10,400
Gotcha.

3161
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,840
Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you

3162
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,200
to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?

3163
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,400
We just needed a cool place to play Monopoly.

3164
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:22,880
Oh.

3165
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,440
No, seriously.

3166
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:27,360
What's the Wii worth waiting for?

3167
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,760
Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.

3168
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:32,480
I mean, that's all we're really doing.

3169
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:33,880
We had nothing else better to do.

3170
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:37,280
Just hanging out with friends, playing games,

3171
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,240
and we really want the Wii, I guess.

3172
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:41,120
Why do you really want the Wii?

3173
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,840
Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.

3174
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,800
Nothing better to do next weekend.

3175
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,440
That works.

3176
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,520
I want to fit in.

3177
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,360
I want to be in the in crowd.

3178
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:52,040
You're not cool unless you have a Wii.

3179
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,720
Exactly.

3180
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:53,240
OK.

3181
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,920
That's going to be so much fun out of you, Barrett.

3182
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:58,040
Do you want to come back?

3183
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:58,520
Yeah.

3184
01:44:58,520 --> 01:44:59,280
OK.

3185
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,600
I heard it actually increases sexual performance.

3186
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:04,440
Yeah.

3187
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:08,960
With the wrist movements.

3188
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,760
No, with the wrist movements.

3189
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,880
The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.

3190
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,360
I think that's the most interesting answer

3191
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,800
I've gotten yet.

3192
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,440
I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way

3193
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:25,760
of innovating the game system.

3194
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,080
And that's the most intelligent one at the table.

3195
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,560
OK.

3196
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:31,840
All right.

3197
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,840
Can I ask you guys, is he getting a PS3 at all?

3198
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,520
Or what do you think about it?

3199
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,720
If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay $600 on it.

3200
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,280
The one that goes down in price.

3201
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:42,120
Hang on, I'm moving.

3202
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:44,440
You mean the piece of shit three that already have glitches?

3203
01:45:44,440 --> 01:45:45,200
Yeah, pretty much.

3204
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,880
Oh, whoa.

3205
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,200
That's what you better bring in.

3206
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,960
Yeah, I'll be getting one.

3207
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:54,600
Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's

3208
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,120
going to glitch, and $600 for something

3209
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,360
that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once

3210
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:00,840
in a while?

3211
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:01,560
Yeah, I don't know.

3212
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,800
Yeah, that's like getting a hooker downtown

3213
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,040
than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.

3214
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:08,960
OK, I like this table.

3215
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,280
These people are interesting.

3216
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,280
OK, you guys get an obligatory question.

3217
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,400
What's your favorite color?

3218
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,280
Clear.

3219
01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:15,680
Fail.

3220
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,720
Blonde.

3221
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:19,360
I'll accept that.

3222
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,000
Corn yellow.

3223
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,520
Interesting, I accept.

3224
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,240
Damn it, you stole mine.

3225
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:26,000
Fail.

3226
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,600
I'll pick.

3227
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:28,880
I like pink, OK.

3228
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,080
Light purple.

3229
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:33,200
OK, I'll accept that.

3230
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:36,640
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.

3231
01:46:36,640 --> 01:46:38,240
Well, thank you guys for being with me.

3232
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,240
Good luck.

3233
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:40,640
All right, that was our last one.

3234
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:42,880
They are at the front of the line.

3235
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,120
And I'll call one more time to tell you

3236
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,120
how I feel about all this, if anyone really gives a shit.

3237
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,280
So, all right, thanks.

3238
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,480
Hello, Orange Toys R' Us, and this is the last one.

3239
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,840
I'll be making these, because I bet you're just sick of them,

3240
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:56,840
and sick of me.

3241
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:59,600
But you get one more little tidbit,

3242
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,360
and that is from Moi, your tokenar lesbian at the show.

3243
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:07,760
I'm actually out here because a bunch of people

3244
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,000
are waiting out in line.

3245
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,600
And they look cold, and they do not

3246
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:16,760
look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.

3247
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:20,320
So Jamie and I actually offered to get them a coffee

3248
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:23,000
and donuts, and that's pretty much why I'm out here,

3249
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,240
is because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.

3250
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,400
That's the only reason.

3251
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,880
And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too, so whatever.

3252
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,480
I actually never played Zelda before.

3253
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,760
I never got to, because my daddy did not let me.

3254
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:37,160
I was a deprived child.

3255
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:41,120
So anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.

3256
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:42,240
Disney Punk.

3257
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:47,000
And this is in front of Target, reporting for the Wii line.

3258
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,440
And just to let you know, there's

3259
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,240
a Best Buy right across the way.

3260
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:52,280
And that line's like 10 times the longer.

3261
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:56,440
And that amuses me.

3262
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:58,640
But this line's cooler, because they're getting coffee

3263
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:01,560
and donuts soon.

3264
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:06,880
All right, have fun out there in the ethernet.

3265
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,360
All right, thank you, Chris.

3266
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,680
I know some of the folks in the chat room were like,

3267
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:11,880
oh, this is long.

3268
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:12,480
This is long.

3269
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,920
You guys are talking to too damn many people.

3270
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:14,560
I am so sorry.

3271
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,640
Don't be sorry, because you know what?

3272
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,400
Usagi hit the air.

3273
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:19,800
Usagi, I say Usagi.

3274
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,200
Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to help.

3275
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,600
But no, she's right on here, because the quote here

3276
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:28,240
is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all

3277
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:30,040
about, the best people on Earth.

3278
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,040
And that's exactly it.

3279
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,600
That's what made last night so fun,

3280
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:35,120
was just meeting other nerds.

3281
01:48:35,120 --> 01:48:36,480
It was really amazing.

3282
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,640
They were so nice.

3283
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:40,640
And they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.

3284
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,160
And it was really important to interview.

3285
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:45,760
There weren't that many people in line, considering.

3286
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,400
And it's like, well, there's not that many people.

3287
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,700
We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on.

3288
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,080
And Rob can edit it later.

3289
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:53,000
But it was just really fun meeting all of them.

3290
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,880
They all said thanks.

3291
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,600
And they all asked, so when is it going to be played?

3292
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:58,280
It was like, I think some of them are in here now.

3293
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,400
I saw Ace Ender earlier.

3294
01:48:59,400 --> 01:48:59,920
Oh, he's back.

3295
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,060
So that must have been that whole net split thing came back.

3296
01:49:02,060 --> 01:49:03,720
And some of those other people said, do you got some votes?

3297
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,200
Oh, hi.

3298
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:07,280
I have to say, too, the group that

3299
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,320
let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.

3300
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,720
You guys were infinitely awesome.

3301
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,480
Thank you so much.

3302
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,880
Sources of amusement and kept me from passing out.

3303
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,440
The entire night, the people just

3304
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,200
that were right next to us and right behind us,

3305
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,040
they just were so nice.

3306
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,840
Somebody kept walking up and down, just talking to us.

3307
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,920
Everybody was so nice.

3308
01:49:24,920 --> 01:49:26,440
It was like one big block party.

3309
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,880
It was really cold.

3310
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:31,440
It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.

3311
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,280
Yeah, it was so fun.

3312
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,400
I was hearing the single best commentary

3313
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:36,320
coming from that game of Risk.

3314
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,320
That was the best.

3315
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:40,880
Yeah, every now and then you'd hear that collective, oh!

3316
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,480
And every so often, I would ask, who took over the world yet?

3317
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:48,520
I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday.

3318
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,320
Oh, man.

3319
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:52,320
I just took Australia, motherfucker.

3320
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,720
The BTF, mate.

3321
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:56,680
All right.

3322
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,520
Now, of course, the chat room is asking.

3323
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,240
We're running a little long this segment,

3324
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:03,200
but the chat room is asking, when do we get to win the damn

3325
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,160
Wii?

3326
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,000
All right.

3327
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,400
Shut up.

3328
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:07,880
This just in.

3329
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,280
We're changing it up on you.

3330
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,120
Having the net split earlier in the show

3331
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,300
made us realize that maybe the chat room isn't

3332
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:15,680
the best process.

3333
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,600
So we are going to change it just a little bit.

3334
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:19,240
We can do that because, you know what?

3335
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:21,760
It's DMN's Wii, and he's giving it away out

3336
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,040
of the goodness of his heart.

3337
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:24,920
This was not something that was given to him.

3338
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:27,800
This was not something that he bought this with his own money,

3339
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,800
and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?

3340
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:30,200
Yes.

3341
01:50:30,200 --> 01:50:31,840
Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners,

3342
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:32,620
something like that.

3343
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:34,120
So we can do whatever rules we want.

3344
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:36,240
So here's the new rules.

3345
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:37,640
It's easy, and it's still fair.

3346
01:50:37,640 --> 01:50:38,600
There's the AP and it's wins.

3347
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:39,100
Go.

3348
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:39,600
No, no, no.

3349
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:40,400
No, I'm just kidding.

3350
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:41,280
So here it is.

3351
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,720
Now, instead of sending me a private message in chat,

3352
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,020
here's what you're going to do.

3353
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:48,040
Remember, this only applies to folks listening live

3354
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:48,960
Sunday night.

3355
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,240
This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast

3356
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:51,800
on all games.

3357
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,400
This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes

3358
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:58,120
or whatever program you use to download our audio archive

3359
01:50:58,120 --> 01:50:59,000
later on.

3360
01:50:59,000 --> 01:50:59,640
OK, here it is.

3361
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:01,280
If you're listening Sunday night and you

3362
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:03,280
want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.

3363
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,780
Send an email, one email.

3364
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:08,680
If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.

3365
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:11,320
If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP.

3366
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:13,940
You will be disqualified, and you don't have much time

3367
01:51:13,940 --> 01:51:14,760
to pull any tricks.

3368
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:15,520
So here it is.

3369
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:22,280
Send one email to wiicontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T,

3370
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:27,200
at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone

3371
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:29,840
number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you

3372
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,600
on air, or a Skype name will do as well.

3373
01:51:32,600 --> 01:51:36,120
And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in,

3374
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:38,120
and we'll be drawing a very random one

3375
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:41,520
when we kick off part B. All right?

3376
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,680
Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast,

3377
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:45,480
you're going to have to wait a day.

3378
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,720
All right.

3379
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:48,080
Sucks for you.

3380
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,080
All right, so we will be back soon

3381
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:54,040
to determine the winner of the Wii contest.

3382
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,040
And for those of you who got, yep, you do it now.

3383
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,800
Right now, we're going to have like five minutes

3384
01:51:58,800 --> 01:51:59,600
to get it in there.

3385
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:00,120
Go, hurry.

3386
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:02,000
What the hell are you doing listening to us?

3387
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Open up your email and freaking email us.

3388
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,720
All right, nope, subject does not

3389
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,220
have to be any particular something.

3390
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,400
We just opened up the email address for that.

3391
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:10,040
Send one email.

3392
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:11,720
But the more you suck up to me.

3393
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,220
With your screen name and your number,

3394
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:16,120
we're going to give away the Wii right at the top of part B.

3395
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:16,800
So that's it.

3396
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,600
Oh, yes, Chris?

3397
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,920
If you send a naked picture with it,

3398
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,400
you know, extra bonus points.

3399
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:22,080
Of me.

3400
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:22,880
Stop, stop.

3401
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,600
All right.

3402
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:25,120
Boobs only, please.

3403
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,400
All right, we'll be back in a little bit

3404
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:28,400
to find out the winner.

3405
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,360
Those of you listening to us on the audio archive,

3406
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,600
we'll be back in about a day.

3407
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,440
And you can hear the exciting conclusion.

3408
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:34,800
Those of you guys on All Games Radio

3409
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:35,760
are listening on Sunday night.

3410
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:36,340
Stick around.

3411
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:37,600
We'll be right back.

3412
