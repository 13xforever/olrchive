00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Tonight, November 19th, 2006.

2
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:25,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Our own stories from the console lineups, a recent horror game causes controversy in Rome, and for those not ready to go to next gen, there's Dreamcast Love coming for ya.

3
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:33,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio

00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:02,481
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers,

5
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunami, Orange Lounge Radio 1 and Only

6
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:44,448
[SPEAKER_06]: or the Isle of Lesbos, as I was saying over dinner.

7
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:44,769
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

8
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:08,000
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyway, also say hello to somebody who's come from a long way away.

9
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly not the Isle of Lesbos, but the Isle of Redmond, Washington.

10
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:15,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to Mr. DMN, John.

11
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:16,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.

12
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys know John because he calls into our show like all the frickin' time.

13
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:20,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

14
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:21,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do.

15
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:26,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And now he's here in studio with us.

16
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm actually going to call when the Skyplane's open.

17
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:29,358
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

18
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:29,638
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

19
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:30,158
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

20
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:32,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do it right now, hold on.

21
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,217
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:40,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day?

23
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium.

24
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:46,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And where do you work for a first-time listener?

25
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:51,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I work at the magical land where wheeze flow like wine, Nintendo.

26
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:53,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

27
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:53,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

28
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:55,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Last I checked.

29
00:02:56,344 --> 00:03:00,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I sometimes have WeFlo when I drink a lot of wine, but I don't... Alright, forget it.

30
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:00,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad joke.

31
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:05,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days, you're all gonna just die.

32
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,367
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway, well, welcome to the show, DMN.

33
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

34
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.

35
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:15,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, just having him here in the studio and, like, hanging out with us all weekend, it just proves, Orange Launch Radio listeners, stalking us works.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,550
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does.

37
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:16,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

38
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Because here he is, and he violated me last night, and it was... No, I'm just kidding.

39
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally joking.

40
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:23,733
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not what you said.

41
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:25,013
[SPEAKER_06]: You were... You were...

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,101
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

43
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:55,483
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

45
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,262
[SPEAKER_06]: and we invite you guys to be nerdy with us.

46
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,604
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, come to our chat room if you're listening to us live here on Sunday night.

47
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:39,506
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not listening to us on our audio blog, you can come join us in the chat room.

48
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:42,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It's chat.orangelunchradio.com and guess what?

49
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:49,612
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are listening live on this Sunday night, you definitely want to be here tonight because DMN, what did you bring with you for one of our random chatters tonight?

50
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:50,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought a Wii.

51
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:53,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Not my Wii, you sickos.

52
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:55,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your head out of the gutter.

53
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,476
[SPEAKER_08]: No, a Wii and a box with

54
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:58,352
[SPEAKER_08]: and all that fun stuff.

55
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:02,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do know we have a worldwide audience, but it should be said this is a U.S.

56
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:03,174
[SPEAKER_08]: region Wii.

57
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:11,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is a region one Wii, so I'm really sorry to all you Japanese, South American, Antarctican, European listeners.

58
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:13,937
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably won't do you much good.

59
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:14,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

60
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,978
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you want to win it that badly, you know.

61
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:18,200
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you got to be in chat.

62
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be at some point tonight, more rules to come later.

63
00:05:21,383 --> 00:05:30,911
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, we usually start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, but obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted by other madness going on out there.

64
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:36,196
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be the craziness going on around the PlayStation 3 and Wii lineups.

65
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:38,038
[SPEAKER_06]: So first off, PlayStation 3.

66
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:43,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of us here in this room weren't really going to do the campout thing for the PlayStation 3.

67
00:05:43,363 --> 00:05:46,626
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've voiced previously on the program, I'm not ready for PlayStation 3.

68
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:49,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, there's no game out right now I really want.

69
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:57,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Wake Me When Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, some of the big franchises are on their way, but I'm not into PS3 right now, and I think Loki's in a very similar camp.

70
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:58,654
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

71
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:24,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you see, I don't understand DarkSakura, because you tend to go back and forth.

72
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:28,498
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, some days you're very anti-PlayStation, some days you're very like, you better bring me that damn PlayStation.

73
00:06:28,558 --> 00:06:30,320
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I hate it, okay?

74
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate it.

75
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,042
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have to have every video game system that comes out.

76
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:33,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

77
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:38,087
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's the collector in me that says, I want, and besides that, I want to play White Knights when it's out.

78
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:41,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the hate for Sony PlayStation right now?

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Ken Kudrag eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet and is leashed to the jungle gym.

80
00:06:45,093 --> 00:06:46,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I see, I see.

81
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:47,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Megzy.

82
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But certain games are going to change your mind, like White Nights and things are going to change your mind later?

83
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:53,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, White Nights I definitely want to play.

84
00:06:54,244 --> 00:07:02,869
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a few other things that I'm sort of curious about, but right now not curious enough that I would go out and wait in line for a PS3.

85
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,272
[SPEAKER_13]: One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date.

86
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

87
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to interview him Monday.

88
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:14,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this is a lot of controversy going around around the PlayStation 3 launch.

89
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:19,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Did your co-worker actually wait in the line to get a PlayStation 3 to play, or were they getting one to sell?

90
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:20,636
[SPEAKER_13]: He was getting one to play.

91
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:22,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, that's admirable.

92
00:07:22,517 --> 00:07:23,117
[SPEAKER_13]: He got Madden.

93
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:24,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I see.

94
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a sports game fan.

95
00:07:25,499 --> 00:07:26,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can see that.

96
00:07:26,739 --> 00:07:32,383
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a hardcore sports game, you want to have the up graphics and all that cool stuff that comes with the new system.

97
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:33,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I see that.

98
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:38,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so more to come on PlayStation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers.

99
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I can say this.

100
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:43,645
[SPEAKER_06]: I did touch the demo station they had at Target.

101
00:07:44,105 --> 00:07:48,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I randomly went to Target on, I think it was Wednesday I went there, Wednesday night.

102
00:07:48,949 --> 00:07:52,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house, like shampoo and stuff.

103
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was already a line forming for the PlayStation 3.

104
00:07:55,153 --> 00:07:55,954
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just said hi.

105
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, PlayStation 3, right?

106
00:07:57,555 --> 00:07:58,196
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all, yeah.

107
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, they were, you know, having fun just camping out.

108
00:08:01,257 --> 00:08:01,778
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

109
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:12,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta be honest, guys, I'm not feeling it.

110
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it.

111
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, again, I'm playing this in a Target.

112
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:20,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sitting down on my couch with my, you know, surround and the HD and all that stuff.

113
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:22,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I wasn't feeling that.

114
00:08:22,088 --> 00:08:26,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like, I don't know, Burnout's more of a racer for me, or even Test Drive was better.

115
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wasn't feeling the Motorstorm.

116
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:32,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, granted, it's a different, it's, you know, a very different type of racer, but even, it felt kind of...

117
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

118
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,904
[SPEAKER_06]: That probably is the game I would pick up.

119
00:08:53,085 --> 00:08:53,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be that game.

120
00:08:54,105 --> 00:09:06,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards the sports gamers and the hardcore because you usually see the people who, especially the sports games, who just come and will buy it without hesitation.

121
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:12,401
[SPEAKER_08]: They always have the stupid Madden day where people, I've heard, camp out for it if that is the case.

122
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:15,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of sad, but yeah, I see your point.

123
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:16,965
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

124
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so that was pretty much PlayStation 3.

125
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:21,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week?

126
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:23,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you play a demo station or anything?

127
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I went by the Best Buy.

128
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, today it was funny because I went down there and it was completely dead and the station was open.

129
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:34,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw Motorstorm, but it looks exactly the same when I saw it at E3.

130
00:09:34,918 --> 00:09:40,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the videos I've seen online look really cool and it made me want to get it at some point.

131
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,204
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I don't know.

132
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we saw that Lair...

133
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:53,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the demonstration thing going on at Walmart that was frozen on Saturday.

134
00:09:54,603 --> 00:10:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I don't really know how well the demo kiosks are working, but at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen, so I don't know.

135
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:07,461
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

136
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:12,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go to the chat room over at chat.orangelunchradio.com for some comments from our chatters.

137
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:13,762
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like the invisible guests.

138
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,203
[SPEAKER_06]: We love to be an interactive show.

139
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there.

140
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

141
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:23,964
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTaw1 says, Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mere toy?

142
00:10:24,964 --> 00:10:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Not when there's a profit to be made, as some people found out with PlayStation 3.

143
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:30,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really their mere motivation.

144
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:33,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, hey, I make more money doing this than I do at my job.

145
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:33,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

146
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, personally, I don't know.

147
00:10:36,673 --> 00:10:41,438
[SPEAKER_06]: The little angel that sits on my shoulder says, not a good idea, so I don't do it.

148
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things.

149
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:50,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Black Lab in our chatroom says, congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot.

150
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,914
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some crazy news about those PlayStation 3 lines we'll get to a little bit later.

151
00:10:55,495 --> 00:11:04,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so after the PlayStation 3 launch, obviously, then the Wii line started forming, and that's kind of where we come in, because I think we've also voiced previously on the program that we have played Wii.

152
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:17,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii is the cheaper option, and as we said earlier in the program, you know, we do this show as a hobby, not a job, so, you know, our day jobs only give us so much money, so the Wii is really, realistically, in my eyes, the more affordable console anyway.

153
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up.

154
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But Loki, you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii.

155
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:23,645
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a Wii before a lot of people did.

156
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:24,305
[SPEAKER_06]: How did this happen?

157
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I work for a video and game distributor, and of course we get ours in early, like on Wednesdays when we got them in, so that we could ship them to our customers so that they would have them for the street date.

158
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:46,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And me being the greedy bastard that I am, I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City, and so I had mine on Thursday.

159
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:49,947
[SPEAKER_05]: and playing it ever since.

160
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know what this meant, boys and girls.

161
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:54,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Party at Loki's house on Friday.

162
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:56,269
[SPEAKER_06]: So, right on.

163
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we played a little bit of the Wii there.

164
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So then flash forward to last night when the real camping started.

165
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:09,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us were at dinner and we were at Strings and this little local Italian place.

166
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:11,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep forgetting we're an international show so not everybody knows that.

167
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:16,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were just sitting around and I don't know, like lightning just kind of struck and we were just kind of like

168
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:23,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, let's go buy cookies and orange soda and go around to lines and just hand out goodies.

169
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:28,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just go and talk to gamers, and Loki can tape it, maybe we can do a YouTube thing, and we'll just hand him stuff.

170
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:39,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, you read all those reports about people getting shot and stuff, but we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line that a lot more people were being very cordial, so we were like, let's go have fun, let's go meet some more nerds.

171
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,075
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did.

172
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:46,117
[SPEAKER_06]: We started at a local Target, we went to a Walmart, we went to GameStop, where people were lining up for the midnight launch.

173
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

174
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,202
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, what did you think about our little experience doing the cookie patrol?

175
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:07,722
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that was a lot of fun.

176
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:11,404
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to interact with a lot of people who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii.

177
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:20,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly think that most of those people in that line were there to play it, not to eBay it, whereas opposed to the PS3 people that are thinking, ooh, I can make double what I bought off this.

178
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line.

179
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,391
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of these people were really good in line.

180
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:26,992
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a lot of fun.

181
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,193
[SPEAKER_08]: They seem to be very grateful for the cookies.

182
00:13:29,694 --> 00:13:32,596
[SPEAKER_08]: So if any of you are listening, hi and we love you.

183
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:34,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, very cool.

184
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:38,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, one of our favorite, now we liked a lot of the people that we met.

185
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was kind of weird because we would walk up at first and some people were like, what are these guys going to do to us?

186
00:13:43,664 --> 00:13:45,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have big BB guns or what's going to happen?

187
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,386
[SPEAKER_06]: You're poisoning the cookies, Rob.

188
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You're poisoning the cookies so you can get your wiggy.

189
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:50,965
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

190
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,937
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

192
00:14:29,437 --> 00:14:32,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So getting back into this where Chris and Jamie, no, it's cool, it's cool.

193
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:38,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So I called Jamie on my phone because I asked the Target Greatland line, I go, how many units are you guys getting here?

194
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, 60.

195
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,661
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm looking at the line, I'm like, there's only like 25 people in this line.

196
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,342
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a great opportunity to line up.

197
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: So I called Jamie on my cell and I said, girl, if you want a Wii, get your butt down here.

198
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get a Wii.

199
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:53,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happened?

200
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:54,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I interrupted something you were doing.

201
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:56,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody else had

202
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:10,223
[SPEAKER_13]: This was just basically me being exhausted already, and somebody else said, oh yeah, the Target Greatlands are doing a midnight lunch, which part of my brain went bullshit, but the rest of me was so tired that I was like, yay, I'm gonna go!

203
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:23,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We were actually, my friend Marissa, who I mentioned on the show a few times, she was in town, and she's a singer-songwriter from LA, and there was a singer-songwriter convention going on, just actually a few, at the, what was it, the...

204
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:25,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Marriott?

205
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the Marriott.

206
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, we don't need to tell them all where I live.

207
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:28,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

208
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

209
00:15:31,549 --> 00:15:33,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were exhausted.

210
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:34,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very claustrophobic.

211
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,671
[SPEAKER_03]: They had blocked off an entire section just for the musicians, and everyone was like, oh, man.

212
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:40,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Jamie calls me on my phone.

213
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,052
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, oh, where are you?

214
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm at the end of the hall.

215
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:45,893
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, oh, we need to go to Target right now.

216
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, are you sick or something?

217
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just like, oh, it's like, where are you going to get a Wii?

218
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,079
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay.

219
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,501
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I'm hanging out with her, she's my ride, and I wasn't really expecting to get one.

220
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Part of me was excited, too, because Megzi called earlier.

221
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:04,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, Megzi.

222
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,042
[SPEAKER_13]: And was humping her Wii.

223
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:07,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, she's like, I'm touching it!

224
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:08,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm touching it!

225
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:11,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That was her on the phone.

226
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:11,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, really funny.

227
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:14,262
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura!

228
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, really funny.

229
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she parked and said, can we hang out with you guys?

230
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:43,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And then someone, like, she wasn't really in the, you know, in the zone.

231
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:46,942
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me clarify, DarkSakura used her celebrity to cut in line.

232
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she was, you're a bitch, Jamie.

233
00:16:49,324 --> 00:16:49,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a bitch.

234
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:50,224
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

235
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:50,945
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she's not.

236
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:56,629
[SPEAKER_06]: She wouldn't have done it if, I mean, they were getting 60, and there was only like 20 people in line, so, you know, nobody was getting hurt, so.

237
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:03,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But we ended up going there, and slowly it dawned on me, this is not a midnight launch, because it was like a half an hour until midnight.

238
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:04,075
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't like a full launch.

239
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,328
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 11.30 something.

240
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:10,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Jamie, this isn't a midnight launch.

241
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,993
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, it's not.

242
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I was, again, already tired of having been around that many people.

243
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,658
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really claustrophobic where we were with Marissa.

244
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:24,660
[SPEAKER_03]: But we jumbled things around.

245
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,143
[SPEAKER_03]: We ended up, what we were going to do is we were going to go back, wait with them until morning.

246
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:30,944
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like at 1 o'clock.

247
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:38,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We were going to wait with them, and then at one point I was going to go for coffee and donuts, which started off really weird, I just said, because we had to leave and go get stuff.

248
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,002
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, does anybody want anything while I'm gone?

249
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:46,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone's like, oh, the eyes kind of looked and went, huh?

250
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:47,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's getting something?

251
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, does anyone want coffee?

252
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody went, me?! !

253
00:17:52,552 --> 00:18:00,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing we've kind of discovered through this whole process is that people are really not used to other people just wanting to do nice things for them.

254
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:04,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone was so shocked that I offered to get... Someone actually brought out their money.

255
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, no, it's on me.

256
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, oh... They looked at me with the weirdest look like I was giving them a razor.

257
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so... Yeah, that kind of razor.

258
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, killing yourself razor.

259
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:16,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the phone.

260
00:18:17,152 --> 00:18:18,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's so...

261
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:26,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and by the time we got back and we waited until like 3.30, I said, all right, I'm going to go get coffee.

262
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And I counted how many people were in line, and it was like just under 30, but to be safe, I said 35.

263
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:37,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went to the Shell station down the street and said, I need 35 cups of coffee.

264
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:38,403
[SPEAKER_03]: And they...

265
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:43,297
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave me free powdered creamer and free sugar.

266
00:18:43,578 --> 00:18:46,701
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the stuff that they have for that store only, for the Shell station.

267
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:48,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you buy 35 cups of coffee, you get this free.

268
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:51,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay.

269
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:55,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bought some other creamer, and I came back, and everyone was like, oh, coffee!

270
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:57,832
[SPEAKER_03]: They were really, really, really happy.

271
00:18:57,892 --> 00:18:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, courtesy of Orange Lingerie, yeah.

272
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,905
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

273
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,210
[SPEAKER_03]: and so I said, okay, I get coffee.

274
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,952
[SPEAKER_06]: But it didn't end there because you got donuts too.

275
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I got crispy.

276
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:28,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I got six.

277
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:36,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what happened was I bought too much coffee and where the Target is, there's a Best Buy just like in the same parking structure.

278
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,906
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, well, I've got too much coffee so I'm going to go see if they want some coffee.

279
00:19:40,464 --> 00:19:43,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, the, oh my gosh, that line was longer.

280
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when we went to Best Buy with the cookies, they were running from the back to the front.

281
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, we're going to come up the line and like people are mobbing us for cookies.

282
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:50,396
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were cool.

283
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the Best Buy line too.

284
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:54,120
[SPEAKER_06]: They had a big sign that said, we spawns here.

285
00:19:54,481 --> 00:19:56,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And I asked the guy, I'm like, what the hell does that mean?

286
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, get it because it's going to spawn here in a couple hours.

287
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh my God.

288
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:04,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought I was a nerd for doing a radio program on the internet.

289
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Meanwhile, while Chris is running around in my car, which I'm like, my baby.

290
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Your baby's fine.

291
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:12,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Some kid asked to borrow my DS, and then I pulled up my micro to play.

292
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:13,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, can I play your micro?

293
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:15,113
[SPEAKER_13]: What's this?

294
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,034
[SPEAKER_13]: So I had to explain the micro.

295
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:19,414
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a dead system, basically, here.

296
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:21,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Puzzle Fighter.

297
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:22,656
[SPEAKER_13]: What else do you have?

298
00:20:24,116 --> 00:20:25,376
[SPEAKER_13]: I have Kingdom Hearts.

299
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:26,937
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to play Puzzle Fighter.

300
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,638
[SPEAKER_03]: What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?

301
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so we got too much coffee.

302
00:20:34,844 --> 00:20:37,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I went over to the Best Buy line, and they swarmed me.

303
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm coming back.

304
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to make, I think, five trips to Shell Station to get that much cups of coffee.

305
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I called out, does anyone want donuts?

306
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:49,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone perked up, donuts?

307
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,254
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a security guard at Best Buy.

308
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:54,236
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, oh, can you get me the cream-filled one?

309
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:54,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

310
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,126
[SPEAKER_03]: The security guard was so cute.

311
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:00,368
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked so tired.

312
00:21:00,828 --> 00:21:02,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, can you get me a coffee?

313
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I'm coming back with more.

314
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And people just liked it.

315
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:10,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought six dozen donuts.

316
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:11,622
[SPEAKER_03]: And what?

317
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:13,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Six dozen plus one for the guard.

318
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:16,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I made sure I got him the cream custard.

319
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:18,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That is so cute.

320
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the time I said, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.

321
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:25,416
[SPEAKER_06]: You gave mad pimpage to our show, Chris, and for that we love you.

322
00:21:25,976 --> 00:21:29,777
[SPEAKER_06]: But you weren't doing it just, I mean, the promo for the show was just a bonus, right?

323
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:42,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I was, you know, I'm not really on this show that often, but I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge because I was hanging out with Jamie, and I really wanted to, you know, it's like, you guys have been sweet to me, so I figured, hey, you know.

324
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,205
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

325
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,996
[SPEAKER_03]: The goodness of my heart doesn't factor in at all.

326
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, there's a couple old people in the Best Buy line, and they were so grateful for that coffee, it made my day.

327
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, one guy in the Great Land line had a beer.

328
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that.

329
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:37,062
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a guy there who said, hey, and he's really cool, we were talking about ThinkGeek and different t-shirts and the joys of Firefox.

330
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:41,203
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's like, I got some beer if you want some.

331
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,232
[SPEAKER_13]: and I was like, what kind?

332
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:45,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Bass.

333
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:48,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh.

334
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:55,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Because for anyone who doesn't know, I love beer a lot and I'm trying to cut down on my beer consumption.

335
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,540
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was sorely tempted.

336
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, Bass, I love you.

337
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me beer.

338
00:23:01,322 --> 00:23:01,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, no.

339
00:23:02,823 --> 00:23:06,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the whole problem with that is the guys are going around the corner to pee.

340
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,438
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have the equipment to go around the corner and pee.

341
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:14,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you could, but it's just not as sanitary.

342
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:22,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm in an awkward position on the floor, right next to Rob's legs, but somebody in the chatroom asked me how much money I spent.

343
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell who that is.

344
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, FootyMonster, probably.

345
00:23:27,221 --> 00:23:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: FootyMonster, they asked me how much money I spent.

346
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:30,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough.

347
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:31,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Enough.

348
00:23:31,842 --> 00:23:34,663
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my money, though, so Orange Lounge will continue to...

349
00:23:35,495 --> 00:23:39,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend all of the money that they get on your crackin' booth.

350
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:44,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also like to add something that's kind of funny according to NextGenWars.com.

351
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:48,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like Wii is beating out PlayStation 3.

352
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they have more units at launch.

353
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:53,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's kind of, I mean, to be fair.

354
00:23:53,293 --> 00:23:55,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, but they basically got a greater market share.

355
00:23:56,038 --> 00:23:56,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Slept in his car!

356
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:56,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

357
00:24:17,885 --> 00:24:23,969
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Extrovert was really cool because I didn't feel like camping out and I was like, you know, I like my warm bed.

358
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,450
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just pick up a Wii at the second shipment.

359
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,451
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to keep coming.

360
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:27,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm cool.

361
00:24:28,211 --> 00:24:30,633
[SPEAKER_06]: But Extrovert was like, I'll gamb out if you want one.

362
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, here's money.

363
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

364
00:24:33,314 --> 00:24:34,095
[SPEAKER_06]: So you did it.

365
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:36,616
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the best thing ever.

366
00:24:36,796 --> 00:24:38,638
[SPEAKER_13]: I love spending money when it's somebody else's.

367
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:39,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

368
00:24:40,058 --> 00:24:44,041
[SPEAKER_10]: I found that spending money when it's not your own

369
00:24:44,648 --> 00:24:46,909
[SPEAKER_10]: is very, it's a very nice thing.

370
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, before I forget, by the way, Bandit sent me the link.

371
00:25:06,801 --> 00:25:10,024
[SPEAKER_06]: They gave out tickets and didn't even honor them and all this junk.

372
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:15,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to admit, hearing these stories on the internet about stores that had failed launches previously made me a little bit nervous.

373
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:16,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But you came back.

374
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,011
[SPEAKER_06]: You walked through the door and you were like, I love Target.

375
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:20,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Target.

376
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:21,273
[SPEAKER_06]: What made it so great?

377
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:21,774
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

378
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:22,394
[SPEAKER_06]: How did it go down?

379
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:31,422
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, the store manager himself was outside and letting everybody know exactly what's going to happen before the store opened.

380
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, I have to burp.

381
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,170
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great radio.

382
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, it just took some airborne.

383
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:44,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, you can't blame me.

384
00:25:46,537 --> 00:25:54,623
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically the store manager explained everything and then we were in line.

385
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:58,426
[SPEAKER_10]: They handed out things for us to fill out as to which games we wanted to get.

386
00:25:59,062 --> 00:26:09,631
[SPEAKER_10]: and then they kind of escorted us into the store where we handed them the flyer that we filled out and then they got everything for us and then sent us to a register.

387
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:14,414
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very, very, very, very organized, well organized.

388
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:17,577
[SPEAKER_10]: No glitches, nobody upset.

389
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:20,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody knew they were going to get one, that was going to get one.

390
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,861
[SPEAKER_10]: It was wham, bam, thank you ma'am, Chris.

391
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, very convenient.

392
00:26:25,214 --> 00:26:25,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it was.

393
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:31,199
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even told the lady that walked me over to the register that I appreciated it.

394
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,920
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell?

395
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,342
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's the end.

396
00:26:35,442 --> 00:26:35,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

397
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,431
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, thank you, Extover, for sharing that.

398
00:26:38,951 --> 00:26:40,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I just got linked to the best site ever.

399
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you also, your website, the week's later in the show, did you?

400
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,213
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this is, well, I might make this next week's.

401
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:49,214
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, did you find the process to be just as great?

402
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, very smooth.

403
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,235
[SPEAKER_13]: But I laughed at the stupid woman.

404
00:26:53,555 --> 00:26:55,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my gosh.

405
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:57,736
[SPEAKER_13]: The prettiest looking woman.

406
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:00,097
[SPEAKER_13]: There were, like, actually walks up from her SUV.

407
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:06,466
[SPEAKER_13]: And she's all in her skirt and her high heels looking all prissy, prissy, prissy.

408
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:07,826
[SPEAKER_13]: And she walks to the end of the line.

409
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:08,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And she walks with an attitude.

410
00:27:08,887 --> 00:27:10,067
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I didn't have to wait.

411
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:10,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to wait.

412
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have to wait.

413
00:27:11,908 --> 00:27:13,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And she walks all the way back there.

414
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And they basically said, oh, we're the last ones to get it.

415
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,991
[SPEAKER_13]: And she walks back because she's so pissed off.

416
00:27:18,752 --> 00:27:19,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, haha!

417
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:24,075
[SPEAKER_03]: There were like a few people who showed up thinking they can just jump in the line.

418
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:26,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy said, I'm sorry, we don't have any more.

419
00:27:26,596 --> 00:27:27,537
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the only people.

420
00:27:27,757 --> 00:27:31,519
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that was probably going to be me if Extra Red had been so volunteer.

421
00:27:31,579 --> 00:27:32,219
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would have been okay.

422
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have left away in a huff.

423
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have understood.

424
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have been, okay, I'm going to Kmart because no one shops at Kmart.

425
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:48,651
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, we've got to keep moving as we want to get in the show, but we want to give a great big round of applause to the line at Target Great Land and Center Sites and the great staff there for making the relaunch good.

426
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:49,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

427
00:27:49,887 --> 00:28:01,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to give a round of applause to the guy at the front of the line at Walmart in Rancho Cordova, the grandpa who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid.

428
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to sell it on eBay, but he looked like the nicest guy in the world.

429
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:09,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to give him a round of applause, too, because I liked him a lot.

430
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,472
[SPEAKER_06]: And I liked all the gamers.

431
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:11,493
[SPEAKER_11]: He didn't take your cookie, though.

432
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,493
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he didn't take the cookie, but that's okay.

433
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:15,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

434
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to force people to take the cookies.

435
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:18,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so anyway.

436
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chat room.

437
00:28:20,838 --> 00:28:24,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are they even, that was Shadow Charlie, but why are they even talking about Paris Hilton?

438
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, because Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one.

439
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:32,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems, use their celebrity to get systems.

440
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:32,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about that later.

441
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:34,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free, okay?

442
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:36,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

443
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:38,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii.

444
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature of the Wiimote easily.

445
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:46,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

446
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:51,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's get into another favorite segment we like to do here on Orange Launch Radio.

447
00:28:51,412 --> 00:28:55,174
[SPEAKER_06]: This is usually how we kick off the show and we don't have launch party stories to tell.

448
00:28:55,574 --> 00:28:56,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I forgot to ask.

449
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,455
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.

450
00:28:57,715 --> 00:28:58,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even ask.

451
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:01,198
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys all camped in the line for the Wii.

452
00:29:01,518 --> 00:29:02,138
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you get?

453
00:29:02,178 --> 00:29:03,299
[SPEAKER_06]: What games did you end up getting?

454
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:04,740
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

455
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I got, well, I actually got another Wiimote.

456
00:29:08,942 --> 00:29:13,825
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I got Zelda, Excite Truck, and Trauma Center.

457
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:14,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Which...

458
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:18,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the exact same three games I got, by the way.

459
00:29:18,787 --> 00:29:22,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck, and Zelda.

460
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:22,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

461
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:37,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel so bad, but I got Zelda, Excite Truck, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Red Steel, and Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

462
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was it.

463
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get SpongeBob?

464
00:29:40,396 --> 00:29:41,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not get SpongeBob.

465
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:44,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I will talk about it in a little bit, but...

466
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:50,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used pretty quick at a GameStop.

467
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:50,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

468
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:51,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

469
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sounding like some good reviews there.

470
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get into how it should get me in just a minute.

471
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:59,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say this comment from chat, though, real quick about the Wii lines.

472
00:29:59,772 --> 00:30:02,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems, not sell them.

473
00:30:03,633 --> 00:30:05,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Another very interesting observation.

474
00:30:05,193 --> 00:30:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've noted this observation was made on blogs where, you know, most of the people in the PlayStation 3 lines were eBay profiteers.

475
00:30:12,515 --> 00:30:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: and most of the people in the Wii lines actually plan on playing them.

476
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:20,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked, you know, and I didn't expect people to be honest with me, but I asked straight up, I said, who's selling the Wii on eBay?

477
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And only one person kind of fessed up to that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay.

478
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:25,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, their friend ratted them out.

479
00:30:25,964 --> 00:30:26,424
[SPEAKER_06]: That was it.

480
00:30:27,445 --> 00:30:28,486
[SPEAKER_06]: One guy at Best Buy

481
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:38,154
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm using that money to buy the Wii and I'm like, what, are you selling the Wii 2?

482
00:30:38,214 --> 00:30:47,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me back the cookie and he's like, he said, no, I actually want to play the Wii so it's very interesting just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people had

483
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,502
[SPEAKER_03]: PooEater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports.

484
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:59,167
[SPEAKER_03]: My girlfriend, Migsy, she's been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop, and she says it's actually gotten kind of boring.

485
00:30:59,587 --> 00:30:59,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

486
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:03,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good to learn how things go, I guess, but it's...

487
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:06,507
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not really a, you know...

488
00:31:24,787 --> 00:31:26,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you want to check out what I just got?

489
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:26,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire it up.

490
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:27,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you go.

491
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:34,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Pass off to Drew Nami for a minute, because I want to ask, you just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room, and you played Wii Sports.

492
00:31:34,633 --> 00:31:35,393
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your impressions?

493
00:31:35,673 --> 00:31:36,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just pick it up and go.

494
00:31:36,994 --> 00:31:39,216
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing to it at all.

495
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:44,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing, but everything else was easy.

496
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:46,740
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

497
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:47,939
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

498
00:32:13,025 --> 00:32:18,686
[SPEAKER_13]: and every time they try to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted so I haven't actually gotten started yet.

499
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:23,148
[SPEAKER_13]: I played some Mario but mostly I was playing Cooking Mama.

500
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:26,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have my Elite Beat Agents today.

501
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

502
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:29,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

503
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:29,789
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

504
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:30,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

505
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:31,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun with it.

506
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Play lots of the Wii for next week.

507
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:34,519
[SPEAKER_06]: and Pinball.

508
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:36,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Pinball, like real Pinball, not virtual console Pinball.

509
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:45,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Dan had a Pinball party last night, so I've actually, well, of course we weren't there, but I was playing some of the machines while Sauce was here last week, too.

510
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:51,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about before we got into How Was Your Gaming Week, but I've got to read these.

511
00:32:52,047 --> 00:32:58,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Robway in our chatroom says, I think less people want to resell the Wii because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling.

512
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, I'm not buying from the eBay scum.

513
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzi said, I showed the parentals Wii Sports.

514
00:33:05,816 --> 00:33:07,378
[SPEAKER_06]: They were like speechless in awe.

515
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting.

516
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:10,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

517
00:33:11,504 --> 00:33:14,828
[SPEAKER_05]: My gaming week was great, especially with the Wii on Thursday.

518
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: We started off with Wii Sports, and that was actually pretty fun.

519
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,717
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wii Tennis was really cool.

520
00:33:21,797 --> 00:33:23,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everyone really had fun with it.

521
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:30,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I tried a little bit of Wii Boxing, which is a little weird because I didn't really read the manual on how to play it.

522
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So I couldn't quite get it to work correctly, but it was still fun.

523
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:37,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Wii Golf was kind of okay, I guess.

524
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:40,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Wii Bowling, I didn't really try that too much.

525
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:43,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the baseball, I think, is way too damn hard.

526
00:33:43,126 --> 00:33:46,447
[SPEAKER_05]: At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous.

527
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:50,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend.

528
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing lots of that.

529
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,191
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is really fun.

530
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:55,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best way to describe it.

531
00:33:56,232 --> 00:34:05,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the music is so goddamn horrible, you really need the SD memory card and just to load your own MP3s.

532
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:11,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I tell you, once you do that, it makes the game completely better.

533
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:12,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really fun game.

534
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:16,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz

535
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,251
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like them.

536
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,512
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't like them too much.

537
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:50,234
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's not something I would play by myself.

538
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:54,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a good party game, but, you know, money's better spent elsewhere.

539
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:58,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits.

540
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you're really interested in a minigame type of game, that is the one for you.

541
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's just insane.

542
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:08,708
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim, just how off the wall weird they are.

543
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:16,203
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite was the eating one, that you trace the food, and one of the foods was a baseball that the guy would eat.

544
00:35:16,303 --> 00:35:18,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, what the hell, he's eating a baseball?

545
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:22,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It's excellent, so definitely you need to check that out.

546
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:26,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Zelda is pretty awesome, but I mean, what do you expect from a Zelda?

547
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:30,268
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just pretty neat, so Zelda, yay.

548
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:31,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course...

549
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:34,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.

550
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:39,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought this thinking it's going to be like SSX, because I love SSX.

551
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:40,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not SSX.

552
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:55,731
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even close to being SSX, and I got really frustrated with this right away, because to be honest, I don't know if it was my TV, but the cables I had, the detail on it, I had trouble seeing some of the tracks.

553
00:35:56,051 --> 00:36:01,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a game that I can get into and have fun with, and Excite Truck was that, Tony Hawk was not.

554
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:01,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

555
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't recommend it.

556
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless you're a really big Tony Hawk fan, I really wouldn't recommend it.

557
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,727
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

558
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,489
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, finally, virtual console games.

559
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:16,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried Mario 64, which is okay with the classic controller.

560
00:36:17,953 --> 00:36:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder how well it'll look with the component cable, but it looks just like it did before.

561
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:31,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Zelda seemed a bit dark to me, but I guess that was because it was from the collection disc or something that came out of the GameCube not too long ago.

562
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:35,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it makes sense because, hey, it's already been ported, right?

563
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:36,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

564
00:36:37,138 --> 00:36:42,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish it was brighter, though, because all those games that we saw at E3 were very vivid and bright, and that's what I kind of liked about them.

565
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, I mean, I think it's all about the cables, though, right now.

566
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:49,226
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was pretty much it.

567
00:36:49,286 --> 00:36:58,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course, you know, the usual suspects, Call of Duty 3 on the 360, and Gears of War a little bit, and Elder Scrolls finally finished it.

568
00:36:59,056 --> 00:37:04,417
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ 100 Matt wants to know, what does Nelly, Loki's wife, have to say about Loki playing all those games this week?

569
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:07,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the funny thing about that, actually.

570
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Nelly originally, if you have her as a friend on LiveJournal, you would have seen that she wrote some pretty negative reviews on the Wii, saying, if I really wanted to exercise, I would go to the gym, I won't play the Wii.

571
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:30,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Ironically enough, though, once she picked up Excite Truck, she's been playing it for five hours yesterday and a couple hours today.

572
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:37,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's actually finished all the four different cups in it, all the way up through the Platinum Cup.

573
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:37,863
[SPEAKER_05]: She's all finished with it.

574
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:40,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Now she's going back to get S rankings on all the other tracks.

575
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even played it that much.

576
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:45,508
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how much she's liked this, and she loves the game.

577
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:46,248
[SPEAKER_05]: She says it's like...

578
00:37:48,247 --> 00:37:54,634
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically like Woman Driver the game because it allows you to crash through trees and just drive aimlessly.

579
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:55,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get points.

580
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:55,935
[SPEAKER_05]: You get rewarded.

581
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:58,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you get rewarded for driving recklessly.

582
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So she loves the game.

583
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Sail at Mervin's.

584
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:03,142
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just kidding.

585
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:10,370
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I like, though, playing on there is the Mii Channel, and I like creating stupid Miis that I sent to Rob, which is great.

586
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:15,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, gosh, I went into my Mii Channel, like, suddenly, like, eight new Miis all dropped in my little thing.

587
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki sent you this.

588
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:16,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki sent you this.

589
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:24,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And he sent him and Nellie, and then he sent, like, Damien, who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side or what you did to get those horns.

590
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:25,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what you did.

591
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:30,178
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he just sent me a guy with a giant afro and called it afro.

592
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:31,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from DDR.

593
00:38:31,798 --> 00:38:32,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

594
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:32,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.

595
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:32,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

596
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,379
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

597
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:36,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's talk to our guests.

598
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I gotta say, my gaming week.

599
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:38,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll make it quick.

600
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:42,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantasy Star Universe before the mass hysteria of the Wii launch.

601
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a lot of Fantasy Star Universe.

602
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:47,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Online mode because they opened up some new areas in online.

603
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:51,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Motube is a new planet you can go to and some new missions are available as well.

604
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:58,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my butt handed to me in Motube though because the missions, even though they're level 15, they're a little bit harder than the ones on New Days.

605
00:38:58,418 --> 00:38:59,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good though.

606
00:38:59,898 --> 00:39:02,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad they're keeping it fresh with new content.

607
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:06,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope Sega gets it right this time and consistently gives us the new stuff.

608
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:08,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be a very happy camper if so.

609
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:10,835
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

610
00:39:29,812 --> 00:39:34,614
[SPEAKER_06]: When I get mad at the patients, I stab them with my scalpel and just kill them.

611
00:39:34,755 --> 00:39:36,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a review from Megzi.

612
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:39,457
[SPEAKER_03]: She said the trauma center for the DS makes you want to hit yourself with a brick.

613
00:39:40,057 --> 00:39:40,477
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard.

614
00:39:40,557 --> 00:39:43,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really hard game, and you have to remember.

615
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,239
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like Simon Says.

616
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Simon Says, but you have to remember.

617
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:50,242
[SPEAKER_06]: First, I've got to drain it.

618
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:51,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, I've got to scalp it.

619
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, I've got to take it out with a thing.

620
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Then, I've got an antibiotic.

621
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:56,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to remember what order you have to do everything in.

622
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

623
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,439
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, You Watch Me Play It

624
00:40:28,353 --> 00:40:29,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I will pick up Mortal Kombat, though.

625
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:34,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally being a hypocrite because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat when it comes out on the Wii.

626
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:35,419
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, how was your gaming week?

627
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I played a bunch of games at work that I can't talk about.

628
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:46,849
[SPEAKER_08]: But, let's see, at home, I actually busted out the Super Nintendo, played some Tecmo Super Bowl, Wario's Woods.

629
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, when I got here, I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP.

630
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:54,395
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a lot of Luminous 2, played a lot of Burnout Revenge on his 360.

631
00:40:55,922 --> 00:41:03,488
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is actually the first time I've actually gotten to play the Wii and play it on my own terms rather than, you're playing this for eight hours, have fun.

632
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,272
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun with the system.

633
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Trauma Center is just funny because, again, the stabbing people.

634
00:41:14,518 --> 00:41:15,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Excite Truck's pretty fun.

635
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually did not like Raving Rabbids.

636
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I just thought it was stupid.

637
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:23,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that's about it.

638
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:24,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm boring like that.

639
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:55,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 pets, and you can kill animals and turn them into ghost animals.

640
00:41:55,451 --> 00:41:56,692
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it's actually really fun.

641
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: All the animals, you can't actually tell the animals what to do, but they have their own personalities and they just kind of run around.

642
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:06,776
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tell them not to do something.

643
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:13,779
[SPEAKER_03]: All my cats that I have for my Sims, they are on the furniture all the time and I can't get them to stop, but...

644
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: and I also played Pokemon Ranger.

645
00:42:17,163 --> 00:42:18,044
[SPEAKER_03]: That game is weird.

646
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:22,911
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, I'm old school Pokemon fan, like the trainer games.

647
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the only ones I like.

648
00:42:24,293 --> 00:42:27,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have pinball or anything like that and I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that.

649
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:28,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

650
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:28,660
[SPEAKER_03]: It's

651
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I have plushies of those.

652
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:30,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they...

653
00:42:55,969 --> 00:43:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always with you, but the friends that you make follow you around until you're done with them.

654
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:04,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can use your Pokemon, so it's even worse than training them.

655
00:43:04,773 --> 00:43:05,553
[SPEAKER_03]: You use them.

656
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:09,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, do that for me, and then get the hell out.

657
00:43:10,176 --> 00:43:12,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a weird game.

658
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:17,499
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you like Pokemon anyway, I mean, I guess it's a really cool game, but I like training them.

659
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I like using them for purposes of battle.

660
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I like trying to kill my Pokemon.

661
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,402
[SPEAKER_03]: PETA doesn't like me, I don't think.

662
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that was my gaming week.

663
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:28,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

664
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:28,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew Nami!

665
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:30,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Drew, I really, really like your shirt.

666
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:32,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It says noob.

667
00:43:32,795 --> 00:43:34,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Noob, it's what's for dinner.

668
00:43:34,036 --> 00:43:40,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a noob assuming the position, kind of like the cuts of meat chart.

669
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:41,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's so funny.

670
00:43:41,943 --> 00:43:44,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew Nami, or Drew Nawi, how was your gaming week?

671
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:52,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually decided to kick it a little bit old school because I didn't get any of the next gen stuff, so I went back to my old...

672
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:57,176
[SPEAKER_04]: MechWarrior games, just started playing MechWarrior 3, MechWarrior 4, MechCommander 2, that kind of stuff.

673
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't do much else except Guitar Hero, and they really ramped up the difficulty on Expert Mode.

674
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:08,042
[SPEAKER_04]: It is almost impossibly hard when you get to the stuff like Miserlew.

675
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:12,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, not much else.

676
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:13,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, very cool.

677
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:17,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny is that earlier in the show I was talking about our history as a music gaming network.

678
00:44:18,094 --> 00:44:21,836
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're the only... Oh no, DarkSakura played Guitar Hero 2 last week.

679
00:44:22,356 --> 00:44:23,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I haven't played it yet.

680
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:24,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played a bunch of that too.

681
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:27,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Pandora is hot.

682
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:28,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Pandora is fucking hot.

683
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Pandora makes me fail songs.

684
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:46,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was our gaming week, and hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well, whether you were in the PlayStation 3 camp, or the Wii camp, or the F the Next Generation camp, or maybe 360, you're just holding out on 360, whatever, hope you had a good gaming week as well.

685
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:51,848
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get into some gaming news, so real quick housekeeping, real quick, just wanted to say...

686
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that have been saying, why do you put out Part B so late in the week?

687
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do we have to wait so long for Part B?

688
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:05,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're going to try a new thing and we're going to put out Part B a little bit earlier, so look for it this week.

689
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another podcast out there.

690
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:11,616
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another show that's syndicated on all games like we are.

691
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Our show replays on all games on Monday.

692
00:45:13,657 --> 00:45:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a show on Thursday, I think, on all games.

693
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:18,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if I messed that up, called Game Addict Hotline.

694
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a spin-off show from that called Cross Platform where they have multiple people come together from different podcasts and magazines and stuff and just talk about random stuff.

695
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So the guy there, Luke, I've been chatting with for a little bit.

696
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:32,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So he had me on.

697
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:35,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Episode 4 and 5, so you should check that out.

698
00:45:35,544 --> 00:45:38,026
[SPEAKER_06]: So go to GameAddictHotline.com and you can download the show.

699
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:43,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can hear how GamerAndy yells at me for being excited about Blue Dragon.

700
00:45:43,811 --> 00:45:48,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But look, number 3 most anticipated title in Japan, GamerAndy.

701
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:49,577
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have to know.

702
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:52,399
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Final Fantasy people, you know what a Final Fantasy whore I am.

703
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:53,020
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah.

704
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:56,471
[SPEAKER_06]: GamerAndy is great and so are all the guys there that have been on the program.

705
00:45:56,511 --> 00:45:57,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

706
00:45:57,432 --> 00:45:57,932
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good time.

707
00:45:58,892 --> 00:46:00,113
[SPEAKER_06]: One other thing I want to say real fast.

708
00:46:00,253 --> 00:46:02,894
[SPEAKER_06]: DMM, do you have anything you want to share with our listeners?

709
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:05,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a cookie.

710
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you mean that thing.

711
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:09,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have a Wii.

712
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:10,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give it to somebody.

713
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:12,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a random chatter.

714
00:46:12,717 --> 00:46:13,278
[SPEAKER_08]: If

715
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:21,260
[SPEAKER_08]: When Rob says go, which won't be now, but at some point, please PM him in the chat room.

716
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,800
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

717
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:25,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give the rules in chat a little later because PMs are going to be too much.

718
00:46:25,663 --> 00:46:26,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we can do PMs.

719
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,044
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

720
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:28,185
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do PMs.

721
00:46:28,265 --> 00:46:30,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, PM him with your... Not now.

722
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:31,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Not now.

723
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:33,169
[SPEAKER_08]: If you do it now, you're disqualified.

724
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:33,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

725
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:36,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have to find a way to say go.

726
00:46:37,592 --> 00:46:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Please PM Rob with your...

727
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:48,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Screen name, your actual name if you like, and a number we can reach you at because we may call you tonight and make an ass of you on the internet and say you won a Wii.

728
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:52,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if we can call you on air, just give us your number and we'll do that.

729
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio employees are not eligible.

730
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:55,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

731
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:57,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, people.

732
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:06,574
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, other than that, you'll get a Wii when I get back to Seattle because I have the Wii, just not here.

733
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:07,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

734
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:12,525
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's any questions, I don't have a computer, so deal with it.

735
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.

736
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:16,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to you, Rob.

737
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:17,666
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there was something else.

738
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:18,606
[SPEAKER_08]: What else?

739
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:21,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's something else.

740
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:22,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not wearing any pants.

741
00:47:25,087 --> 00:47:26,428
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to tell me these things beforehand.

742
00:47:27,088 --> 00:47:27,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Kirby.

743
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:28,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirby, yes.

744
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:31,989
[SPEAKER_08]: STFU, Rob.

745
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:32,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, wait.

746
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:33,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait.

747
00:47:34,298 --> 00:47:39,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Coming Thursdays to Orange Lounge Radio, DJ Tyron and myself will be hosting a show called STFU.

748
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be maybe a 30-45 minute show.

749
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:50,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be pre-taped until we decide, hey, we're going to feel the wrath of the live listeners.

750
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:52,784
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what time.

751
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:55,764
[SPEAKER_08]: More details on that will be announced as they come.

752
00:47:56,305 --> 00:48:01,166
[SPEAKER_08]: But we look forward to being a part of the Orange Lounge Radio family, and we are going to have a lot of fun with it.

753
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:02,805
[SPEAKER_08]: So when's that start?

754
00:48:02,866 --> 00:48:03,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday after Thanksgiving, right?

755
00:48:03,906 --> 00:48:05,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it'll be the first Thursday after Thanksgiving.

756
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:11,931
[SPEAKER_08]: We're shooting for an evening sort of time so people can, you know... We're going to have it at 3 in the morning.

757
00:48:12,592 --> 00:48:12,912
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

758
00:48:13,132 --> 00:48:14,553
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was 7 o'clock?

759
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:15,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was going to be 7.

760
00:48:15,233 --> 00:48:15,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think we're going to do 7.

761
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:19,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Because most of the other shows are at 7 or 7.30, so probably in that window somewhere.

762
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:24,069
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, just real quick, I want to say one more time because now everybody's talking about the contest.

763
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody in chat is like, contest, contest, contest.

764
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:29,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, ask an op if you need to know how to private message somebody in chat.

765
00:48:29,814 --> 00:48:34,618
[SPEAKER_06]: The folks in chat would request that if you already have a Wii, you don't enter the contest.

766
00:48:34,658 --> 00:48:41,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But since there's no way for us to verify it, maybe you know someone in need of a Wii, so we're not going to stop people that already have one from entering.

767
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:43,866
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you win brownie points with the ladies.

768
00:48:43,926 --> 00:48:45,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Use your best judgment, yeah.

769
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Only PM me when I say to, and after a certain period of time, one number will be drawn at random.

770
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:59,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not the first person to PM me, it's one number from someone who PMs me will be drawn at random.

771
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:05,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, if you're PMing me other things during the show, because there's a lot of people in chat tonight, I can't look at them right now because there's too much else going on.

772
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very sorry, folks, but you have to look at the general chat or, I don't know, see if Loki or DarkSakura can answer.

773
00:49:14,022 --> 00:49:15,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Or ask one of your friendly ops.

774
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:16,318
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

775
00:49:18,118 --> 00:49:18,419
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

776
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's get into some gaming news already.

777
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:27,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we haven't given the 360 a lot of love tonight, but Loki, can you change that for us a little bit?

778
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I can.

779
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:31,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the 360 and I'll still be playing plenty.

780
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:39,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so on the 15th, you know, there is a big anniversary, the fifth year anniversary of Halo.

781
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:43,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Halo,

782
00:49:43,948 --> 00:49:44,448
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

783
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:14,941
[SPEAKER_05]: XBOX 360 EXCLUSIVE MAPS

784
00:50:35,768 --> 00:50:43,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the first Halo 3 television ad will air during ESPN Monday Night Football on December 4th.

785
00:50:43,391 --> 00:50:45,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And it'll be a 60-second spot.

786
00:50:46,472 --> 00:50:47,853
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll be very interesting.

787
00:50:47,873 --> 00:50:52,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Tune in to that to watch it or catch it on YouTube the day after.

788
00:50:56,156 --> 00:50:56,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.

789
00:50:56,957 --> 00:51:00,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I've been having to argue a little bit with some people in chat room.

790
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:00,458
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like,

791
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:06,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, the rules are the rules, and it's DMN's Wii, and he can do whatever he wants to give it away, because he doesn't have to be doing it.

792
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:07,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's it.

793
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a very massive Wii you have there, DMN.

794
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:11,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I wanted to say real quick on the Halo 3.

795
00:51:12,383 --> 00:51:14,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the beta coming out in spring.

796
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:20,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you have said on previous episodes, you are convinced that the game is coming out in, what, March, April, somewhere in that window.

797
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?

798
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:27,035
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they beta tested Phantasy Star Universe right before it came out.

799
00:51:28,316 --> 00:51:28,977
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the big deal?

800
00:51:29,177 --> 00:51:29,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

801
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be beta tested months in advance.

802
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:41,434
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the only exception I've seen so far with demos and Xbox Live would probably be the stuff from E3.

803
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:45,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost Planet got a demo and Test Drive Unlimited and stuff like that.

804
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:52,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that stuff was way early, but then again, it was also already done for that show, so they didn't have to really work on it.

805
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:53,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it makes perfect sense.

806
00:51:53,981 --> 00:51:58,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you have a beta test for something and then wait like six months to put it out?

807
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:00,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still telling you.

808
00:52:00,598 --> 00:52:01,020
[SPEAKER_05]: End of March.

809
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:03,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

810
00:52:04,376 --> 00:52:05,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you all will see.

811
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: We shall, we shall see.

812
00:52:08,898 --> 00:52:14,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of things that need to be beta tested, perhaps the PlayStation 3 backwards compatibility should have been play tested.

813
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:20,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure you guys have been hearing the reports about, I think we got into it a little bit last week, some of the games don't work right.

814
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:25,186
[SPEAKER_06]: They have little bugs, I don't know if any, are any of them rendered unplayable that you've heard of?

815
00:52:25,306 --> 00:52:26,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any of them are necessarily unplayable.

816
00:52:26,627 --> 00:52:27,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about unplayable.

817
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:30,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But you've got graphical audio bugs quite a bit.

818
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:47,323
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's very interesting because there was an interview with Sony Computer Entertainment America exec Jack Trenton and he made this very interesting and bizarre quote in response to the question do you have a response for people experiencing backwards compatibility issues and or television upscaling problems

819
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote,

820
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:10,937
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

821
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:36,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, and FireballManChatroom says, that's just giving a big fuck you to the gaming community.

822
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:37,575
[SPEAKER_06]: I tend to agree.

823
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a very snide thing to say.

824
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:40,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a flying car and make breakfast.

825
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:42,936
[SPEAKER_06]: He just said, look, we have bugs.

826
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:43,716
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll fix them.

827
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:44,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Our bad.

828
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:52,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get a big pro tip for every single higher up at every single video game company.

829
00:53:52,798 --> 00:53:55,019
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

830
00:53:55,339 --> 00:53:56,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut the hell up.

831
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:59,200
[SPEAKER_08]: This includes mine, too.

832
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're listening, Perrin.

833
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:06,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they are working on patch to fix this stuff.

834
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:13,531
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, Microsoft, their games aren't backwards compatible.

835
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:15,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them.

836
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:22,277
[SPEAKER_05]: They have as many backwards compatible games as Sony has games that aren't working in backwards compatibility.

837
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:24,919
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about that.

838
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be fixed in a patch.

839
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:29,182
[SPEAKER_05]: People can quit their bitching.

840
00:54:29,282 --> 00:54:31,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, there's still going to be other problems, but

841
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:34,992
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why they have these updates and firmware updates and stuff like that.

842
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:37,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not a huge deal right now, I think.

843
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:44,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides, with that big of a library, I mean, the percentage of games that aren't working is about, like, 2%.

844
00:54:44,395 --> 00:54:46,896
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really not that big a deal.

845
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it will be fixed soon.

846
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:54,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they could have said, at least, hey, we're doing better than 360 is.

847
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, yeah, this guy is an idiot.

848
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they do not need people like him talking because...

849
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:07,768
[SPEAKER_05]: They already have people like, you know, Kaz and just spout off dumbass remarks.

850
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:12,832
[SPEAKER_06]: LokiFNX in our chatroom with very familiar sounding names says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.

851
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:15,074
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very rude.

852
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,575
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just rude.

853
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:17,556
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible PR.

854
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:18,697
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a little bit.

855
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:26,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering they're relying on these people to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they were really rude to them at launch.

856
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:28,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

857
00:55:28,522 --> 00:55:29,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting words.

858
00:55:30,103 --> 00:55:39,789
[SPEAKER_08]: What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks, and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound like pricks.

859
00:55:39,809 --> 00:55:40,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Them's fighting words.

860
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are fighting words.

861
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:45,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite all this crap, I do still consider myself a Sony fanboy.

862
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:48,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.

863
00:55:48,955 --> 00:55:49,436
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go outside?

864
00:55:49,456 --> 00:55:50,356
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go to the parking lot?

865
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,817
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go get taught a lesson?

866
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:52,578
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

867
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:54,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Fight, fight.

868
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I might shoot him.

869
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

870
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:57,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

871
00:55:58,123 --> 00:55:58,723
[SPEAKER_13]: I get a stuff.

872
00:56:00,584 --> 00:56:07,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.

873
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:08,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, not really got shot.

874
00:56:08,809 --> 00:56:10,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, in other states they got shot.

875
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:18,095
[SPEAKER_13]: But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their PS3.

876
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:25,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And... Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game system.

877
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:32,476
[SPEAKER_06]: $600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay.

878
00:56:33,396 --> 00:56:42,199
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's people getting shot over this and I'm like... You people are pathetic.

879
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:46,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up on mic again.

880
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:51,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.

881
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:52,482
[SPEAKER_06]: You smartass.

882
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,064
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm just all...

883
00:56:59,474 --> 00:57:07,495
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's... They were shooting people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.

884
00:57:07,975 --> 00:57:23,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the PS3 must be the must-own console, because that's, you know, every year you hear about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them, and now it's... My mom did that!

885
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:26,439
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle Me Elmo.

886
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: That's hot.

887
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:28,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

888
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:33,431
[SPEAKER_06]: and now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation 3s.

889
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,051
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

890
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:34,951
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

891
00:57:37,072 --> 00:57:50,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back to any of those, you know, assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and bork acid poured over the stump.

892
00:57:50,997 --> 00:57:52,338
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's probably someone's fetish.

893
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:54,999
[SPEAKER_08]: While having to watch Bad Santa.

894
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:55,642
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

895
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,002
[SPEAKER_13]: A big flippin' F you to Sony.

896
00:58:27,923 --> 00:58:28,924
[SPEAKER_13]: All-encompassingly.

897
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:33,768
[SPEAKER_13]: And all of your retarded, as the name would notice something, retarded fanboys.

898
00:58:34,308 --> 00:58:38,612
[SPEAKER_13]: As in, not that all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.

899
00:58:40,533 --> 00:58:46,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, all those... I guess, it's stupid men, really.

900
00:58:46,818 --> 00:58:50,301
[SPEAKER_13]: But, it's all the ones, oh, we're gonna sell it on eBay.

901
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:51,942
[SPEAKER_13]: You people are disgusting.

902
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:58,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a secondary FU that I think is going to go in line with somebody else's in this room.

903
00:58:58,444 --> 00:58:59,185
[SPEAKER_13]: FU to Art Thieves.

904
00:59:00,926 --> 00:59:01,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

905
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:02,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, ouch.

906
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:03,287
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Loki.

907
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:12,611
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Nintendo, MadCatz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.

908
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:17,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday?

909
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:18,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Or today?

910
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:19,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

911
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:20,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Why...

912
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:22,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have to wait?

913
00:59:22,703 --> 00:59:24,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot stand composite cables.

914
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I need higher def cables.

915
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:32,550
[SPEAKER_05]: How will I live in a high def world with standard composite cables?

916
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just... It's barbaric!

917
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:38,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

918
00:59:38,895 --> 00:59:40,416
[SPEAKER_05]: And besides, why do I have to wait until December?

919
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:41,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to wait.

920
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:43,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, um...

921
00:59:44,159 --> 01:00:02,312
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to DarkSakura, Chris, and Extifer and the entire line at Target Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, Hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my bed, warm and toasty asleep.

922
01:00:02,645 --> 01:00:06,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache, so F you to my toothache, no.

923
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:12,310
[SPEAKER_03]: If we really wanted to attack revenge on you, we would have dumped some ice water on you too.

924
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have locked the door to my house, so you couldn't do that.

925
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,353
[SPEAKER_13]: If it makes you feel any better, I've thought about calling you at 5.

926
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:19,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, alright.

927
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:21,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So, no, I'm teasing.

928
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:25,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little bit of sand in my vagina this week.

929
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:28,078
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, your FUs of the week.

930
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:31,760
[SPEAKER_08]: My first FU of the week goes to T-Mobile.

931
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:35,924
[SPEAKER_08]: because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation with money to spend.

932
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:40,006
[SPEAKER_08]: And then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money and you're going to fucking hate your weekend.

933
01:00:40,226 --> 01:00:43,527
[SPEAKER_08]: But thankfully, I have friends who help me out, but they don't get FUs.

934
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:44,467
[SPEAKER_08]: But T-Mobile does.

935
01:00:44,867 --> 01:00:49,849
[SPEAKER_08]: If you ever take my fucking money without my permission again, people will die.

936
01:00:50,569 --> 01:00:53,250
[SPEAKER_08]: And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR the other day.

937
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,564
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally pwned you a butterfly.

938
01:00:55,845 --> 01:00:58,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Rematch, bitch, right now.

939
01:00:59,227 --> 01:00:59,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, alright.

940
01:00:59,928 --> 01:01:00,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, you didn't.

941
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:01,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yes, I did.

942
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:02,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I will soak it, LaQuisha.

943
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,071
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already been brought in.

944
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:06,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, Chris, you're FU of the week.

945
01:01:07,813 --> 01:01:08,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, then Drew.

946
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Drew, you're FU of the week.

947
01:01:10,415 --> 01:01:11,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You got served.

948
01:01:12,897 --> 01:01:14,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, FU to Demass Marketing Strategies.

949
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:20,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have just not enough game systems for everyone to watch the first time around?

950
01:01:20,863 --> 01:01:23,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It still makes no fucking sense to me.

951
01:01:24,334 --> 01:01:26,695
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the ramped-up difficulty levels on Guitar Hero 2.

952
01:01:26,775 --> 01:01:27,255
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

953
01:01:27,695 --> 01:01:29,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know you're going to make it harder, but Jesus!

954
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:31,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Miserlew on Expert?

955
01:01:31,597 --> 01:01:33,577
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

956
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, FU to the DMV.

957
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I know everyone shares FU.

958
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:42,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they have to have your birth certificate, even though you've been through the whole thing before, just for a new something.

959
01:01:43,021 --> 01:01:45,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get to stand in line, not once, but twice.

960
01:01:46,022 --> 01:01:46,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it lovely?

961
01:01:46,962 --> 01:01:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Ain't it grand?

962
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:48,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

963
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:49,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, you're FU's.

964
01:01:50,821 --> 01:01:53,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Jamie kind of already stated my FU.

965
01:01:53,482 --> 01:01:54,403
[SPEAKER_03]: FU to art thieves.

966
01:01:54,523 --> 01:01:56,404
[SPEAKER_03]: My art was stolen on DeviantArt.

967
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:57,784
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

968
01:01:57,905 --> 01:01:59,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would somebody steal art?

969
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:08,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, well, it was kind of funny because it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school technically, so I'm not that great.

970
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: But it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown enough that she thought no one would recognize it.

971
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:18,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody did and they informed me and she did it on both her accounts and...

972
01:02:18,727 --> 01:02:25,692
[SPEAKER_03]: She actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description, too!

973
01:02:26,012 --> 01:02:26,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Word for word.

974
01:02:27,013 --> 01:02:28,094
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really, really funny.

975
01:02:28,394 --> 01:02:28,894
[SPEAKER_08]: What a hooker.

976
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:33,497
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um... I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thief.

977
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

978
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:35,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

979
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:46,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I draw, so... I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an FU, but I kind of, like, confused why don't you know this, is all the people who ask me why are you doing this online when I was handing out coffee...

980
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:53,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of not pleased that people have just lost faith in humanity.

981
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know you read about all these things happening, it's like, people are killing each other for a PS3!

982
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:01,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are nice people left, and they're all gay.

983
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:09,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, Drew.

984
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:11,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

985
01:03:12,676 --> 01:03:14,817
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew me as the lesbian in line.

986
01:03:16,874 --> 01:03:18,235
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they know you on the show, too.

987
01:03:18,275 --> 01:03:18,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But we love you.

988
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:21,196
[SPEAKER_06]: You're much more than a lesbian.

989
01:03:21,996 --> 01:03:23,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You're also the chick with blue hair.

990
01:03:24,157 --> 01:03:26,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feed you sugar.

991
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:28,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I give you sugar.

992
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:36,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week.

993
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:39,703
[SPEAKER_05]: A pregnant woman, actually.

994
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey.

995
01:03:44,891 --> 01:03:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And she says, nine months pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's father, and her younger brother.

996
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:00,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

997
01:04:00,976 --> 01:04:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're really... You're stupid!

998
01:04:06,585 --> 01:04:07,647
[SPEAKER_06]: That is pretty stupid.

999
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.

1000
01:04:11,111 --> 01:04:13,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are you allowed to be pregnant?

1001
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:15,217
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, no, no.

1002
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,520
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where I'm going off because this is one of the things I hate.

1003
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:20,164
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate when stupid people breed.

1004
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:25,710
[SPEAKER_13]: When people exist only on this earth to start out babies.

1005
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, she really, really, really, really wanted one.

1006
01:04:29,173 --> 01:04:29,413
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1007
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:30,734
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no.

1008
01:04:30,774 --> 01:04:31,095
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

1009
01:04:31,155 --> 01:04:34,618
[SPEAKER_13]: What is more important, the birth of your child or a video game system?

1010
01:04:34,698 --> 01:04:35,939
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a disgusting person.

1011
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:38,541
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hope your child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.

1012
01:04:38,822 --> 01:04:39,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Depends.

1013
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:40,183
[SPEAKER_05]: How ugly is your child?

1014
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:42,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1015
01:04:43,506 --> 01:04:43,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1016
01:04:45,988 --> 01:04:47,850
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on if she was at Walmart or not.

1017
01:04:48,815 --> 01:04:52,577
[SPEAKER_06]: LandmineFairy in chat says, WTF, is she going to play Trauma Center while in labor?

1018
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:54,138
[SPEAKER_05]: She was at... No, no, no.

1019
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:55,659
[SPEAKER_05]: She will not be playing Trauma Center.

1020
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Trauma Center's not on a PlayStation 3.

1021
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1022
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:00,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap.

1023
01:05:00,641 --> 01:05:04,483
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll be playing one of the 15 games that came out for it, and that's about it.

1024
01:05:04,663 --> 01:05:07,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess... No, she will not be playing Motorstorm until March.

1025
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:14,208
[SPEAKER_06]: She will be playing... She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spider-Man impregnated her.

1026
01:05:14,308 --> 01:05:14,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1027
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:15,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh...

1028
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:23,067
[SPEAKER_13]: To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.

1029
01:05:24,567 --> 01:05:36,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child, you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.

1030
01:05:37,413 --> 01:05:39,894
[SPEAKER_13]: No video game system is worth your child's life.

1031
01:05:41,214 --> 01:05:41,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1032
01:05:42,135 --> 01:05:42,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the chat room.

1033
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:44,355
[SPEAKER_05]: SSJ100Matt says...

1034
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, it's New Jersey after all.

1035
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:53,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.

1036
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:56,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once.

1037
01:05:56,764 --> 01:05:57,805
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

1038
01:05:57,966 --> 01:06:01,029
[SPEAKER_08]: For all you people in Jersey, that's Loki at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1039
01:06:01,049 --> 01:06:01,790
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1040
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:02,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Send the hate mail.

1041
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:03,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire away.

1042
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just reading the chat room, okay?

1043
01:06:05,855 --> 01:06:06,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say it.

1044
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:07,016
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1045
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:12,042
[SPEAKER_06]: To one very strange incident in a line, too.

1046
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:25,424
[SPEAKER_06]: A line that was complimented on a very big blogging site, Joystick, gave kudos to Best Buy in Landmark Center, Best Buy in Boston, where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.

1047
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:33,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But what happened is that, okay, ways it would happen, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event the next day.

1048
01:06:34,062 --> 01:06:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1049
01:06:58,587 --> 01:06:59,448
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what happened?

1050
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:02,370
[SPEAKER_06]: By 3 p.m., they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.

1051
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:07,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.

1052
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:13,917
[SPEAKER_06]: They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just come back and get their system.

1053
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:17,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And anything that was left over was automatically raffled off.

1054
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:27,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.

1055
01:07:27,847 --> 01:07:28,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for them.

1056
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:33,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good to hear that not every line was just fucking nuts.

1057
01:07:34,186 --> 01:07:36,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So good for you guys in Boston.

1058
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:42,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and Wii launches.

1059
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:50,860
[SPEAKER_13]: They were basically doing this in conjunction with the law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.

1060
01:07:53,242 --> 01:07:58,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going on in regards to the system launches elsewhere.

1061
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:00,905
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.

1062
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:08,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I know with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles, it's real chaos.

1063
01:08:08,407 --> 01:08:14,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this week at launch, you may be in luck.

1064
01:08:14,669 --> 01:08:18,509
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be some more coming in next week for Black Friday.

1065
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:28,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you really want to fight the chaos in the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more...

1066
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:33,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Systems out there for next week and stuff.

1067
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:34,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1068
01:08:34,157 --> 01:08:38,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I don't think that there's a real big need for it right now.

1069
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,582
[SPEAKER_05]: With only 15 games going to be out before the end of the year, you probably could wait.

1070
01:08:42,722 --> 01:08:44,883
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.

1071
01:08:44,943 --> 01:08:47,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what's coming out next month anyways?

1072
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:49,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.

1073
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:52,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.

1074
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so it's not a huge deal.

1075
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:59,371
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's cool at least that they're shipping them relatively quick.

1076
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:05,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this is going to drive the eBay prices down as the market gets more diluted?

1077
01:09:05,377 --> 01:09:06,198
[SPEAKER_05]: It already has, actually.

1078
01:09:06,258 --> 01:09:12,079
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I was reading, they're going for about $1,500 now.

1079
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:23,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think it really... That's also another reason I think you're probably not seeing a lot of Wiis on eBay because their shipments are going to be coming in around the same time.

1080
01:09:24,183 --> 01:09:26,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we heard that we're getting our next shipment after Thanksgiving.

1081
01:09:27,384 --> 01:09:27,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

1082
01:09:29,102 --> 01:09:34,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's gonna be, they're gonna have systems out there, and people don't really need to spend, you know, tons of money.

1083
01:09:36,188 --> 01:09:39,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Ranma just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.

1084
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?

1085
01:09:43,113 --> 01:09:44,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Two gunshots to the head.

1086
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:46,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

1087
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:47,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1088
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, look, I didn't write them, I only read them.

1089
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, uh, yeah, um...

1090
01:09:53,652 --> 01:09:56,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.

1091
01:09:57,213 --> 01:09:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys remember John Edwards?

1092
01:09:58,934 --> 01:10:01,515
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.

1093
01:10:02,395 --> 01:10:03,736
[SPEAKER_06]: He ran with John Kerry, right?

1094
01:10:04,636 --> 01:10:07,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was a story circulating around the internet that what happened.

1095
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:19,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what's interesting to note about John Edwards is he's kind of, you know, he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know, and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart.

1096
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:22,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's kind of in that camp and it's kind of one of his platforms or whatever.

1097
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:24,466
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1098
01:10:39,713 --> 01:10:40,534
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1099
01:11:08,976 --> 01:11:10,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting back and forth.

1100
01:11:11,497 --> 01:11:17,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, there's the he said and they said type thing, so it's really hard to know who's right.

1101
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:27,943
[SPEAKER_06]: But if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little silly.

1102
01:11:28,023 --> 01:11:29,604
[SPEAKER_06]: One of his staffers is probably fired.

1103
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.

1104
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:36,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1105
01:11:37,847 --> 01:11:38,907
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this quote from Walmart?

1106
01:11:38,947 --> 01:11:40,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the quote from Walmart.

1107
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:45,710
[SPEAKER_06]: While the rest of America's working families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.

1108
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:46,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

1109
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:53,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly not good if he's trying to run for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?

1110
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:54,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people probably forget.

1111
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:56,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1112
01:11:57,055 --> 01:11:57,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1113
01:11:57,475 --> 01:11:58,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just thinking.

1114
01:11:58,115 --> 01:11:59,216
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a while ago.

1115
01:11:59,976 --> 01:12:00,316
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1116
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:01,016
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1117
01:12:02,097 --> 01:12:04,998
[SPEAKER_03]: On a small political note, he made a

1118
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:11,918
[SPEAKER_03]: He made a joke about George Bush and everyone took it to be a joke about him insulting the troops.

1119
01:12:12,438 --> 01:12:14,159
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to play that too.

1120
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,560
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Kerry, not Edwards.

1121
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:16,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was Kerry?

1122
01:12:16,301 --> 01:12:17,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1123
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:20,443
[SPEAKER_08]: He did that in Seattle and I thought it was the funniest thing ever.

1124
01:12:20,463 --> 01:12:22,825
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not running anyway because he's associated with John Kerry.

1125
01:12:25,247 --> 01:12:27,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, this isn't Crossfire, boys and girls.

1126
01:12:27,388 --> 01:12:29,189
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to keep it moving.

1127
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:33,492
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to have to go to a different country or something to get us off of this tangent.

1128
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:34,478
[SPEAKER_13]: PS3, PS4, PS5

1129
01:13:00,491 --> 01:13:27,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony's crackdown on all of the shipping LickSanClose, PlayAsia is not sending any Sony products to Europe eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done but there is a company that's advertising in these stations stating PS3 order now for Christmas and they're giving a premium 150 minute phone number to call

1130
01:13:28,914 --> 01:13:34,799
[SPEAKER_13]: to leave details on the phone service to where they'll be called back when the systems are available.

1131
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:40,123
[SPEAKER_13]: A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently investigating it further.

1132
01:13:40,563 --> 01:13:47,269
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.

1133
01:13:49,269 --> 01:13:56,571
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff going on just to get their hands on a PlayStation 3.

1134
01:13:56,952 --> 01:13:58,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus Christ, Sony.

1135
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:00,333
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you trying to hide from Europe?

1136
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:02,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Let them import the goddamn systems.

1137
01:14:03,174 --> 01:14:05,795
[SPEAKER_13]: But I still think that this stinks of scam.

1138
01:14:06,715 --> 01:14:08,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, I don't doubt that one bit.

1139
01:14:08,475 --> 01:14:11,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up.

1140
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:13,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And scammers, shut the fuck up.

1141
01:14:13,937 --> 01:14:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story.

1142
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:17,619
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

1143
01:14:17,699 --> 01:14:18,239
[SPEAKER_06]: You know I love you, DMN.

1144
01:14:21,676 --> 01:14:23,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, sorry.

1145
01:14:25,338 --> 01:14:33,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's kind of funny though, I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart.

1146
01:14:33,824 --> 01:14:40,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going there with a PlayStation 3 in there.

1147
01:14:40,488 --> 01:14:50,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, basically they found out it's not running actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's actually a PlayStation 3.

1148
01:14:50,885 --> 01:14:51,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Live footage.

1149
01:14:51,706 --> 01:14:55,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So, oops, I guess that sucks.

1150
01:14:56,049 --> 01:15:03,394
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was actually coming from Gamer Randy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there.

1151
01:15:04,095 --> 01:15:06,737
[SPEAKER_05]: One for the TV, one for a DVD player.

1152
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:12,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just asking this question hypothetically to bring up debate.

1153
01:15:13,436 --> 01:15:16,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this necessarily such a bad thing, though?

1154
01:15:16,157 --> 01:15:22,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if that's what Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine?

1155
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if that's how they want to do it?

1156
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:29,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine, but I still think it's funny how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk.

1157
01:15:30,384 --> 01:15:30,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It's authentic.

1158
01:15:31,765 --> 01:15:32,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give them that.

1159
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:34,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You're harsh.

1160
01:15:34,566 --> 01:15:35,006
[SPEAKER_06]: You're harsh.

1161
01:15:35,707 --> 01:15:36,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1162
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:42,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, Sony may not be the only folks experiencing some broken things here at launch.

1163
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:54,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually, just before we went live, and I think I missed the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are breaking down, but

1164
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:56,358
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1165
01:16:18,167 --> 01:16:22,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So two of these things they were touting at E3, just for whatever reason, not ready to go just yet.

1166
01:16:23,189 --> 01:16:29,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Should be noted, it's kind of interesting, I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't available either.

1167
01:16:29,092 --> 01:16:32,333
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop channel.

1168
01:16:32,653 --> 01:16:39,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now.

1169
01:16:39,556 --> 01:16:42,477
[SPEAKER_06]: All those people that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today.

1170
01:16:42,877 --> 01:16:44,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, everybody's trying to download that at once.

1171
01:16:44,918 --> 01:16:47,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And thankfully I didn't have a problem, I guess...

1172
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:50,674
[SPEAKER_06]: We're lucky in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores.

1173
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:54,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, you know, certainly interesting to have all these updates.

1174
01:16:54,957 --> 01:17:03,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not detrimental to the system's operation.

1175
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:05,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, first and foremost, the gaming console.

1176
01:17:05,423 --> 01:17:13,748
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly think that the news channel is coming out a little later because it was announced that they're partnering with CNN and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out yet.

1177
01:17:14,722 --> 01:17:23,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea about the forecast channel, but it was interesting to see that firmware update right out of the box when you connected to the internet.

1178
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:30,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike W0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down.

1179
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:31,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, that's because it happened to me.

1180
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,928
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was pissed, of course.

1181
01:17:33,968 --> 01:17:35,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And if my Wii breaks, I'm going to be pissed too.

1182
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:42,975
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay or it's, you know, but it's kind of one of the things like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point.

1183
01:17:42,995 --> 01:17:45,437
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, every launch console has bugs.

1184
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:52,183
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, in the first wave, no matter what the system, PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.

1185
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:59,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?

1186
01:18:00,432 --> 01:18:13,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and again, this was so new, it didn't make our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like it said, you need to eject the disc and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things like that.

1187
01:18:13,334 --> 01:18:15,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that and lots of, like, disc read errors.

1188
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:16,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, little things like that.

1189
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:20,636
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the amount that Sony is.

1190
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:23,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to chat room to read more comments.

1191
01:18:23,802 --> 01:18:25,543
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com

1192
01:18:47,713 --> 01:18:49,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat.

1193
01:18:49,694 --> 01:18:51,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want news or weather?

1194
01:18:52,016 --> 01:18:53,196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

1195
01:18:53,216 --> 01:18:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be nice.

1196
01:18:55,438 --> 01:18:57,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like the internet browser.

1197
01:18:57,459 --> 01:18:58,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would like that, definitely.

1198
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:08,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.

1199
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:09,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry.

1200
01:19:09,948 --> 01:19:13,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, if you want to know what the weather is going to look like, it's called looking out the fucking window.

1201
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:14,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Open a window.

1202
01:19:17,190 --> 01:19:18,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't open the window.

1203
01:19:18,331 --> 01:19:20,272
[SPEAKER_05]: The sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.

1204
01:19:23,194 --> 01:19:24,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, touche.

1205
01:19:24,234 --> 01:19:26,475
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I live in Seattle where it's cloudy and rainy all day.

1206
01:19:27,936 --> 01:19:29,957
[SPEAKER_06]: At least you know what it's always going to be like there.

1207
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:36,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, at any rate, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for is music.

1208
01:19:37,822 --> 01:19:45,827
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be an MP3 player out in Europe anyway on 8th December that will be 20 Pounds.

1209
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:48,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Game Boy Advance and DS

1210
01:20:10,983 --> 01:20:13,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting?

1211
01:20:13,626 --> 01:20:22,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if it is a redo of the PlayOn, the PlayOn had a capacity to take a 2GB SD card.

1212
01:20:24,756 --> 01:20:26,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they already had something like that already.

1213
01:20:27,438 --> 01:20:28,419
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the PlayOn.

1214
01:20:28,839 --> 01:20:29,420
[SPEAKER_05]: No, here.

1215
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:31,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the PlayOn or whatever.

1216
01:20:32,102 --> 01:20:33,864
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.

1217
01:20:34,404 --> 01:20:37,107
[SPEAKER_05]: They use it mainly for, I don't know,

1218
01:20:37,657 --> 01:20:41,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Pirating Games, and other things, but it's also meant for media.

1219
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:47,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte hard drive, micro drive in there.

1220
01:20:47,544 --> 01:20:48,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, this one's official.

1221
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:49,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, interesting.

1222
01:20:51,616 --> 01:20:54,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick.

1223
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:57,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Miklatov PM'd me, and he said his Wii froze up today.

1224
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:00,062
[SPEAKER_06]: He was exiting the Mii channel, and it just froze.

1225
01:21:00,142 --> 01:21:01,503
[SPEAKER_06]: He had to turn it off and on.

1226
01:21:01,563 --> 01:21:07,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get patched or something.

1227
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:10,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine froze up once, but it actually didn't really freeze up.

1228
01:21:10,890 --> 01:21:16,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seemed like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system.

1229
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:21,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Before they launched the internet thing, so yeah, I didn't like it.

1230
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:29,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I tried to do the Shop Channel today, and it just froze up when I was trying to go into Shop Channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.

1231
01:21:29,298 --> 01:21:33,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, mine's kind of a little delayed today, too.

1232
01:21:33,462 --> 01:21:39,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can let little web errors slide, because those are at least fixed in an hour, you know, just depending on the issue.

1233
01:21:39,747 --> 01:21:44,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues ever since the damn game came out, so...

1234
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,582
[SPEAKER_06]: A World of Warcraft, Long Q Times, and all that fun stuff.

1235
01:21:50,122 --> 01:21:54,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Anywho, so, you know, of course you're going to get issues with a console like this.

1236
01:21:54,945 --> 01:22:01,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they cut out, like, you know, DVD playback and stuff like that.

1237
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:02,669
[SPEAKER_05]: But not a big deal.

1238
01:22:02,789 --> 01:22:06,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But actually, they were aiming for an even lower price point than $249.

1239
01:22:06,491 --> 01:22:11,294
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have liked to have seen it at under $100, according to Miyamoto.

1240
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:19,976
[SPEAKER_05]: and his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money could be spent on proving the interface and software.

1241
01:22:20,557 --> 01:22:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and photos and other pricey parts they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.

1242
01:22:31,903 --> 01:22:37,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for $99?

1243
01:22:37,326 --> 01:22:40,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean as it is they're flying off the shelves pretty quick but

1244
01:22:41,426 --> 01:22:44,447
[SPEAKER_05]: $99 is just stupid low.

1245
01:22:45,608 --> 01:22:45,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1246
01:22:46,688 --> 01:22:52,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted as the revolution that the revolution was going to be $99?

1247
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:59,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?

1248
01:22:59,313 --> 01:22:59,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think.

1249
01:23:01,054 --> 01:23:02,395
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I don't know.

1250
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:04,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think $249 is pretty good.

1251
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:06,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, it's different.

1252
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:10,478
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people, though, I think their competition is going to be saying...

1253
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:12,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, our graphics are better.

1254
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:17,684
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do HD movies, but... Yeah, so what?

1255
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:26,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.

1256
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:29,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me.

1257
01:23:30,014 --> 01:23:32,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So, whatever.

1258
01:23:34,178 --> 01:23:34,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1259
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:35,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1260
01:23:36,292 --> 01:23:43,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.

1261
01:23:44,016 --> 01:23:46,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming.

1262
01:23:46,818 --> 01:23:47,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

1263
01:23:47,558 --> 01:23:50,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Drew's waving his hand over there.

1264
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:53,401
[SPEAKER_06]: What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?

1265
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:55,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just the cost or what's the deal?

1266
01:23:56,443 --> 01:23:57,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's the cost.

1267
01:23:58,143 --> 01:24:01,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.

1268
01:24:02,166 --> 01:24:02,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1269
01:24:03,556 --> 01:24:09,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XIII, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side, Super Smash Bros.

1270
01:24:09,598 --> 01:24:11,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

1271
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just waiting for the big name titles.

1272
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:17,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what current gen systems do you have?

1273
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:18,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a Dreamcast?

1274
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:19,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PS2.

1275
01:24:19,382 --> 01:24:20,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a Dreamcast.

1276
01:24:20,763 --> 01:24:22,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can probably still get one cheap.

1277
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:27,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And good news for you Dreamcast owners, there is another Dreamcast game coming out.

1278
01:24:27,185 --> 01:24:32,087
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayAsia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December.

1279
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:34,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a side-scrolling space shooter.

1280
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:40,405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.

1281
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:47,007
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured, distributed, or endorsed by Sega.

1282
01:24:47,447 --> 01:24:55,889
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo AES and NVS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.

1283
01:24:56,129 --> 01:24:56,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, interesting.

1284
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:57,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even catch that.

1285
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,350
[SPEAKER_13]: I went to the website.

1286
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:11,423
[SPEAKER_13]: www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com The one thing about it though is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other Neo Geo carts.

1287
01:25:12,284 --> 01:25:15,207
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo.

1288
01:25:17,343 --> 01:25:19,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless you get CD or Dreamcast.

1289
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:26,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince, that OLR reported on a few months ago.

1290
01:25:26,532 --> 01:25:27,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

1291
01:25:27,293 --> 01:25:28,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Genesis game?

1292
01:25:28,354 --> 01:25:28,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1293
01:25:28,975 --> 01:25:29,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1294
01:25:31,823 --> 01:25:32,083
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

1295
01:25:58,929 --> 01:26:02,031
[SPEAKER_06]: My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.

1296
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:02,611
[SPEAKER_06]: It's smashmyps3.com.

1297
01:26:24,969 --> 01:26:31,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have Smash My PS3.

1298
01:26:32,673 --> 01:26:51,084
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation 3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting outside.

1299
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:55,549
[SPEAKER_13]: and waiting and waiting for their very own PlayStation 3.

1300
01:26:56,829 --> 01:27:19,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.

1301
01:27:21,058 --> 01:27:24,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Translated, that means they smashed that thing to the ground.

1302
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:29,221
[SPEAKER_13]: It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.

1303
01:27:29,381 --> 01:27:31,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, abstract translation.

1304
01:27:31,621 --> 01:27:36,023
[SPEAKER_04]: A method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.

1305
01:27:37,023 --> 01:27:41,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe that... They did take the second one and sell it.

1306
01:27:41,644 --> 01:27:44,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Gets their conscience cleared a little bit.

1307
01:27:44,565 --> 01:27:47,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity, will you be visiting smashmywee.com?

1308
01:27:48,406 --> 01:27:49,347
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that will make me cry.

1309
01:27:50,720 --> 01:28:02,246
[SPEAKER_13]: No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny because there's people who are so freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.

1310
01:28:04,247 --> 01:28:08,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, there's a... You can't get laid, Jernami.

1311
01:28:09,733 --> 01:28:14,336
[SPEAKER_03]: There's actually, there was a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.

1312
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:18,899
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool, and I'm looking forward to it.

1313
01:28:18,939 --> 01:28:21,401
[SPEAKER_03]: There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.

1314
01:28:21,821 --> 01:28:25,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!

1315
01:28:27,825 --> 01:28:31,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Satan commands that I give my soul to Sony!

1316
01:28:31,448 --> 01:28:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like, watching someone smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point.

1317
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:42,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, does that mean Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?

1318
01:28:43,548 --> 01:28:44,249
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't seen that.

1319
01:28:44,309 --> 01:28:45,670
No, I love Little Nicky.

1320
01:28:46,511 --> 01:28:48,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.

1321
01:28:48,132 --> 01:28:49,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes.

1322
01:28:49,653 --> 01:28:50,454
[SPEAKER_04]: He eats crayons.

1323
01:28:51,675 --> 01:28:53,517
[SPEAKER_13]: He's like the poo of Cthulhu.

1324
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,763
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his fecal matter.

1325
01:29:03,606 --> 01:29:06,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's interesting.

1326
01:29:06,648 --> 01:29:06,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1327
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip here.

1328
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:18,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having to hold off on the contest a little bit here.

1329
01:29:18,832 --> 01:29:20,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll fill you in after this taped segment what we're going to do.

1330
01:29:20,652 --> 01:29:23,193
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hoping the rest of the chat comes back.

1331
01:29:23,293 --> 01:29:24,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob broke the internet.

1332
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't break it.

1333
01:29:25,453 --> 01:29:26,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a backup plan just in case.

1334
01:29:26,813 --> 01:29:28,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll run it by DMN.

1335
01:29:28,394 --> 01:29:29,794
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're going to go to this taped bit.

1336
01:29:30,054 --> 01:29:32,914
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland.

1337
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:36,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And they thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?

1338
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different people.

1339
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:45,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?

1340
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:51,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the car we were thinking, hey, it'd be a cool idea to interview people to see why they're out in line.

1341
01:29:51,364 --> 01:29:55,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was, like, Jamie was keeping our place in line and I was going to go play reporter.

1342
01:29:55,827 --> 01:29:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.

1343
01:29:59,950 --> 01:30:01,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like talking to new people.

1344
01:30:02,692 --> 01:30:03,133
[SPEAKER_06]: She's shy.

1345
01:30:04,506 --> 01:30:05,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I am pretty shy around new people.

1346
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:08,149
[SPEAKER_03]: So I walked up and I was representing Orange Lounge.

1347
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:11,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, oh, hi, do you mind if I interview you for OrangeLoungeRadio.com?

1348
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:12,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a video game.

1349
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:14,352
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went through the whole thing.

1350
01:30:14,752 --> 01:30:17,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of most of them went, uh, sure.

1351
01:30:17,634 --> 01:30:20,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.

1352
01:30:20,836 --> 01:30:22,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry.

1353
01:30:22,537 --> 01:30:23,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry you have to listen to those.

1354
01:30:24,098 --> 01:30:25,038
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's cool.

1355
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:26,359
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, Demon?

1356
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:30,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.

1357
01:30:30,561 --> 01:30:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

1358
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:31,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1359
01:30:32,503 --> 01:30:34,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.

1360
01:30:35,164 --> 01:30:42,908
[SPEAKER_16]: This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Lounge Radio message line from the line outside Target in Citrus Heights, California.

1361
01:30:42,928 --> 01:30:45,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Say hi, everybody.

1362
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:51,852
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the night.

1363
01:30:51,992 --> 01:30:54,613
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'll begin by our house lesbian.

1364
01:30:54,653 --> 01:30:54,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1365
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:55,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

1366
01:30:56,194 --> 01:30:57,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And stay tuned to listen.

1367
01:30:57,835 --> 01:30:58,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, bye-bye.

1368
01:30:59,758 --> 01:31:03,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Lauren's Lounge Radio.

1369
01:31:04,003 --> 01:31:10,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I am Chris, also known as Disney Punk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target Garden Center, actually.

1370
01:31:10,752 --> 01:31:12,394
[SPEAKER_16]: We're under the sign that says Garden Center.

1371
01:31:13,014 --> 01:31:15,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's probably, it looks to be about 30 people online.

1372
01:31:15,197 --> 01:31:17,380
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to start at the end because the end rules.

1373
01:31:18,298 --> 01:31:22,022
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm right in front of a guy and a girl.

1374
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:25,245
[SPEAKER_16]: One's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black hats on.

1375
01:31:25,325 --> 01:31:26,426
[SPEAKER_16]: One's got an Alcatraz office on.

1376
01:31:26,446 --> 01:31:27,067
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

1377
01:31:27,387 --> 01:31:28,628
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just going to ask a couple of questions.

1378
01:31:28,808 --> 01:31:30,029
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, can you state your name?

1379
01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:30,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie.

1380
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:31,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie?

1381
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,295
[SPEAKER_16]: Our host, DarkSakura, actually named Jamie, too.

1382
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:37,837
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to fight.

1383
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:38,417
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I'm kidding.

1384
01:31:38,898 --> 01:31:40,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I have your name?

1385
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:40,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Erin.

1386
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:40,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Erin?

1387
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:41,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Erin?

1388
01:31:41,935 --> 01:31:47,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at, what is it, 2?

1389
01:31:47,858 --> 01:31:48,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's 2 o'clock in the morning?

1390
01:31:49,299 --> 01:31:52,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's my birthday today.

1391
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:53,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

1392
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:55,902
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.

1393
01:31:56,302 --> 01:32:02,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones because the codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.

1394
01:32:03,585 --> 01:32:06,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?

1395
01:32:07,787 --> 01:32:08,028
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1396
01:32:08,848 --> 01:32:09,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely not.

1397
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:10,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely not?

1398
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:11,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Why not?

1399
01:32:11,938 --> 01:32:13,641
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not as interested really right now.

1400
01:32:14,642 --> 01:32:16,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.

1401
01:32:17,607 --> 01:32:18,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

1402
01:32:18,748 --> 01:32:20,531
[SPEAKER_16]: And can I ask you guys a random question?

1403
01:32:21,492 --> 01:32:24,296
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite color?

1404
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:24,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue.

1405
01:32:25,037 --> 01:32:25,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Green?

1406
01:32:25,774 --> 01:32:27,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, those were both wrong answers and you fail.

1407
01:32:29,116 --> 01:32:29,476
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm kidding.

1408
01:32:29,736 --> 01:32:29,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange.

1409
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:31,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange, okay.

1410
01:32:32,417 --> 01:32:33,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you, sir?

1411
01:32:33,298 --> 01:32:34,338
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your name?

1412
01:32:34,398 --> 01:32:34,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Nathan.

1413
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:35,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Nathan?

1414
01:32:35,619 --> 01:32:38,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, why do you think the Wii U is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

1415
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:42,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan.

1416
01:32:42,222 --> 01:32:42,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I grew up on it.

1417
01:32:44,704 --> 01:32:45,964
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, old school fan.

1418
01:32:45,984 --> 01:32:49,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?

1419
01:32:49,626 --> 01:32:50,407
[SPEAKER_09]: No, absolutely not.

1420
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:50,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1421
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,009
[SPEAKER_16]: And here's your obligatory question.

1422
01:32:55,996 --> 01:32:56,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm, that's a good one.

1423
01:32:57,517 --> 01:32:59,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't really think of a little obligatory question.

1424
01:32:59,638 --> 01:33:01,159
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your favorite color?

1425
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:01,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Red.

1426
01:33:01,519 --> 01:33:01,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Red?

1427
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:01,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1428
01:33:02,439 --> 01:33:03,240
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the right answer.

1429
01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:03,740
[SPEAKER_16]: You win.

1430
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:07,622
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.

1431
01:33:07,702 --> 01:33:12,885
[SPEAKER_16]: There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here, and there isn't a big line, so good luck.

1432
01:33:13,405 --> 01:33:20,569
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, radio fans, and this is Kristen again with your Wii.

1433
01:33:20,949 --> 01:33:21,770
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess it would be...

1434
01:33:22,854 --> 01:33:25,718
[SPEAKER_16]: and our cast of Are We... I don't know what you call it.

1435
01:33:25,998 --> 01:33:28,541
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.

1436
01:33:29,463 --> 01:33:31,145
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm here with... Can you say your name?

1437
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:31,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Sarah.

1438
01:33:32,006 --> 01:33:32,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Sarah.

1439
01:33:33,868 --> 01:33:37,192
[SPEAKER_16]: I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line.

1440
01:33:37,232 --> 01:33:38,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.

1441
01:33:38,915 --> 01:33:39,015
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

1442
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:42,923
[SPEAKER_16]: But she's got, she's probably got the most awesome hat here.

1443
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:50,347
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a white hat, like baseball cap, with a V. It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.

1444
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:53,109
[SPEAKER_16]: So, can I ask you, she's actually got, what's your shirt?

1445
01:33:53,509 --> 01:33:54,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Donkey Kong.

1446
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:54,550
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.

1447
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:56,071
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.

1448
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:56,631
[SPEAKER_16]: That's awesome.

1449
01:33:57,051 --> 01:34:01,374
[SPEAKER_16]: So, can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

1450
01:34:02,275 --> 01:34:04,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?

1451
01:34:04,736 --> 01:34:06,017
[SPEAKER_16]: How long, actually, how long have you been here?

1452
01:34:06,713 --> 01:34:09,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.

1453
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:11,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Not too terribly long, yeah.

1454
01:34:11,355 --> 01:34:12,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's not bad.

1455
01:34:12,775 --> 01:34:15,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you think the Wii is waiting for us this early in the morning?

1456
01:34:17,717 --> 01:34:18,778
[SPEAKER_16]: Twilight Princess, first of all.

1457
01:34:18,978 --> 01:34:25,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while, and I think it's certainly worth the wait.

1458
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1459
01:34:27,781 --> 01:34:28,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you get a PS3?

1460
01:34:29,142 --> 01:34:31,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, hell no.

1461
01:34:31,483 --> 01:34:35,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you see a difference, or is it just the price, or...?

1462
01:34:35,882 --> 01:34:40,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I would not pay $600 to test out an unused, unproven format of disc.

1463
01:34:40,406 --> 01:34:40,646
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1464
01:34:40,726 --> 01:34:41,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Screw Sony.

1465
01:34:41,387 --> 01:34:42,548
[SPEAKER_15]: They're getting too big for their shorts.

1466
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:46,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, you are loved by many Orange Lounge listeners.

1467
01:34:47,652 --> 01:34:50,895
[SPEAKER_16]: They all bash Sony all the time.

1468
01:34:50,975 --> 01:34:53,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?

1469
01:34:54,478 --> 01:34:54,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Blue.

1470
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:57,081
[SPEAKER_16]: You fail and lose.

1471
01:34:57,661 --> 01:34:58,041
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1472
01:34:58,241 --> 01:34:59,241
[SPEAKER_15]: I meant to say orange.

1473
01:34:59,281 --> 01:35:00,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I meant to say orange!

1474
01:35:00,282 --> 01:35:02,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you survived.

1475
01:35:02,943 --> 01:35:07,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii, but I don't think it'll be that bad.

1476
01:35:07,564 --> 01:35:08,625
[SPEAKER_16]: There's not that many people online.

1477
01:35:09,385 --> 01:35:10,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you very much.

1478
01:35:10,765 --> 01:35:11,586
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

1479
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:15,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?

1480
01:35:15,787 --> 01:35:16,868
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your quest?

1481
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:17,588
[SPEAKER_13]: You!

1482
01:35:18,128 --> 01:35:19,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Cake or death!

1483
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:37,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question, I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions, but I was so nervous, I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them, and I just kept, what's your favorite color?

1484
01:35:38,043 --> 01:35:44,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright, it's just an internet radio show, you don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie, you still are, you're Saint Chris, remember?

1485
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:45,150
[SPEAKER_13]: It's

1486
01:35:45,862 --> 01:35:47,823
[SPEAKER_13]: She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.

1487
01:35:47,963 --> 01:35:53,584
[SPEAKER_06]: No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.

1488
01:35:55,665 --> 01:35:57,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to help your radio.

1489
01:35:57,946 --> 01:35:58,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's funny.

1490
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:01,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it because I like hearing people's reactions to it.

1491
01:36:01,467 --> 01:36:01,827
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1492
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell no.

1493
01:36:03,907 --> 01:36:06,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later.

1494
01:36:06,348 --> 01:36:08,609
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I just had to interrupt to say that because that was funny.

1495
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:09,589
[SPEAKER_06]: So back to the tape.

1496
01:36:10,194 --> 01:36:16,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people, in line for the Wii.

1497
01:36:16,676 --> 01:36:17,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you guys state your names?

1498
01:36:18,236 --> 01:36:20,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Stellon, John.

1499
01:36:21,757 --> 01:36:24,558
[SPEAKER_16]: How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?

1500
01:36:24,678 --> 01:36:26,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like nine, about like eight.

1501
01:36:26,358 --> 01:36:27,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, what's your name?

1502
01:36:28,419 --> 01:36:28,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Kyle.

1503
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:30,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Kyle, how long have you been here?

1504
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:31,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, just Kyle.

1505
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:35,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, uh, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?

1506
01:36:35,521 --> 01:36:35,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh,

1507
01:36:38,539 --> 01:36:38,739
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1508
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:40,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?

1509
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:41,981
[SPEAKER_16]: What's so special about it?

1510
01:36:42,442 --> 01:36:43,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's so kick-ass.

1511
01:36:43,843 --> 01:36:44,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's Zelda.

1512
01:36:45,864 --> 01:36:47,005
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just picking it up for a friend.

1513
01:36:47,905 --> 01:36:48,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1514
01:36:49,426 --> 01:36:53,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn, he must owe you or you owe him.

1515
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:53,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you owe him money?

1516
01:36:54,670 --> 01:36:54,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1517
01:36:56,591 --> 01:36:57,972
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just here for kicks.

1518
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:00,473
[SPEAKER_16]: You're just hanging out in the cold?

1519
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:00,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1520
01:37:01,094 --> 01:37:01,474
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1521
01:37:01,494 --> 01:37:05,336
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?

1522
01:37:05,376 --> 01:37:05,477
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1523
01:37:06,641 --> 01:37:08,602
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Sony Scott.

1524
01:37:08,622 --> 01:37:10,324
[SPEAKER_17]: Not unless they drop the price.

1525
01:37:12,145 --> 01:37:14,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, he's just here for kids.

1526
01:37:14,947 --> 01:37:18,229
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, and your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?

1527
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:19,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Green.

1528
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:20,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Plaid.

1529
01:37:21,391 --> 01:37:21,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Yellow.

1530
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:22,532
Yellow?

1531
01:37:23,032 --> 01:37:23,893
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you win.

1532
01:37:24,053 --> 01:37:24,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Plaid wins.

1533
01:37:24,893 --> 01:37:26,394
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, well, thank you guys.

1534
01:37:26,435 --> 01:37:33,179
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock tonight, or we're on podcast.

1535
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,380
[SPEAKER_16]: You can download it on iTunes.

1536
01:37:35,024 --> 01:37:37,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, though.

1537
01:37:38,505 --> 01:37:38,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, Wii!

1538
01:37:39,046 --> 01:37:44,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but because the next one is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.

1539
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:48,789
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're interviewing people at the Wii, so Jamie, stop talking to people.

1540
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:49,949
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

1541
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:50,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1542
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:52,971
[SPEAKER_16]: State your name, please.

1543
01:37:52,991 --> 01:37:54,871
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, the Great and Mighty.

1544
01:37:56,072 --> 01:37:57,092
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty pathetic.

1545
01:37:57,112 --> 01:37:58,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Light my ass!

1546
01:37:59,273 --> 01:37:59,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Literally?

1547
01:38:00,245 --> 01:38:01,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, in public.

1548
01:38:01,526 --> 01:38:05,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you get to be asked these questions too.

1549
01:38:05,489 --> 01:38:08,951
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

1550
01:38:09,652 --> 01:38:10,232
[SPEAKER_16]: I was bored.

1551
01:38:10,652 --> 01:38:13,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1552
01:38:14,215 --> 01:38:15,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, are you getting a PS3?

1553
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:21,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1554
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:26,524
[SPEAKER_16]: We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a trader and pre-ordered one right before he quit GameStop.

1555
01:38:27,164 --> 01:38:27,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you guys actually get it?

1556
01:38:28,645 --> 01:38:29,846
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're getting a second shipment.

1557
01:38:31,129 --> 01:38:34,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care because Sony sucks my butt.

1558
01:38:36,031 --> 01:38:41,772
[SPEAKER_16]: Your obligatory question, can you peel potatoes correctly?

1559
01:38:43,133 --> 01:38:50,755
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama, and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.

1560
01:38:54,016 --> 01:38:55,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Nintendo, please give her money.

1561
01:38:56,636 --> 01:38:59,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Better living than Nintendo, I am now the aluminum chef.

1562
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:00,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-huh.

1563
01:39:01,341 --> 01:39:05,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.

1564
01:39:05,823 --> 01:39:07,003
[SPEAKER_16]: I go on to the next step.

1565
01:39:07,223 --> 01:39:12,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the WeLine at Target.

1566
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:20,127
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are apparently, or one of them at least, is apparently a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second when I get closer to him.

1567
01:39:20,575 --> 01:39:23,257
[SPEAKER_16]: They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.

1568
01:39:24,738 --> 01:39:28,942
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that that's like old school, you know.

1569
01:39:29,082 --> 01:39:31,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, alright, I get it.

1570
01:39:32,184 --> 01:39:34,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.

1571
01:39:34,726 --> 01:39:35,607
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your name?

1572
01:39:35,627 --> 01:39:35,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Gary.

1573
01:39:36,168 --> 01:39:36,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Gary.

1574
01:39:36,928 --> 01:39:37,409
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your name?

1575
01:39:37,449 --> 01:39:37,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Horatio.

1576
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:45,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Jordan Can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at 2 in the morning waiting for a week?

1577
01:39:54,437 --> 01:39:56,839
[SPEAKER_17]: We want the Wii.

1578
01:39:56,879 --> 01:39:57,579
[SPEAKER_17]: We want the Wii.

1579
01:39:57,919 --> 01:39:59,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Why do you want the Wii so badly?

1580
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Twilight Princess.

1581
01:40:00,721 --> 01:40:01,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Twilight Princess.

1582
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:03,162
[SPEAKER_16]: And you?

1583
01:40:03,182 --> 01:40:05,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Twilight Princess.

1584
01:40:05,824 --> 01:40:07,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Twilight Princess.

1585
01:40:07,725 --> 01:40:09,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Car, yo!

1586
01:40:09,987 --> 01:40:10,767
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I get your name?

1587
01:40:11,267 --> 01:40:11,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Kristen.

1588
01:40:13,149 --> 01:40:13,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Travis.

1589
01:40:13,569 --> 01:40:14,129
Travis.

1590
01:40:14,469 --> 01:40:15,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are you out here?

1591
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:17,211
[SPEAKER_17]: To get a Wii for his brother.

1592
01:40:18,772 --> 01:40:19,452
[SPEAKER_16]: You owe him money?

1593
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:20,853
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm just a good friend.

1594
01:40:21,113 --> 01:40:21,574
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not broke.

1595
01:40:21,594 --> 01:40:22,074
[SPEAKER_16]: That's sweet.

1596
01:40:24,427 --> 01:40:27,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I get your name?

1597
01:40:27,149 --> 01:40:27,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Steven.

1598
01:40:27,770 --> 01:40:28,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Steven?

1599
01:40:28,631 --> 01:40:33,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to actually have an interview with you.

1600
01:40:34,235 --> 01:40:36,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Steven, why are you here?

1601
01:40:36,637 --> 01:40:42,541
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you guys, can I ask you guys, did you get a PS3?

1602
01:40:42,681 --> 01:40:44,082
[SPEAKER_16]: Or planning on getting a PS3?

1603
01:40:44,423 --> 01:40:46,744
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe with $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.

1604
01:40:46,945 --> 01:40:48,466
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only game I will be getting for that.

1605
01:40:48,526 --> 01:40:48,886
No.

1606
01:40:49,507 --> 01:40:49,647
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

1607
01:40:49,987 --> 01:40:50,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Not at all?

1608
01:40:50,407 --> 01:40:50,467
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1609
01:40:51,667 --> 01:40:52,848
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll borrow his video game.

1610
01:40:52,868 --> 01:40:53,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'll borrow one.

1611
01:40:53,468 --> 01:40:53,748
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no PS3.

1612
01:40:53,768 --> 01:40:54,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Final Fantasy 13.

1613
01:40:55,029 --> 01:40:56,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, and here's your blanket question.

1614
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,450
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite color?

1615
01:40:58,531 --> 01:40:58,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue.

1616
01:40:58,731 --> 01:40:59,211
[SPEAKER_00]: You failed.

1617
01:40:59,231 --> 01:40:59,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Green.

1618
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:00,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's correct.

1619
01:41:19,303 --> 01:41:29,568
[SPEAKER_16]: I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a DarkSakura fanboy apparently.

1620
01:41:29,588 --> 01:41:30,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll be there in a second.

1621
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:44,573
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello radio listeners, I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.

1622
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:47,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?

1623
01:41:47,954 --> 01:41:51,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.

1624
01:41:51,055 --> 01:41:51,955
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not in the chat at all?

1625
01:41:52,275 --> 01:41:53,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but you are a listener?

1626
01:41:53,716 --> 01:41:54,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Archive listener.

1627
01:41:55,016 --> 01:41:55,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Awesome.

1628
01:41:55,636 --> 01:41:58,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m.

1629
01:41:58,657 --> 01:41:59,098
[SPEAKER_16]: for a Wii?

1630
01:41:59,998 --> 01:42:00,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, the Wii?

1631
01:42:00,618 --> 01:42:01,899
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I was in the, like, PS3 line.

1632
01:42:02,019 --> 01:42:04,820
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm getting a Wii.

1633
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:05,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, why are you getting a Wii?

1634
01:42:06,847 --> 01:42:07,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Spongebob.

1635
01:42:09,929 --> 01:42:11,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I often hear Zelda's pretty good.

1636
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:14,211
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, well, we'll buy that.

1637
01:42:14,551 --> 01:42:16,332
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?

1638
01:42:17,433 --> 01:42:18,713
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll buy it.

1639
01:42:18,753 --> 01:42:21,055
[SPEAKER_17]: If my friends get it, I'll play it, but I'm not going to buy it myself.

1640
01:42:21,115 --> 01:42:22,315
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Dave.

1641
01:42:22,475 --> 01:42:23,896
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, what's your favorite color?

1642
01:42:24,296 --> 01:42:24,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Brown.

1643
01:42:26,277 --> 01:42:27,418
[SPEAKER_17]: No, hold on.

1644
01:42:28,378 --> 01:42:28,919
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought white.

1645
01:42:28,939 --> 01:42:31,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki is displeased with you.

1646
01:42:35,958 --> 01:42:37,158
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki is displeased with you.

1647
01:42:37,179 --> 01:42:39,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.

1648
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:40,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.

1649
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:42,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Microsoft.

1650
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:42,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1651
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?

1652
01:42:45,101 --> 01:42:45,601
[SPEAKER_16]: It's amazing.

1653
01:42:46,161 --> 01:42:46,761
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing.

1654
01:42:46,801 --> 01:42:48,422
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your favorite part?

1655
01:42:48,542 --> 01:42:50,563
[SPEAKER_16]: I like FU's of the Week.

1656
01:42:50,763 --> 01:42:52,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Damien just informed us that he came up with that.

1657
01:42:53,203 --> 01:42:55,704
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny because I always talk about the roads in Sacramento.

1658
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:57,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.

1659
01:42:57,305 --> 01:42:57,945
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's pretty cool.

1660
01:42:58,837 --> 01:42:59,718
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1661
01:42:59,878 --> 01:43:04,984
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any advice you'd want to give Rob, Jamie, and Loki?

1662
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:06,606
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1663
01:43:06,626 --> 01:43:08,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell them to go snorkeling more.

1664
01:43:08,688 --> 01:43:10,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, go snorkeling more often.

1665
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,592
[SPEAKER_15]: More snorkeling inside the gaming news.

1666
01:43:13,874 --> 01:43:14,694
[SPEAKER_16]: I see.

1667
01:43:14,734 --> 01:43:16,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I give you a hint of another...

1668
01:43:18,078 --> 01:43:20,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, Orange Line listeners, I'm at the front of the line.

1669
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:21,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody just yelled.

1670
01:43:44,961 --> 01:43:47,323
[SPEAKER_16]: That was interesting.

1671
01:43:47,423 --> 01:43:54,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, I'm at the front of the line with some people playing Monopoly, and I actually haven't gotten an okay to interview all of them, but let's start.

1672
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:56,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I interview you guys?

1673
01:43:57,029 --> 01:43:58,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1674
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1675
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I get your name?

1676
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:00,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Nick.

1677
01:44:00,511 --> 01:44:00,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Rod.

1678
01:44:01,151 --> 01:44:01,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Rod.

1679
01:44:02,572 --> 01:44:03,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Farnsworth.

1680
01:44:03,433 --> 01:44:04,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Farnsworth.

1681
01:44:04,713 --> 01:44:05,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Katie.

1682
01:44:05,434 --> 01:44:06,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Katie.

1683
01:44:06,374 --> 01:44:06,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Katie.

1684
01:44:06,895 --> 01:44:08,436
[SPEAKER_17]: I like to go by Epis.

1685
01:44:08,756 --> 01:44:09,016
Epis.

1686
01:44:10,384 --> 01:44:19,090
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?

1687
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:20,791
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a cool place to play Monopoly.

1688
01:44:24,453 --> 01:44:26,134
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the Wii worth waiting for?

1689
01:44:27,375 --> 01:44:30,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.

1690
01:44:30,137 --> 01:44:32,458
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's all we're really doing.

1691
01:44:32,498 --> 01:44:33,619
[SPEAKER_15]: We have nothing else better to do.

1692
01:44:33,879 --> 01:44:36,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang out with friends, play some games.

1693
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:39,432
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want the Wii, I guess.

1694
01:44:39,472 --> 01:44:40,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you really want the Wii?

1695
01:44:41,093 --> 01:44:43,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.

1696
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:45,376
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing better to do next weekend.

1697
01:44:45,776 --> 01:44:46,156
[SPEAKER_16]: That works.

1698
01:44:47,477 --> 01:44:48,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to fit in.

1699
01:44:48,498 --> 01:44:49,759
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be in the end crowd.

1700
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:51,920
[SPEAKER_16]: You're not cool unless you have a Wii.

1701
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:52,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

1702
01:44:53,561 --> 01:44:54,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

1703
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:56,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want me to come back?

1704
01:44:57,164 --> 01:44:57,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1705
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:57,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1706
01:44:59,266 --> 01:45:05,048
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard it actually increases sexual performance.

1707
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,148
[SPEAKER_17]: With the wrist movements.

1708
01:45:09,029 --> 01:45:10,649
[SPEAKER_17]: No, with the wrist movements.

1709
01:45:10,729 --> 01:45:17,551
[SPEAKER_17]: The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.

1710
01:45:17,631 --> 01:45:20,152
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's the most interesting answer I've gotten yet.

1711
01:45:20,832 --> 01:45:25,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way of innovating the game system.

1712
01:45:25,779 --> 01:45:28,019
[SPEAKER_16]: and that's the most intelligent one at the table.

1713
01:45:28,139 --> 01:45:29,540
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1714
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:34,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I ask you guys, are you getting a PS3 at all or what do you think about it?

1715
01:45:35,621 --> 01:45:38,922
[SPEAKER_17]: If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay attention at all.

1716
01:45:38,942 --> 01:45:40,842
[SPEAKER_16]: The one that goes down in price.

1717
01:45:41,282 --> 01:45:41,842
[SPEAKER_17]: Hang on, I'm moving.

1718
01:45:42,162 --> 01:45:44,403
[SPEAKER_17]: You mean the piece of shit three that already has glitches?

1719
01:45:44,443 --> 01:45:45,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, pretty much.

1720
01:45:45,603 --> 01:45:47,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, whoa!

1721
01:45:47,603 --> 01:45:49,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, I'll be getting one.

1722
01:45:49,264 --> 01:45:49,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh...

1723
01:45:52,040 --> 01:46:01,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's going to be a glitch and $600 for something that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once in a while?

1724
01:46:01,662 --> 01:46:06,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's luck, getting a hooker downtown than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.

1725
01:46:08,104 --> 01:46:08,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I like this table.

1726
01:46:08,984 --> 01:46:09,884
[SPEAKER_15]: These people are interesting.

1727
01:46:10,325 --> 01:46:12,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, you guys get an obligatory question.

1728
01:46:12,305 --> 01:46:12,925
[SPEAKER_16]: What's your favorite color?

1729
01:46:13,245 --> 01:46:13,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Clear.

1730
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:15,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Fail.

1731
01:46:15,726 --> 01:46:16,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Vlog.

1732
01:46:16,226 --> 01:46:17,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll accept that.

1733
01:46:19,407 --> 01:46:20,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Corn yellow.

1734
01:46:21,098 --> 01:46:21,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting.

1735
01:46:21,818 --> 01:46:22,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I accept.

1736
01:46:23,659 --> 01:46:24,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Jeremy, you stole mine.

1737
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:25,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Fail.

1738
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:26,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll pink.

1739
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,020
[SPEAKER_16]: I like pink.

1740
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:28,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1741
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:29,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Light purple.

1742
01:46:32,121 --> 01:46:32,901
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll accept that.

1743
01:46:32,921 --> 01:46:35,902
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.

1744
01:46:36,622 --> 01:46:37,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you guys for evening.

1745
01:46:37,843 --> 01:46:38,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck.

1746
01:46:39,361 --> 01:46:40,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that was our last one.

1747
01:46:40,623 --> 01:46:42,024
[SPEAKER_16]: They are at the front of the line.

1748
01:46:43,146 --> 01:46:47,191
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll call one more time to tell you how I feel about all this.

1749
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:48,973
[SPEAKER_16]: If anyone really gives a shit.

1750
01:46:49,133 --> 01:46:50,775
[SPEAKER_16]: So, alright, thanks.

1751
01:46:50,795 --> 01:46:54,960
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the last one I'll be making of these because I bet you're just

1752
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,581
[SPEAKER_16]: and Sick of Me.

1753
01:46:56,841 --> 01:47:02,744
[SPEAKER_16]: But you get one more little tidbit and that is from Wah, your token lesbian of the show.

1754
01:47:04,385 --> 01:47:16,391
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm actually out here because a bunch of people are waiting out in line and they look cold and they do not look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.

1755
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:22,514
[SPEAKER_16]: So Jamie and I actually offered to get them coffee and donuts and that's pretty much why I'm out here.

1756
01:47:23,078 --> 01:47:24,739
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.

1757
01:47:25,219 --> 01:47:26,080
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the only reason.

1758
01:47:26,500 --> 01:47:27,941
[SPEAKER_16]: And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too.

1759
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:29,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So, eh, whatever.

1760
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:32,183
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never played Zelda before.

1761
01:47:32,543 --> 01:47:35,324
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never got to because my daddy did not let me.

1762
01:47:35,785 --> 01:47:36,765
[SPEAKER_16]: I was a deprived child.

1763
01:47:37,165 --> 01:47:41,107
[SPEAKER_16]: So, anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.

1764
01:47:41,127 --> 01:47:41,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Disney Punk.

1765
01:47:42,288 --> 01:47:46,410
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is in front of Target reporting for the Wii line.

1766
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:50,192
[SPEAKER_16]: And, oh, just to let you know, there's a Best Buy, like, right across the way.

1767
01:47:50,272 --> 01:47:51,753
[SPEAKER_16]: And that line's, like, ten times as long.

1768
01:47:52,561 --> 01:47:55,144
[SPEAKER_16]: and that amuses me.

1769
01:47:56,425 --> 01:47:59,568
[SPEAKER_16]: But this line's cooler because they're getting coffee and donuts soon.

1770
01:47:59,588 --> 01:48:04,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, have fun out there in the Ethernet.

1771
01:48:07,006 --> 01:48:08,026
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you, Chris.

1772
01:48:08,406 --> 01:48:12,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of the folks in the chat room were like, oh, this is long, this is long.

1773
01:48:12,488 --> 01:48:14,268
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are talking to too damn many people.

1774
01:48:14,288 --> 01:48:14,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so sorry.

1775
01:48:14,748 --> 01:48:16,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be sorry, because you know what?

1776
01:48:16,769 --> 01:48:19,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Usagi hit the, or Usagi, I... Say Usagi.

1777
01:48:19,850 --> 01:48:22,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to hell.

1778
01:48:22,271 --> 01:48:29,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, no, she's right on here, because the quote here is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all about, the best people on earth.

1779
01:48:30,013 --> 01:48:30,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly it.

1780
01:48:32,035 --> 01:48:35,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what made last night so fun, was just meeting other nerds.

1781
01:48:35,137 --> 01:48:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really amazing.

1782
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:40,521
[SPEAKER_03]: They were so nice, and they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.

1783
01:48:41,402 --> 01:48:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really important to interview.

1784
01:48:43,124 --> 01:48:45,245
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't that many people in line, considering.

1785
01:48:46,066 --> 01:48:47,367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, there's not that many people.

1786
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:51,030
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on, and Rob can edit it later.

1787
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:52,931
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was just really fun meeting all of them.

1788
01:48:52,991 --> 01:48:55,954
[SPEAKER_03]: They all said thanks, and they all asked, so when is it going to be played?

1789
01:48:55,974 --> 01:48:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1790
01:48:56,634 --> 01:48:58,235
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, I think some of them are in here now.

1791
01:48:58,255 --> 01:48:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw Ace Ender earlier.

1792
01:48:59,335 --> 01:48:59,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he's back.

1793
01:49:00,015 --> 01:49:02,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that must have been that whole Netsplit thing came back and some of those other people.

1794
01:49:02,816 --> 01:49:04,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, hi!

1795
01:49:04,157 --> 01:49:10,279
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to say, too, the group that let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.

1796
01:49:10,299 --> 01:49:11,679
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys were infinitely awesome.

1797
01:49:11,699 --> 01:49:12,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

1798
01:49:12,440 --> 01:49:13,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Sources of amusement.

1799
01:49:14,020 --> 01:49:15,802
[SPEAKER_13]: and kept me from passing out.

1800
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire night, the people that were right next to us and right behind us, they just were so nice.

1801
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:23,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody kept walking up and down just talking to us.

1802
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:24,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was so nice.

1803
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:27,453
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one big block party.

1804
01:49:27,893 --> 01:49:30,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.

1805
01:49:32,197 --> 01:49:35,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I was hearing the single best commentary coming from that game of Risk.

1806
01:49:36,281 --> 01:49:37,282
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the best.

1807
01:49:37,502 --> 01:49:38,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Every now and then you'd hear that collective...

1808
01:49:40,859 --> 01:49:43,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And every so often I would ask, who took over the world yet?

1809
01:49:45,502 --> 01:49:48,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday, you know.

1810
01:49:49,365 --> 01:49:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I just took Australia, motherfucker.

1811
01:49:52,407 --> 01:49:53,347
[SPEAKER_03]: WTF, mate.

1812
01:49:55,709 --> 01:49:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1813
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:57,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN's We

1814
01:50:20,712 --> 01:50:22,714
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's giving it away out of the goodness of his heart.

1815
01:50:22,994 --> 01:50:24,855
[SPEAKER_06]: This was not something that was given to him.

1816
01:50:24,895 --> 01:50:29,719
[SPEAKER_06]: This was not something that he bought this with his own money and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?

1817
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:30,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1818
01:50:30,179 --> 01:50:32,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners, something like that.

1819
01:50:32,621 --> 01:50:33,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can do whatever rules we want.

1820
01:50:33,882 --> 01:50:35,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the new rules.

1821
01:50:36,244 --> 01:50:37,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy and it's still fair.

1822
01:50:37,485 --> 01:50:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Biggest e-penis wins.

1823
01:50:38,645 --> 01:50:38,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Go.

1824
01:50:39,046 --> 01:50:39,726
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1825
01:50:39,766 --> 01:50:40,167
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

1826
01:50:40,407 --> 01:50:41,187
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is.

1827
01:50:41,307 --> 01:50:44,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Now instead of sending me a private message in chat, here's what you're going to do.

1828
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:48,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, this only applies to folks listening live Sunday night.

1829
01:50:49,133 --> 01:50:51,695
[SPEAKER_06]: This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast on all games.

1830
01:50:51,735 --> 01:50:58,619
[SPEAKER_06]: This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes or whatever program you use to download our audio archive later on.

1831
01:50:58,939 --> 01:50:59,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, here it is.

1832
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:02,842
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're listening Sunday night and you want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.

1833
01:51:03,422 --> 01:51:05,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Send an email, one email.

1834
01:51:05,764 --> 01:51:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.

1835
01:51:08,726 --> 01:51:12,408
[SPEAKER_06]: If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP, you will be disqualified.

1836
01:51:12,928 --> 01:51:14,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't have much time to pull any tricks.

1837
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:15,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is.

1838
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:32,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Send one email to wecontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you on air or a Skype name will do as well.

1839
01:51:32,736 --> 01:51:40,119
[SPEAKER_06]: And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in and we'll be drawing a very random one when we kick off part B. All right?

1840
01:51:41,519 --> 01:51:45,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast, you're going to have to wait a day.

1841
01:51:45,561 --> 01:51:45,981
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1842
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:47,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks for you.

1843
01:51:48,142 --> 01:51:53,304
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so we will be back soon to determine the winner of the Wii contest.

1844
01:51:54,164 --> 01:51:55,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you, yep, you do it now.

1845
01:51:55,645 --> 01:51:56,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Ready, set, go, right now.

1846
01:51:57,165 --> 01:51:59,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, you have like five minutes to get it in there.

1847
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Go, hurry.

1848
01:52:00,086 --> 01:52:01,967
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell are you doing listening to us?

1849
01:52:02,027 --> 01:52:03,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Open up your email and freaking email us.

1850
01:52:03,988 --> 01:52:07,169
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, nope, subject does not have to be any particular something.

1851
01:52:07,209 --> 01:52:09,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We just open up the email address for that.

1852
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:09,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Send one email.

1853
01:52:09,890 --> 01:52:10,931
[SPEAKER_08]: But the more you suck up to me.

1854
01:52:10,951 --> 01:52:11,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1855
01:52:11,764 --> 01:52:13,165
[SPEAKER_06]: with your screen name and your number.

1856
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:16,627
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give away the Wii right at the top of Part B. So that's it.

1857
01:52:16,827 --> 01:52:17,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, Chris?

1858
01:52:17,627 --> 01:52:21,189
[SPEAKER_03]: If you send a naked picture with it, you know, extra bonus points.

1859
01:52:21,489 --> 01:52:22,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, stop, stop.

1860
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1861
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:24,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Boobs only, please.

1862
01:52:25,151 --> 01:52:25,451
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1863
01:52:26,572 --> 01:52:28,133
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back in a little bit to find out the winner.

1864
01:52:28,413 --> 01:52:33,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you listening to us on the audio archive, we'll be back in about a day, and you can hear the exciting conclusion.

1865
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:36,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you guys on All Games Radio or listening on Sunday night, stick around.

1866
01:52:36,257 --> 01:52:36,897
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be right back.

1867
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:37,898
