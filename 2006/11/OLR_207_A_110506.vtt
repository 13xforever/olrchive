00:14.164 --> 00:25.632
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and are HD movies coming to the Xbox Marketplace?

00:27.813 --> 00:37.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.760 --> 00:42.343
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming related.

00:42.927 --> 00:44.547
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Culture, Gaming Lifestyle, etc.

01:08.832 --> 01:10.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you redid the hair, though.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.553
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this new hairstyle.

01:11.653 --> 01:13.154
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my hair is pretty now.

01:13.374 --> 01:17.616
[SPEAKER_05]: We need the new promo pics for OLR, because you have way different hair now, and I've got the facial hair.

01:18.196 --> 01:24.279
[SPEAKER_00]: The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very curly.

01:24.299 --> 01:27.721
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I straightened my hair, and it's cherry red and black.

01:28.361 --> 01:30.802
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you what, chat room.

01:30.842 --> 01:34.904
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone earlier.

01:35.624 --> 01:37.085
[SPEAKER_00]: And hooray for being vulgar and offensive.

01:37.405 --> 01:37.665
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.048
[SPEAKER_05]: VULGAR AND OFFENSIVE

02:00.939 --> 02:08.265
[SPEAKER_05]: So remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XBStream.

02:08.585 --> 02:13.609
[SPEAKER_05]: We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program, and through iTunes we're always getting new people.

02:13.869 --> 02:17.232
[SPEAKER_05]: Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because of it.

02:17.692 --> 02:23.716
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact with...

02:25.094 --> 02:54.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot So yeah, every now and then we do this annual sales conferencing with the game publishers And they bring us free stuff Not so much this year though, they didn't bring us as much free stuff Poor baby Yeah, I did get a free shirt from Eidos, so for just cause And Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda shirt Or like a communist propaganda shirt, that's what it looks like

02:55.134 --> 02:56.035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting shirt.

02:56.095 --> 03:00.518
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.

03:01.619 --> 03:01.919
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

03:02.039 --> 03:02.640
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just me.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.140
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just crazy.

03:05.396 --> 03:07.857
[SPEAKER_05]: In all seriousness, we have no guest right now.

03:07.917 --> 03:14.241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Miklatov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show people that hang out here at the apartment.

03:14.981 --> 03:17.343
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

03:18.103 --> 03:22.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar and offensive.

03:22.946 --> 03:25.287
[SPEAKER_05]: I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.

03:25.347 --> 03:27.108
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they love it.

03:27.248 --> 03:31.591
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.

03:32.391 --> 03:33.852
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you will see it in a few.

03:34.613 --> 03:34.833
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

03:34.853 --> 03:35.173
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

03:36.140 --> 03:44.165
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.

03:44.565 --> 03:47.347
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

03:47.367 --> 03:47.847
[SPEAKER_05]: We always do.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:50.649 --> 03:53.150
[SPEAKER_00]: My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.

03:53.290 --> 03:57.973
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.

03:58.533 --> 04:00.054
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get new games today.

04:02.656 --> 04:03.136
[SPEAKER_00]: I got...

04:05.919 --> 04:06.859
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the name of that game again?

04:08.660 --> 04:11.860
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was... I can't believe I can't... I forgot the name of it already.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.361
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, Trauma Sensor Under the Knife.

04:15.721 --> 04:19.582
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I can, you know, cut into people and be the uber surgeon.

04:20.942 --> 04:32.624
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

05:03.070 --> 05:09.794
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get back and, you know, because she picked up my trauma center at the time, which I need to sort of pay her back for.

05:10.555 --> 05:14.837
[SPEAKER_00]: But she hands me the bag, and it's heavy.

05:15.638 --> 05:16.278
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?

05:16.859 --> 05:17.999
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she starts running out the door.

05:18.019 --> 05:18.740
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, my God.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.642
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.

05:22.042 --> 05:22.322
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot.

05:23.483 --> 05:24.463
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, whatever.

05:25.404 --> 05:29.747
[SPEAKER_00]: And then don't let me forget during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's Witness I own today.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.948
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's very nice, though, of, you know,

05:32.574 --> 05:33.474
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very nice of her.

05:33.494 --> 05:34.655
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a very sweet friend.

05:34.675 --> 05:34.915
[SPEAKER_00]: She is.

05:35.055 --> 05:35.635
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very good.

05:35.895 --> 05:37.535
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could, I would do all the same for her.

05:37.635 --> 05:39.336
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm making her a special Christmas present.

05:39.536 --> 05:39.816
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

05:40.496 --> 05:41.716
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making it with finger paints.

05:43.237 --> 05:44.157
[SPEAKER_05]: How four years old of you.

05:44.177 --> 05:44.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

05:44.837 --> 05:45.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:47.598 --> 05:48.238
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.899
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got that to work.

05:52.319 --> 05:56.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.

05:57.381 --> 06:02.062
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.

06:03.314 --> 06:32.121
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this and none of them have covered multiplayer very well and because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is and why they did a lot of things badly for one

06:32.938 --> 06:43.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice City or Vice City Stories will know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.

06:43.440 --> 06:48.222
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.

06:49.702 --> 06:55.123
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that in mind, the multiplayer I was really surprised because they had six different maps to choose from.

06:55.523 --> 06:57.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least that's what I thought that meant.

06:57.644 --> 07:02.445
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points

07:03.519 --> 07:04.380
[SPEAKER_04]: on the same map.

07:04.640 --> 07:17.349
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks because when you're playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.

07:18.991 --> 07:21.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.

07:21.573 --> 07:28.097
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead and let everyone run around the full map.

07:29.058 --> 07:30.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that sucks right there.

07:30.660 --> 07:31.660
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:53.687 --> 07:54.388
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:14.827 --> 08:15.888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:42.899 --> 08:52.224
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they spawn about 50 miles away, so you'll never get to the power-up anyways.

08:53.064 --> 09:02.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except the Hunter controls are crap, but I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around in the helicopter.

09:03.549 --> 09:05.290
[SPEAKER_04]: But multiplayer is pretty good overall.

09:05.390 --> 09:10.173
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had only made the maps a little bit smaller, hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better.

09:10.653 --> 09:12.394
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, you know...

09:13.456 --> 09:16.257
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid.

09:16.417 --> 09:20.219
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff.

09:20.279 --> 09:21.260
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

09:22.380 --> 09:23.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Some comments from our chat room.

09:23.581 --> 09:24.922
[SPEAKER_05]: Zappy seems to agree with you.

09:25.202 --> 09:26.462
[SPEAKER_05]: Bleh, Vice City is meh.

09:26.622 --> 09:27.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Same old GTA.

09:28.103 --> 09:30.384
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you.

09:30.464 --> 09:33.286
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think having the full map and multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.

09:33.666 --> 09:33.846
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

09:34.066 --> 09:37.908
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Trust me, I play multiplayer every single day.

09:37.928 --> 09:42.070
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not make it more fun because you have to... Say, for example, you're playing a 13-minute game.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.431
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to spend a lot of time getting to where the other people are.

09:47.231 --> 09:51.554
[SPEAKER_04]: They also retweaked the weapons and how much damage they do.

09:51.834 --> 09:54.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the remote grenades, which used to be really devastating.

09:54.596 --> 09:56.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody.

09:56.758 --> 09:57.418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

09:57.839 --> 09:59.660
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes like four of them to blow up somebody.

09:59.860 --> 10:05.144
[SPEAKER_04]: And before, you can get hit from one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome.

10:05.684 --> 10:06.625
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

10:06.665 --> 10:08.466
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like how they retweaked everything.

10:08.806 --> 10:11.368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really wish they had thought more about the multiplayer stuff.

10:11.843 --> 10:34.084
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute but they really if they're going to put multiplayer in the game at least spend some time actually working out the tweaks working out the bugs in it because all those same bugs that were there in the first one are still there in this one so obviously they weren't working very well you know on this and we're going to probably beta test them more than they did

10:35.183 --> 10:36.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they fucking consult me?

10:36.905 --> 10:37.945
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

10:38.206 --> 10:45.091
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played this game more than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet they do not consult me when it comes to their multiplayer in their game.

10:45.151 --> 10:50.155
[SPEAKER_04]: I can at least give them some simple advice like, maybe put an option where you can turn off the power-ups.

10:50.196 --> 10:51.136
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be smart.

10:52.297 --> 10:53.378
[SPEAKER_05]: No one cares what you think, Loki.

10:53.398 --> 10:55.500
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just some dumb podcaster, amateur...

10:56.351 --> 10:57.171
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet Journalist.

10:57.311 --> 11:00.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories.

11:00.612 --> 11:01.792
[SPEAKER_04]: I will fucking kick your ass.

11:02.252 --> 11:02.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody.

11:03.132 --> 11:04.873
[SPEAKER_04]: In the face of the world, anybody.

11:05.013 --> 11:05.973
[SPEAKER_04]: I will beat them down.

11:06.113 --> 11:09.494
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games.

11:10.054 --> 11:11.154
[SPEAKER_04]: I would kick their ass.

11:11.674 --> 11:11.974
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

11:12.194 --> 11:12.754
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong words there.

11:12.774 --> 11:13.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Challenge to anybody.

11:14.014 --> 11:14.715
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong words there.

11:15.735 --> 11:18.295
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're just begging for an ass kicking with a statement like that.

11:18.395 --> 11:19.055
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I'm not.

11:19.315 --> 11:20.496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

11:21.296 --> 11:22.136
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it for your gaming week?

11:22.839 --> 11:23.520
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.478
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:12.492 --> 12:17.217
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, graphics are only so much of a game, so that's really a minor bitch, all things considered.

12:17.297 --> 12:23.023
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series, in my opinion.

12:23.323 --> 12:26.507
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.808
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is fabulous.

12:28.729 --> 12:30.871
[SPEAKER_05]: The combat system is genius.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.474
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo doesn't give...

12:34.054 --> 12:36.895
[SPEAKER_05]: you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.

12:36.935 --> 12:47.801
[SPEAKER_05]: The combat system is great because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final Fantasy XI except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want and you don't have to put up with retards.

12:47.861 --> 12:48.401
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

12:48.461 --> 12:48.861
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

12:49.361 --> 12:51.342
[SPEAKER_05]: So the combat system is brilliant.

12:51.442 --> 12:51.802
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

12:52.103 --> 12:56.445
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's probably going to turn off some old school fans of the Final Fantasy series but it's a nice change.

12:56.765 --> 12:57.405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

12:57.965 --> 12:59.326
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters are awesome.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.127
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is awesome and

13:02.786 --> 13:10.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great, and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.

13:10.255 --> 13:16.962
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story, because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but

13:17.520 --> 13:18.621
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy VII

13:46.315 --> 13:47.677
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess he got a prize for it.

13:47.697 --> 13:50.039
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever.

13:50.119 --> 13:51.501
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was kind of anticlimactic.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.004
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook.

13:54.064 --> 13:55.345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I have a game.

13:55.706 --> 13:56.526
[SPEAKER_05]: I have GameFAQs.

13:56.727 --> 13:57.648
[SPEAKER_03]: The guidebook is sexy.

13:57.908 --> 14:01.152
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the guidebook looks nice, but I just, I couldn't justify paying the money for it.

14:01.252 --> 14:03.254
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, when GameFAQs.com is available.

14:03.474 --> 14:03.574
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

14:06.206 --> 14:06.846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say.

14:07.507 --> 14:10.088
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in our chatroom says Gambits and License is crap.

14:10.529 --> 14:11.169
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

14:11.469 --> 14:20.695
[SPEAKER_05]: The License board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambits is really what makes the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.

14:21.075 --> 14:24.217
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the Gambits is basically... For those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambits system basically...

14:24.657 --> 14:26.679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

14:49.096 --> 14:52.277
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority.

14:52.377 --> 14:55.217
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.

14:55.877 --> 14:59.738
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.

15:00.498 --> 15:02.859
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she will automatically cure silence.

15:03.039 --> 15:04.159
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll automatically cure poison.

15:04.439 --> 15:07.519
[SPEAKER_05]: Then her priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.

15:07.920 --> 15:14.981
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, under that, the logic is that she casts protect on my main character, Vaan, who I use as my main character right now.

15:15.501 --> 15:15.681
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

15:16.872 --> 15:22.013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, so it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle, so she's not wasting MP.

15:22.253 --> 15:24.033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great, so you can kind of play with this.

15:24.053 --> 15:27.994
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic available to you.

15:28.294 --> 15:32.135
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for instance, you start with, like, only a few commands, like, hit points below 70%.

15:33.175 --> 15:37.376
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have to buy that.

15:37.696 --> 15:41.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you want to get, like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.

15:41.857 --> 15:44.098
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of interesting, the way that all works.

15:44.158 --> 15:45.618
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I kind of think it's cool.

15:46.198 --> 15:46.518
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

15:47.731 --> 15:48.492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.893
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the game is great.

15:51.115 --> 15:53.277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.

15:53.538 --> 15:54.679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a 9.9 out of 10.

15:54.959 --> 15:55.480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wonderful.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.401
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get it.

15:56.481 --> 16:03.069
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you don't like RPGs usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in this will get you into it.

16:03.249 --> 16:03.530
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

16:03.990 --> 16:04.691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my thoughts.

16:06.021 --> 16:13.627
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but I realized that... I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.

16:14.187 --> 16:14.748
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

16:15.088 --> 16:17.730
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo didn't do it justice because it didn't show you the depth of it.

16:17.990 --> 16:23.274
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like, run up to a monster and rely on the auto-attack thing and maybe use the magic.

16:23.895 --> 16:24.655
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't do it justice.

16:24.676 --> 16:25.076
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like...

16:25.556 --> 16:26.937
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the stupid thing off the screen.

16:26.977 --> 16:28.098
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my cutscene.

16:28.298 --> 16:31.741
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.

16:31.881 --> 16:32.981
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I meant, though?

16:33.001 --> 16:34.082
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant the cut to battle.

16:34.342 --> 16:34.503
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

16:34.803 --> 16:36.364
[SPEAKER_00]: The battle screen, I guess.

16:36.384 --> 16:38.866
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's interesting because it means you have no random battles.

16:38.926 --> 16:40.967
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasies.

16:41.027 --> 16:43.929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, God damn it, I need to get to a save point because I need to go.

16:44.790 --> 16:45.750
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you had.

16:45.931 --> 16:47.612
[SPEAKER_05]: You're walking towards a save point and then...

16:48.314 --> 16:55.057
[SPEAKER_00]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.

16:55.117 --> 16:56.578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.

16:56.918 --> 16:59.719
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.

16:59.859 --> 17:00.159
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

17:00.399 --> 17:02.220
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.

17:02.660 --> 17:04.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is one other kind of minor.

17:04.861 --> 17:07.723
[SPEAKER_05]: You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.

17:08.323 --> 17:09.924
[SPEAKER_05]: The areas are massive.

17:11.404 --> 17:12.165
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same with X.

17:13.504 --> 17:17.047
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say was like the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie?

17:17.227 --> 17:19.308
[SPEAKER_05]: When you played Final Fantasy XI, what was the worst thing about it?

17:20.149 --> 17:20.930
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a white mage.

17:21.390 --> 17:28.515
[SPEAKER_05]: See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.

17:28.635 --> 17:30.176
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you set the gamuts and they do it.

17:31.897 --> 17:33.959
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.

17:34.259 --> 17:34.679
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

17:34.779 --> 17:36.020
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one yells at you to cure them.

17:36.060 --> 17:36.621
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll just die.

17:36.681 --> 17:37.101
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

17:37.461 --> 17:41.484
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger.

17:42.642 --> 17:44.143
[SPEAKER_00]: without Toriyama's artwork.

18:01.676 --> 18:30.711
[SPEAKER_05]: so no other games for me to review this week and probably for the next few weeks there won't be a lot that I'm playing although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents and I did go to we were at the mall today and of course I had to look to see if they had Luminous 2 because I still kind of want it even if I am a little even if I am a little bit like see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week I got mixed up so I have to wait for Tuesday but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous right now because the Xbox one was not all that I still really want Luminous 2 and somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week and you know

18:30.971 --> 18:32.512
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

18:53.417 --> 18:56.859
[SPEAKER_05]: or maybe somebody will get married or they'll have a baby.

18:57.199 --> 18:58.299
[SPEAKER_05]: Something really big happens.

18:58.819 --> 19:05.062
[SPEAKER_05]: So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey, maybe we'll get involved in November Sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.163
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight we have a surprise for you guys.

19:07.223 --> 19:09.004
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something we've been hinting at for a little while.

19:09.764 --> 19:17.328
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes or XBStream or however you're doing it,

19:18.806 --> 19:23.068
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is actually a live streaming radio station, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

19:23.148 --> 19:29.750
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then, you know, broadcasted over the MP3s.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.771
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have live-only shows that air throughout the week.

19:32.831 --> 19:35.652
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, Tuesday night, DarkSakura does her Pump Up the Volume.

19:35.672 --> 19:38.013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just her, and she plays some indie band music for you guys.

19:39.093 --> 19:44.195
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is kind of about pop culture stuff.

19:44.953 --> 19:49.174
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.

19:49.294 --> 19:50.274
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to the tape.

19:56.335 --> 19:58.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to listen to me?

19:59.736 --> 20:01.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do, then I should warn you.

20:01.776 --> 20:06.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do, I should warn you.

20:07.177 --> 20:08.497
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear all sorts of things.

20:09.837 --> 20:10.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Hits from the past.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.838
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap from the future.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis Donovan Live, coming to Orange Lounge Radio

20:37.153 --> 20:37.973
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

21:01.778 --> 21:04.521
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:21.656 --> 21:22.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

21:22.297 --> 21:22.937
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

21:50.762 --> 21:51.222
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo 3 Halo 3 Halo 3

22:20.314 --> 22:38.582
[SPEAKER_04]: With such a date like this, you have to kind of wonder, okay, well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, you know, we haven't gotten, according to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement.

22:38.602 --> 22:46.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Microsoft hasn't made an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside Microsoft, March 14th.

22:47.677 --> 22:51.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes sense, because that's when the big games came out last year.

22:52.161 --> 22:56.304
[SPEAKER_04]: March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies, including Microsoft.

22:56.944 --> 23:01.768
[SPEAKER_04]: So, March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo.

23:03.817 --> 23:04.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

23:04.798 --> 23:05.538
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now wait a minute.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.160
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing you're saying there.

23:08.220 --> 23:16.846
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, let's look at the evidence and why, you know, because most people are assuming that Christmas window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3.

23:17.186 --> 23:23.370
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we've had several, like, random things pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?

23:23.390 --> 23:28.594
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember a few episodes ago you had the marketing folks that came to your work and they told you spring, right?

23:28.614 --> 23:29.754
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this wasn't the marketing guy.

23:29.774 --> 23:32.516
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their head of sales at Microsoft.

23:34.257 --> 23:35.158
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember his name.

23:35.178 --> 23:35.998
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Dave.

23:36.258 --> 23:42.181
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, he said March or April was the target date for Halo.

23:42.981 --> 23:54.986
[SPEAKER_04]: And this makes sense because, you know, how would you love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really good.

23:56.448 --> 24:00.791
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways, Halo Wars.

24:00.931 --> 24:03.913
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.

24:05.154 --> 24:05.534
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.232
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting?

24:08.272 --> 24:16.897
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, when you posted this in the show role thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different source, let's just say I have a friend.

24:17.497 --> 24:21.559
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you all hate these friend of a friend things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place, right?

24:22.040 --> 24:26.382
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain company.

24:26.742 --> 24:33.765
[SPEAKER_05]: Large Magazine Company, who's had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to be spring of 07.

24:33.865 --> 24:35.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course it's going to be spring of 07.

24:36.626 --> 24:40.207
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, and I would think this makes very good sense.

24:40.287 --> 24:45.609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be February, because I thought originally it might be February or something like that, but February's usually dead.

24:45.649 --> 24:52.132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of still that dead point from December to March, where nothing really comes out.

24:52.812 --> 24:52.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

24:54.059 --> 24:54.139
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

24:54.159 --> 24:54.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Replay 2 E.A.

24:54.539 --> 24:54.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Replay 2

25:24.494 --> 25:29.516
[SPEAKER_04]: MVP07, NCAA Baseball, also that same date.

25:30.296 --> 25:39.760
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, Two Worlds for Xbox 360, which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th.

25:40.220 --> 25:41.881
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of good stuff.

25:42.781 --> 25:48.624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, Home Court, but I think the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.505
[SPEAKER_04]: But fun stuff.

25:51.065 --> 25:51.325
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

25:51.949 --> 25:55.794
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?

25:56.134 --> 25:57.616
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I saw it on a blog somewhere.

25:58.237 --> 25:58.878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

25:58.958 --> 25:59.578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

25:59.598 --> 26:02.922
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have that pre-ordered because I want that for my desk.

26:03.844 --> 26:04.204
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

26:05.222 --> 26:06.343
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that turns out to be true.

26:06.823 --> 26:09.025
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of signs point to that.

26:09.125 --> 26:15.651
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3?

26:15.911 --> 26:17.012
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

26:17.032 --> 26:19.594
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot of things that kind of make that look probable.

26:19.794 --> 26:20.835
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we might be wrong.

26:21.696 --> 26:24.478
[SPEAKER_05]: It might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.

26:24.558 --> 26:26.960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.223
[SPEAKER_04]: There are delay issues for different reasons.

26:30.263 --> 26:31.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just like, you know...

26:31.884 --> 26:35.065
[SPEAKER_05]: or folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray.

26:35.265 --> 26:42.727
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, if these magazines are getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate to me the game is pretty close to completion.

26:43.047 --> 26:43.527
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

26:43.627 --> 26:45.108
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing about it, though.

26:45.648 --> 26:53.290
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one seems to pay attention to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big chunks.

26:53.330 --> 26:57.691
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the spring releases, which take place mostly in March.

26:58.311 --> 26:59.752
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:26.096 --> 27:33.063
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the holiday season, you've still got your Halo Wars that you can also push out there as well.

27:33.203 --> 27:36.646
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're covered in both sections of the year.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that makes sense to me.

27:39.409 --> 27:40.190
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.028
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see you all in time.

27:58.383 --> 27:58.864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:20.560 --> 28:32.170
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong But what's interesting, Japan is getting some exclusives They are the only ones that are getting Gradius And what's very interesting, I think, is that they're the only ones getting Super Mario Bros.

28:33.191 --> 28:36.273
[SPEAKER_05]: So, kind of strange there Oh, also, how could I forget this one?

28:36.293 --> 28:48.904
[SPEAKER_04]: Solomon's Key I played that game a lot I think those are launch games I thought it was until the end of the year I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than us And I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for us

28:49.484 --> 28:50.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

28:50.065 --> 28:52.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Europe is getting some games that we're not either.

28:53.147 --> 28:53.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

28:54.368 --> 28:57.730
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that, I don't know, it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.

28:58.071 --> 28:58.591
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, alright.

28:58.951 --> 29:04.215
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey Kong Country, but the other two regions are.

29:04.516 --> 29:16.845
[SPEAKER_05]: All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and SimCity, but then Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra 3, Super Castlevania 4, Street Fighter 2, and Zelda A Link to the Past.

29:17.425 --> 29:22.087
[SPEAKER_05]: The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.

29:22.528 --> 29:26.970
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go over to Sega Genesis and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.

29:27.230 --> 29:37.735
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same game anyway.

29:38.195 --> 29:46.421
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic the Hedgehog, ToeJam & Earl The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?

29:46.521 --> 29:51.985
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the one with the dog That game was freaking awesome But yet there's no Shinobi listed, that's kind of weird

29:52.754 --> 29:53.775
[SPEAKER_00]: Shadow Dancer was a better game.

29:54.215 --> 29:54.515
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whatever.

29:55.235 --> 30:09.562
[SPEAKER_05]: On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions getting Bonks Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and Superstar Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman 94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.

30:10.782 --> 30:14.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Victory Run, not coming to the U.S., but is coming to Japan.

30:14.164 --> 30:18.666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, not going to Europe, but is going to Japan and the U.S., so.

30:19.452 --> 30:20.652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going, where's Dracula X?

30:44.955 --> 30:46.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.

30:46.756 --> 30:57.102
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the one in Japan, so... Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, you know, while they're looking at the... And they could easily encode it, you know, memory storage being what it is now.

30:57.503 --> 31:07.509
[SPEAKER_00]: They could easily move a whole CD game into... Because the thing that took up the most room on those discs was the Red Book Audio.

31:09.010 --> 31:12.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.

31:12.272 --> 31:14.533
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?

31:15.134 --> 31:18.696
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia.

31:18.836 --> 31:19.336
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.918
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so that's all I've got to say on the Virtual Console.

31:25.739 --> 31:27.420
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got news.

31:28.120 --> 31:33.503
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.

31:35.164 --> 31:44.408
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.

31:47.396 --> 31:50.256
[SPEAKER_00]: In the magazine it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.

31:50.296 --> 31:52.717
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a typo.

31:53.137 --> 31:56.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they went back and Nintendo themselves said that.

31:57.298 --> 32:11.381
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released at launch in the UK.

32:11.461 --> 32:13.002
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have no problem getting that.

32:13.022 --> 32:14.342
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to import that.

32:17.867 --> 32:18.487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

32:19.368 --> 32:21.329
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are some other secrets out there.

32:21.869 --> 32:28.372
[SPEAKER_05]: I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us some high def later on or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.793
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says they can't?

32:32.354 --> 32:36.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft upgraded their display output, so why not?

32:36.956 --> 32:37.676
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do stuff.

32:38.517 --> 32:39.657
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's just not their thing.

32:39.877 --> 32:40.858
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not their thing right now.

32:41.533 --> 32:48.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher can say, I want to make my game 720, damn it!

32:49.680 --> 32:50.441
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

32:50.721 --> 32:51.642
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

32:52.162 --> 32:57.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's some other stuff released this week, actually, about the Virtual Console.

32:57.207 --> 33:01.931
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.

33:02.691 --> 33:04.573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to find out, actually, that

33:05.592 --> 33:13.996
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to store your games to the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.

33:14.756 --> 33:23.840
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, where you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your Mario Brothers there.

33:24.360 --> 33:32.144
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can, however, re-download the games, kind of typical with Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.

33:33.673 --> 34:01.470
[SPEAKER_04]: and um some interesting stuff they're talking about how the virtual console stuff you'll be able to use um the standard Wii Remote actually for NES games by turning it on its side which you know ever since I saw that Wii Remote and they announced the virtual console I knew they were going to be able to do that and as well as using the GameCube pads also if you don't want to spend money on the uh classic controller you can use that as well so that's kind of neat and um

34:02.386 --> 34:03.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

34:03.807 --> 34:06.548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all about the information that they have on that.

34:08.108 --> 34:10.049
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments regarding high definition from our chatroom.

34:10.729 --> 34:13.090
[SPEAKER_05]: PooEater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.

34:13.110 --> 34:19.232
[SPEAKER_05]: I could give a crap less about $1,296,000,000 or whatever.

34:19.673 --> 34:21.633
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.

34:21.653 --> 34:24.094
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.

34:24.594 --> 34:25.375
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

34:25.535 --> 34:26.295
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is kind of neat.

34:26.595 --> 34:28.776
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the iTunes books you get.

34:29.941 --> 34:38.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there something a while ago about how Nintendo totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming type thing?

34:38.147 --> 34:41.230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.

34:41.810 --> 34:42.310
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Sony?

34:42.370 --> 34:42.691
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

34:43.852 --> 34:45.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody wanted to use iTunes as a model?

34:46.193 --> 34:49.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.

34:50.977 --> 34:52.218
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad, I got it mixed up then.

34:53.229 --> 34:54.110
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

35:15.400 --> 35:28.944
[SPEAKER_05]: and it shows in the sound options menu that there's an SD card option in the menu and so it's being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as custom soundtracks in the game.

35:29.264 --> 35:42.749
[SPEAKER_05]: No official word from Nintendo just yet, but this screenshot sure does make things look interesting and since Nintendo has said that there's still some secrets yet to be revealed, this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.

35:43.249 --> 35:44.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

35:44.548 --> 35:45.329
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be kind of neat.

35:46.309 --> 35:50.292
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to use custom soundtracks on 360, unless I'm playing DDR or something.

35:50.332 --> 35:50.912
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, no, just kidding.

35:50.952 --> 35:51.693
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't play DDR on 360.

35:51.973 --> 35:56.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that, because that kind of would break the game.

35:57.096 --> 35:59.758
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.

36:02.120 --> 36:10.866
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of a character in Super Smash Bros.

36:10.926 --> 36:11.286
[SPEAKER_00]: Brawl.

36:11.746 --> 36:12.867
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox McCloud is showing up.

36:13.719 --> 36:19.403
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I can tell, I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.

36:20.283 --> 36:27.268
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time zero suit.

36:29.189 --> 36:33.211
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Solid Snake and Wario.

36:36.994 --> 36:39.195
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I am going to have that game so fast.

36:39.778 --> 36:42.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of disappointed that they didn't announce something new.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've had Fox before.

36:44.881 --> 36:46.282
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in every single game.

36:46.422 --> 36:47.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but, I mean, okay, big deal.

36:47.963 --> 36:51.045
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave them a staff this time, so... Ooh, staff!

36:51.145 --> 36:53.267
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so they gave us a crappy game, Fox.

36:56.329 --> 36:59.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you for reminding us that they made that game.

36:59.331 --> 36:59.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

37:02.934 --> 37:07.538
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.

37:07.578 --> 37:14.843
[SPEAKER_05]: We were hoping to... Well, I know you didn't plan it, Jamie, but... I was like, I didn't think that story... We did that on purpose.

37:14.883 --> 37:17.464
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the game anyway, but I personally don't care about Fox News.

37:17.485 --> 37:23.749
[SPEAKER_05]: We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character... Because they've said that there are going to be other third-party characters.

37:23.769 --> 37:28.512
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi.

37:28.812 --> 37:30.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't see that coming.

37:31.094 --> 37:32.295
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Raiden to be in it.

37:32.952 --> 37:33.753
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be funny.

37:34.713 --> 37:42.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Our new secret character is... A defective NES card where you have to blow on it.

37:42.758 --> 37:44.699
[SPEAKER_00]: The new fighter is Pantsless Rage.

37:45.480 --> 37:45.980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

37:46.541 --> 37:46.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

37:46.941 --> 37:47.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

37:48.702 --> 38:00.249
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week, in fact, in the form of an episode of South Park where Cartman's actually waiting for the Wii to come out at... It was quite funny.

38:00.589 --> 38:01.030
[SPEAKER_04]: And a...

38:02.017 --> 38:02.077
[SPEAKER_04]: E.L.

38:02.097 --> 38:02.237
[SPEAKER_04]: or E.B.

38:30.305 --> 38:31.306
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried.

38:31.326 --> 38:35.107
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried the last... I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal.

38:35.388 --> 38:39.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the last minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up.

38:39.770 --> 38:40.470
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried.

38:40.510 --> 38:41.170
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.

38:41.951 --> 38:43.011
[SPEAKER_00]: This is making me laugh.

38:43.992 --> 38:47.613
[SPEAKER_00]: GS68 in the chatroom says a new secret character, Ken Kudaragi.

38:47.934 --> 38:48.834
[SPEAKER_00]: He wields a crayon sword.

38:50.835 --> 38:51.255
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't.

38:51.295 --> 38:51.915
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to eat it.

38:52.336 --> 38:53.696
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Cartman's the secret character.

38:53.736 --> 38:54.036
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

38:54.557 --> 38:55.037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joke.

38:55.983 --> 39:10.612
[SPEAKER_05]: It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that would probably be the big joke.

39:11.092 --> 39:14.054
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.

39:14.414 --> 39:23.080
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty funny.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.220
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

39:26.109 --> 39:27.029
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:50.080 --> 39:51.461
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCube component cables

40:12.626 --> 40:17.188
[SPEAKER_05]: in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will component cables be available on day one?

40:17.228 --> 40:19.588
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaplan said, yes, at retail and online.

40:19.668 --> 40:24.770
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com if you still want to go the online route.

40:25.830 --> 40:31.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing to lattes.

40:31.912 --> 40:33.733
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that, but whatever.

40:33.993 --> 40:37.374
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.

40:38.875 --> 40:39.695
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me very happy.

40:41.593 --> 40:42.514
[SPEAKER_04]: She's insane.

40:42.554 --> 40:43.834
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make you a happy panda?

40:44.335 --> 40:44.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

40:45.715 --> 40:47.296
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a crazy, crazy person.

40:48.597 --> 40:48.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

40:49.818 --> 40:50.918
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell was that?

40:50.938 --> 40:57.322
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.

40:57.342 --> 41:03.145
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I love Gnarl Sparkly as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing that damn song every time I open up my AIM.

41:03.185 --> 41:04.966
[SPEAKER_05]: You must not like them very much because I don't like them.

41:06.747 --> 41:09.028
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.

41:09.849 --> 41:10.489
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Danger Mouse.

41:12.126 --> 41:22.614
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play sounds when you don't expect it to, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.

41:24.276 --> 41:24.716
[SPEAKER_05]: Frightening.

41:24.996 --> 41:25.417
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool!

41:25.457 --> 41:26.898
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill 5, finally?

41:27.138 --> 41:28.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Confirmation?

41:28.659 --> 41:28.880
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

41:29.400 --> 41:35.005
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Otonari Yoku, which means adult power.

41:36.107 --> 41:37.128
[SPEAKER_05]: Adult Power, huh?

41:37.168 --> 41:38.929
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this one of, like, those games?

41:39.069 --> 41:43.833
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a self-help guide to improving your relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.

41:44.253 --> 41:45.374
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring!

41:47.015 --> 41:56.262
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin'... I don't have... It's gonna sell like... Not in this country.

41:56.702 --> 41:57.083
[SPEAKER_00]: In Japan.

41:58.284 --> 41:59.725
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like, five people will import it.

42:00.165 --> 42:01.626
[SPEAKER_00]: And go, I can't read Japanese!

42:02.647 --> 42:05.229
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?

42:05.976 --> 42:07.478
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, kind of like how he feels like... He's scared us from here.

42:12.065 --> 42:22.271
[SPEAKER_05]: He feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know, like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.

42:22.491 --> 42:24.052
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell do you do in adult training?

42:24.352 --> 42:30.615
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that it'll do, like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, sirens go off, the world gets dark.

42:31.156 --> 42:34.157
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends.

42:34.398 --> 42:38.560
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what exactly is going to be trained in this game?

42:40.177 --> 42:45.381
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's accidental.

42:45.781 --> 42:46.842
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, I crapped my pants.

42:49.064 --> 42:50.385
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a good comparison.

42:51.385 --> 42:51.906
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonsense.

42:51.946 --> 42:53.607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about control.

42:54.148 --> 42:56.149
[SPEAKER_00]: The thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.

42:57.370 --> 43:00.312
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult, never mind, forget it.

43:00.532 --> 43:03.074
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, I was going to ask for Saturday Night Live.

43:03.915 --> 43:04.715
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, I crapped my pants.

43:04.816 --> 43:05.556
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind, forget it.

43:06.016 --> 43:06.617
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.

43:08.238 --> 43:12.762
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for elementary school kids.

43:14.243 --> 43:15.264
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in America.

43:16.424 --> 43:17.946
[SPEAKER_00]: So that everyone gets good manners.

43:19.107 --> 43:21.769
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.

43:22.189 --> 43:22.789
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

43:22.929 --> 43:24.971
[SPEAKER_00]: I have really good freaking manners, okay?

43:25.632 --> 43:26.832
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so polite.

43:27.713 --> 43:33.858
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold the doors open for people, I smile and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when I think they're being retards.

43:34.859 --> 43:36.720
[SPEAKER_05]: You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.

43:36.780 --> 43:36.940
[SPEAKER_00]: I did!

43:36.960 --> 43:37.741
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm nice!

43:39.097 --> 43:40.338
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the nicest person.

44:01.736 --> 44:09.300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?

44:10.181 --> 44:11.982
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything possible.

44:12.422 --> 44:14.483
[SPEAKER_04]: They are shipping it by any means possible.

44:14.543 --> 44:19.666
[SPEAKER_04]: Planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name it.

44:20.107 --> 44:20.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Horseback?

44:21.828 --> 44:22.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

44:22.968 --> 44:26.290
[SPEAKER_04]: Little immigrants too, pulling the crates, you know.

44:27.030 --> 44:28.491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so any means necessary.

44:28.811 --> 44:31.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a huge surprise, but it's nice to

44:31.960 --> 44:32.841
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44:48.511 --> 44:56.197
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Miklatov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit because you have certain fears you've expressed to me before.

44:56.678 --> 45:01.141
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you feel if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?

45:01.542 --> 45:03.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I would cry because I hate UPS.

45:04.404 --> 45:06.826
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS.

45:06.846 --> 45:08.467
[SPEAKER_05]: You've told me you have a fear of UPS.

45:08.547 --> 45:09.668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of both.

45:09.828 --> 45:10.969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all from high school.

45:11.330 --> 45:12.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us your fears.

45:12.591 --> 45:13.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my fears?

45:14.012 --> 45:16.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, UPS, water, sheep.

45:17.496 --> 45:18.196
[SPEAKER_03]: Flying Bugs.

45:18.276 --> 45:19.977
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so water, sheep, and flying bugs.

45:20.237 --> 45:27.939
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a UPS man ever delivered you a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.

45:28.639 --> 45:30.080
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably just die on the spot.

45:30.100 --> 45:30.960
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Silent Hill to you.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.701
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so why the UPS fear?

45:32.741 --> 45:34.461
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with video games.

45:34.641 --> 45:35.502
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I'm curious.

45:36.202 --> 45:36.902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like...

45:37.645 --> 45:51.995
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in high school, my bus stop was next to UPS Center, and I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.

45:54.897 --> 45:56.838
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get much more stupid than I have.

45:56.858 --> 45:58.960
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that be, Universal Pwnage Service?

45:59.961 --> 46:01.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I just hate them, and they frighten me.

46:04.545 --> 46:07.308
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought maybe like a UPS man beat you up once or something.

46:07.328 --> 46:11.593
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop watching all the trucks go by.

46:11.893 --> 46:14.856
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part was it was apparently next to a UPS center.

46:15.217 --> 46:16.999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know that, but I still figured.

46:17.179 --> 46:19.101
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.

46:19.401 --> 46:20.022
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me on the doll.

46:20.442 --> 46:20.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere.

46:20.883 --> 46:23.566
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.

46:26.740 --> 46:29.682
[SPEAKER_05]: Usagi in our chatroom agrees UPS is the spawn of Satan.

46:29.902 --> 46:31.683
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had a problem with UPS.

46:31.903 --> 46:32.503
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate them.

46:32.603 --> 46:35.885
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.

46:36.145 --> 46:36.545
[SPEAKER_05]: No such thing.

46:36.645 --> 46:36.966
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

46:37.046 --> 46:40.167
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're attractive... At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

46:40.187 --> 46:41.408
[SPEAKER_05]: This is years before my current job.

46:41.468 --> 46:43.249
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

46:44.309 --> 46:47.171
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're hot, that means they're really evil.

46:48.852 --> 46:49.112
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.

46:52.222 --> 46:52.862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.

46:53.002 --> 46:53.523
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know.

46:53.983 --> 47:02.870
[SPEAKER_05]: If people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can listen to.

47:03.190 --> 47:06.713
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you listen to fears about insects and sheep and water?

47:06.733 --> 47:07.434
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

47:07.634 --> 47:14.940
[SPEAKER_05]: You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to do with gaming.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're going to make me cry.

47:17.842 --> 47:19.183
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I cry, I get stabby.

47:19.762 --> 47:21.663
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.

47:21.783 --> 47:23.124
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, they're close enough.

47:23.184 --> 47:23.985
[SPEAKER_00]: Did goats scare you?

47:25.086 --> 47:26.707
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I haven't been... What about llamas?

47:27.127 --> 47:27.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Llamas, no.

47:27.927 --> 47:30.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, I'm really ready to get back in the game now.

47:30.189 --> 47:33.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Llamas have to do with Tempest, so there you go.

47:33.371 --> 47:34.772
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were llamas in Tempest?

47:35.072 --> 47:37.914
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that one guy that makes Tempest something to do with a llama?

47:37.934 --> 47:39.315
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here.

47:39.355 --> 47:40.936
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, no, I have a question.

47:40.956 --> 47:43.898
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?

47:44.698 --> 47:46.539
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that they deserve to buy things.

47:46.799 --> 47:47.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

47:47.879 --> 47:53.360
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.

47:53.740 --> 47:56.321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.

47:56.381 --> 47:56.781
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

47:57.141 --> 48:03.543
[SPEAKER_05]: Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

48:03.623 --> 48:07.144
[SPEAKER_05]: If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.

48:07.784 --> 48:09.084
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Buy employees aren't shut out.

48:10.402 --> 48:11.683
[SPEAKER_05]: Circuit City and CompUSA

48:33.212 --> 48:34.313
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:02.150 --> 49:02.770
[SPEAKER_05]: or Kmart.

49:02.850 --> 49:04.671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart.

49:05.772 --> 49:06.593
[SPEAKER_05]: And with good reason.

49:06.893 --> 49:10.635
[SPEAKER_05]: But Kmart, I'm telling you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.

49:10.935 --> 49:11.315
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

49:11.355 --> 49:14.217
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to camp out for a PlayStation 3.

49:15.357 --> 49:16.838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't either because I'm not getting one.

49:17.218 --> 49:18.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.

49:19.220 --> 49:28.785
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to know what's funny is that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else because our credit card was special.

49:29.346 --> 49:32.467
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of special... Actually, I wanted to say real quick.

49:32.667 --> 49:32.887
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

49:33.248 --> 49:40.811
[SPEAKER_05]: Neologism, totally mispronouncing his name, 82, says Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.

49:41.131 --> 49:42.972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.

49:43.912 --> 49:44.452
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does it matter?

49:44.992 --> 49:48.354
[SPEAKER_00]: But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, Ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.

49:48.454 --> 49:48.794
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.

49:50.275 --> 49:51.335
[SPEAKER_00]: You open your mouth.

49:51.355 --> 49:53.736
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.

49:54.520 --> 49:55.880
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.720
[SPEAKER_05]: You better back that up.

49:56.981 --> 49:58.741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to the one on How.

49:59.121 --> 50:00.941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.

50:01.241 --> 50:04.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.

50:04.562 --> 50:05.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind, forget it.

50:05.402 --> 50:07.623
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was actually, I was like, oh, Rob is being clever.

50:07.903 --> 50:08.523
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to me.

50:08.923 --> 50:09.963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.

50:09.983 --> 50:10.523
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the JV show.

50:10.803 --> 50:16.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on, there's still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?

50:16.565 --> 50:17.405
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I'm going to.

50:17.525 --> 50:18.785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's the ticket.

50:19.225 --> 50:19.625
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there.

50:20.305 --> 50:21.686
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not on Antelope, it's Auburn.

50:21.846 --> 50:23.386
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, whatever, anyway.

50:24.142 --> 50:26.623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's your Sacramento direction thing.

50:27.263 --> 50:32.904
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, back to the PS3.

50:33.905 --> 50:36.245
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you, Best Buy, you bitches.

50:37.086 --> 50:40.166
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I really don't hate any... Okay, I will rephrase that.

50:40.586 --> 50:43.427
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.

50:43.567 --> 50:46.188
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.

50:47.332 --> 50:53.454
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3 and they're not doing anything for the Wii.

50:53.954 --> 50:54.594
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why?

50:54.654 --> 50:55.974
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Nintendo loves us.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.195
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.

50:59.455 --> 51:02.676
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 18 stores total.

51:02.816 --> 51:04.116
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in these cities.

51:04.616 --> 51:05.657
[SPEAKER_00]: Park Lane, Texas.

51:07.717 --> 51:09.097
[SPEAKER_00]: West Los Angeles, California.

51:09.617 --> 51:10.278
[SPEAKER_00]: Chesterfield.

51:10.618 --> 51:11.458
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that... Is M.O.

51:11.498 --> 51:11.898
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana?

51:12.658 --> 51:12.898
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

51:13.899 --> 51:14.179
[SPEAKER_05]: No, M.O.

51:14.239 --> 51:14.619
[SPEAKER_05]: is Missouri.

51:14.659 --> 51:14.999
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri.

51:15.019 --> 51:15.819
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I thought that.

51:16.640 --> 51:43.076
[SPEAKER_00]: El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria, Texas, Butterfield, Illinois, West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York,

51:46.250 --> 51:48.733
[SPEAKER_00]: Landmark Massachusetts, and Midtown Manhattan.

51:49.013 --> 51:50.655
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously kids, why bother though?

51:51.055 --> 51:51.515
[SPEAKER_05]: Why bother?

51:51.615 --> 51:51.936
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

51:52.797 --> 52:06.388
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games all day long that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can I get Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.

52:06.928 --> 52:08.249
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're screwed.

52:08.429 --> 52:09.190
[SPEAKER_05]: So why bother?

52:09.350 --> 52:14.874
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing it, people are going to be driving in from far away.

52:15.195 --> 52:16.396
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody is going to beat you to it.

52:16.616 --> 52:17.937
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say why bother?

52:19.744 --> 52:25.487
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.

52:26.908 --> 52:29.009
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go to any big blog you look at.

52:29.049 --> 52:29.830
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have the list.

52:30.150 --> 52:34.732
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.

52:36.493 --> 52:38.634
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

52:38.754 --> 52:39.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun waiting in line.

52:41.499 --> 52:41.960
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't know.

52:42.000 --> 52:48.063
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid?

52:48.103 --> 52:49.284
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, wait for PlayStation 3.

52:49.344 --> 52:50.385
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can make fun of them.

52:50.585 --> 52:51.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we really got to do that?

52:51.665 --> 52:53.647
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, everybody else says that.

52:54.107 --> 53:00.431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, that's like reporting on the fucking groundhog, you know, and seeing his shadow or not.

53:00.471 --> 53:01.611
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just retarded.

53:01.751 --> 53:04.833
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone to steal it.

53:05.153 --> 53:06.394
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good idea for a parody.

53:06.754 --> 53:09.496
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, to answer questions from the chat room, um, uh,

53:10.014 --> 53:19.277
[SPEAKER_00]: The Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is $6.09, and the Midtown one is $10.28, so that you can look online and see what stores those are.

53:19.317 --> 53:19.737
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

53:20.837 --> 53:22.238
[SPEAKER_05]: I just whispered my parody to Loki.

53:22.258 --> 53:22.638
[SPEAKER_05]: You like that?

53:23.138 --> 53:23.498
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

53:23.518 --> 53:25.179
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to do that instead, okay?

53:25.219 --> 53:25.559
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

53:25.939 --> 53:26.699
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.

53:29.540 --> 53:29.900
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

53:30.260 --> 53:32.841
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally missed it because I was doing my job.

53:34.482 --> 53:38.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's some interesting things in, you know,

53:39.161 --> 53:49.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan might be waiting a little longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another one-fifth of their initial launch PS3s.

53:49.524 --> 53:54.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of getting 100,000 units at launch, they're going to be getting closer to 80,000.

53:54.225 --> 53:57.466
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of sucks.

53:57.486 --> 54:03.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United States.

54:04.408 --> 54:06.789
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh well, kind of seemed

54:07.446 --> 54:12.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week, so... Yeah.

54:13.349 --> 54:14.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be them.

54:14.489 --> 54:17.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be UK even more, though, because they have to wait until March.

54:19.795 --> 54:26.817
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City, because that's the only place right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing this.

54:26.917 --> 54:31.958
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America, and we'll hit a store near you soon enough.

54:32.899 --> 54:34.719
[SPEAKER_05]: But this week it hit YouTube.

54:34.739 --> 54:42.621
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.

54:42.661 --> 54:44.302
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.

54:44.562 --> 54:47.083
[SPEAKER_05]: I freaking missed the Wii's and Nintendo World by a week.

54:47.223 --> 54:48.343
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed this by a week.

54:49.019 --> 54:51.740
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.

54:51.820 --> 54:52.780
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't plan for shit.

54:52.820 --> 54:53.340
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate my life.

54:54.520 --> 54:58.201
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming blogs.

54:58.761 --> 55:04.382
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this is showing up at the Times Square Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.

55:04.562 --> 55:07.383
[SPEAKER_05]: So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.

55:08.323 --> 55:11.143
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.

55:11.223 --> 55:16.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.

55:16.124 --> 55:17.425
[SPEAKER_00]: My informed decision is poo.

55:18.385 --> 55:18.745
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

55:20.339 --> 55:22.121
[SPEAKER_00]: Disney is having a cow.

55:23.502 --> 55:26.785
[SPEAKER_00]: They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.

55:27.726 --> 55:34.893
[SPEAKER_00]: Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.

55:34.993 --> 55:37.795
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you get the new...

55:39.637 --> 55:41.598
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it right now though

56:09.460 --> 56:10.060
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, hold on.

56:10.100 --> 56:17.142
[SPEAKER_05]: You just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl!

56:17.722 --> 56:19.262
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't be PS3 fangirl.

56:19.342 --> 56:20.922
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.

56:22.223 --> 56:23.923
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not care what the platform is.

56:24.003 --> 56:27.264
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to play the game I want to play.

56:27.704 --> 56:30.364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the system that is good.

56:30.464 --> 56:34.325
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the game that is good, that maximizes how well it uses the system.

56:34.625 --> 56:35.945
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is the tool.

56:36.285 --> 56:39.186
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.

56:39.867 --> 56:43.111
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my only problem with PlayStation, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier.

56:43.151 --> 56:45.635
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a year from now, PlayStation 3 will be just fine.

56:45.675 --> 56:49.420
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now at launch, there is zero, zip, nada, nothing I want.

56:49.760 --> 56:53.085
[SPEAKER_05]: Because half the launch games you can get, and more than half you can get on another system.

56:53.585 --> 56:56.028
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh.

56:56.950 --> 56:57.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

56:57.884 --> 57:01.965
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this and Final Fantasy XIII.

57:02.525 --> 57:05.786
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year.

57:05.846 --> 57:09.027
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, I see no need to do this crazy campout crap.

57:09.427 --> 57:10.107
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just no need.

57:10.527 --> 57:19.389
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the need to get the PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or whatever.

57:19.629 --> 57:20.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

57:20.490 --> 57:20.990
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

57:22.430 --> 57:24.191
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of gone that route anyways.

57:24.251 --> 57:25.491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive, and it's...

57:26.528 --> 57:27.048
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what?

57:27.369 --> 57:29.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm is kind of the only thing I'm looking forward to.

57:29.390 --> 57:33.412
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this.

57:33.472 --> 57:34.893
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gamers like you.

57:34.973 --> 57:35.634
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?

57:36.034 --> 57:41.317
[SPEAKER_05]: If the real list is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the listeners will forgive us a little bit.

57:41.657 --> 57:42.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

57:42.418 --> 57:43.718
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you're special.

57:43.759 --> 57:46.000
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.

57:46.140 --> 57:46.540
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

57:46.580 --> 57:50.322
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.

57:50.763 --> 57:50.943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

57:51.783 --> 57:52.524
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord help us all.

57:52.544 --> 57:52.804
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

57:53.767 --> 57:56.949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.

57:56.989 --> 57:58.050
[SPEAKER_00]: So I played Sonic.

57:58.350 --> 57:58.990
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap.

58:01.072 --> 58:02.733
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Gran Turismo.

58:02.913 --> 58:03.593
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap.

58:04.634 --> 58:05.555
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

58:09.458 --> 58:13.901
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadowslayer would like to point out they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts 3 is for yet.

58:13.921 --> 58:18.824
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really said exactly which platform it's going to be.

58:18.924 --> 58:20.986
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.

58:21.557 --> 58:24.019
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.

58:24.400 --> 58:24.740
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

58:25.320 --> 58:25.841
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

58:25.941 --> 58:26.821
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be what?

58:26.881 --> 58:27.662
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii World?

58:28.343 --> 58:28.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

58:31.505 --> 58:33.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

58:34.207 --> 58:41.113
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not so soon, but Castlevania.

58:41.633 --> 58:47.758
[SPEAKER_04]: The film's in the works right now and unfortunately it's being directed by Paul W.S.

58:47.958 --> 58:48.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Anderson who has

58:49.639 --> 59:01.563
[SPEAKER_04]: made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.

59:03.144 --> 59:04.824
[SPEAKER_05]: So, is he going to take a big poop?

59:04.844 --> 59:07.725
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two winners to be influenced, but actually Blade's kind of cool.

59:08.105 --> 59:16.008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.

59:17.289 --> 59:18.549
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like Van Helsing.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably... That was a waste of a movie.

59:24.054 --> 59:24.394
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

59:24.414 --> 59:25.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me put it this way.

59:25.554 --> 59:29.856
[SPEAKER_04]: In the spectrum of video game movies, he's not the bottom.

59:30.156 --> 59:31.596
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

59:31.916 --> 59:34.137
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.

59:34.157 --> 59:35.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat was Resident Evil.

59:35.797 --> 59:36.677
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fans of that.

59:36.777 --> 59:38.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil, eh, not so great.

59:38.338 --> 59:40.978
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Mortal Kombat was cheesy, but, you know, whatever.

59:41.058 --> 59:41.519
[SPEAKER_04]: It was effective.

59:41.539 --> 59:42.259
[SPEAKER_05]: It got the job done.

59:42.299 --> 59:43.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so...

59:43.692 --> 59:43.852
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

59:43.872 --> 59:44.032
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

59:44.052 --> 59:44.132
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:11.906
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have Kylie Minogue in it?

01:00:12.426 --> 01:00:12.986
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

01:00:13.086 --> 01:00:16.808
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another Street Fighter movie.

01:00:19.569 --> 01:00:22.170
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.

01:00:22.930 --> 01:00:24.331
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they'll get Ming-Na Wen back.

01:00:24.391 --> 01:00:24.731
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:00:25.091 --> 01:00:25.872
[SPEAKER_05]: She's still on ER?

01:00:26.172 --> 01:00:27.052
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a cute Chun-Li.

01:00:27.092 --> 01:00:27.872
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a cute Chun-Li.

01:00:27.892 --> 01:00:28.613
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe she'll come back.

01:00:28.653 --> 01:00:28.893
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:29.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Is she too old now?

01:00:30.133 --> 01:00:30.414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

01:00:30.434 --> 01:00:30.974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a few years.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.254
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why she would.

01:00:32.274 --> 01:00:33.475
[SPEAKER_05]: She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.710
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch TV.

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:36.191
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:38.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do this.

01:00:38.512 --> 01:00:41.913
[SPEAKER_04]: All they're going to do is just try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.

01:00:41.953 --> 01:00:46.295
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Tide, Zhang Ji, or whatever her name is.

01:00:46.535 --> 01:00:47.195
[SPEAKER_00]: Zhang Ji?

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:47.755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, her.

01:00:49.296 --> 01:00:51.017
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be cool, actually, because she's...

01:00:52.469 --> 01:00:54.110
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks way too innocent.

01:00:54.330 --> 01:01:00.353
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news because, you know, it's Hyde Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this.

01:01:00.693 --> 01:01:06.116
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter, they want to get this movie out in time for.

01:01:06.136 --> 01:01:08.737
[SPEAKER_05]: They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?

01:01:09.017 --> 01:01:13.159
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.

01:01:13.539 --> 01:01:18.762
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with, you know, a Hadouken.

01:01:20.673 --> 01:01:21.794
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

01:01:22.874 --> 01:01:23.234
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

01:01:24.195 --> 01:01:26.596
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 in our chatroom says, New Street Fighter movie?

01:01:26.796 --> 01:01:27.476
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:32.098
[SPEAKER_05]: And Justin says, Hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.

01:01:33.079 --> 01:01:36.180
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:36.680
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.121
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Raul Julia's last role.

01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:39.101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was kind of sad.

01:01:39.401 --> 01:01:41.242
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, he's going to die.

01:01:42.116 --> 01:01:44.597
[SPEAKER_00]: with that being his last movie.

01:01:44.737 --> 01:01:48.978
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards.

01:01:49.018 --> 01:01:55.479
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the HBO movie may have technically been... Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter thing.

01:01:55.539 --> 01:02:00.260
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his last movie.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.840
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say he did make a good bison.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.481
[SPEAKER_05]: He made a great Gomez Adams.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.061
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.141
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll always remember him for it.

01:02:06.161 --> 01:02:07.101
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:08.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, never saw it.

01:02:08.982 --> 01:02:09.482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

01:02:11.863 --> 01:02:19.388
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Addams Family, but has everything to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:25.092
[SPEAKER_05]: Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.

01:02:26.233 --> 01:02:32.578
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.

01:02:34.662 --> 01:02:40.005
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3.

01:02:41.626 --> 01:02:42.946
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the Halo movie, I'm sorry.

01:02:43.086 --> 01:02:47.269
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.

01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:55.453
[SPEAKER_00]: They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for it.

01:02:58.434 --> 01:02:59.035
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's too bad.

01:02:59.695 --> 01:03:01.276
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is stupid, because...

01:03:02.421 --> 01:03:06.567
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a market for these type of sci-fi fantasy.

01:03:07.508 --> 01:03:10.572
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made but Halo can't?

01:03:10.592 --> 01:03:16.820
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll bet you the problem is you got Peter Jackson attached and they probably want a budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie is going to cost to make.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.605
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses.

01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:23.230
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no short dresses in Halo.

01:03:35.726 --> 01:03:41.068
[SPEAKER_05]: True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox live release of Street Fighter.

01:03:41.188 --> 01:03:43.588
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.

01:03:43.628 --> 01:03:46.829
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day.

01:03:46.909 --> 01:03:49.830
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was posting, where's Street Fighter?

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:51.070
[SPEAKER_05]: We want Street Fighter.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.571
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week.

01:03:53.611 --> 01:03:56.052
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like, where's Luminous?

01:03:56.192 --> 01:03:57.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Luminous?

01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.712
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Mortal Kombat 3?

01:04:00.413 --> 01:04:03.994
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say, though, that Sharon is my hero right now.

01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:04.434
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

01:04:04.938 --> 01:04:05.538
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:34.085
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in... What was that game?

01:04:34.165 --> 01:04:35.685
[SPEAKER_05]: The motorcycle game with the chain?

01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:36.806
[SPEAKER_05]: Road Rash.

01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:38.566
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Road Rash, was the game.

01:04:38.866 --> 01:04:39.946
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I like Road Rash.

01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:42.607
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.

01:04:42.647 --> 01:04:42.947
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we?

01:04:43.327 --> 01:04:43.747
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting.

01:04:43.767 --> 01:04:45.027
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.

01:04:46.708 --> 01:04:52.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GamePro Expo.

01:04:53.129 --> 01:04:54.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the new E3?

01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:55.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

01:04:55.769 --> 01:04:58.810
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Show Event E3 General Mission or Industry Only

01:05:20.103 --> 01:05:20.603
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:05:41.215 --> 01:05:50.043
[SPEAKER_05]: By October, their Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having to build in April.

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:58.311
[SPEAKER_04]: They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?

01:05:58.391 --> 01:06:01.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not really any extra work that they have to do.

01:06:02.543 --> 01:06:06.985
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're saying that's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.

01:06:07.065 --> 01:06:11.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well, like tournaments and that sort of thing.

01:06:12.767 --> 01:06:16.668
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's what makes me think it's general mission, because why would you do industry-only tournaments?

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:17.729
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of defeats purpose.

01:06:17.949 --> 01:06:22.751
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.

01:06:24.551 --> 01:06:25.992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just L.A.

01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:26.912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably go.

01:06:27.232 --> 01:06:28.113
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds kind of exciting.

01:06:28.793 --> 01:06:29.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

01:06:29.413 --> 01:06:29.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there.

01:06:29.994 --> 01:06:30.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

01:06:30.514 --> 01:06:31.214
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean.

01:06:31.874 --> 01:06:41.652
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully we're able to get in hopefully it's not, you know, by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be but we'll see, we'll see alright, well

01:06:42.062 --> 01:06:45.745
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for the news here in this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:45.765 --> 01:06:49.969
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:50.209 --> 01:06:52.771
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you guys listening live, we're going to do a music break here shortly.
