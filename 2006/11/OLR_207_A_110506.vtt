00:00.000 --> 00:20.260
Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for

00:20.260 --> 00:33.040
Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and our HD movies coming to the Xbox marketplace.

00:33.040 --> 00:37.320
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
Radio.

00:38.320 --> 00:42.880
We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming,

00:42.880 --> 00:46.200
the gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle, so on and so on.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.200
We've been here for the past four and a half years serving you.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.200
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
You might know me as Sky.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.460
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.920
I got a snake, Meng.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
Maybe she's not so lovely, actually.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.920
Last night I fed my snake some beer.

01:00.920 --> 01:03.560
I was slithering this way and that.

01:03.560 --> 01:09.680
Come to think of it, she's rather vulgar, actually, and kind of offensive.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.680
You redid the hair, though.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.680
I like this new hairstyle.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.480
Yeah, my hair is pretty now.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.080
We need the new promo pics for OLR because you have way different hair now and I've got

01:17.080 --> 01:18.080
the facial hair.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.680
The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very

01:23.680 --> 01:24.680
curly.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.360
Now I straighten my hair and it's cherry red and black.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.240
I'll tell you what, chat room, I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
earlier.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.160
I'm great for being vulgar and offensive.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.160
All right.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.160
Speaking of vulgar and offensive, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.160
Hello.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.160
How you doing, Loki?

01:44.160 --> 01:45.160
I'm okay.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.160
Yeah?

01:46.160 --> 01:47.400
No new hairstyle for you, though.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.800
You still look the same as always.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Yes.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
Yeah.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
But I do notice you're wearing a gaming-related shirt today.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.360
Where did you come across this?

01:54.360 --> 01:55.840
From work, actually.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.800
Got it from Eidos.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.760
It's a shirt for just cause.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.320
Remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange on Australia for the first time,

02:04.320 --> 02:08.640
because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XB Stream.

02:08.640 --> 02:12.760
We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program and through iTunes

02:12.760 --> 02:14.060
we're always getting new people.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.980
Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because

02:16.980 --> 02:17.980
of it.

02:17.980 --> 02:23.320
I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact

02:23.320 --> 02:28.920
with big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot.

02:28.920 --> 02:36.240
So yeah, every now and then we do this annual kind of sales conferencing with the game publishers

02:36.240 --> 02:38.420
and they bring us free stuff.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.420
Not so much this year, though.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.080
They didn't bring us as much free stuff.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.400
But I did get a shirt from...

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
Poor baby.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.400
Yeah.

02:44.400 --> 02:51.220
I got a shirt from Eidos, so for just cause, and Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda

02:51.220 --> 02:53.920
shirt or a communist propaganda shirt.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.240
That's what it looks like.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
It's an interesting shirt.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.600
I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.600
I don't know.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.600
Maybe it's just me.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
I'm just crazy.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
All right.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.880
Anyway, in all seriousness, we have no guest right now.

03:07.880 --> 03:12.580
I think Miklotov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show

03:12.580 --> 03:15.040
people that hang out here at the apartment.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.480
But we do have our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.480
Click on chat.

03:18.480 --> 03:22.320
Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
and offensive.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.400
I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.400
So they love it.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.460
Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.720
And so you will see it in a few.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.720
All right.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.720
Sounds good.

03:36.720 --> 03:41.160
Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have

03:41.160 --> 03:44.620
some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.360
But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.360
We always do.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.640
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

03:50.640 --> 03:53.000
My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.440
I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.560
I did get new games today.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.560
I got...

04:03.560 --> 04:07.800
What was the name of that game again?

04:07.800 --> 04:12.360
No, I can't believe I forgot the name of it already.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.360
Oh, yeah.

04:13.360 --> 04:21.080
Trauma Center Under the Knife, so that I can cut into people and be the Uber surgeon.

04:21.080 --> 04:28.120
And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have

04:28.120 --> 04:35.960
the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.

04:35.960 --> 04:36.960
Very cool.

04:36.960 --> 04:37.960
That's a lot of money.

04:37.960 --> 04:38.960
I didn't buy the collector art book.

04:38.960 --> 04:45.160
We went to a GameStop in San Jose, and she's like, go look in the back and price this game

04:45.160 --> 04:46.160
for me.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.160
Okay, but you can just...

04:47.160 --> 04:49.160
Go in the back!

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
Okay.

04:50.160 --> 04:56.200
So I look back, and she's huddled over the counter, and I'm like, oh shit.

04:56.200 --> 05:00.720
Because I know when she tells somebody to go look at something, and then starts huddling

05:00.720 --> 05:03.120
over the counter, that I'm in trouble.

05:03.120 --> 05:09.000
So I get back, because she picked up my Trauma Center at the time, which I need to sort of

05:09.000 --> 05:16.920
pay her back for it, but she hands me the bag, and it's heavy, and I'm like, what?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.080
And then she starts running out the door, I'm like, oh my god.

05:19.080 --> 05:22.880
So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.

05:22.880 --> 05:23.880
Hot.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.480
Okay, whatever.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.280
And then, don't let me forget, during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's

05:28.280 --> 05:29.840
Witness I owned today.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.800
That was very nice, though, of...

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
You know.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.800
That was very nice of her.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
She's a very sweet friend.

05:34.800 --> 05:35.800
She is.

05:35.800 --> 05:36.800
She's very good.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.000
And if I could, I would do all the same for her, so I'm making her a special Christmas

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
present.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Right on.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.280
I'm making it with finger paints.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.600
How four years old are you?

05:44.600 --> 05:45.600
Yeah.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
It was okay.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.600
I...

05:49.600 --> 05:52.800
Ooh, finally got that to work.

05:52.800 --> 05:57.440
Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.400
So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.

06:03.400 --> 06:09.120
And then, of course, I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.800
I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this, and none of them have covered multiplayer

06:14.800 --> 06:16.080
very well.

06:16.080 --> 06:21.680
And because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know

06:21.680 --> 06:27.840
possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP, I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is

06:27.840 --> 06:31.720
and why they did a lot of things badly.

06:31.720 --> 06:38.720
For one, anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice Cities or Vice City Stories will

06:38.720 --> 06:43.080
know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.

06:43.080 --> 06:49.000
It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.120
Okay, that in mind.

06:51.120 --> 06:54.480
The multiplayer, I was really surprised because they had six different, you know, maps to

06:54.480 --> 06:57.720
choose from, or at least that's what I thought that meant.

06:57.720 --> 07:04.680
But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points on the same map.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.920
So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks, because when you're

07:09.920 --> 07:13.680
playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn

07:13.680 --> 07:19.060
island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.440
Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.900
I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead

07:25.900 --> 07:29.320
and let everyone run around the full map.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.320
That sucks right there.

07:30.320 --> 07:34.640
Second of all, the map design has a lot of fences that aren't on the map, so you don't

07:34.640 --> 07:39.360
know, you know, you're trying to go to one spot and you don't realize that, oh wait,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.600
there's gonna be a chain link fence that I can't go through.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.920
Wait, you can beat up hookers, you can steal cars, but you can't hop a goddamn fence?

07:45.920 --> 07:47.800
No, I'm sorry, that was in San Andreas.

07:47.800 --> 07:53.800
You see Vice City, you can't have, there is no hopping fence technology yet, nor, you

07:53.800 --> 07:57.520
know, we're lucky enough to actually be able to swim for about a minute, you know, let

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
alone...

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
In the 80s, we didn't know how to climb.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.280
So, it's just retarded, because the chain link fence is in Liberty City, you can smash

08:03.280 --> 08:08.400
a car through and then, you know, be able to go right through, but, so basically the

08:08.400 --> 08:15.240
whole game is flawed in the sense that there's, the maps are too big, and I mean, granted,

08:15.240 --> 08:19.080
you can kind of get by it a little bit, you know, just picking the section of the map,

08:19.080 --> 08:23.520
but it would have been a lot better if they had put some sort of artificial wall blocking

08:23.520 --> 08:25.480
you into a certain section of the map.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.240
That would have worked a lot better, and I would have rather seen that.

08:28.240 --> 08:33.820
The second thing that sucks about the multiplayer in the game, though, is the option to turn

08:33.820 --> 08:35.020
off power-ups.

08:35.020 --> 08:38.800
You cannot turn the power-ups off in the game, whereas you could in the first one, which

08:38.800 --> 08:43.760
I don't understand why they took that feature out, because that makes no sense, but anyways,

08:43.760 --> 08:48.440
so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they

08:48.440 --> 08:53.160
spawn about 50 miles away, so, you know, you'll never get to the power-up anyways.

08:53.160 --> 08:58.240
Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except

08:58.240 --> 09:01.960
the Hunter controls it crap, but, I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around

09:01.960 --> 09:03.680
in the helicopter.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.960
But multiplayer is pretty good overall, if they had only made the maps a little bit smaller,

09:06.960 --> 09:12.160
and hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better, but right now, you

09:12.160 --> 09:16.520
know, they don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid, and

09:16.520 --> 09:22.440
all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff, so, whatever.

09:22.440 --> 09:26.680
Some comments from our chat room, Zappy seems to agree with you, bleh, Vice City is meh,

09:26.680 --> 09:31.220
same old GTA, whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you, I actually think having

09:31.220 --> 09:33.360
the full map in multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
No!

09:34.360 --> 09:36.040
If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelunchradio.com.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.060
Trust me, I've played multiplayer every single day, it does not make it more fun, because

09:39.060 --> 09:44.280
you have, say for example, you're playing a 13 minute game, you have to spend a lot

09:44.280 --> 09:49.600
of time, you know, getting to where the other people are, and they also retweet the weapons

09:49.600 --> 09:53.560
and how, you know, much damage they do, like the remote grenades, which used to be really

09:53.560 --> 09:57.880
devastating, now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody, it's ridiculous.

09:57.880 --> 10:02.680
It takes like four of them to blow up somebody, and before, it's like, you can get hit from,

10:02.680 --> 10:06.560
one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome, but, I don't know,

10:06.560 --> 10:10.680
I don't like how they retweeted everything, and I really wish they had thought more about

10:10.680 --> 10:16.440
the multiplayer, I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute, but,

10:16.440 --> 10:19.720
they really, if they're going to put multiplayer in the game, at least spend some time actually

10:19.720 --> 10:24.120
working out the tweaks, working out the bugs in it, because all those same bugs that were

10:24.120 --> 10:29.740
there in the first one are still there in this one, so, obviously they weren't working

10:29.740 --> 10:34.760
very well, you know, on this, and we're going to probably beta test them more than they

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
did.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.120
They don't fucking consult me, that's what I want to know, I've played this game more

10:39.120 --> 10:43.880
than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet, they do not consult me when it comes

10:43.880 --> 10:48.260
to their multiplayer in their game, I can at least give them some simple advice, like,

10:48.260 --> 10:52.320
maybe put an option where you can turn off the powerups, that might be smart.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.660
No one cares what you think, Loki, you're just some dumb podcaster, amateur internet

10:56.660 --> 10:57.660
journalist.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.680
I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories, I

11:00.680 --> 11:05.620
will fucking kick your ass, anybody, in the face of the world, anybody, I will beat them

11:05.620 --> 11:10.500
down, and this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games, I would kick

11:10.500 --> 11:11.500
their ass.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.500
Wow.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.500
Strong words there.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
Challenge to anybody.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.800
Strong words there.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
You know, you're just begging for an ass-kicking with a statement like that, Loki.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.460
Oh, no, I'm not.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.460
All right.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.460
Is that it for your gaming week?

11:22.460 --> 11:23.460
That's pretty much it, yeah.

11:23.460 --> 11:27.240
All right, my gaming week, for those folks that have listened to Orange Lounge Radio

11:27.240 --> 11:31.660
for any amount of time, you guys know that I'm pretty much, you know, I'm openly, admittedly

11:31.660 --> 11:39.220
a whore for all games Final Fantasy that don't involve draw magic.

11:39.220 --> 11:43.820
So Final Fantasy XII came out this week, and it's epic.

11:43.820 --> 11:46.460
That's the only word I can use to describe it, it's just epic.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.280
It's a lot of what I hope for and dream for.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.580
Let me get my bitches out of the way first, because that's usually what people do.

11:52.580 --> 11:59.220
My bitches for the game is that I think I've been really spoiled by next-gen graphics,

11:59.220 --> 12:04.120
because the graphics didn't really wow me like how Final Fantasy X did when I first

12:04.120 --> 12:08.240
played X, or a lot of the Final Fantasy facts in their respective generations usually get

12:08.240 --> 12:09.580
very wowed by the graphics.

12:09.580 --> 12:14.020
XII didn't really wow me with the graphics, but, you know, graphics are only so much of

12:14.020 --> 12:17.660
a game, so that's really a minor bitch all things considered.

12:17.660 --> 12:22.540
Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series,

12:22.540 --> 12:23.540
in my opinion.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.780
But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.740
The game is fabulous.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.660
The combat system is genius.

12:31.660 --> 12:36.940
The demo doesn't give you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.

12:36.940 --> 12:41.800
The combat system is great, because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final

12:41.800 --> 12:46.540
Fantasy XI, except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want, and

12:46.540 --> 12:47.920
you don't have to put up with retards.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
It's awesome.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.180
I love it.

12:50.180 --> 12:51.360
The combat system is brilliant.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.360
I love it.

12:52.360 --> 12:55.500
I know it's probably going to turn off some old-school fans of the Final Fantasy series,

12:55.500 --> 12:56.500
but it's a nice change.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.980
I think it's great.

12:57.980 --> 13:05.500
The characters are awesome, the story is awesome, and I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great,

13:05.500 --> 13:10.360
and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.

13:10.360 --> 13:14.180
There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story,

13:14.180 --> 13:17.660
because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but I had

13:17.660 --> 13:21.260
an interesting experience going to pick this game up, because I went to a midnight release

13:21.260 --> 13:25.200
for Final Fantasy XII at the local GameStop, because they called and said, hey, we're doing

13:25.200 --> 13:26.240
the midnight release.

13:26.240 --> 13:31.380
So I went, and it was so anticlimactic, like it was just a bunch of people standing around

13:31.380 --> 13:36.700
looking bored, all kind of watching the clock for midnight to hit, and then one cosplayer

13:36.700 --> 13:42.420
walked in at 11.55, and everybody was just kind of staring at him, like, isn't that cute?

13:42.420 --> 13:47.660
Because he came as Cid from Final Fantasy VII, and I guess he got a prize for it.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.580
I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever, so it was kind of anticlimactic,

13:51.580 --> 13:55.020
and of course they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook, and I'm like, no, I have

13:55.020 --> 13:56.380
a game, I have GameFacts.

13:56.380 --> 13:57.840
The guidebook is sexy.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.780
I know the guidebook looks nice, but I couldn't justify paying the money for it, when GameFacts.com

14:02.780 --> 14:03.780
is available.

14:03.780 --> 14:07.540
That's all I can say.

14:07.540 --> 14:10.420
Rama in our chat room says, Gambites and Licenses, crap.

14:10.420 --> 14:11.500
I disagree.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.780
The license board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambites is really what makes

14:15.780 --> 14:21.180
the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.

14:21.180 --> 14:23.500
Like the Gambites is basically, for those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambit

14:23.500 --> 14:28.300
system basically, you can set a pre-programmed set of logic for your players when you're

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
doing battle.

14:29.300 --> 14:34.540
Like for instance, let's say I use Fran a lot, she's the bunny looking character, she's

14:34.540 --> 14:37.460
awesome, and she's so sarcastic too.

14:37.460 --> 14:40.300
Even my friend who doesn't play games, like one of my best friends, John, just watched

14:40.300 --> 14:43.940
me play Final Fantasy XII for like two hours the other night, and he even agreed by the

14:43.940 --> 14:47.740
time it was over that Balthier and Fran were like sexy beasts.

14:47.740 --> 14:52.420
Anyway, but Fran, so like I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority,

14:52.420 --> 14:55.920
if anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.740
If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.

15:00.740 --> 15:05.260
Then she will automatically cure Silence, she'll automatically cure Poison, then her

15:05.260 --> 15:08.220
priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.

15:08.220 --> 15:13.580
Then under that, the logic is that she casts Protect on my main character, Vaan, who I

15:13.580 --> 15:15.580
use as my main character right now.

15:15.580 --> 15:21.100
So it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle,

15:21.100 --> 15:22.340
so she's not wasting MP.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.340
It's great.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.340
So you can kind of play with this.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.260
But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic

15:27.260 --> 15:28.260
available to you.

15:28.260 --> 15:33.280
Like, for instance, you start with like only a few commands, like hit points below 70%,

15:33.280 --> 15:36.860
but if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have

15:36.860 --> 15:37.860
to buy that.

15:37.860 --> 15:41.940
Or if you want to get like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.220
You know, it's kind of interesting the way that all works.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.180
So I kind of think it's cool.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.180
I like it.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.580
So that's just my opinion.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.840
So I think the game is great.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.620
It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.040
It's like a 9.9 out of 10.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.040
It's wonderful.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.040
You have to get it.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.940
Even if you don't like RPGs, usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in

16:01.940 --> 16:03.200
this will get you into it.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.200
I don't know.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
That's just my thoughts.

16:05.200 --> 16:10.500
So, Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
I realized that...

16:11.500 --> 16:14.260
I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.

16:14.260 --> 16:15.260
You know what, though?

16:15.260 --> 16:18.020
The demo didn't do it justice, because it didn't show you the depth of it.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.820
It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like run up to a monster and rely on the auto

16:21.820 --> 16:23.920
attack thing and maybe use the magic.

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
It didn't do it justice.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.980
I was just like, get the stupid thing off the screen.

16:26.980 --> 16:27.980
I want my cutscene.

16:27.980 --> 16:28.980
Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.

16:28.980 --> 16:29.980
You know what I meant, though?

16:29.980 --> 16:30.980
I meant the cut to battle.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
Yeah.

16:31.980 --> 16:32.980
The battle screen, I guess.

16:32.980 --> 16:39.400
Well, it's interesting, because it means you have no random battles, and that was kind

16:39.400 --> 16:42.700
of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasy, is like, God damn it, I need to get to a save

16:42.700 --> 16:47.940
point, because I need to go, and it's like you're walking towards a save point, and then

16:47.940 --> 16:48.940
boom, boom, boom.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.780
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

16:50.780 --> 16:55.020
There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.740
Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.980
Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.

16:59.980 --> 17:00.980
That's true.

17:00.980 --> 17:02.420
But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.900
Oh, that is one other kind of minor.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.100
You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.

17:08.100 --> 17:11.400
The areas are massive.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.580
It was the same with X.

17:13.580 --> 17:17.980
What would you say was the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, when you played Final

17:17.980 --> 17:18.980
Fantasy XI?

17:18.980 --> 17:19.980
What was the worst thing about it?

17:19.980 --> 17:20.980
Being a white mage.

17:20.980 --> 17:25.340
See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat

17:25.340 --> 17:28.900
system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.940
You set the gamuts, and they do it.

17:31.940 --> 17:34.300
If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.300
You got it.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
And no one yells at you to cure them.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
They'll just die.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
It's awesome.

17:38.300 --> 17:43.820
So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger, without Toriyama's artwork.

17:43.820 --> 17:44.820
Maybe.

17:44.820 --> 17:45.820
Maybe.

17:45.820 --> 17:46.820
I don't know.

17:46.820 --> 17:48.020
Chrono Trigger is just a whole other universe.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.020
I don't know.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.020
You're comparing apples to oranges.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.020
That would be awesome.

17:51.020 --> 17:52.820
You're comparing apples to oranges.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.300
They're different, but they're still grapefruit.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.300
I don't know.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.300
Take that as you will.

17:57.300 --> 18:01.740
All you need to know is comparing apples to oranges when you're eating pizza.

18:01.740 --> 18:05.260
So no other games for me to review this week, and probably for the next few weeks there

18:05.260 --> 18:09.080
won't be a lot that I'm playing, although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.340
And I did go to, we were at the mall today, and of course I had to look to see if they

18:12.340 --> 18:15.820
had Luminous 2, because I still kind of want it.

18:15.820 --> 18:19.060
Even if I am a little bit like, see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week.

18:19.060 --> 18:23.580
I got mixed up, so I have to wait for Tuesday, but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous

18:23.580 --> 18:27.940
right now because the Xbox one was not all that, I still really want Luminous 2.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.060
And somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week, and you know,

18:31.060 --> 18:32.280
it looked pretty hot.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.340
So anyway, let's get into some housekeeping.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.760
We have a few items for housekeeping tonight.

18:37.760 --> 18:43.340
First things first, it is November sweeps, for those that don't know what I'm talking

18:43.340 --> 18:44.340
about.

18:44.340 --> 18:48.780
In the TV industry they usually do this thing called November sweeps, which is where the

18:48.780 --> 18:54.380
big stuff happens, like in Lost they'll kill off the character that you really liked, or

18:54.380 --> 18:58.860
maybe somebody will get married, or they'll have a baby, something really big happens.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.920
So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey maybe we'll get involved in November

19:01.920 --> 19:05.660
sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.180
And tonight we have a surprise for you guys, and this is something we've been hinting

19:08.180 --> 19:09.820
at for a little while.

19:09.820 --> 19:14.900
But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes

19:14.900 --> 19:20.900
or XB Stream or however you're doing it, Orange Launch Radio is actually a live streaming

19:20.900 --> 19:23.220
radio station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

19:23.220 --> 19:28.620
This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then broadcasted

19:28.620 --> 19:30.420
over the MP3s.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.860
But we do have live only shows that air throughout the week.

19:32.860 --> 19:36.280
For instance, Tuesday night, Dark Soccer does her Pump Up the Volume, it's just her and

19:36.280 --> 19:39.180
she plays some indie band music for you guys.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.900
Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is

19:42.900 --> 19:45.100
kind of about pop culture stuff.

19:45.100 --> 19:49.380
And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.

19:49.380 --> 19:56.380
So let's go to the tape.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.380
Do you want to listen to me?

19:58.380 --> 20:05.380
Because if you do, then I should warn you.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.300
Because if you do, I should warn you.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.020
You're going to hear all sorts of things.

20:10.020 --> 20:17.300
It's from the past, crap from the future, the day I have a meltdown on the air, it won't

20:17.300 --> 20:20.780
be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be clean.

20:20.780 --> 20:26.340
But I tell you what it will be, but I tell you what it will be, the train wreck of a

20:26.340 --> 20:27.340
lifetime.

20:27.340 --> 20:30.780
Do you want to listen to me?

20:30.780 --> 20:36.700
Travis Donovan Law coming to Orange Launch Radio.

20:36.700 --> 20:42.180
That's right, Orange Lounge Radio welcomes Travis Donovan Live, premiering Saturday,

20:42.180 --> 20:47.980
November 11th at 730 Pacific about here on Orange Lounge Radio.

20:47.980 --> 20:52.340
Right now it's scheduled to be a live only show, but the option for audio RSS may be

20:52.340 --> 20:53.340
in the future.

20:53.340 --> 20:55.000
So we're very excited about that.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.460
For those that don't know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer and I used to be

20:59.460 --> 21:04.540
on a program called Under Sedation Live that was hosted by Travis Donovan.

21:04.540 --> 21:08.380
And also for those of you that are big on DDR Freak and the DDR scene, you probably

21:08.380 --> 21:11.260
know Iguana Girl, she was on that program as well.

21:11.260 --> 21:16.100
So Under Sedation Live has gone through some changes recently and unfortunately the station

21:16.100 --> 21:17.100
is going to be folding.

21:17.100 --> 21:21.900
The live station that runs 24-7 is going to be folding I believe at the end of this month.

21:21.900 --> 21:25.580
So we thought, you know what, Travis did a lot for us, so we want to allow him to come

21:25.580 --> 21:29.860
over to our station and continue the legacy he started many years ago.

21:29.860 --> 21:31.860
So I look forward to that.

21:31.860 --> 21:35.020
For those that don't know Travis, he's kind of a geek just like the rest of us.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.200
So his show is going to be a little more sci-fi oriented and type stuff.

21:38.200 --> 21:42.860
So sci-fi, I know he plays Xbox 360 and hopefully he'll be giving us a call a little later in

21:42.860 --> 21:45.460
the program and tell us a little more about what to look forward to on his program.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.260
So we're very excited about that.

21:47.260 --> 21:50.820
More surprises to come in upcoming weeks.

21:50.820 --> 21:54.420
For now let's get into some gaming news and we're going to start it off.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.820
Loki has some dates for you guys, some things you may not have heard about, a little Under

21:58.820 --> 21:59.900
the Radar stuff this week.

21:59.900 --> 22:05.740
I have dates now, but we've got some good stuff this week of course.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.980
Lots of stuff has been announced and one of those titles that you might have seen floating

22:09.980 --> 22:13.660
around out there would be Halo 3.

22:13.660 --> 22:21.460
So without further ado, and I'm going to preface this a little bit because with such a date

22:21.460 --> 22:27.540
like this you have to kind of wonder, okay well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive

22:27.540 --> 22:35.620
on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, according

22:35.620 --> 22:40.080
to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement, of course Microsoft hasn't made

22:40.080 --> 22:43.680
an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside

22:43.680 --> 22:52.220
Microsoft, March 14th, which makes sense because that's when the big games came out last year.

22:52.220 --> 22:55.820
March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies including

22:55.820 --> 23:04.660
Microsoft, so March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo, and yeah, that's pretty cool.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.460
Okay, now wait a minute, I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing

23:07.460 --> 23:08.460
you're saying there.

23:08.460 --> 23:13.980
So again, let's look at the evidence and why, because most people are assuming that Christmas

23:13.980 --> 23:20.100
window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3, but now we've had several random things

23:20.100 --> 23:23.060
pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?

23:23.060 --> 23:27.140
Because I remember a few episodes ago, you had the marketing folks that came to your

23:27.140 --> 23:28.580
work and they told you spring, right?

23:28.580 --> 23:38.840
Well, this wasn't the marketing guy, this was their head of sales at Microsoft, he said

23:38.840 --> 23:47.260
March or April was the target date for Halo, and this makes sense because how would you

23:47.260 --> 23:51.320
love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions

23:51.320 --> 23:54.780
and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really

23:54.780 --> 24:00.300
good because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways,

24:00.300 --> 24:06.380
Halo Wars, so you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.

24:06.380 --> 24:10.400
You know what's interesting is that the same, obviously when you posted this in the show

24:10.400 --> 24:14.540
roll thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different

24:14.540 --> 24:19.140
source, let's just say I have a friend, and I know you all hate these friend of a friend

24:19.140 --> 24:21.700
things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place,

24:21.700 --> 24:22.700
right?

24:22.700 --> 24:28.220
I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain large magazine company who's

24:28.220 --> 24:33.220
had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to

24:33.220 --> 24:34.220
be spring of 2007.

24:34.220 --> 24:39.700
Well, of course it's going to be spring of 2007, and I would think that this makes very

24:39.700 --> 24:44.100
good sense, it's not going to be February because I thought originally it might be February

24:44.100 --> 24:47.700
or something like that, but February is usually dead, it's kind of still that dead point from

24:47.700 --> 24:54.100
December to March, where nothing really comes out.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.800
That wasn't the only day I had, there were some other ones from EA I thought I'd mentioned

24:57.800 --> 25:02.380
as well, I mean, it's not huge stuff, but EA Replay 2, they've already decided to go

25:02.380 --> 25:08.460
ahead and make a second one, that'll be coming out also the same day on Valentine's Day.

25:08.460 --> 25:13.340
Perfect way to say I love you is Halo 3 and EA Replay 2.

25:13.340 --> 25:18.700
Coded Arbs Contagion, and that might even be pushed back, who knows, because a lot of

25:18.700 --> 25:24.540
Konami stuff has been delayed lately, they've been kind of dropping the ball on some stuff.

25:24.540 --> 25:34.380
MVP07 NCAA Baseball, also that same date, and then finally Two Worlds for Xbox 360,

25:34.380 --> 25:41.300
which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th, so lots of

25:41.300 --> 25:47.140
good stuff, I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, home court, but I think

25:47.140 --> 25:50.220
the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.

25:50.220 --> 25:51.220
Fun stuff.

25:51.220 --> 25:55.940
Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?

25:55.940 --> 26:01.400
I think I saw it on a blog somewhere, it's interesting, I actually have that preordered

26:01.400 --> 26:05.180
because I want that for my desk.

26:05.180 --> 26:09.340
I hope that turns out to be true, you know, a lot of signs point to that, you know, why

26:09.340 --> 26:13.580
the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a

26:13.580 --> 26:17.660
big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3, and I don't know, there's just a lot of

26:17.660 --> 26:20.060
things that kind of make that look probable.

26:20.060 --> 26:24.300
We might be wrong, it might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.

26:24.300 --> 26:29.940
It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong, there are delay issues for different reasons,

26:29.940 --> 26:32.380
I mean, it's just like, you know.

26:32.380 --> 26:37.180
Folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray, but at the same time, if these magazines are

26:37.180 --> 26:40.740
getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate

26:40.740 --> 26:42.860
to me the game is pretty close to completion.

26:42.860 --> 26:47.500
I think so, and here's the thing about it though, and no one seems to pay attention

26:47.500 --> 26:53.860
to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big, you know, chunks, you've got

26:53.860 --> 27:00.820
the spring releases which take place mostly in March, you know, and it basically builds

27:00.820 --> 27:07.340
up right there in that March 15th week, you know, over there, then in November, November

27:07.340 --> 27:12.100
15th, those are the big, you know, two, and it just makes perfect sense.

27:12.100 --> 27:17.680
Just with the whole launch windows, you want to have this strong title for the spring that's

27:17.680 --> 27:22.940
basically going to, you know, dominate the market and make people even, you know, consider

27:22.940 --> 27:28.700
the 360 War over the PlayStation 3, and then for the holiday season, you've still got your

27:28.700 --> 27:35.060
Halo title, Halo Wars, that you can also push out there as well, so they're covered in both,

27:35.060 --> 27:36.900
you know, sections of the year.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.100
I don't know, that makes sense to me.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.180
Well, we'll see what happens.

27:41.180 --> 27:42.580
We will see all the time.

27:42.580 --> 27:46.140
Well anyway, getting into some other news, speaking of games that are coming out soon,

27:46.140 --> 27:50.300
some of your old favorites are coming back on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, but

27:50.300 --> 27:54.380
what's interesting, and I suppose not really a surprise to anyone, is that the lineups

27:54.380 --> 27:59.060
are going to be a little bit different between Japan, the U.S., and Europe.

27:59.060 --> 28:02.220
There's been a lot of release charts that have been circulating the internet.

28:02.220 --> 28:05.860
Now, this is supposed to be what's available by year's end, I believe, not necessarily

28:05.860 --> 28:10.300
all on November 19th, December 2nd, whatever day your country's getting the Wii, but this

28:10.300 --> 28:13.340
is all what's supposed to be available by year's end.

28:13.340 --> 28:20.500
All three regions are getting a wide selection of NES games, including Wario's Woods, Tennis,

28:20.500 --> 28:25.580
Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong, but what's interesting, Japan is getting

28:25.580 --> 28:26.580
some exclusives.

28:26.580 --> 28:30.300
They are the only ones that are getting Gradius, and what's very interesting, I think, is that

28:30.300 --> 28:33.260
they're the only ones getting Super Mario Brothers.

28:33.260 --> 28:34.580
So kind of strange there.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.340
Oh, also, how could I forget this one?

28:36.340 --> 28:37.340
Solomon's Key.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.340
I played that game a lot.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.060
I think those are launch games, if I remember correctly.

28:40.060 --> 28:41.980
I thought it was until the end of the year.

28:41.980 --> 28:44.860
I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than

28:44.860 --> 28:48.860
us, and I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for

28:48.860 --> 28:49.860
us.

28:49.860 --> 28:55.020
I want to say Europe is getting some games that were not either, and I want to say that

28:55.020 --> 28:58.180
it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.

28:58.180 --> 28:59.180
Well, alright.

28:59.180 --> 29:01.940
Now what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey

29:01.940 --> 29:04.540
Kong Country, but the other two regions are.

29:04.540 --> 29:08.060
All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and Sim City, but then

29:08.060 --> 29:14.220
Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra III, Super Castlevania

29:14.220 --> 29:17.460
IV, Street Fighter II, and Zelda Link to the Past.

29:17.460 --> 29:21.860
The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.

29:21.860 --> 29:27.060
Then you go over to Sega Genesis, and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.

29:27.060 --> 29:33.660
You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo

29:33.660 --> 29:37.380
or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same

29:37.380 --> 29:38.380
game, anyway.

29:38.380 --> 29:40.620
Sonic the Hedgehog, Toejam and Earl.

29:40.620 --> 29:44.020
The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer.

29:44.020 --> 29:45.340
Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?

29:45.340 --> 29:48.780
Yeah, that was the one with the dog.

29:48.780 --> 29:50.220
That game was freaking awesome.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.580
But yet there's no Shinobi listed.

29:51.580 --> 29:52.580
That's kind of weird.

29:52.580 --> 29:55.260
Shadow Dancer was a better game.

29:55.260 --> 30:00.520
On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions are getting Bonk's Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and

30:00.520 --> 30:06.980
Super Star Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman

30:06.980 --> 30:10.780
94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.

30:10.780 --> 30:19.900
Victory Run, not coming to the US, but is coming to Japan and the US.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.020
I screwed up earlier.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.460
Donkey Kong Country is not coming to the US.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.300
It is going to Europe, but not the US.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.300
My bad.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.960
Sorry, folks.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.540
We make mistakes here once in a while.

30:29.540 --> 30:30.540
My bad.

30:30.540 --> 30:32.180
But interesting lineups, nonetheless.

30:32.180 --> 30:34.440
Of course, a lot of us go, where's this game?

30:34.440 --> 30:37.700
For instance, I can't help but go, where's Guardian Legend?

30:37.700 --> 30:40.480
Where's the greatest NES game ever made?

30:40.480 --> 30:41.740
But maybe later.

30:41.740 --> 30:45.040
I'm also going, where's Dracula X?

30:45.040 --> 30:46.880
Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.

30:46.880 --> 30:47.880
Only the one in Japan.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.580
Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, while they're looking at the...

30:52.580 --> 30:58.740
And they could easily encode it, memory, storage being what it is now, they could easily move

30:58.740 --> 31:00.740
a whole CD game into...

31:00.740 --> 31:09.060
Because the thing that took up the most room on those disks was the Redbook audio.

31:09.060 --> 31:12.060
Well we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.

31:12.060 --> 31:14.940
It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?

31:14.940 --> 31:18.980
Imagine, you know, if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia, that'd

31:18.980 --> 31:19.980
be cool.

31:19.980 --> 31:20.980
Yeah.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.940
All right, so that's all I gotta say on the Virtual Console.

31:24.940 --> 31:28.220
Well, I've gotten used.

31:28.220 --> 31:35.580
But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.

31:35.580 --> 31:41.020
Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though

31:41.020 --> 31:47.420
the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.

31:47.420 --> 31:51.700
In the magazine, it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.

31:51.700 --> 31:52.700
But...

31:52.700 --> 31:53.700
That was a typo.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.700
Yeah.

31:54.700 --> 31:57.460
They went back and Nintendo themselves said that.

31:57.460 --> 32:02.860
Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to

32:02.860 --> 32:08.900
be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released

32:08.900 --> 32:13.060
at launch in the UK, so you should have no problem getting that.

32:13.060 --> 32:18.000
You won't have to import that.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.300
That's pretty cool.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.780
I know there are some other secrets out there.

32:21.780 --> 32:26.220
I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us, you know, maybe some high def later on

32:26.220 --> 32:30.220
or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy wah-wah-wah, so I've given up.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.340
Who says they can't?

32:32.340 --> 32:36.980
Microsoft upgraded their display of output, so why not?

32:36.980 --> 32:38.700
They can do stuff.

32:38.700 --> 32:40.000
Because it's just not their thing.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.140
That's not their thing right now.

32:41.140 --> 32:45.420
Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher

32:45.420 --> 32:48.300
can say, I want to make my game 720, dammit!

32:48.300 --> 32:50.180
So I'm going to.

32:50.180 --> 32:51.180
We'll see.

32:51.180 --> 32:52.180
I don't know.

32:52.180 --> 32:57.340
So anyways, there's some other stuff released this week actually about the Virtual Console.

32:57.340 --> 33:02.700
Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.

33:02.700 --> 33:07.980
It's going to be interesting to find out actually that you'll be able to store your games to

33:07.980 --> 33:14.780
the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.

33:14.780 --> 33:19.740
You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, you know, being where

33:19.740 --> 33:22.980
you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your

33:22.980 --> 33:25.460
Mario Brothers there.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.820
You can, however, re-download your games.

33:28.820 --> 33:33.860
Kind of typical with like Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.

33:33.860 --> 33:36.940
And some interesting stuff they're talking about.

33:36.940 --> 33:44.460
How the Virtual Console stuff, you'll be able to use the standard Wii Remote actually for

33:44.460 --> 33:48.940
NES games by turning it outside, which, you know, ever since I saw that Wii Remote and

33:48.940 --> 33:51.980
they announced the Virtual Console, I knew they were going to be able to do that.

33:51.980 --> 33:57.020
And as well as using the GameCube pads, also if you don't want to spend money on the classic

33:57.020 --> 33:58.820
controller you can use that as well.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.140
So that's kind of neat.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.980
And yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

34:03.980 --> 34:08.380
That's all about the information that they have on that.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.380
Comments regarding high definition from our chat room.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.060
Pooeater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.

34:13.060 --> 34:19.340
I could give a crap less about 1,296,000,000 or P or whatever.

34:19.340 --> 34:21.780
No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.

34:21.780 --> 34:24.660
They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.

34:24.660 --> 34:25.660
So that's kind of neat.

34:25.660 --> 34:26.660
Oh, that is kind of neat.

34:26.660 --> 34:30.140
That's like the iTunes books you get.

34:30.140 --> 34:32.620
Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there

34:32.620 --> 34:37.460
something a while ago about how Nintendo like totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming

34:37.460 --> 34:38.460
type thing?

34:38.460 --> 34:41.900
I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.

34:41.900 --> 34:42.900
Was it Sony?

34:42.900 --> 34:43.900
I don't know.

34:43.900 --> 34:45.620
Did somebody want to use iTunes as a model?

34:45.620 --> 34:51.020
Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.

34:51.020 --> 34:53.300
My bad, I got it mixed up then.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.460
Well speaking of iTunes, perhaps some of the music you download from there will soon be

34:57.460 --> 34:58.540
playable on the Wii.

34:58.540 --> 35:04.060
Actually not really because iTunes uses the protected format, but there are stories going

35:04.060 --> 35:08.700
around the internet this week that the Wii will be supporting custom soundtracks.

35:08.700 --> 35:15.660
A screenshot popped up on Neo GAF forums and it's a screenshot from Excite Truck and it

35:15.660 --> 35:21.340
shows in the sound options menu that there is an SD card option in the menu and so it's

35:21.340 --> 35:27.620
being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as

35:27.620 --> 35:29.300
custom soundtracks in the game.

35:29.300 --> 35:34.480
No official word from Nintendo just yet, but the screenshot sure does make things look

35:34.480 --> 35:38.980
interesting and since Nintendo has said that there are still some secrets yet to be revealed,

35:38.980 --> 35:43.300
this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.300
Who knows?

35:44.300 --> 35:46.220
But that would be kind of neat.

35:46.220 --> 35:50.700
I like to use custom soundtracks on 360 unless I'm playing DDR or something, oh wait no just

35:50.700 --> 35:52.060
kidding I can't play DDR on 360.

35:52.060 --> 35:56.140
Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that because that kind of would break the

35:56.140 --> 36:02.300
game, but most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.

36:02.300 --> 36:08.820
Well speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of

36:08.820 --> 36:14.620
a character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Fox McCloud is showing up and from what I can

36:14.620 --> 36:20.460
tell I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.

36:20.460 --> 36:26.540
Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time

36:26.540 --> 36:29.300
zero suit.

36:29.300 --> 36:39.220
There's also Solid Snake and Wario, which I'm going to have that game so fast.

36:39.220 --> 36:43.420
I know it's kind of disappointing that they didn't announce something new, I mean we've

36:43.420 --> 36:44.740
had Fox before.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.460
Even in every single game.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.620
Yeah but I mean okay big deal, they gave him a staff this time so.

36:49.620 --> 36:50.620
Ooh staff.

36:50.620 --> 36:54.220
It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.

36:54.220 --> 36:56.180
Great so they gave us a crappy game Fox.

36:56.180 --> 37:02.940
Thank you for reminding us that they made that game, seriously.

37:02.940 --> 37:07.620
We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.

37:07.620 --> 37:11.020
We were hoping to, well I know you didn't plan it Jamie, but.

37:11.020 --> 37:17.500
I was like, I didn't think that story out, I want the game anyway, but I appreciate it.

37:17.500 --> 37:21.420
We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character, because

37:21.420 --> 37:23.900
they've said that there are going to be other third party characters in it.

37:23.900 --> 37:29.700
It's almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi, I didn't see

37:29.700 --> 37:30.700
that coming.

37:30.700 --> 37:34.740
No I want Raiden to be in it, that'd be funny.

37:34.740 --> 37:42.780
Our new secret character is, a defective NES cart where you have to blow on it.

37:42.780 --> 37:45.300
The new fighter is pantsless rage.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.020
Oh god, anyways.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.740
Moving on.

37:48.740 --> 37:53.260
So anyways some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week in fact in the form

37:53.260 --> 37:58.460
of an episode of South Park where Cartman is actually waiting for the Wii to come out

37:58.460 --> 38:06.820
at, it was quite funny, and was it like an E.L. or E.B., it's like an E.B. type story.

38:06.820 --> 38:07.820
It was E.V.

38:07.820 --> 38:09.820
E.V. whatever.

38:09.820 --> 38:16.660
So basically impatient, you know, like most of us, he ends up freezing himself to be able

38:16.660 --> 38:22.100
to be woken up later on in the future when the Wii is out, and unfortunately wakes up

38:22.100 --> 38:23.500
too late.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.500
And the hilarity ensues.

38:25.500 --> 38:30.580
But he wakes up in a land full of sea otter people, which was so freaking funny, I about

38:30.580 --> 38:31.580
cried.

38:31.580 --> 38:35.900
I about cried the last, I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal, like the last

38:35.900 --> 38:40.580
minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up, I about cried, it

38:40.580 --> 38:41.580
was so funny.

38:41.580 --> 38:47.980
This is making me laugh, G.S. 68 in the chat room says, new secret character Ken Kuraghi,

38:47.980 --> 38:48.980
he wields a crayon sword.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.480
He can't, he's going to eat it.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.700
Maybe Cartman's the secret character, who knows.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.700
That's the joke.

38:55.700 --> 39:00.300
It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because

39:00.300 --> 39:04.320
the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying

39:04.320 --> 39:07.820
that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's

39:07.820 --> 39:11.280
going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that will probably be the big joke.

39:11.280 --> 39:14.540
But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.

39:14.540 --> 39:18.340
But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but

39:18.340 --> 39:22.780
that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty

39:22.780 --> 39:26.180
funny.

39:26.180 --> 39:33.340
One of my favorite characters at Nintendo is Perrin Caplan, and the Game Informer magazine

39:33.340 --> 39:37.100
spoke to Perrin Caplan this week about something that I've been very curious about, the Wii

39:37.100 --> 39:42.100
component cables, because there are stories going around out there that the component

39:42.100 --> 39:46.580
cables you're only going to be able to order online, which kind of makes me sad, because

39:46.580 --> 39:52.220
I was never, even today, I was never able to find GameCube component cables for a reasonable

39:52.220 --> 39:53.220
price.

39:53.220 --> 39:56.900
So I never did get to try the GameCube on the HDTV, so I thought, oh, okay, well, what

39:56.900 --> 40:00.140
I'll do is I'll wait for the Wii, which is sure to have component cables, because this

40:00.140 --> 40:03.860
is the next gen of gaming after all, and then I'll get to play all those old GameCube games

40:03.860 --> 40:05.500
on the component cables.

40:05.500 --> 40:10.280
But then the rumors came out that you're only going to be able to get them online, but Perrin

40:10.280 --> 40:15.180
Caplan to the rescue, she, in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will

40:15.180 --> 40:19.860
component cables be available on day one, Caplan said yes, at retail and online, Best

40:19.860 --> 40:25.980
Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com, if you still want to go the online route.

40:25.980 --> 40:30.820
Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing

40:30.820 --> 40:31.820
to lattes.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.900
I didn't get that, but whatever.

40:33.900 --> 40:38.940
I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.

40:38.940 --> 40:41.820
That makes me very happy.

40:41.820 --> 40:42.820
She's insane.

40:42.820 --> 40:44.820
Does that make you a happy panda?

40:44.820 --> 40:47.940
She's a crazy, crazy person.

40:47.940 --> 40:48.940
Anyways.

40:48.940 --> 40:51.380
What the hell was that?

40:51.380 --> 40:57.540
It was no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.

40:57.540 --> 41:00.580
It's like, I love Gnarls Barkley as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing

41:00.580 --> 41:03.180
that damn song every time I open up my AIM.

41:03.180 --> 41:05.700
You must not like them very much, because I don't like them.

41:05.700 --> 41:09.780
No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.

41:09.780 --> 41:11.540
I like Danger Mouse.

41:11.540 --> 41:17.820
Um, speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play

41:17.820 --> 41:24.620
sounds when you don't expect it to, um, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.

41:24.620 --> 41:25.620
Frightening Frightening.

41:25.620 --> 41:26.620
Cool!

41:26.620 --> 41:27.620
Silent Hill 5?

41:27.620 --> 41:28.620
Finally?

41:28.620 --> 41:29.620
Confirmation?

41:29.620 --> 41:30.620
Serior!

41:30.620 --> 41:31.620
What?

41:31.620 --> 41:36.420
It's called, um, Otonarioku, which means adult power.

41:36.420 --> 41:37.420
Adult power, huh?

41:37.420 --> 41:39.260
So is this one of like, those games, where it's a little-

41:39.260 --> 41:44.660
It's a self-help guide to improving relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.

41:44.660 --> 41:45.660
Boring!

41:45.660 --> 41:53.900
But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin', I don't have, it's gonna

41:53.900 --> 41:54.900
sell like-

41:54.900 --> 41:56.700
Not in this country.

41:56.700 --> 41:57.700
In Japan.

41:57.700 --> 42:02.700
And like, five people will import it and go, I CAN'T READ JAPANESE!

42:02.700 --> 42:06.020
Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?

42:06.020 --> 42:08.180
Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.

42:08.180 --> 42:14.340
Oh, kind of like how like, he feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him

42:14.340 --> 42:18.700
straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know,

42:18.700 --> 42:22.220
like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.

42:22.220 --> 42:24.100
I don't- what the hell do you do in adult training?

42:24.100 --> 42:29.220
No, I think that it'll do like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, SIRENS GO OFF!

42:29.220 --> 42:31.220
THE WORLD GETS DARK!

42:31.220 --> 42:35.900
Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends, I mean, I don't- what exactly

42:35.900 --> 42:39.220
is, uh, gonna be trained in this game?

42:39.220 --> 42:44.620
Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's

42:44.620 --> 42:49.100
accidental, oops I crapped my pants.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.420
So that's not a good comparison.

42:50.420 --> 42:51.420
Nonsense.

42:51.420 --> 42:52.580
Although the thought of crapping one's pants is-

42:52.580 --> 42:53.580
It's all about control.

42:53.580 --> 42:56.380
Although the thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.

42:56.380 --> 43:00.580
Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult- never mind, forget it.

43:00.580 --> 43:03.340
No, it was, I was gonna, it was Saturday Night Live.

43:03.340 --> 43:04.900
Oops, I crapped my pants.

43:04.900 --> 43:05.900
Never mind, forget it.

43:05.900 --> 43:08.140
But, I don't know.

43:08.140 --> 43:13.140
I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for, um, like, elementary school kids.

43:13.140 --> 43:18.500
So, you know, in America, so that everyone gets good manners.

43:18.500 --> 43:22.220
Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.

43:22.220 --> 43:23.220
You know what?

43:23.220 --> 43:25.260
I have really good freakin' manners, okay?

43:25.260 --> 43:27.580
I am so polite.

43:27.580 --> 43:32.900
I hold the doors open for people, I smile, and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when

43:32.900 --> 43:33.900
I think they're being retards.

43:33.900 --> 43:36.900
You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.

43:36.900 --> 43:37.900
I did!

43:37.900 --> 43:38.900
See, I'm nice!

43:38.900 --> 43:39.900
Aren't I nice?

43:39.900 --> 43:40.900
I am the nicest person.

43:40.900 --> 43:44.140
Of course, she was trying to redeem herself with- no, I'm just kidding.

43:44.140 --> 43:45.140
No.

43:45.140 --> 43:46.140
And I bought snickerdoodles.

43:46.140 --> 43:48.740
Alright, back to games, back to games.

43:48.740 --> 43:49.740
We're getting crazy off-topic.

43:49.740 --> 43:55.660
Sorry, I was caught up in your guys' argument there.

43:55.660 --> 43:59.900
And suddenly it was turning into the Jenny Jones show, suddenly.

43:59.900 --> 44:05.700
Anyways, so, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what

44:05.700 --> 44:10.340
is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?

44:10.340 --> 44:12.460
Everything possible.

44:12.460 --> 44:19.620
They are shipping it by any means possible, planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name

44:19.620 --> 44:20.620
it.

44:20.620 --> 44:21.620
Horseback?

44:21.620 --> 44:22.620
Yes.

44:22.620 --> 44:26.700
Little immigrants, too, pulling the crates, you know.

44:26.700 --> 44:32.820
Yeah, so any means necessary, not a huge surprise, but it's nice to, you know, be reassured

44:32.820 --> 44:39.140
that they are doing everything in their- that they possibly could do, so.

44:39.140 --> 44:40.140
Excellent.

44:40.140 --> 44:44.140
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce somebody who's walked in, I said would be

44:44.140 --> 44:45.140
on the show a little later.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.140
Say hello to Miklotov.

44:46.140 --> 44:47.140
Hello.

44:47.140 --> 44:51.820
Now, Miklotov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit, because you have

44:51.820 --> 44:57.420
certain fears on the- certain fears you've expressed to me before, so how do you feel

44:57.420 --> 45:01.380
if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?

45:01.380 --> 45:04.500
I would cry, because I hate UPS.

45:04.500 --> 45:08.860
But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS, you've told me you have a fear of UPS.

45:08.860 --> 45:09.860
It's a little bit of both.

45:09.860 --> 45:11.400
It's all from high school.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.400
Tell us your fears, firstly.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
Okay, my fears?

45:13.400 --> 45:14.400
Uh-huh.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.400
Okay, UPS?

45:15.400 --> 45:16.400
Yeah.

45:16.400 --> 45:17.400
Water?

45:17.400 --> 45:18.400
Yeah.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.400
Sheep?

45:19.400 --> 45:20.400
Uh-huh.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.400
Flying bugs.

45:21.400 --> 45:28.540
If you had ever delivered you, like, a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.

45:28.540 --> 45:30.100
I would probably just die on the spot.

45:30.100 --> 45:31.100
That's like Silent Hill to you.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.820
Okay, so why the UPS fear?

45:32.820 --> 45:34.660
That has nothing to do with video games.

45:34.660 --> 45:36.380
No, but I'm curious.

45:36.380 --> 45:41.660
That's just like, when I was in high school, my bus stop was next to the UPS center, and

45:41.660 --> 45:44.340
I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were-

45:44.340 --> 45:45.340
You're really weird now!

45:45.340 --> 45:46.340
High school?

45:46.340 --> 45:47.500
Yeah, whatever.

45:47.500 --> 45:54.900
I figured they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.

45:54.900 --> 45:56.780
You don't get much more stupid than I have.

45:56.780 --> 45:57.780
What would that be?

45:57.780 --> 45:59.780
Universal Pwnage Service?

45:59.780 --> 46:00.780
I don't know.

46:00.780 --> 46:04.420
I just hate them, and they frighten me.

46:04.420 --> 46:07.420
I thought maybe, like, a UPS man beat you up once or something.

46:07.420 --> 46:12.020
No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop, watching all the trucks go by, and the

46:12.020 --> 46:16.140
best part was, it was apparently next to a UPS center, and I didn't know that, but I

46:16.140 --> 46:17.140
still figured-

46:17.140 --> 46:19.460
Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.

46:19.460 --> 46:20.460
Show me on the doll.

46:20.460 --> 46:21.460
Nowhere.

46:21.460 --> 46:26.660
I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.820
Usiagi in our chat room agrees, UPS is the spawn of Satan.

46:29.820 --> 46:31.820
I've never had a problem with UPS.

46:31.820 --> 46:32.820
I hate them.

46:32.820 --> 46:35.620
In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.

46:35.620 --> 46:36.620
No such thing.

46:36.620 --> 46:37.620
No, I-

46:37.620 --> 46:38.620
You know what?

46:38.620 --> 46:39.620
If they're attracted-

46:39.620 --> 46:40.620
At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

46:40.620 --> 46:41.620
This is years before my current job.

46:41.620 --> 46:45.420
I used to have to sign for UPS all the time, and, you know, sometimes that's the highlight

46:45.420 --> 46:46.420
of the day.

46:46.420 --> 46:47.420
It's really evil.

46:47.420 --> 46:48.420
All right.

46:48.420 --> 46:52.340
Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.

46:52.340 --> 46:53.340
That's what I said.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.780
Well, you know, if people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games

46:56.780 --> 47:02.180
and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can

47:02.180 --> 47:03.300
listen to.

47:03.300 --> 47:07.180
Where would you listen to, you know, fears about insects and sheep and water?

47:07.180 --> 47:08.180
Exactly.

47:08.180 --> 47:14.140
You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to

47:14.140 --> 47:15.140
do with gaming.

47:15.140 --> 47:19.620
Jamie, you're going to make me cry, and when I cry I get stabby.

47:19.620 --> 47:21.780
I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.

47:21.780 --> 47:22.780
You know what?

47:22.780 --> 47:23.780
They're close enough.

47:23.780 --> 47:25.140
Do goats scare you?

47:25.140 --> 47:26.140
You know what?

47:26.140 --> 47:27.140
I haven't been-

47:27.140 --> 47:28.140
What about llamas?

47:28.140 --> 47:29.140
Llamas, no.

47:29.140 --> 47:30.140
Okay.

47:30.140 --> 47:31.140
No, I'm really ready to get back in the game, though.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.140
Llamas have to do with tempests, so there you go.

47:33.140 --> 47:35.220
Where were llamas and tempests?

47:35.220 --> 47:37.820
Isn't that one guy that makes tempests something to do with a llama?

47:37.820 --> 47:40.300
Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here so we can get back-

47:40.300 --> 47:41.300
Wait, no, I have a-

47:41.300 --> 47:44.580
How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?

47:44.580 --> 47:46.660
I feel that they deserve to buy things.

47:46.660 --> 47:47.900
Well, guess what?

47:47.900 --> 47:53.800
They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.

47:53.800 --> 47:56.540
It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.540
No, no, no.

47:57.540 --> 48:02.260
Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying

48:02.260 --> 48:03.620
the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

48:03.620 --> 48:07.920
If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.

48:07.920 --> 48:09.700
Best Buy employees aren't shut out.

48:09.700 --> 48:12.020
Well, I guess they're not shut out.

48:12.020 --> 48:14.100
Don't they have to act like regular customers or whatever?

48:14.100 --> 48:15.260
Yeah, they get no preferential treats.

48:15.260 --> 48:19.820
Well, the word is that actually Circuit City and CompUSA can't even get them.

48:19.820 --> 48:22.980
So if you work for Circuit City, you just have to go to CompUSA, and if you work for

48:22.980 --> 48:23.980
CompUSA, you go to Circuit City.

48:23.980 --> 48:27.380
That's what you get for working for a second-rate retailer.

48:27.380 --> 48:29.220
What's your problem with Circuit City and CompUSA?

48:29.220 --> 48:31.180
They never have anything I want.

48:31.180 --> 48:33.060
You know why I like Circuit City?

48:33.060 --> 48:36.800
I don't know about your town, guys, but in this town, fucking no one shops at Circuit

48:36.800 --> 48:37.800
City.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.180
It's always empty.

48:39.180 --> 48:41.100
No matter when I go there, there is nobody there.

48:41.100 --> 48:42.900
I can't believe the chain didn't go under.

48:42.900 --> 48:44.700
They went under where I'm from.

48:44.700 --> 48:45.700
Really?

48:45.700 --> 48:46.700
I'm surprised they haven't.

48:46.700 --> 48:47.700
They have expanded here.

48:47.700 --> 48:51.380
They took over, like the good guys all went under, and they took over the old building

48:51.380 --> 48:55.780
that they were in, and yeah, I can't believe they're expanding because no one is ever in

48:55.780 --> 48:56.780
Circuit City.

48:56.780 --> 49:02.180
In fact, that's probably where I'd go get my PlayStation 3 is Circuit City.

49:02.180 --> 49:03.180
Or Kmart.

49:03.180 --> 49:07.900
I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart, and with good reason, but Kmart, I'm telling

49:07.900 --> 49:10.980
you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.

49:10.980 --> 49:11.980
You know what?

49:11.980 --> 49:15.260
I'd camp out for a PlayStation 3.

49:15.260 --> 49:17.060
I don't either, because I'm not getting one.

49:17.060 --> 49:18.620
Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.

49:18.620 --> 49:23.140
Well, you want to know what's funny, that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually

49:23.140 --> 49:27.860
getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else, because our

49:27.860 --> 49:29.020
credit card was special.

49:29.020 --> 49:30.660
But speaking of special...

49:30.660 --> 49:37.780
Actually, I wanted to say real quick, Neologism, I totally mispronounced his name, 82, says

49:37.780 --> 49:40.860
Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.

49:40.860 --> 49:43.980
Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.

49:43.980 --> 49:45.060
So what does it matter?

49:45.060 --> 49:48.620
But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.

49:48.620 --> 49:50.380
Damn it.

49:50.380 --> 49:51.380
You open your mouth.

49:51.380 --> 49:54.460
If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.

49:54.460 --> 49:55.980
I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.

49:55.980 --> 49:56.980
You better back the F away.

49:56.980 --> 49:58.780
I'm going to the one on How.

49:58.780 --> 50:00.780
Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.

50:00.780 --> 50:04.660
Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.

50:04.660 --> 50:05.660
Never mind.

50:05.660 --> 50:06.660
Forget it.

50:06.660 --> 50:07.660
No, that was actually...

50:07.660 --> 50:08.660
I was like, oh, Rob's being clever.

50:08.660 --> 50:09.660
Don't listen to me.

50:09.660 --> 50:10.660
Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.

50:10.660 --> 50:12.940
Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on...

50:12.940 --> 50:16.720
They're still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?

50:16.720 --> 50:18.260
That's the one I'm going to, yes.

50:18.260 --> 50:19.260
That's the ticket.

50:19.260 --> 50:20.260
Go there.

50:20.260 --> 50:21.260
Okay.

50:21.260 --> 50:22.260
No, it's not on Antelope.

50:22.260 --> 50:23.260
It's Auburn.

50:23.260 --> 50:24.260
Whatever.

50:24.260 --> 50:25.260
Whatever.

50:25.260 --> 50:26.260
Anyway.

50:26.260 --> 50:27.260
Yeah.

50:27.260 --> 50:28.260
Here's your Sacramento direction thing.

50:28.260 --> 50:29.260
Okay.

50:29.260 --> 50:33.820
Well, back to the PS3.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.660
I hate you, Best Buy.

50:35.660 --> 50:36.660
You bitches.

50:36.660 --> 50:37.660
Okay.

50:37.660 --> 50:38.660
I really don't...

50:38.660 --> 50:39.660
I don't hate any...

50:39.660 --> 50:40.660
Let me rephrase that.

50:40.660 --> 50:43.460
I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.

50:43.460 --> 50:46.740
I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.

50:46.740 --> 50:52.420
18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3, and they're not doing

50:52.420 --> 50:54.020
anything for the Wii.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.020
You know why?

50:55.020 --> 50:59.500
Because Nintendo loves us, and they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.860
So there are 18 stores total.

51:02.860 --> 51:04.780
It's going to be in these cities.

51:04.780 --> 51:10.620
Park Lane, Texas, West Los Angeles, California, Chesterfield...

51:10.620 --> 51:11.620
Is that...

51:11.620 --> 51:12.620
Is M.O.

51:12.620 --> 51:13.620
Montana?

51:13.620 --> 51:14.620
Yeah.

51:14.620 --> 51:15.620
No.

51:15.620 --> 51:16.620
M.O. is Missouri.

51:16.620 --> 51:17.620
Missouri.

51:17.620 --> 51:18.620
I don't know why I thought that.

51:18.620 --> 51:25.100
El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria,

51:25.100 --> 51:27.860
Texas, Butterfield, Ro...

51:27.860 --> 51:28.860
What's the...

51:28.860 --> 51:29.860
Okay.

51:29.860 --> 51:30.860
Anyway.

51:30.860 --> 51:31.860
Illinois.

51:31.860 --> 51:33.340
I'm a little tongue-tied today.

51:33.340 --> 51:38.940
West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South

51:38.940 --> 51:48.260
Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York, Landmark, Massachusetts, and Midtown,

51:48.260 --> 51:49.260
Manhattan.

51:49.260 --> 51:50.260
Seriously, kids?

51:50.260 --> 51:51.260
Why bother, though?

51:51.260 --> 51:52.260
Why bother?

51:52.260 --> 51:58.660
Because some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games

51:58.660 --> 52:03.380
all day long, that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can't get

52:03.380 --> 52:06.960
Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.

52:06.960 --> 52:08.460
So you're screwed.

52:08.460 --> 52:09.460
So why bother?

52:09.460 --> 52:13.220
I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing

52:13.220 --> 52:15.420
it, people are going to be driving in from far away.

52:15.420 --> 52:16.660
Somebody is going to beat you to it.

52:16.660 --> 52:19.780
So I say why bother?

52:19.780 --> 52:27.060
If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.060
Just go to any big blog you look at.

52:29.060 --> 52:30.060
They all have the list.

52:30.060 --> 52:36.540
For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.

52:36.540 --> 52:38.540
So yeah.

52:38.540 --> 52:39.540
All right.

52:39.540 --> 52:40.540
Have fun waiting in line.

52:40.540 --> 52:41.980
Now, I don't know.

52:41.980 --> 52:45.220
Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big

52:45.220 --> 52:49.500
blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid like, oh, I'm waiting for a place to drink.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.500
If I can make fun of them.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.780
Do we really got to do that?

52:51.780 --> 52:54.160
I mean, seriously, everybody else does that.

52:54.160 --> 53:00.820
It's just like reporting on the fucking groundhog and seeing his shadow or not, I mean, that's

53:00.820 --> 53:01.820
just retarded.

53:01.820 --> 53:04.380
Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone

53:04.380 --> 53:05.380
to steal it.

53:05.380 --> 53:06.620
I have a good idea for a parody.

53:06.620 --> 53:13.780
Also, to answer questions from the chat room, the Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is 609

53:13.780 --> 53:19.260
and the Midtown one is 1028 so that you can look online and see what stores those are.

53:19.260 --> 53:20.780
I don't know.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.220
I just whispered my parody to Loki.

53:22.220 --> 53:23.220
You like that?

53:23.220 --> 53:24.220
I don't like that.

53:24.220 --> 53:25.220
Okay, we're going to do that instead.

53:25.220 --> 53:26.220
Okay.

53:26.220 --> 53:27.220
All right.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.220
All right.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.220
So, good luck.

53:29.220 --> 53:30.220
All right.

53:30.220 --> 53:34.220
I totally missed it because I was doing my job.

53:34.220 --> 53:40.460
Anyways, there's some interesting things and, you know, Japan might be waiting a little

53:40.460 --> 53:46.220
longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another

53:46.220 --> 53:52.820
one fifth of their initial launch PS3s instead of getting 100,000 units at launch.

53:52.820 --> 53:58.340
They're going to be getting closer to 80,000 and that kind of sucks.

53:58.340 --> 54:03.020
Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United

54:03.020 --> 54:04.020
States.

54:04.020 --> 54:13.600
So, yeah, well, kind of same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week so, yeah.

54:13.600 --> 54:14.740
Sucks to be them.

54:14.740 --> 54:19.060
Sucks to be UK even more though because they have to wait until March.

54:19.060 --> 54:22.820
Well, sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City because that's the only place

54:22.820 --> 54:26.780
right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing

54:26.780 --> 54:27.780
this.

54:27.780 --> 54:31.740
I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America and we'll hit a store near you soon

54:31.740 --> 54:34.860
enough, but this week it hit YouTube.

54:34.860 --> 54:39.180
There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York

54:39.180 --> 54:42.680
City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.500
It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.

54:44.500 --> 54:47.140
I freaking missed the Wii's in Nintendo World by a week.

54:47.140 --> 54:51.780
I missed this by a week and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.

54:51.780 --> 54:52.780
I can't plan for shit.

54:52.780 --> 54:54.620
I hate my life.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.900
But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming

54:57.900 --> 54:58.900
blogs.

54:58.900 --> 55:02.460
And if this is showing up at the Times Square, Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of

55:02.460 --> 55:04.620
time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.

55:04.620 --> 55:07.980
So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.

55:07.980 --> 55:11.520
Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.

55:11.520 --> 55:16.140
Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.

55:16.140 --> 55:19.100
My informed decision is poo.

55:19.100 --> 55:23.540
Disney is having a cow.

55:23.540 --> 55:27.740
They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.

55:27.740 --> 55:34.980
Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.

55:34.980 --> 55:43.480
In fact, if you get the new release for Kingdom Hearts 2 that's got all the extra goodies,

55:43.480 --> 55:46.460
it's going to give you a little bit of a hint into the third one.

55:46.460 --> 55:51.740
But to quote Nomura on this issue, we've already been approached by the Disney side saying

55:51.740 --> 55:53.060
they want us to make it.

55:53.060 --> 55:57.060
What I can say at this time is that we have various ideas, but we're not at the point

55:57.060 --> 55:58.500
where we can say that.

55:58.500 --> 56:00.340
It's physically impossible at the present.

56:00.340 --> 56:04.220
I feel that it's not the right time to talk about the future of Kingdom Hearts.

56:04.220 --> 56:08.020
So sorry, hold off, wait.

56:08.020 --> 56:09.500
I don't want it right now, though.

56:09.500 --> 56:14.940
Now hold on, you just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out

56:14.940 --> 56:17.500
you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl, eeee!

56:17.500 --> 56:22.140
No, it won't be PS3 fangirl, it'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.

56:22.140 --> 56:26.180
I do not care what the platform is, if it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to

56:26.180 --> 56:27.800
play the game I want to play.

56:27.800 --> 56:33.340
It's not the system that is good, it is the game that is good, that maximizes how well

56:33.340 --> 56:34.700
it uses the system.

56:34.700 --> 56:35.700
This is true.

56:35.700 --> 56:36.700
The system is the tool.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.940
And so far no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.

56:39.940 --> 56:43.100
Well my only problem with PlayStation 3, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier,

56:43.100 --> 56:46.740
I think a year from now PlayStation 3 will be just fine, but right now at launch there

56:46.740 --> 56:47.740
is zero.

56:47.740 --> 56:48.740
Zip.

56:48.740 --> 56:49.740
Nada.

56:49.740 --> 56:50.740
Nothing I want.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.640
Because half the launch games you can get, more than half you can get on another system.

56:53.640 --> 56:58.020
And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh, meh.

56:58.020 --> 57:02.640
But you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this in Final Fantasy 13, and

57:02.640 --> 57:06.380
yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year, but right now I

57:06.380 --> 57:11.220
see no need to do this crazy campout crap, there's just no need.

57:11.220 --> 57:15.260
And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the

57:15.260 --> 57:19.340
need to get to PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or

57:19.340 --> 57:20.340
whatever.

57:20.340 --> 57:21.340
Fuck that.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.340
Fuck that.

57:22.340 --> 57:24.340
I've kind of gone that route anyways.

57:24.340 --> 57:28.780
It's too expensive and it's, I mean, what, Motorstorm's kind of the only thing I'm looking

57:28.780 --> 57:29.780
forward to on that.

57:29.780 --> 57:35.040
I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this, we're just gamers like you,

57:35.040 --> 57:39.860
so you know what, if the realist is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the

57:39.860 --> 57:41.540
listeners will forgive us a little bit.

57:41.540 --> 57:43.420
Oh yeah, yeah, Jamie gets, you're special.

57:43.420 --> 57:46.220
Well no, no, no, I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.

57:46.220 --> 57:50.340
Alright, so you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.

57:50.340 --> 57:52.340
Doesn't he have to play it?

57:52.340 --> 57:53.340
Yep.

57:53.340 --> 57:54.340
Lord help us all.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.340
God damn it.

57:55.340 --> 57:57.060
Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.

57:57.060 --> 58:00.900
So I played Sonic, it's crap.

58:00.900 --> 58:04.780
I played Gran Turismo, it's crap.

58:04.780 --> 58:09.340
We'll see, we'll see.

58:09.340 --> 58:13.180
Shadowslayer would like to point out, they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts

58:13.180 --> 58:14.180
3 is for yet.

58:14.180 --> 58:16.940
We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really

58:16.940 --> 58:19.020
said exactly which platform it's going to be.

58:19.020 --> 58:21.180
That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.

58:21.180 --> 58:24.340
JVmon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.

58:24.340 --> 58:25.340
I agree.

58:25.340 --> 58:29.300
Oh my god, what, no, it'd be what, Hawaii World?

58:29.300 --> 58:32.340
Well, whatever.

58:32.340 --> 58:39.280
Anyways, so speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.280
So soon.

58:40.280 --> 58:45.740
But, Castlevania, the film's in the works right now, and unfortunately it's being directed

58:45.740 --> 58:55.960
by Paul W.S. Anderson, who has made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes

58:55.960 --> 59:03.200
the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.820
So is he going to take a big hit?

59:04.820 --> 59:06.900
There's two winners to be influenced by.

59:06.900 --> 59:07.980
Actually Blade's kind of cool.

59:07.980 --> 59:11.300
I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic

59:11.300 --> 59:17.340
vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.

59:17.340 --> 59:19.180
So like Van Helsing.

59:19.180 --> 59:21.900
Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably...

59:21.900 --> 59:23.980
That was a waste of a movie.

59:23.980 --> 59:29.060
I don't know, he's, okay, let me put it this way, in the spectrum of video game movies,

59:29.060 --> 59:30.220
he's not the bottom.

59:30.220 --> 59:31.220
So that's good.

59:31.220 --> 59:34.980
I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.

59:34.980 --> 59:39.300
Resident Evil, a lot of fans of that, Resident Evil, eh, not so great, I mean, Mortal Kombat

59:39.300 --> 59:42.940
was cheesy, but you know, whatever, it was effective, it got the job done.

59:42.940 --> 59:48.400
So I trust this guy more than I do a certain other name, director, three letters, starts

59:48.400 --> 59:54.180
with U, ends in W. Now, now, his next movie though, I'm sorry, I will see that movie.

59:54.180 --> 59:56.180
That is a movie that will appeal to me.

59:56.180 --> 59:58.480
Anyway, will this movie appeal to you?

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.100
It's a new Street Fighter movie.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:06.220
Yes, that is a sequel to the 1994 Street Fighter movie, which has Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.980
Julia, and all that stuff.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.940
Yes, they're making another Street Fighter movie.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:10.940
What?

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.740
Will it have Kylie Minogue in it?

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740
Probably not.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.100
Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.260
Now she has a career again.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:22.980
It's just another Street Fighter movie, but this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.140
So maybe they'll get Min-Na Wen back, I don't know.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:26.140
She still on ER?

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.140
She was a cute Chun-Li.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:29.020
She was a cute Chun-Li, so maybe she'll come back, I don't know.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.020
Is she too old now?

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.020
I don't know.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.020
It's been a few years.

01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.020
I don't see why she would.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.020
She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.020
I don't watch TV.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.020
There you go.

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:38.580
Miklotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do it.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.020
All they're going to do is try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:46.460
No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Time, Zhang Jie, or whatever her name is.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460
Zhang Jie?

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460
Yes, her.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:54.400
She'd be cool, actually, because she looks way too innocent.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.900
But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news, because, you know, it's Hyde

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.000
Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this, apparently

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.240
in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.380
They want to get this movie out in time for.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:09.180
They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:13.580
Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:20.820
We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with a hadoken.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.420
We'll see what happens.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:28.500
Let's see, GS68 says, new Street Fighter movie, do not want.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.140
And Justin says, hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:36.300
You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300
What?

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.300
That was Raul Julia's last role.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:39.300
Yeah, it was kind of sad.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:44.900
It's like, he's going to die with that being his last movie.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:50.060
But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards, and I think the HBO

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.060
movie may have technically been.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.380
Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380
thing.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:59.700
So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.700
last movie.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.580
I do have to say, he did make a good bison.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.380
He made a great Gomez Adams.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380
Oh, yeah.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380
I'll always remember him for it.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.380
Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.380
Eh, never saw it.

01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.380
All right, anyway.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:16.960
Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Adams family, but has everything

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.540
to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:25.380
Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.

01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:34.940
Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:41.900
They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3, well, for

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:48.060
the Halo movie, I'm sorry, and so they're just, all we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:55.420
They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.420
it.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.420
All right.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:59.980
Well, that's too bad, but I guess, you know.

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:07.660
Which is stupid, because there's been a market for, you know, these types of sci-fi fantasy.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.700
Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made by Halo camp, but I'll

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.420
bet you that the problem is you've got Peter Jackson attached, and they probably want a

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.900
budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie's going to cost to make.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.900
And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses, and

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.840
there's no short dresses in Halo.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.260
Going back to the Chun-Li movie for a minute, I want to mention from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.240
Hit Sun says, where did the Street Fighter hype come from?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.500
In the past five years, Capcom has made one original Street Fighter character.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:40.980
True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox Live release of Street Fighter.

01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:43.860
I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:49.220
Remember we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day, somebody was posting, where's Street

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.220
Fighter?

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.220
We want Street Fighter!

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.680
And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.480
and then it was like, where's Luminous?

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:57.480
Where's Luminous?

01:03:57.480 --> 01:03:58.860
Where's Mortal Kombat 3?

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.140
Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:05.500
I do have to say, though, that Charon in chat is my hero right now for freaking bringing

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.700
up the Ghost Rider movie, because I'm going to be there.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.380
Why don't we get a game based on that movie?

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.320
We are, and it sucked.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.780
It was like one of the worst games I played at E3, it was awful.

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:16.780
Really?

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.940
Well, no, I'm not counting that one, I mean a good one.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:25.980
Yeah, the one at E3 was poopy, unless they went back and did some major re-edits to it,

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.740
don't bother with the Ghost Rider game.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:33.460
Actually, you know, it came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in...

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.460
What was that game?

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.980
The motorcycle game with the chain?

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:36.980
Road Rash.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.620
It was Road Rash, was the game.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.300
I don't know why I like Road Rash.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.820
No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.820
Really exciting.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.820
Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:54.860
Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GameProExpo, is it the new E3?

01:04:54.860 --> 01:05:01.000
Maybe, but they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the big show event that

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.140
was E3, and it will be in the same location as well.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:14.520
Of course, they're expecting on about 30,000 attendees, no word yet though that I've seen

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:21.220
whether this is going to be General Mission or Industry Only, which if it's General Mission,

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.740
that's going to not be 30,000 people.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:27.620
Well, but maybe they're thinking because it's a new show that won't have the name behind

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.860
it, people aren't going to be wanting to go to this, but it's all about what names they

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860
can attract.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.940
They can get big boosts for Nintendo and Microsoft the size of E3's boost.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:42.540
I think that a show like this would be lucrative to the designers because by October, their

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.860
Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.180
to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having the build in April.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:59.500
They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.980
It's not really any extra work that they have to do.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.060
They're saying that it's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.900
Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well like tournaments and that sort

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.500
of thing.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.820
That's what makes me think it's General Mission because why would you do Industry Only tournaments?

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:17.820
That kind of defeats the purpose.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:25.260
It's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.260
It's just LA.

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.260
I'll probably go.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.260
It sounds kind of exciting.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:33.540
Hopefully we're able to get in.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:38.940
Hopefully it's not by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be,

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:39.940
but we'll see.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:40.940
We'll see.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:41.940
All right.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.620
Well, that's it for the news here in this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:49.340
We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more of Orange Lounge

01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.340
Radio.

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.100
For those of you guys listening live, we're going to do a music break here shortly.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:57.160
For those of you guys listening to us on the audio download, we will be back in a couple

01:06:57.160 --> 01:07:02.900
of days because we split it up into Part A and Part B, and we'll be back after this.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.300
