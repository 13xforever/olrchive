0	20260	Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for
20260	33040	Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and our HD movies coming to the Xbox marketplace.
33040	37320	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge
37320	38320	Radio.
38320	42880	We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming,
42880	46200	the gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle, so on and so on.
46200	49200	We've been here for the past four and a half years serving you.
49200	50200	My name is Rob Roberts.
50200	51200	You might know me as Sky.
51200	55460	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
55460	57920	I got a snake, Meng.
57920	58920	Maybe she's not so lovely, actually.
58920	60920	Last night I fed my snake some beer.
60920	63560	I was slithering this way and that.
63560	69680	Come to think of it, she's rather vulgar, actually, and kind of offensive.
69680	70680	You redid the hair, though.
70680	71680	I like this new hairstyle.
71680	73480	Yeah, my hair is pretty now.
73480	77080	We need the new promo pics for OLR because you have way different hair now and I've got
77080	78080	the facial hair.
78080	83680	The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very
83680	84680	curly.
84680	89360	Now I straighten my hair and it's cherry red and black.
89360	94240	I'll tell you what, chat room, I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone
94240	95240	earlier.
95240	97160	I'm great for being vulgar and offensive.
97160	98160	All right.
98160	101160	Speaking of vulgar and offensive, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
101160	102160	Hello.
102160	104160	How you doing, Loki?
104160	105160	I'm okay.
105160	106160	Yeah?
106160	107400	No new hairstyle for you, though.
107400	108800	You still look the same as always.
108800	109800	Yes.
109800	110800	Yeah.
110800	111800	But I do notice you're wearing a gaming-related shirt today.
111800	114360	Where did you come across this?
114360	115840	From work, actually.
115840	117800	Got it from Eidos.
117800	121760	It's a shirt for just cause.
121760	124320	Remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange on Australia for the first time,
124320	128640	because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XB Stream.
128640	132760	We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program and through iTunes
132760	134060	we're always getting new people.
134060	136980	Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because
136980	137980	of it.
137980	143320	I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact
143320	148920	with big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot.
148920	156240	So yeah, every now and then we do this annual kind of sales conferencing with the game publishers
156240	158420	and they bring us free stuff.
158420	159420	Not so much this year, though.
159420	161080	They didn't bring us as much free stuff.
161080	162400	But I did get a shirt from...
162400	163400	Poor baby.
163400	164400	Yeah.
164400	171220	I got a shirt from Eidos, so for just cause, and Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda
171220	173920	shirt or a communist propaganda shirt.
173920	175240	That's what it looks like.
175240	176240	It's an interesting shirt.
176240	180600	I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.
180600	181600	I don't know.
181600	182600	Maybe it's just me.
182600	183600	I'm just crazy.
183600	184600	All right.
184600	187880	Anyway, in all seriousness, we have no guest right now.
187880	192580	I think Miklotov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show
192580	195040	people that hang out here at the apartment.
195040	197480	But we do have our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com.
197480	198480	Click on chat.
198480	202320	Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar
202320	203320	and offensive.
203320	205400	I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.
205400	206400	So they love it.
206400	212460	Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.
212460	214720	And so you will see it in a few.
214720	215720	All right.
215720	216720	Sounds good.
216720	221160	Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have
221160	224620	some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.
224620	227360	But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.
227360	228360	We always do.
228360	230640	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
230640	233000	My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.
233000	238440	I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.
238440	242560	I did get new games today.
242560	243560	I got...
243560	247800	What was the name of that game again?
247800	252360	No, I can't believe I forgot the name of it already.
252360	253360	Oh, yeah.
253360	261080	Trauma Center Under the Knife, so that I can cut into people and be the Uber surgeon.
261080	268120	And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have
268120	275960	the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.
275960	276960	Very cool.
276960	277960	That's a lot of money.
277960	278960	I didn't buy the collector art book.
278960	285160	We went to a GameStop in San Jose, and she's like, go look in the back and price this game
285160	286160	for me.
286160	287160	Okay, but you can just...
287160	289160	Go in the back!
289160	290160	Okay.
290160	296200	So I look back, and she's huddled over the counter, and I'm like, oh shit.
296200	300720	Because I know when she tells somebody to go look at something, and then starts huddling
300720	303120	over the counter, that I'm in trouble.
303120	309000	So I get back, because she picked up my Trauma Center at the time, which I need to sort of
309000	316920	pay her back for it, but she hands me the bag, and it's heavy, and I'm like, what?
316920	319080	And then she starts running out the door, I'm like, oh my god.
319080	322880	So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.
322880	323880	Hot.
323880	325480	Okay, whatever.
325480	328280	And then, don't let me forget, during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's
328280	329840	Witness I owned today.
329840	331800	That was very nice, though, of...
331800	332800	You know.
332800	333800	That was very nice of her.
333800	334800	She's a very sweet friend.
334800	335800	She is.
335800	336800	She's very good.
336800	339000	And if I could, I would do all the same for her, so I'm making her a special Christmas
339000	340000	present.
340000	341000	Right on.
341000	343280	I'm making it with finger paints.
343280	344600	How four years old are you?
344600	345600	Yeah.
345600	347600	Loki, how was your gaming week?
347600	348600	It was okay.
348600	349600	I...
349600	352800	Ooh, finally got that to work.
352800	357440	Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.
357440	363400	So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.
363400	369120	And then, of course, I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.
369120	374800	I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this, and none of them have covered multiplayer
374800	376080	very well.
376080	381680	And because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know
381680	387840	possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP, I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is
387840	391720	and why they did a lot of things badly.
391720	398720	For one, anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice Cities or Vice City Stories will
398720	403080	know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.
403080	409000	It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.
409000	411120	Okay, that in mind.
411120	414480	The multiplayer, I was really surprised because they had six different, you know, maps to
414480	417720	choose from, or at least that's what I thought that meant.
417720	424680	But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points on the same map.
424680	429920	So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks, because when you're
429920	433680	playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn
433680	439060	island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.
439060	441440	Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.
441440	445900	I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead
445900	449320	and let everyone run around the full map.
449320	450320	That sucks right there.
450320	454640	Second of all, the map design has a lot of fences that aren't on the map, so you don't
454640	459360	know, you know, you're trying to go to one spot and you don't realize that, oh wait,
459360	461600	there's gonna be a chain link fence that I can't go through.
461600	465920	Wait, you can beat up hookers, you can steal cars, but you can't hop a goddamn fence?
465920	467800	No, I'm sorry, that was in San Andreas.
467800	473800	You see Vice City, you can't have, there is no hopping fence technology yet, nor, you
473800	477520	know, we're lucky enough to actually be able to swim for about a minute, you know, let
477520	478520	alone...
478520	479520	In the 80s, we didn't know how to climb.
479520	483280	So, it's just retarded, because the chain link fence is in Liberty City, you can smash
483280	488400	a car through and then, you know, be able to go right through, but, so basically the
488400	495240	whole game is flawed in the sense that there's, the maps are too big, and I mean, granted,
495240	499080	you can kind of get by it a little bit, you know, just picking the section of the map,
499080	503520	but it would have been a lot better if they had put some sort of artificial wall blocking
503520	505480	you into a certain section of the map.
505480	508240	That would have worked a lot better, and I would have rather seen that.
508240	513820	The second thing that sucks about the multiplayer in the game, though, is the option to turn
513820	515020	off power-ups.
515020	518800	You cannot turn the power-ups off in the game, whereas you could in the first one, which
518800	523760	I don't understand why they took that feature out, because that makes no sense, but anyways,
523760	528440	so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they
528440	533160	spawn about 50 miles away, so, you know, you'll never get to the power-up anyways.
533160	538240	Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except
538240	541960	the Hunter controls it crap, but, I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around
541960	543680	in the helicopter.
543680	546960	But multiplayer is pretty good overall, if they had only made the maps a little bit smaller,
546960	552160	and hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better, but right now, you
552160	556520	know, they don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid, and
556520	562440	all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff, so, whatever.
562440	566680	Some comments from our chat room, Zappy seems to agree with you, bleh, Vice City is meh,
566680	571220	same old GTA, whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you, I actually think having
571220	573360	the full map in multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.
573360	574360	No!
574360	576040	If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelunchradio.com.
576040	579060	Trust me, I've played multiplayer every single day, it does not make it more fun, because
579060	584280	you have, say for example, you're playing a 13 minute game, you have to spend a lot
584280	589600	of time, you know, getting to where the other people are, and they also retweet the weapons
589600	593560	and how, you know, much damage they do, like the remote grenades, which used to be really
593560	597880	devastating, now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody, it's ridiculous.
597880	602680	It takes like four of them to blow up somebody, and before, it's like, you can get hit from,
602680	606560	one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome, but, I don't know,
606560	610680	I don't like how they retweeted everything, and I really wish they had thought more about
610680	616440	the multiplayer, I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute, but,
616440	619720	they really, if they're going to put multiplayer in the game, at least spend some time actually
619720	624120	working out the tweaks, working out the bugs in it, because all those same bugs that were
624120	629740	there in the first one are still there in this one, so, obviously they weren't working
629740	634760	very well, you know, on this, and we're going to probably beta test them more than they
634760	635760	did.
635760	639120	They don't fucking consult me, that's what I want to know, I've played this game more
639120	643880	than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet, they do not consult me when it comes
643880	648260	to their multiplayer in their game, I can at least give them some simple advice, like,
648260	652320	maybe put an option where you can turn off the powerups, that might be smart.
652320	656660	No one cares what you think, Loki, you're just some dumb podcaster, amateur internet
656660	657660	journalist.
657660	660680	I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories, I
660680	665620	will fucking kick your ass, anybody, in the face of the world, anybody, I will beat them
665620	670500	down, and this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games, I would kick
670500	671500	their ass.
671500	672500	Wow.
672500	673500	Strong words there.
673500	674500	Challenge to anybody.
674500	675800	Strong words there.
675800	678800	You know, you're just begging for an ass-kicking with a statement like that, Loki.
678800	680460	Oh, no, I'm not.
680460	681460	All right.
681460	682460	Is that it for your gaming week?
682460	683460	That's pretty much it, yeah.
683460	687240	All right, my gaming week, for those folks that have listened to Orange Lounge Radio
687240	691660	for any amount of time, you guys know that I'm pretty much, you know, I'm openly, admittedly
691660	699220	a whore for all games Final Fantasy that don't involve draw magic.
699220	703820	So Final Fantasy XII came out this week, and it's epic.
703820	706460	That's the only word I can use to describe it, it's just epic.
706460	709280	It's a lot of what I hope for and dream for.
709280	712580	Let me get my bitches out of the way first, because that's usually what people do.
712580	719220	My bitches for the game is that I think I've been really spoiled by next-gen graphics,
719220	724120	because the graphics didn't really wow me like how Final Fantasy X did when I first
724120	728240	played X, or a lot of the Final Fantasy facts in their respective generations usually get
728240	729580	very wowed by the graphics.
729580	734020	XII didn't really wow me with the graphics, but, you know, graphics are only so much of
734020	737660	a game, so that's really a minor bitch all things considered.
737660	742540	Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series,
742540	743540	in my opinion.
743540	746780	But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.
746780	748740	The game is fabulous.
748740	751660	The combat system is genius.
751660	756940	The demo doesn't give you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.
756940	761800	The combat system is great, because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final
761800	766540	Fantasy XI, except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want, and
766540	767920	you don't have to put up with retards.
767920	768920	It's awesome.
768920	770180	I love it.
770180	771360	The combat system is brilliant.
771360	772360	I love it.
772360	775500	I know it's probably going to turn off some old-school fans of the Final Fantasy series,
775500	776500	but it's a nice change.
776500	777980	I think it's great.
777980	785500	The characters are awesome, the story is awesome, and I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great,
785500	790360	and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.
790360	794180	There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story,
794180	797660	because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but I had
797660	801260	an interesting experience going to pick this game up, because I went to a midnight release
801260	805200	for Final Fantasy XII at the local GameStop, because they called and said, hey, we're doing
805200	806240	the midnight release.
806240	811380	So I went, and it was so anticlimactic, like it was just a bunch of people standing around
811380	816700	looking bored, all kind of watching the clock for midnight to hit, and then one cosplayer
816700	822420	walked in at 11.55, and everybody was just kind of staring at him, like, isn't that cute?
822420	827660	Because he came as Cid from Final Fantasy VII, and I guess he got a prize for it.
827660	831580	I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever, so it was kind of anticlimactic,
831580	835020	and of course they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook, and I'm like, no, I have
835020	836380	a game, I have GameFacts.
836380	837840	The guidebook is sexy.
837840	842780	I know the guidebook looks nice, but I couldn't justify paying the money for it, when GameFacts.com
842780	843780	is available.
843780	847540	That's all I can say.
847540	850420	Rama in our chat room says, Gambites and Licenses, crap.
850420	851500	I disagree.
851500	855780	The license board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambites is really what makes
855780	861180	the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.
861180	863500	Like the Gambites is basically, for those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambit
863500	868300	system basically, you can set a pre-programmed set of logic for your players when you're
868300	869300	doing battle.
869300	874540	Like for instance, let's say I use Fran a lot, she's the bunny looking character, she's
874540	877460	awesome, and she's so sarcastic too.
877460	880300	Even my friend who doesn't play games, like one of my best friends, John, just watched
880300	883940	me play Final Fantasy XII for like two hours the other night, and he even agreed by the
883940	887740	time it was over that Balthier and Fran were like sexy beasts.
887740	892420	Anyway, but Fran, so like I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority,
892420	895920	if anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.
895920	900740	If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.
900740	905260	Then she will automatically cure Silence, she'll automatically cure Poison, then her
905260	908220	priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.
908220	913580	Then under that, the logic is that she casts Protect on my main character, Vaan, who I
913580	915580	use as my main character right now.
915580	921100	So it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle,
921100	922340	so she's not wasting MP.
922340	923340	It's great.
923340	924340	So you can kind of play with this.
924340	927260	But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic
927260	928260	available to you.
928260	933280	Like, for instance, you start with like only a few commands, like hit points below 70%,
933280	936860	but if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have
936860	937860	to buy that.
937860	941940	Or if you want to get like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.
941940	944220	You know, it's kind of interesting the way that all works.
944220	946180	So I kind of think it's cool.
946180	947180	I like it.
947180	948580	So that's just my opinion.
948580	951840	So I think the game is great.
951840	953620	It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.
953620	955040	It's like a 9.9 out of 10.
955040	956040	It's wonderful.
956040	957040	You have to get it.
957040	961940	Even if you don't like RPGs, usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in
961940	963200	this will get you into it.
963200	964200	I don't know.
964200	965200	That's just my thoughts.
965200	970500	So, Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but
970500	971500	I realized that...
971500	974260	I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.
974260	975260	You know what, though?
975260	978020	The demo didn't do it justice, because it didn't show you the depth of it.
978020	981820	It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like run up to a monster and rely on the auto
981820	983920	attack thing and maybe use the magic.
983920	984920	It didn't do it justice.
984920	986980	I was just like, get the stupid thing off the screen.
986980	987980	I want my cutscene.
987980	988980	Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.
988980	989980	You know what I meant, though?
989980	990980	I meant the cut to battle.
990980	991980	Yeah.
991980	992980	The battle screen, I guess.
992980	999400	Well, it's interesting, because it means you have no random battles, and that was kind
999400	1002700	of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasy, is like, God damn it, I need to get to a save
1002700	1007940	point, because I need to go, and it's like you're walking towards a save point, and then
1007940	1008940	boom, boom, boom.
1008940	1010780	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
1010780	1015020	There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.
1015020	1016740	Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.
1016740	1019980	Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.
1019980	1020980	That's true.
1020980	1022420	But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.
1022420	1024900	Oh, that is one other kind of minor.
1024900	1028100	You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.
1028100	1031400	The areas are massive.
1031400	1033580	It was the same with X.
1033580	1037980	What would you say was the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, when you played Final
1037980	1038980	Fantasy XI?
1038980	1039980	What was the worst thing about it?
1039980	1040980	Being a white mage.
1040980	1045340	See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat
1045340	1048900	system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.
1048900	1051940	You set the gamuts, and they do it.
1051940	1054300	If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.
1054300	1055300	You got it.
1055300	1056300	And no one yells at you to cure them.
1056300	1057300	They'll just die.
1057300	1058300	It's awesome.
1058300	1063820	So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger, without Toriyama's artwork.
1063820	1064820	Maybe.
1064820	1065820	Maybe.
1065820	1066820	I don't know.
1066820	1068020	Chrono Trigger is just a whole other universe.
1068020	1069020	I don't know.
1069020	1070020	You're comparing apples to oranges.
1070020	1071020	That would be awesome.
1071020	1072820	You're comparing apples to oranges.
1072820	1074300	They're different, but they're still grapefruit.
1074300	1076300	I don't know.
1076300	1077300	Take that as you will.
1077300	1081740	All you need to know is comparing apples to oranges when you're eating pizza.
1081740	1085260	So no other games for me to review this week, and probably for the next few weeks there
1085260	1089080	won't be a lot that I'm playing, although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents.
1089080	1092340	And I did go to, we were at the mall today, and of course I had to look to see if they
1092340	1095820	had Luminous 2, because I still kind of want it.
1095820	1099060	Even if I am a little bit like, see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week.
1099060	1103580	I got mixed up, so I have to wait for Tuesday, but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous
1103580	1107940	right now because the Xbox one was not all that, I still really want Luminous 2.
1107940	1111060	And somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week, and you know,
1111060	1112280	it looked pretty hot.
1112280	1115340	So anyway, let's get into some housekeeping.
1115340	1117760	We have a few items for housekeeping tonight.
1117760	1123340	First things first, it is November sweeps, for those that don't know what I'm talking
1123340	1124340	about.
1124340	1128780	In the TV industry they usually do this thing called November sweeps, which is where the
1128780	1134380	big stuff happens, like in Lost they'll kill off the character that you really liked, or
1134380	1138860	maybe somebody will get married, or they'll have a baby, something really big happens.
1138860	1141920	So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey maybe we'll get involved in November
1141920	1145660	sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.
1145660	1148180	And tonight we have a surprise for you guys, and this is something we've been hinting
1148180	1149820	at for a little while.
1149820	1154900	But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes
1154900	1160900	or XB Stream or however you're doing it, Orange Launch Radio is actually a live streaming
1160900	1163220	radio station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
1163220	1168620	This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then broadcasted
1168620	1170420	over the MP3s.
1170420	1172860	But we do have live only shows that air throughout the week.
1172860	1176280	For instance, Tuesday night, Dark Soccer does her Pump Up the Volume, it's just her and
1176280	1179180	she plays some indie band music for you guys.
1179180	1182900	Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is
1182900	1185100	kind of about pop culture stuff.
1185100	1189380	And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.
1189380	1196380	So let's go to the tape.
1196380	1198380	Do you want to listen to me?
1198380	1205380	Because if you do, then I should warn you.
1205380	1207300	Because if you do, I should warn you.
1207300	1210020	You're going to hear all sorts of things.
1210020	1217300	It's from the past, crap from the future, the day I have a meltdown on the air, it won't
1217300	1220780	be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be clean.
1220780	1226340	But I tell you what it will be, but I tell you what it will be, the train wreck of a
1226340	1227340	lifetime.
1227340	1230780	Do you want to listen to me?
1230780	1236700	Travis Donovan Law coming to Orange Launch Radio.
1236700	1242180	That's right, Orange Lounge Radio welcomes Travis Donovan Live, premiering Saturday,
1242180	1247980	November 11th at 730 Pacific about here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1247980	1252340	Right now it's scheduled to be a live only show, but the option for audio RSS may be
1252340	1253340	in the future.
1253340	1255000	So we're very excited about that.
1255000	1259460	For those that don't know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer and I used to be
1259460	1264540	on a program called Under Sedation Live that was hosted by Travis Donovan.
1264540	1268380	And also for those of you that are big on DDR Freak and the DDR scene, you probably
1268380	1271260	know Iguana Girl, she was on that program as well.
1271260	1276100	So Under Sedation Live has gone through some changes recently and unfortunately the station
1276100	1277100	is going to be folding.
1277100	1281900	The live station that runs 24-7 is going to be folding I believe at the end of this month.
1281900	1285580	So we thought, you know what, Travis did a lot for us, so we want to allow him to come
1285580	1289860	over to our station and continue the legacy he started many years ago.
1289860	1291860	So I look forward to that.
1291860	1295020	For those that don't know Travis, he's kind of a geek just like the rest of us.
1295020	1298200	So his show is going to be a little more sci-fi oriented and type stuff.
1298200	1302860	So sci-fi, I know he plays Xbox 360 and hopefully he'll be giving us a call a little later in
1302860	1305460	the program and tell us a little more about what to look forward to on his program.
1305460	1307260	So we're very excited about that.
1307260	1310820	More surprises to come in upcoming weeks.
1310820	1314420	For now let's get into some gaming news and we're going to start it off.
1314420	1318820	Loki has some dates for you guys, some things you may not have heard about, a little Under
1318820	1319900	the Radar stuff this week.
1319900	1325740	I have dates now, but we've got some good stuff this week of course.
1325740	1329980	Lots of stuff has been announced and one of those titles that you might have seen floating
1329980	1333660	around out there would be Halo 3.
1333660	1341460	So without further ado, and I'm going to preface this a little bit because with such a date
1341460	1347540	like this you have to kind of wonder, okay well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive
1347540	1355620	on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, according
1355620	1360080	to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement, of course Microsoft hasn't made
1360080	1363680	an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside
1363680	1372220	Microsoft, March 14th, which makes sense because that's when the big games came out last year.
1372220	1375820	March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies including
1375820	1384660	Microsoft, so March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo, and yeah, that's pretty cool.
1384660	1387460	Okay, now wait a minute, I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing
1387460	1388460	you're saying there.
1388460	1393980	So again, let's look at the evidence and why, because most people are assuming that Christmas
1393980	1400100	window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3, but now we've had several random things
1400100	1403060	pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?
1403060	1407140	Because I remember a few episodes ago, you had the marketing folks that came to your
1407140	1408580	work and they told you spring, right?
1408580	1418840	Well, this wasn't the marketing guy, this was their head of sales at Microsoft, he said
1418840	1427260	March or April was the target date for Halo, and this makes sense because how would you
1427260	1431320	love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions
1431320	1434780	and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really
1434780	1440300	good because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways,
1440300	1446380	Halo Wars, so you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.
1446380	1450400	You know what's interesting is that the same, obviously when you posted this in the show
1450400	1454540	roll thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different
1454540	1459140	source, let's just say I have a friend, and I know you all hate these friend of a friend
1459140	1461700	things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place,
1461700	1462700	right?
1462700	1468220	I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain large magazine company who's
1468220	1473220	had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to
1473220	1474220	be spring of 2007.
1474220	1479700	Well, of course it's going to be spring of 2007, and I would think that this makes very
1479700	1484100	good sense, it's not going to be February because I thought originally it might be February
1484100	1487700	or something like that, but February is usually dead, it's kind of still that dead point from
1487700	1494100	December to March, where nothing really comes out.
1494100	1497800	That wasn't the only day I had, there were some other ones from EA I thought I'd mentioned
1497800	1502380	as well, I mean, it's not huge stuff, but EA Replay 2, they've already decided to go
1502380	1508460	ahead and make a second one, that'll be coming out also the same day on Valentine's Day.
1508460	1513340	Perfect way to say I love you is Halo 3 and EA Replay 2.
1513340	1518700	Coded Arbs Contagion, and that might even be pushed back, who knows, because a lot of
1518700	1524540	Konami stuff has been delayed lately, they've been kind of dropping the ball on some stuff.
1524540	1534380	MVP07 NCAA Baseball, also that same date, and then finally Two Worlds for Xbox 360,
1534380	1541300	which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th, so lots of
1541300	1547140	good stuff, I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, home court, but I think
1547140	1550220	the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.
1550220	1551220	Fun stuff.
1551220	1555940	Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?
1555940	1561400	I think I saw it on a blog somewhere, it's interesting, I actually have that preordered
1561400	1565180	because I want that for my desk.
1565180	1569340	I hope that turns out to be true, you know, a lot of signs point to that, you know, why
1569340	1573580	the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a
1573580	1577660	big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3, and I don't know, there's just a lot of
1577660	1580060	things that kind of make that look probable.
1580060	1584300	We might be wrong, it might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.
1584300	1589940	It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong, there are delay issues for different reasons,
1589940	1592380	I mean, it's just like, you know.
1592380	1597180	Folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray, but at the same time, if these magazines are
1597180	1600740	getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate
1600740	1602860	to me the game is pretty close to completion.
1602860	1607500	I think so, and here's the thing about it though, and no one seems to pay attention
1607500	1613860	to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big, you know, chunks, you've got
1613860	1620820	the spring releases which take place mostly in March, you know, and it basically builds
1620820	1627340	up right there in that March 15th week, you know, over there, then in November, November
1627340	1632100	15th, those are the big, you know, two, and it just makes perfect sense.
1632100	1637680	Just with the whole launch windows, you want to have this strong title for the spring that's
1637680	1642940	basically going to, you know, dominate the market and make people even, you know, consider
1642940	1648700	the 360 War over the PlayStation 3, and then for the holiday season, you've still got your
1648700	1655060	Halo title, Halo Wars, that you can also push out there as well, so they're covered in both,
1655060	1656900	you know, sections of the year.
1656900	1659100	I don't know, that makes sense to me.
1659100	1661180	Well, we'll see what happens.
1661180	1662580	We will see all the time.
1662580	1666140	Well anyway, getting into some other news, speaking of games that are coming out soon,
1666140	1670300	some of your old favorites are coming back on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, but
1670300	1674380	what's interesting, and I suppose not really a surprise to anyone, is that the lineups
1674380	1679060	are going to be a little bit different between Japan, the U.S., and Europe.
1679060	1682220	There's been a lot of release charts that have been circulating the internet.
1682220	1685860	Now, this is supposed to be what's available by year's end, I believe, not necessarily
1685860	1690300	all on November 19th, December 2nd, whatever day your country's getting the Wii, but this
1690300	1693340	is all what's supposed to be available by year's end.
1693340	1700500	All three regions are getting a wide selection of NES games, including Wario's Woods, Tennis,
1700500	1705580	Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong, but what's interesting, Japan is getting
1705580	1706580	some exclusives.
1706580	1710300	They are the only ones that are getting Gradius, and what's very interesting, I think, is that
1710300	1713260	they're the only ones getting Super Mario Brothers.
1713260	1714580	So kind of strange there.
1714580	1716340	Oh, also, how could I forget this one?
1716340	1717340	Solomon's Key.
1717340	1718340	I played that game a lot.
1718340	1720060	I think those are launch games, if I remember correctly.
1720060	1721980	I thought it was until the end of the year.
1721980	1724860	I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than
1724860	1728860	us, and I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for
1728860	1729860	us.
1729860	1735020	I want to say Europe is getting some games that were not either, and I want to say that
1735020	1738180	it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.
1738180	1739180	Well, alright.
1739180	1741940	Now what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey
1741940	1744540	Kong Country, but the other two regions are.
1744540	1748060	All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and Sim City, but then
1748060	1754220	Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra III, Super Castlevania
1754220	1757460	IV, Street Fighter II, and Zelda Link to the Past.
1757460	1761860	The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.
1761860	1767060	Then you go over to Sega Genesis, and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.
1767060	1773660	You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo
1773660	1777380	or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same
1777380	1778380	game, anyway.
1778380	1780620	Sonic the Hedgehog, Toejam and Earl.
1780620	1784020	The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer.
1784020	1785340	Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?
1785340	1788780	Yeah, that was the one with the dog.
1788780	1790220	That game was freaking awesome.
1790220	1791580	But yet there's no Shinobi listed.
1791580	1792580	That's kind of weird.
1792580	1795260	Shadow Dancer was a better game.
1795260	1800520	On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions are getting Bonk's Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and
1800520	1806980	Super Star Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman
1806980	1810780	94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.
1810780	1819900	Victory Run, not coming to the US, but is coming to Japan and the US.
1819900	1821020	I screwed up earlier.
1821020	1823460	Donkey Kong Country is not coming to the US.
1823460	1825300	It is going to Europe, but not the US.
1825300	1826300	My bad.
1826300	1827960	Sorry, folks.
1827960	1829540	We make mistakes here once in a while.
1829540	1830540	My bad.
1830540	1832180	But interesting lineups, nonetheless.
1832180	1834440	Of course, a lot of us go, where's this game?
1834440	1837700	For instance, I can't help but go, where's Guardian Legend?
1837700	1840480	Where's the greatest NES game ever made?
1840480	1841740	But maybe later.
1841740	1845040	I'm also going, where's Dracula X?
1845040	1846880	Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.
1846880	1847880	Only the one in Japan.
1847880	1852580	Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, while they're looking at the...
1852580	1858740	And they could easily encode it, memory, storage being what it is now, they could easily move
1858740	1860740	a whole CD game into...
1860740	1869060	Because the thing that took up the most room on those disks was the Redbook audio.
1869060	1872060	Well we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.
1872060	1874940	It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?
1874940	1878980	Imagine, you know, if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia, that'd
1878980	1879980	be cool.
1879980	1880980	Yeah.
1880980	1884940	All right, so that's all I gotta say on the Virtual Console.
1884940	1888220	Well, I've gotten used.
1888220	1895580	But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.
1895580	1901020	Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though
1901020	1907420	the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.
1907420	1911700	In the magazine, it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.
1911700	1912700	But...
1912700	1913700	That was a typo.
1913700	1914700	Yeah.
1914700	1917460	They went back and Nintendo themselves said that.
1917460	1922860	Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to
1922860	1928900	be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released
1928900	1933060	at launch in the UK, so you should have no problem getting that.
1933060	1938000	You won't have to import that.
1938000	1939300	That's pretty cool.
1939300	1941780	I know there are some other secrets out there.
1941780	1946220	I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us, you know, maybe some high def later on
1946220	1950220	or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy wah-wah-wah, so I've given up.
1950220	1952340	Who says they can't?
1952340	1956980	Microsoft upgraded their display of output, so why not?
1956980	1958700	They can do stuff.
1958700	1960000	Because it's just not their thing.
1960000	1961140	That's not their thing right now.
1961140	1965420	Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher
1965420	1968300	can say, I want to make my game 720, dammit!
1968300	1970180	So I'm going to.
1970180	1971180	We'll see.
1971180	1972180	I don't know.
1972180	1977340	So anyways, there's some other stuff released this week actually about the Virtual Console.
1977340	1982700	Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.
1982700	1987980	It's going to be interesting to find out actually that you'll be able to store your games to
1987980	1994780	the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.
1994780	1999740	You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, you know, being where
1999740	2002980	you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your
2002980	2005460	Mario Brothers there.
2005460	2008820	You can, however, re-download your games.
2008820	2013860	Kind of typical with like Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.
2013860	2016940	And some interesting stuff they're talking about.
2016940	2024460	How the Virtual Console stuff, you'll be able to use the standard Wii Remote actually for
2024460	2028940	NES games by turning it outside, which, you know, ever since I saw that Wii Remote and
2028940	2031980	they announced the Virtual Console, I knew they were going to be able to do that.
2031980	2037020	And as well as using the GameCube pads, also if you don't want to spend money on the classic
2037020	2038820	controller you can use that as well.
2038820	2041140	So that's kind of neat.
2041140	2043980	And yeah, that's pretty much it for now.
2043980	2048380	That's all about the information that they have on that.
2048380	2050380	Comments regarding high definition from our chat room.
2050380	2053060	Pooeater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.
2053060	2059340	I could give a crap less about 1,296,000,000 or P or whatever.
2059340	2061780	No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.
2061780	2064660	They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.
2064660	2065660	So that's kind of neat.
2065660	2066660	Oh, that is kind of neat.
2066660	2070140	That's like the iTunes books you get.
2070140	2072620	Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there
2072620	2077460	something a while ago about how Nintendo like totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming
2077460	2078460	type thing?
2078460	2081900	I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.
2081900	2082900	Was it Sony?
2082900	2083900	I don't know.
2083900	2085620	Did somebody want to use iTunes as a model?
2085620	2091020	Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.
2091020	2093300	My bad, I got it mixed up then.
2093300	2097460	Well speaking of iTunes, perhaps some of the music you download from there will soon be
2097460	2098540	playable on the Wii.
2098540	2104060	Actually not really because iTunes uses the protected format, but there are stories going
2104060	2108700	around the internet this week that the Wii will be supporting custom soundtracks.
2108700	2115660	A screenshot popped up on Neo GAF forums and it's a screenshot from Excite Truck and it
2115660	2121340	shows in the sound options menu that there is an SD card option in the menu and so it's
2121340	2127620	being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as
2127620	2129300	custom soundtracks in the game.
2129300	2134480	No official word from Nintendo just yet, but the screenshot sure does make things look
2134480	2138980	interesting and since Nintendo has said that there are still some secrets yet to be revealed,
2138980	2143300	this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.
2143300	2144300	Who knows?
2144300	2146220	But that would be kind of neat.
2146220	2150700	I like to use custom soundtracks on 360 unless I'm playing DDR or something, oh wait no just
2150700	2152060	kidding I can't play DDR on 360.
2152060	2156140	Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that because that kind of would break the
2156140	2162300	game, but most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.
2162300	2168820	Well speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of
2168820	2174620	a character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Fox McCloud is showing up and from what I can
2174620	2180460	tell I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.
2180460	2186540	Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time
2186540	2189300	zero suit.
2189300	2199220	There's also Solid Snake and Wario, which I'm going to have that game so fast.
2199220	2203420	I know it's kind of disappointing that they didn't announce something new, I mean we've
2203420	2204740	had Fox before.
2204740	2206460	Even in every single game.
2206460	2209620	Yeah but I mean okay big deal, they gave him a staff this time so.
2209620	2210620	Ooh staff.
2210620	2214220	It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.
2214220	2216180	Great so they gave us a crappy game Fox.
2216180	2222940	Thank you for reminding us that they made that game, seriously.
2222940	2227620	We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.
2227620	2231020	We were hoping to, well I know you didn't plan it Jamie, but.
2231020	2237500	I was like, I didn't think that story out, I want the game anyway, but I appreciate it.
2237500	2241420	We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character, because
2241420	2243900	they've said that there are going to be other third party characters in it.
2243900	2249700	It's almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi, I didn't see
2249700	2250700	that coming.
2250700	2254740	No I want Raiden to be in it, that'd be funny.
2254740	2262780	Our new secret character is, a defective NES cart where you have to blow on it.
2262780	2265300	The new fighter is pantsless rage.
2265300	2267020	Oh god, anyways.
2267020	2268740	Moving on.
2268740	2273260	So anyways some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week in fact in the form
2273260	2278460	of an episode of South Park where Cartman is actually waiting for the Wii to come out
2278460	2286820	at, it was quite funny, and was it like an E.L. or E.B., it's like an E.B. type story.
2286820	2287820	It was E.V.
2287820	2289820	E.V. whatever.
2289820	2296660	So basically impatient, you know, like most of us, he ends up freezing himself to be able
2296660	2302100	to be woken up later on in the future when the Wii is out, and unfortunately wakes up
2302100	2303500	too late.
2303500	2305500	And the hilarity ensues.
2305500	2310580	But he wakes up in a land full of sea otter people, which was so freaking funny, I about
2310580	2311580	cried.
2311580	2315900	I about cried the last, I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal, like the last
2315900	2320580	minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up, I about cried, it
2320580	2321580	was so funny.
2321580	2327980	This is making me laugh, G.S. 68 in the chat room says, new secret character Ken Kuraghi,
2327980	2328980	he wields a crayon sword.
2328980	2332480	He can't, he's going to eat it.
2332480	2334700	Maybe Cartman's the secret character, who knows.
2334700	2335700	That's the joke.
2335700	2340300	It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because
2340300	2344320	the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying
2344320	2347820	that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's
2347820	2351280	going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that will probably be the big joke.
2351280	2354540	But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.
2354540	2358340	But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but
2358340	2362780	that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty
2362780	2366180	funny.
2366180	2373340	One of my favorite characters at Nintendo is Perrin Caplan, and the Game Informer magazine
2373340	2377100	spoke to Perrin Caplan this week about something that I've been very curious about, the Wii
2377100	2382100	component cables, because there are stories going around out there that the component
2382100	2386580	cables you're only going to be able to order online, which kind of makes me sad, because
2386580	2392220	I was never, even today, I was never able to find GameCube component cables for a reasonable
2392220	2393220	price.
2393220	2396900	So I never did get to try the GameCube on the HDTV, so I thought, oh, okay, well, what
2396900	2400140	I'll do is I'll wait for the Wii, which is sure to have component cables, because this
2400140	2403860	is the next gen of gaming after all, and then I'll get to play all those old GameCube games
2403860	2405500	on the component cables.
2405500	2410280	But then the rumors came out that you're only going to be able to get them online, but Perrin
2410280	2415180	Caplan to the rescue, she, in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will
2415180	2419860	component cables be available on day one, Caplan said yes, at retail and online, Best
2419860	2425980	Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com, if you still want to go the online route.
2425980	2430820	Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing
2430820	2431820	to lattes.
2431820	2433900	I didn't get that, but whatever.
2433900	2438940	I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.
2438940	2441820	That makes me very happy.
2441820	2442820	She's insane.
2442820	2444820	Does that make you a happy panda?
2444820	2447940	She's a crazy, crazy person.
2447940	2448940	Anyways.
2448940	2451380	What the hell was that?
2451380	2457540	It was no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.
2457540	2460580	It's like, I love Gnarls Barkley as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing
2460580	2463180	that damn song every time I open up my AIM.
2463180	2465700	You must not like them very much, because I don't like them.
2465700	2469780	No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.
2469780	2471540	I like Danger Mouse.
2471540	2477820	Um, speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play
2477820	2484620	sounds when you don't expect it to, um, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.
2484620	2485620	Frightening Frightening.
2485620	2486620	Cool!
2486620	2487620	Silent Hill 5?
2487620	2488620	Finally?
2488620	2489620	Confirmation?
2489620	2490620	Serior!
2490620	2491620	What?
2491620	2496420	It's called, um, Otonarioku, which means adult power.
2496420	2497420	Adult power, huh?
2497420	2499260	So is this one of like, those games, where it's a little-
2499260	2504660	It's a self-help guide to improving relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.
2504660	2505660	Boring!
2505660	2513900	But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin', I don't have, it's gonna
2513900	2514900	sell like-
2514900	2516700	Not in this country.
2516700	2517700	In Japan.
2517700	2522700	And like, five people will import it and go, I CAN'T READ JAPANESE!
2522700	2526020	Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?
2526020	2528180	Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.
2528180	2534340	Oh, kind of like how like, he feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him
2534340	2538700	straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know,
2538700	2542220	like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.
2542220	2544100	I don't- what the hell do you do in adult training?
2544100	2549220	No, I think that it'll do like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, SIRENS GO OFF!
2549220	2551220	THE WORLD GETS DARK!
2551220	2555900	Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends, I mean, I don't- what exactly
2555900	2559220	is, uh, gonna be trained in this game?
2559220	2564620	Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's
2564620	2569100	accidental, oops I crapped my pants.
2569100	2570420	So that's not a good comparison.
2570420	2571420	Nonsense.
2571420	2572580	Although the thought of crapping one's pants is-
2572580	2573580	It's all about control.
2573580	2576380	Although the thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.
2576380	2580580	Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult- never mind, forget it.
2580580	2583340	No, it was, I was gonna, it was Saturday Night Live.
2583340	2584900	Oops, I crapped my pants.
2584900	2585900	Never mind, forget it.
2585900	2588140	But, I don't know.
2588140	2593140	I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for, um, like, elementary school kids.
2593140	2598500	So, you know, in America, so that everyone gets good manners.
2598500	2602220	Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.
2602220	2603220	You know what?
2603220	2605260	I have really good freakin' manners, okay?
2605260	2607580	I am so polite.
2607580	2612900	I hold the doors open for people, I smile, and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when
2612900	2613900	I think they're being retards.
2613900	2616900	You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.
2616900	2617900	I did!
2617900	2618900	See, I'm nice!
2618900	2619900	Aren't I nice?
2619900	2620900	I am the nicest person.
2620900	2624140	Of course, she was trying to redeem herself with- no, I'm just kidding.
2624140	2625140	No.
2625140	2626140	And I bought snickerdoodles.
2626140	2628740	Alright, back to games, back to games.
2628740	2629740	We're getting crazy off-topic.
2629740	2635660	Sorry, I was caught up in your guys' argument there.
2635660	2639900	And suddenly it was turning into the Jenny Jones show, suddenly.
2639900	2645700	Anyways, so, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what
2645700	2650340	is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?
2650340	2652460	Everything possible.
2652460	2659620	They are shipping it by any means possible, planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name
2659620	2660620	it.
2660620	2661620	Horseback?
2661620	2662620	Yes.
2662620	2666700	Little immigrants, too, pulling the crates, you know.
2666700	2672820	Yeah, so any means necessary, not a huge surprise, but it's nice to, you know, be reassured
2672820	2679140	that they are doing everything in their- that they possibly could do, so.
2679140	2680140	Excellent.
2680140	2684140	I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce somebody who's walked in, I said would be
2684140	2685140	on the show a little later.
2685140	2686140	Say hello to Miklotov.
2686140	2687140	Hello.
2687140	2691820	Now, Miklotov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit, because you have
2691820	2697420	certain fears on the- certain fears you've expressed to me before, so how do you feel
2697420	2701380	if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?
2701380	2704500	I would cry, because I hate UPS.
2704500	2708860	But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS, you've told me you have a fear of UPS.
2708860	2709860	It's a little bit of both.
2709860	2711400	It's all from high school.
2711400	2712400	Tell us your fears, firstly.
2712400	2713400	Okay, my fears?
2713400	2714400	Uh-huh.
2714400	2715400	Okay, UPS?
2715400	2716400	Yeah.
2716400	2717400	Water?
2717400	2718400	Yeah.
2718400	2719400	Sheep?
2719400	2720400	Uh-huh.
2720400	2721400	Flying bugs.
2721400	2728540	If you had ever delivered you, like, a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.
2728540	2730100	I would probably just die on the spot.
2730100	2731100	That's like Silent Hill to you.
2731100	2732820	Okay, so why the UPS fear?
2732820	2734660	That has nothing to do with video games.
2734660	2736380	No, but I'm curious.
2736380	2741660	That's just like, when I was in high school, my bus stop was next to the UPS center, and
2741660	2744340	I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were-
2744340	2745340	You're really weird now!
2745340	2746340	High school?
2746340	2747500	Yeah, whatever.
2747500	2754900	I figured they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.
2754900	2756780	You don't get much more stupid than I have.
2756780	2757780	What would that be?
2757780	2759780	Universal Pwnage Service?
2759780	2760780	I don't know.
2760780	2764420	I just hate them, and they frighten me.
2764420	2767420	I thought maybe, like, a UPS man beat you up once or something.
2767420	2772020	No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop, watching all the trucks go by, and the
2772020	2776140	best part was, it was apparently next to a UPS center, and I didn't know that, but I
2776140	2777140	still figured-
2777140	2779460	Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.
2779460	2780460	Show me on the doll.
2780460	2781460	Nowhere.
2781460	2786660	I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.
2786660	2789820	Usiagi in our chat room agrees, UPS is the spawn of Satan.
2789820	2791820	I've never had a problem with UPS.
2791820	2792820	I hate them.
2792820	2795620	In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.
2795620	2796620	No such thing.
2796620	2797620	No, I-
2797620	2798620	You know what?
2798620	2799620	If they're attracted-
2799620	2800620	At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.
2800620	2801620	This is years before my current job.
2801620	2805420	I used to have to sign for UPS all the time, and, you know, sometimes that's the highlight
2805420	2806420	of the day.
2806420	2807420	It's really evil.
2807420	2808420	All right.
2808420	2812340	Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.
2812340	2813340	That's what I said.
2813340	2816780	Well, you know, if people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games
2816780	2822180	and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can
2822180	2823300	listen to.
2823300	2827180	Where would you listen to, you know, fears about insects and sheep and water?
2827180	2828180	Exactly.
2828180	2834140	You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to
2834140	2835140	do with gaming.
2835140	2839620	Jamie, you're going to make me cry, and when I cry I get stabby.
2839620	2841780	I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.
2841780	2842780	You know what?
2842780	2843780	They're close enough.
2843780	2845140	Do goats scare you?
2845140	2846140	You know what?
2846140	2847140	I haven't been-
2847140	2848140	What about llamas?
2848140	2849140	Llamas, no.
2849140	2850140	Okay.
2850140	2851140	No, I'm really ready to get back in the game, though.
2851140	2853140	Llamas have to do with tempests, so there you go.
2853140	2855220	Where were llamas and tempests?
2855220	2857820	Isn't that one guy that makes tempests something to do with a llama?
2857820	2860300	Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here so we can get back-
2860300	2861300	Wait, no, I have a-
2861300	2864580	How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?
2864580	2866660	I feel that they deserve to buy things.
2866660	2867900	Well, guess what?
2867900	2873800	They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.
2873800	2876540	It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.
2876540	2877540	No, no, no.
2877540	2882260	Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying
2882260	2883620	the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
2883620	2887920	If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.
2887920	2889700	Best Buy employees aren't shut out.
2889700	2892020	Well, I guess they're not shut out.
2892020	2894100	Don't they have to act like regular customers or whatever?
2894100	2895260	Yeah, they get no preferential treats.
2895260	2899820	Well, the word is that actually Circuit City and CompUSA can't even get them.
2899820	2902980	So if you work for Circuit City, you just have to go to CompUSA, and if you work for
2902980	2903980	CompUSA, you go to Circuit City.
2903980	2907380	That's what you get for working for a second-rate retailer.
2907380	2909220	What's your problem with Circuit City and CompUSA?
2909220	2911180	They never have anything I want.
2911180	2913060	You know why I like Circuit City?
2913060	2916800	I don't know about your town, guys, but in this town, fucking no one shops at Circuit
2916800	2917800	City.
2917800	2919180	It's always empty.
2919180	2921100	No matter when I go there, there is nobody there.
2921100	2922900	I can't believe the chain didn't go under.
2922900	2924700	They went under where I'm from.
2924700	2925700	Really?
2925700	2926700	I'm surprised they haven't.
2926700	2927700	They have expanded here.
2927700	2931380	They took over, like the good guys all went under, and they took over the old building
2931380	2935780	that they were in, and yeah, I can't believe they're expanding because no one is ever in
2935780	2936780	Circuit City.
2936780	2942180	In fact, that's probably where I'd go get my PlayStation 3 is Circuit City.
2942180	2943180	Or Kmart.
2943180	2947900	I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart, and with good reason, but Kmart, I'm telling
2947900	2950980	you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.
2950980	2951980	You know what?
2951980	2955260	I'd camp out for a PlayStation 3.
2955260	2957060	I don't either, because I'm not getting one.
2957060	2958620	Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.
2958620	2963140	Well, you want to know what's funny, that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually
2963140	2967860	getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else, because our
2967860	2969020	credit card was special.
2969020	2970660	But speaking of special...
2970660	2977780	Actually, I wanted to say real quick, Neologism, I totally mispronounced his name, 82, says
2977780	2980860	Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.
2980860	2983980	Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.
2983980	2985060	So what does it matter?
2985060	2988620	But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.
2988620	2990380	Damn it.
2990380	2991380	You open your mouth.
2991380	2994460	If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.
2994460	2995980	I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.
2995980	2996980	You better back the F away.
2996980	2998780	I'm going to the one on How.
2998780	3000780	Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.
3000780	3004660	Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.
3004660	3005660	Never mind.
3005660	3006660	Forget it.
3006660	3007660	No, that was actually...
3007660	3008660	I was like, oh, Rob's being clever.
3008660	3009660	Don't listen to me.
3009660	3010660	Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.
3010660	3012940	Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on...
3012940	3016720	They're still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?
3016720	3018260	That's the one I'm going to, yes.
3018260	3019260	That's the ticket.
3019260	3020260	Go there.
3020260	3021260	Okay.
3021260	3022260	No, it's not on Antelope.
3022260	3023260	It's Auburn.
3023260	3024260	Whatever.
3024260	3025260	Whatever.
3025260	3026260	Anyway.
3026260	3027260	Yeah.
3027260	3028260	Here's your Sacramento direction thing.
3028260	3029260	Okay.
3029260	3033820	Well, back to the PS3.
3033820	3035660	I hate you, Best Buy.
3035660	3036660	You bitches.
3036660	3037660	Okay.
3037660	3038660	I really don't...
3038660	3039660	I don't hate any...
3039660	3040660	Let me rephrase that.
3040660	3043460	I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.
3043460	3046740	I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.
3046740	3052420	18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3, and they're not doing
3052420	3054020	anything for the Wii.
3054020	3055020	You know why?
3055020	3059500	Because Nintendo loves us, and they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.
3059500	3062860	So there are 18 stores total.
3062860	3064780	It's going to be in these cities.
3064780	3070620	Park Lane, Texas, West Los Angeles, California, Chesterfield...
3070620	3071620	Is that...
3071620	3072620	Is M.O.
3072620	3073620	Montana?
3073620	3074620	Yeah.
3074620	3075620	No.
3075620	3076620	M.O. is Missouri.
3076620	3077620	Missouri.
3077620	3078620	I don't know why I thought that.
3078620	3085100	El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria,
3085100	3087860	Texas, Butterfield, Ro...
3087860	3088860	What's the...
3088860	3089860	Okay.
3089860	3090860	Anyway.
3090860	3091860	Illinois.
3091860	3093340	I'm a little tongue-tied today.
3093340	3098940	West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South
3098940	3108260	Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York, Landmark, Massachusetts, and Midtown,
3108260	3109260	Manhattan.
3109260	3110260	Seriously, kids?
3110260	3111260	Why bother, though?
3111260	3112260	Why bother?
3112260	3118660	Because some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games
3118660	3123380	all day long, that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can't get
3123380	3126960	Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.
3126960	3128460	So you're screwed.
3128460	3129460	So why bother?
3129460	3133220	I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing
3133220	3135420	it, people are going to be driving in from far away.
3135420	3136660	Somebody is going to beat you to it.
3136660	3139780	So I say why bother?
3139780	3147060	If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.
3147060	3149060	Just go to any big blog you look at.
3149060	3150060	They all have the list.
3150060	3156540	For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.
3156540	3158540	So yeah.
3158540	3159540	All right.
3159540	3160540	Have fun waiting in line.
3160540	3161980	Now, I don't know.
3161980	3165220	Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big
3165220	3169500	blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid like, oh, I'm waiting for a place to drink.
3169500	3170500	If I can make fun of them.
3170500	3171780	Do we really got to do that?
3171780	3174160	I mean, seriously, everybody else does that.
3174160	3180820	It's just like reporting on the fucking groundhog and seeing his shadow or not, I mean, that's
3180820	3181820	just retarded.
3181820	3184380	Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone
3184380	3185380	to steal it.
3185380	3186620	I have a good idea for a parody.
3186620	3193780	Also, to answer questions from the chat room, the Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is 609
3193780	3199260	and the Midtown one is 1028 so that you can look online and see what stores those are.
3199260	3200780	I don't know.
3200780	3202220	I just whispered my parody to Loki.
3202220	3203220	You like that?
3203220	3204220	I don't like that.
3204220	3205220	Okay, we're going to do that instead.
3205220	3206220	Okay.
3206220	3207220	All right.
3207220	3208220	All right.
3208220	3209220	So, good luck.
3209220	3210220	All right.
3210220	3214220	I totally missed it because I was doing my job.
3214220	3220460	Anyways, there's some interesting things and, you know, Japan might be waiting a little
3220460	3226220	longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another
3226220	3232820	one fifth of their initial launch PS3s instead of getting 100,000 units at launch.
3232820	3238340	They're going to be getting closer to 80,000 and that kind of sucks.
3238340	3243020	Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United
3243020	3244020	States.
3244020	3253600	So, yeah, well, kind of same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week so, yeah.
3253600	3254740	Sucks to be them.
3254740	3259060	Sucks to be UK even more though because they have to wait until March.
3259060	3262820	Well, sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City because that's the only place
3262820	3266780	right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing
3266780	3267780	this.
3267780	3271740	I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America and we'll hit a store near you soon
3271740	3274860	enough, but this week it hit YouTube.
3274860	3279180	There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York
3279180	3282680	City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.
3282680	3284500	It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.
3284500	3287140	I freaking missed the Wii's in Nintendo World by a week.
3287140	3291780	I missed this by a week and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.
3291780	3292780	I can't plan for shit.
3292780	3294620	I hate my life.
3294620	3297900	But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming
3297900	3298900	blogs.
3298900	3302460	And if this is showing up at the Times Square, Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of
3302460	3304620	time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.
3304620	3307980	So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.
3307980	3311520	Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.
3311520	3316140	Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.
3316140	3319100	My informed decision is poo.
3319100	3323540	Disney is having a cow.
3323540	3327740	They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.
3327740	3334980	Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.
3334980	3343480	In fact, if you get the new release for Kingdom Hearts 2 that's got all the extra goodies,
3343480	3346460	it's going to give you a little bit of a hint into the third one.
3346460	3351740	But to quote Nomura on this issue, we've already been approached by the Disney side saying
3351740	3353060	they want us to make it.
3353060	3357060	What I can say at this time is that we have various ideas, but we're not at the point
3357060	3358500	where we can say that.
3358500	3360340	It's physically impossible at the present.
3360340	3364220	I feel that it's not the right time to talk about the future of Kingdom Hearts.
3364220	3368020	So sorry, hold off, wait.
3368020	3369500	I don't want it right now, though.
3369500	3374940	Now hold on, you just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out
3374940	3377500	you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl, eeee!
3377500	3382140	No, it won't be PS3 fangirl, it'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.
3382140	3386180	I do not care what the platform is, if it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to
3386180	3387800	play the game I want to play.
3387800	3393340	It's not the system that is good, it is the game that is good, that maximizes how well
3393340	3394700	it uses the system.
3394700	3395700	This is true.
3395700	3396700	The system is the tool.
3396700	3399940	And so far no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.
3399940	3403100	Well my only problem with PlayStation 3, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier,
3403100	3406740	I think a year from now PlayStation 3 will be just fine, but right now at launch there
3406740	3407740	is zero.
3407740	3408740	Zip.
3408740	3409740	Nada.
3409740	3410740	Nothing I want.
3410740	3413640	Because half the launch games you can get, more than half you can get on another system.
3413640	3418020	And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh, meh.
3418020	3422640	But you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this in Final Fantasy 13, and
3422640	3426380	yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year, but right now I
3426380	3431220	see no need to do this crazy campout crap, there's just no need.
3431220	3435260	And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the
3435260	3439340	need to get to PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or
3439340	3440340	whatever.
3440340	3441340	Fuck that.
3441340	3442340	Fuck that.
3442340	3444340	I've kind of gone that route anyways.
3444340	3448780	It's too expensive and it's, I mean, what, Motorstorm's kind of the only thing I'm looking
3448780	3449780	forward to on that.
3449780	3455040	I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this, we're just gamers like you,
3455040	3459860	so you know what, if the realist is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the
3459860	3461540	listeners will forgive us a little bit.
3461540	3463420	Oh yeah, yeah, Jamie gets, you're special.
3463420	3466220	Well no, no, no, I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.
3466220	3470340	Alright, so you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.
3470340	3472340	Doesn't he have to play it?
3472340	3473340	Yep.
3473340	3474340	Lord help us all.
3474340	3475340	God damn it.
3475340	3477060	Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.
3477060	3480900	So I played Sonic, it's crap.
3480900	3484780	I played Gran Turismo, it's crap.
3484780	3489340	We'll see, we'll see.
3489340	3493180	Shadowslayer would like to point out, they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts
3493180	3494180	3 is for yet.
3494180	3496940	We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really
3496940	3499020	said exactly which platform it's going to be.
3499020	3501180	That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.
3501180	3504340	JVmon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.
3504340	3505340	I agree.
3505340	3509300	Oh my god, what, no, it'd be what, Hawaii World?
3509300	3512340	Well, whatever.
3512340	3519280	Anyways, so speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not.
3519280	3520280	So soon.
3520280	3525740	But, Castlevania, the film's in the works right now, and unfortunately it's being directed
3525740	3535960	by Paul W.S. Anderson, who has made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes
3535960	3543200	the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.
3543200	3544820	So is he going to take a big hit?
3544820	3546900	There's two winners to be influenced by.
3546900	3547980	Actually Blade's kind of cool.
3547980	3551300	I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic
3551300	3557340	vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.
3557340	3559180	So like Van Helsing.
3559180	3561900	Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably...
3561900	3563980	That was a waste of a movie.
3563980	3569060	I don't know, he's, okay, let me put it this way, in the spectrum of video game movies,
3569060	3570220	he's not the bottom.
3570220	3571220	So that's good.
3571220	3574980	I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.
3574980	3579300	Resident Evil, a lot of fans of that, Resident Evil, eh, not so great, I mean, Mortal Kombat
3579300	3582940	was cheesy, but you know, whatever, it was effective, it got the job done.
3582940	3588400	So I trust this guy more than I do a certain other name, director, three letters, starts
3588400	3594180	with U, ends in W. Now, now, his next movie though, I'm sorry, I will see that movie.
3594180	3596180	That is a movie that will appeal to me.
3596180	3598480	Anyway, will this movie appeal to you?
3598480	3600100	It's a new Street Fighter movie.
3600100	3606220	Yes, that is a sequel to the 1994 Street Fighter movie, which has Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul
3606220	3607980	Julia, and all that stuff.
3607980	3609940	Yes, they're making another Street Fighter movie.
3609940	3610940	What?
3610940	3612740	Will it have Kylie Minogue in it?
3612740	3613740	Probably not.
3613740	3616100	Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.
3616100	3617260	Now she has a career again.
3617260	3622980	It's just another Street Fighter movie, but this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.
3622980	3625140	So maybe they'll get Min-Na Wen back, I don't know.
3625140	3626140	She still on ER?
3626140	3627140	She was a cute Chun-Li.
3627140	3629020	She was a cute Chun-Li, so maybe she'll come back, I don't know.
3629020	3630020	Is she too old now?
3630020	3631020	I don't know.
3631020	3632020	It's been a few years.
3632020	3633020	I don't see why she would.
3633020	3634020	She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?
3634020	3635020	I don't watch TV.
3635020	3636020	There you go.
3636020	3638580	Miklotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do it.
3638580	3642020	All they're going to do is try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.
3642020	3646460	No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Time, Zhang Jie, or whatever her name is.
3646460	3647460	Zhang Jie?
3647460	3648460	Yes, her.
3648460	3654400	She'd be cool, actually, because she looks way too innocent.
3654400	3657900	But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news, because, you know, it's Hyde
3657900	3661000	Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this, apparently
3661000	3664240	in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter.
3664240	3666380	They want to get this movie out in time for.
3666380	3669180	They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?
3669180	3673580	Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.
3673580	3680820	We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with a hadoken.
3680820	3682420	We'll see what happens.
3682420	3688500	Let's see, GS68 says, new Street Fighter movie, do not want.
3688500	3693140	And Justin says, hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.
3693140	3696300	You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?
3696300	3697300	What?
3697300	3698300	That was Raul Julia's last role.
3698300	3699300	Yeah, it was kind of sad.
3699300	3704900	It's like, he's going to die with that being his last movie.
3704900	3710060	But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards, and I think the HBO
3710060	3711060	movie may have technically been.
3711060	3715380	Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter
3715380	3716380	thing.
3716380	3719700	So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his
3719700	3720700	last movie.
3720700	3722580	I do have to say, he did make a good bison.
3722580	3724380	He made a great Gomez Adams.
3724380	3725380	Oh, yeah.
3725380	3726380	I'll always remember him for it.
3726380	3727380	Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.
3727380	3728380	Eh, never saw it.
3728380	3729380	All right, anyway.
3729380	3736960	Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Adams family, but has everything
3736960	3739540	to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.
3739540	3745380	Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.
3745380	3754940	Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.
3754940	3761900	They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3, well, for
3761900	3768060	the Halo movie, I'm sorry, and so they're just, all we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.
3768060	3775420	They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for
3775420	3776420	it.
3776420	3777420	All right.
3777420	3779980	Well, that's too bad, but I guess, you know.
3779980	3787660	Which is stupid, because there's been a market for, you know, these types of sci-fi fantasy.
3787660	3790700	Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made by Halo camp, but I'll
3790700	3793420	bet you that the problem is you've got Peter Jackson attached, and they probably want a
3793420	3796900	budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie's going to cost to make.
3796900	3801900	And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses, and
3801900	3803840	there's no short dresses in Halo.
3803840	3808260	Going back to the Chun-Li movie for a minute, I want to mention from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com,
3808260	3811240	Hit Sun says, where did the Street Fighter hype come from?
3811240	3815500	In the past five years, Capcom has made one original Street Fighter character.
3815500	3820980	True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox Live release of Street Fighter.
3820980	3823860	I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.
3823860	3829220	Remember we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day, somebody was posting, where's Street
3829220	3830220	Fighter?
3830220	3831220	We want Street Fighter!
3831220	3833680	And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week,
3833680	3836480	and then it was like, where's Luminous?
3836480	3837480	Where's Luminous?
3837480	3838860	Where's Mortal Kombat 3?
3838860	3840140	Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.
3840140	3845500	I do have to say, though, that Charon in chat is my hero right now for freaking bringing
3845500	3847700	up the Ghost Rider movie, because I'm going to be there.
3847700	3850380	Why don't we get a game based on that movie?
3850380	3853320	We are, and it sucked.
3853320	3855780	It was like one of the worst games I played at E3, it was awful.
3855780	3856780	Really?
3856780	3859940	Well, no, I'm not counting that one, I mean a good one.
3859940	3865980	Yeah, the one at E3 was poopy, unless they went back and did some major re-edits to it,
3865980	3867740	don't bother with the Ghost Rider game.
3867740	3873460	Actually, you know, it came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in...
3873460	3874460	What was that game?
3874460	3875980	The motorcycle game with the chain?
3875980	3876980	Road Rash.
3876980	3878620	It was Road Rash, was the game.
3878620	3880300	I don't know why I like Road Rash.
3880300	3882820	No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.
3882820	3883820	Really exciting.
3883820	3886820	Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.
3886820	3894860	Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GameProExpo, is it the new E3?
3894860	3901000	Maybe, but they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the big show event that
3901000	3906140	was E3, and it will be in the same location as well.
3906140	3914520	Of course, they're expecting on about 30,000 attendees, no word yet though that I've seen
3914520	3921220	whether this is going to be General Mission or Industry Only, which if it's General Mission,
3921220	3923740	that's going to not be 30,000 people.
3923740	3927620	Well, but maybe they're thinking because it's a new show that won't have the name behind
3927620	3931860	it, people aren't going to be wanting to go to this, but it's all about what names they
3931860	3932860	can attract.
3932860	3936940	They can get big boosts for Nintendo and Microsoft the size of E3's boost.
3936940	3942540	I think that a show like this would be lucrative to the designers because by October, their
3942540	3946860	Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having
3946860	3950180	to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having the build in April.
3950180	3959500	They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?
3959500	3962980	It's not really any extra work that they have to do.
3962980	3967060	They're saying that it's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.
3967060	3970900	Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well like tournaments and that sort
3970900	3973500	of thing.
3973500	3976820	That's what makes me think it's General Mission because why would you do Industry Only tournaments?
3976820	3977820	That kind of defeats the purpose.
3977820	3985260	It's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.
3985260	3986260	It's just LA.
3986260	3987260	I'll probably go.
3987260	3992260	It sounds kind of exciting.
3992260	3993540	Hopefully we're able to get in.
3993540	3998940	Hopefully it's not by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be,
