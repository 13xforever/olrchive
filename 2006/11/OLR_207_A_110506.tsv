14164	25632	Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and are HD movies coming to the Xbox Marketplace?
27813	37720	Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
37760	42343	We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming related.
42927	44547	Gaming Culture, Gaming Lifestyle, etc.
68832	70633	Actually, you redid the hair, though.
70653	71553	I like this new hairstyle.
71653	73154	Yeah, my hair is pretty now.
73374	77616	We need the new promo pics for OLR, because you have way different hair now, and I've got the facial hair.
78196	84279	The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very curly.
84299	87721	And now I straightened my hair, and it's cherry red and black.
88361	90802	So I'll tell you what, chat room.
90842	94904	I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone earlier.
95624	97085	And hooray for being vulgar and offensive.
97405	97665	All right.
98347	99048	VULGAR AND OFFENSIVE
120939	128265	So remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XBStream.
128585	133609	We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program, and through iTunes we're always getting new people.
133869	137232	Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because of it.
137692	143716	I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact with...
145094	174590	Big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot So yeah, every now and then we do this annual sales conferencing with the game publishers And they bring us free stuff Not so much this year though, they didn't bring us as much free stuff Poor baby Yeah, I did get a free shirt from Eidos, so for just cause And Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda shirt Or like a communist propaganda shirt, that's what it looks like
175134	176035	It's an interesting shirt.
176095	180518	I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.
181619	181919	I don't know.
182039	182640	Maybe it's just me.
182720	183140	I'm just crazy.
185396	187857	In all seriousness, we have no guest right now.
187917	194241	I think Miklatov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show people that hang out here at the apartment.
194981	197343	But we do have our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
197363	198063	Click on chat.
198103	202906	Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar and offensive.
202946	205287	I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.
205347	207108	So, you know, they love it.
207248	211591	Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.
212391	213852	And so you will see it in a few.
214613	214833	All right.
214853	215173	Sounds good.
216140	224165	Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.
224565	227347	But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.
227367	227847	We always do.
227927	229288	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
230649	233150	My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.
233290	237973	I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.
238533	240054	I did get new games today.
242656	243136	I got...
245919	246859	What was the name of that game again?
248660	251860	No, it was... I can't believe I can't... I forgot the name of it already.
252280	254361	Oh yeah, Trauma Sensor Under the Knife.
255721	259582	So that I can, you know, cut into people and be the uber surgeon.
260942	272624	And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.
275842	276423	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
303070	309794	So I get back and, you know, because she picked up my trauma center at the time, which I need to sort of pay her back for.
310555	314837	But she hands me the bag, and it's heavy.
315638	316278	And I'm like, what?
316859	317999	And then she starts running out the door.
318019	318740	I'm like, oh, my God.
319040	321642	So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.
322042	322322	Hot.
323483	324463	Okay, whatever.
325404	329747	And then don't let me forget during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's Witness I own today.
330167	331948	Oh, it's very nice, though, of, you know,
332574	333474	That was very nice of her.
333494	334655	She's a very sweet friend.
334675	334915	She is.
335055	335635	She's very good.
335895	337535	If I could, I would do all the same for her.
337635	339336	So I'm making her a special Christmas present.
339536	339816	Right on.
340496	341716	I'm making it with finger paints.
343237	344157	How four years old of you.
344177	344777	Yeah.
344837	345898	Loki, how was your gaming week?
347598	348238	It was okay.
349599	351899	I finally got that to work.
352319	356921	Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.
357381	362062	So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.
363314	392121	and then of course I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this and none of them have covered multiplayer very well and because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is and why they did a lot of things badly for one
392938	403180	Anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice City or Vice City Stories will know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.
403440	408222	It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.
409702	415123	Okay, that in mind, the multiplayer I was really surprised because they had six different maps to choose from.
415523	417024	Or at least that's what I thought that meant.
417644	422445	But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points
423519	424380	on the same map.
424640	437349	So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks because when you're playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.
438991	441432	Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.
441573	448097	I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead and let everyone run around the full map.
449058	450099	Okay, that sucks right there.
450660	451660	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
473687	474388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
494827	495888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
522899	532224	But anyways, so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they spawn about 50 miles away, so you'll never get to the power-up anyways.
533064	542729	Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except the Hunter controls are crap, but I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around in the helicopter.
543549	545290	But multiplayer is pretty good overall.
545390	550173	If they had only made the maps a little bit smaller, hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better.
550653	552394	But right now, you know...
553456	556257	They don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid.
556417	560219	And all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff.
560279	561260	So, whatever.
562380	563501	Some comments from our chat room.
563581	564922	Zappy seems to agree with you.
565202	566462	Bleh, Vice City is meh.
566622	567663	Same old GTA.
568103	570384	Whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you.
570464	573286	I actually think having the full map and multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.
573666	573846	No.
574066	577908	If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Trust me, I play multiplayer every single day.
577928	582070	It does not make it more fun because you have to... Say, for example, you're playing a 13-minute game.
583208	586431	You have to spend a lot of time getting to where the other people are.
587231	591554	They also retweaked the weapons and how much damage they do.
591834	594276	Like the remote grenades, which used to be really devastating.
594596	596718	Now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody.
596758	597418	It's ridiculous.
597839	599660	It takes like four of them to blow up somebody.
599860	605144	And before, you can get hit from one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome.
605684	606625	But I don't know.
606665	608466	I don't like how they retweaked everything.
608806	611368	And I really wish they had thought more about the multiplayer stuff.
611843	634084	I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute but they really if they're going to put multiplayer in the game at least spend some time actually working out the tweaks working out the bugs in it because all those same bugs that were there in the first one are still there in this one so obviously they weren't working very well you know on this and we're going to probably beta test them more than they did
635183	636824	Why don't they fucking consult me?
636905	637945	That's what I want to know.
638206	645091	I've played this game more than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet they do not consult me when it comes to their multiplayer in their game.
645151	650155	I can at least give them some simple advice like, maybe put an option where you can turn off the power-ups.
650196	651136	That might be smart.
652297	653378	No one cares what you think, Loki.
653398	655500	You're just some dumb podcaster, amateur...
656351	657171	Internet Journalist.
657311	660432	I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories.
660612	661792	I will fucking kick your ass.
662252	662652	Anybody.
663132	664873	In the face of the world, anybody.
665013	665973	I will beat them down.
666113	669494	And this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games.
670054	671154	I would kick their ass.
671674	671974	Wow.
672194	672754	Strong words there.
672774	673714	Challenge to anybody.
674014	674715	Strong words there.
675735	678295	You know, you're just begging for an ass kicking with a statement like that.
678395	679055	Oh, no, I'm not.
679315	680496	All right.
681296	682136	Is that it for your gaming week?
682839	683520	That's pretty much it, yeah.
706997	708478	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
732492	737217	You know, graphics are only so much of a game, so that's really a minor bitch, all things considered.
737297	743023	Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series, in my opinion.
743323	746507	But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.
746747	747808	The game is fabulous.
748729	750871	The combat system is genius.
751251	753474	The demo doesn't give...
754054	756895	you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.
756935	767801	The combat system is great because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final Fantasy XI except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want and you don't have to put up with retards.
767861	768401	It's awesome.
768461	768861	I love it.
769361	771342	So the combat system is brilliant.
771442	771802	I love it.
772103	776445	I know it's probably going to turn off some old school fans of the Final Fantasy series but it's a nice change.
776765	777405	I think it's great.
777965	779326	The characters are awesome.
779346	781127	The story is awesome and
782786	790215	I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great, and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.
790255	796962	There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story, because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but
797520	798621	Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy VII
826315	827677	and I guess he got a prize for it.
827697	830039	I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever.
830119	831501	So, it was kind of anticlimactic.
831541	834004	And of course, they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook.
834064	835345	I'm like, no, I have a game.
835706	836526	I have GameFAQs.
836727	837648	The guidebook is sexy.
837908	841152	I know the guidebook looks nice, but I just, I couldn't justify paying the money for it.
841252	843254	I just, when GameFAQs.com is available.
843474	843574	So...
846206	846846	That's all I can say.
847507	850088	Ranma in our chatroom says Gambits and License is crap.
850529	851169	I disagree.
851469	860695	The License board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambits is really what makes the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.
861075	864217	Like, the Gambits is basically... For those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambits system basically...
864657	866679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
889096	892277	So, like, I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority.
892377	895217	If anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.
895877	899738	If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.
900498	902859	Then she will automatically cure silence.
903039	904159	She'll automatically cure poison.
904439	907519	Then her priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.
907920	914981	Then, under that, the logic is that she casts protect on my main character, Vaan, who I use as my main character right now.
915501	915681	So...
916872	922013	It's kind of like, so it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle, so she's not wasting MP.
922253	924033	It's great, so you can kind of play with this.
924053	927994	But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic available to you.
928294	932135	Like, for instance, you start with, like, only a few commands, like, hit points below 70%.
933175	937376	But if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have to buy that.
937696	941777	Or if you want to get, like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.
941857	944098	You know, it's kind of interesting, the way that all works.
944158	945618	So, I kind of think it's cool.
946198	946518	I like it.
947731	948492	That's just my opinion.
948532	949893	So I think the game is great.
951115	953277	It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.
953538	954679	It's like a 9.9 out of 10.
954959	955480	It's wonderful.
955780	956401	You have to get it.
956481	963069	Even if you don't like RPGs usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in this will get you into it.
963249	963530	I don't know.
963990	964691	That's just my thoughts.
966021	973627	Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but I realized that... I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.
974187	974748	You know what, though?
975088	977730	The demo didn't do it justice because it didn't show you the depth of it.
977990	983274	It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like, run up to a monster and rely on the auto-attack thing and maybe use the magic.
983895	984655	It didn't do it justice.
984676	985076	I was just like...
985556	986937	Get the stupid thing off the screen.
986977	988098	I want my cutscene.
988298	991741	Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.
991881	992981	You know what I meant, though?
993001	994082	I meant the cut to battle.
994342	994503	Yeah.
994803	996364	The battle screen, I guess.
996384	998866	Well, it's interesting because it means you have no random battles.
998926	1000967	And that was kind of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasies.
1001027	1003929	It's like, God damn it, I need to get to a save point because I need to go.
1004790	1005750	That's what you had.
1005931	1007612	You're walking towards a save point and then...
1008314	1015057	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.
1015117	1016578	Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.
1016918	1019719	Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.
1019859	1020159	That's true.
1020399	1022220	But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.
1022660	1024181	Oh, that is one other kind of minor.
1024861	1027723	You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.
1028323	1029924	The areas are massive.
1031404	1032165	It was the same with X.
1033504	1037047	What would you say was like the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie?
1037227	1039308	When you played Final Fantasy XI, what was the worst thing about it?
1040149	1040930	Being a white mage.
1041390	1048515	See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.
1048635	1050176	You know, you set the gamuts and they do it.
1051897	1053959	If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.
1054259	1054679	You got it.
1054779	1056020	And no one yells at you to cure them.
1056060	1056621	They'll just die.
1056681	1057101	It's awesome.
1057461	1061484	So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger.
1062642	1064143	without Toriyama's artwork.
1081676	1110711	so no other games for me to review this week and probably for the next few weeks there won't be a lot that I'm playing although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents and I did go to we were at the mall today and of course I had to look to see if they had Luminous 2 because I still kind of want it even if I am a little even if I am a little bit like see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week I got mixed up so I have to wait for Tuesday but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous right now because the Xbox one was not all that I still really want Luminous 2 and somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week and you know
1110971	1112512	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1133417	1136859	or maybe somebody will get married or they'll have a baby.
1137199	1138299	Something really big happens.
1138819	1145062	So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey, maybe we'll get involved in November Sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.
1145602	1147163	And tonight we have a surprise for you guys.
1147223	1149004	And this is something we've been hinting at for a little while.
1149764	1157328	But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes or XBStream or however you're doing it,
1158806	1163068	Orange Lounge Radio is actually a live streaming radio station, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
1163148	1169750	This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then, you know, broadcasted over the MP3s.
1170370	1172771	But we do have live-only shows that air throughout the week.
1172831	1175652	For instance, Tuesday night, DarkSakura does her Pump Up the Volume.
1175672	1178013	It's just her, and she plays some indie band music for you guys.
1179093	1184195	Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is kind of about pop culture stuff.
1184953	1189174	And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.
1189294	1190274	So let's go to the tape.
1196335	1198195	Do you want to listen to me?
1199736	1201756	Because if you do, then I should warn you.
1201776	1206917	Because if you do, I should warn you.
1207177	1208497	You're going to hear all sorts of things.
1209837	1210758	Hits from the past.
1211878	1212838	Crap from the future.
1213860	1215362	Travis Donovan Live, coming to Orange Lounge Radio
1237153	1237973	Orange Lounge Radio
1261778	1264521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1281656	1282277	Thank you for watching.
1282297	1282937	See you next time.
1310762	1311222	Halo 3 Halo 3 Halo 3
1340314	1358582	With such a date like this, you have to kind of wonder, okay, well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, you know, we haven't gotten, according to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement.
1358602	1366445	Of course, Microsoft hasn't made an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside Microsoft, March 14th.
1367677	1371520	Which makes sense, because that's when the big games came out last year.
1372161	1376304	March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies, including Microsoft.
1376944	1381768	So, March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo.
1383817	1384558	Yeah, that's pretty cool.
1384798	1385538	Okay, now wait a minute.
1385558	1388160	I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing you're saying there.
1388220	1396846	So, again, let's look at the evidence and why, you know, because most people are assuming that Christmas window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3.
1397186	1403370	But now we've had several, like, random things pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?
1403390	1408594	Because I remember a few episodes ago you had the marketing folks that came to your work and they told you spring, right?
1408614	1409754	Well, this wasn't the marketing guy.
1409774	1412516	This is their head of sales at Microsoft.
1414257	1415158	I can't remember his name.
1415178	1415998	I want to say Dave.
1416258	1422181	But anyways, he said March or April was the target date for Halo.
1422981	1434986	And this makes sense because, you know, how would you love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really good.
1436448	1440791	because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways, Halo Wars.
1440931	1443913	So you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.
1445154	1445534	Interesting.
1446711	1448232	You know what's interesting?
1448272	1456897	Obviously, when you posted this in the show role thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different source, let's just say I have a friend.
1457497	1461559	I know you all hate these friend of a friend things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place, right?
1462040	1466382	I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain company.
1466742	1473765	Large Magazine Company, who's had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to be spring of 07.
1473865	1475946	Well, of course it's going to be spring of 07.
1476626	1480207	Now, and I would think this makes very good sense.
1480287	1485609	It's not going to be February, because I thought originally it might be February or something like that, but February's usually dead.
1485649	1492132	It's kind of still that dead point from December to March, where nothing really comes out.
1492812	1492912	Um,
1494059	1494139	E.A.
1494159	1494519	Replay 2 E.A.
1494539	1494740	Replay 2
1524494	1529516	MVP07, NCAA Baseball, also that same date.
1530296	1539760	And then finally, Two Worlds for Xbox 360, which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th.
1540220	1541881	So lots of good stuff.
1542781	1548624	I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, Home Court, but I think the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.
1549464	1550505	But fun stuff.
1551065	1551325	All right.
1551949	1555794	Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?
1556134	1557616	I think I saw it on a blog somewhere.
1558237	1558878	It's interesting.
1558958	1559578	It's interesting.
1559598	1562922	I actually have that pre-ordered because I want that for my desk.
1563844	1564204	All right.
1565222	1566343	I hope that turns out to be true.
1566823	1569025	I mean, a lot of signs point to that.
1569125	1575651	Why the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3?
1575911	1577012	I don't know.
1577032	1579594	There's just a lot of things that kind of make that look probable.
1579794	1580835	I mean, we might be wrong.
1581696	1584478	It might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.
1584558	1586960	It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong.
1587160	1590223	There are delay issues for different reasons.
1590263	1591304	I mean, it's just like, you know...
1591884	1595065	or folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray.
1595265	1602727	But at the same time, if these magazines are getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate to me the game is pretty close to completion.
1603047	1603527	I think so.
1603627	1605108	And here's the thing about it, though.
1605648	1613290	And no one seems to pay attention to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big chunks.
1613330	1617691	You've got the spring releases, which take place mostly in March.
1618311	1619752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1646096	1653063	And then for the holiday season, you've still got your Halo Wars that you can also push out there as well.
1653203	1656646	So they're covered in both sections of the year.
1656666	1658809	I don't know, that makes sense to me.
1659409	1660190	We'll see what happens.
1661127	1662028	We will see you all in time.
1678383	1678864	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1700560	1712170	Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong But what's interesting, Japan is getting some exclusives They are the only ones that are getting Gradius And what's very interesting, I think, is that they're the only ones getting Super Mario Bros.
1713191	1716273	So, kind of strange there Oh, also, how could I forget this one?
1716293	1728904	Solomon's Key I played that game a lot I think those are launch games I thought it was until the end of the year I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than us And I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for us
1729484	1730045	Well, we'll see.
1730065	1732547	Because Europe is getting some games that we're not either.
1733147	1733387	Right.
1734368	1737730	I want to say that, I don't know, it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.
1738071	1738591	Well, alright.
1738951	1744215	Now, what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey Kong Country, but the other two regions are.
1744516	1756845	All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and SimCity, but then Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra 3, Super Castlevania 4, Street Fighter 2, and Zelda A Link to the Past.
1757425	1762087	The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.
1762528	1766970	Then you go over to Sega Genesis and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.
1767230	1777735	You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same game anyway.
1778195	1786421	Sonic the Hedgehog, ToeJam & Earl The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?
1786521	1791985	Yeah, that was the one with the dog That game was freaking awesome But yet there's no Shinobi listed, that's kind of weird
1792754	1793775	Shadow Dancer was a better game.
1794215	1794515	Oh, whatever.
1795235	1809562	On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions getting Bonks Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and Superstar Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman 94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.
1810782	1814084	Victory Run, not coming to the U.S., but is coming to Japan.
1814164	1818666	I'm sorry, not going to Europe, but is going to Japan and the U.S., so.
1819452	1820652	I'm also going, where's Dracula X?
1844955	1846436	Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.
1846756	1857102	Only the one in Japan, so... Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, you know, while they're looking at the... And they could easily encode it, you know, memory storage being what it is now.
1857503	1867509	They could easily move a whole CD game into... Because the thing that took up the most room on those discs was the Red Book Audio.
1869010	1872191	Well, we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.
1872272	1874533	It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?
1875134	1878696	Imagine if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia.
1878836	1879336	That'd be cool.
1881337	1883918	Alright, so that's all I've got to say on the Virtual Console.
1885739	1887420	Well, I've got news.
1888120	1893503	But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.
1895164	1904408	Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.
1907396	1910256	In the magazine it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.
1910296	1912717	That was a typo.
1913137	1916858	Yeah, they went back and Nintendo themselves said that.
1917298	1931381	Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released at launch in the UK.
1931461	1933002	So you should have no problem getting that.
1933022	1934342	You won't have to import that.
1937867	1938487	That's pretty cool.
1939368	1941329	I know there are some other secrets out there.
1941869	1948372	I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us some high def later on or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy.
1948532	1950793	Who says they can't?
1952354	1956176	Microsoft upgraded their display output, so why not?
1956956	1957676	They can do stuff.
1958517	1959657	Because it's just not their thing.
1959877	1960858	That's not their thing right now.
1961533	1968539	Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher can say, I want to make my game 720, damn it!
1969680	1970441	We'll see.
1970721	1971642	I don't know.
1972162	1977186	Anyways, there's some other stuff released this week, actually, about the Virtual Console.
1977207	1981931	Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.
1982691	1984573	It's going to be interesting to find out, actually, that
1985592	1993996	You'll be able to store your games to the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.
1994756	2003840	You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, where you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your Mario Brothers there.
2004360	2012144	But you can, however, re-download the games, kind of typical with Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.
2013673	2041470	and um some interesting stuff they're talking about how the virtual console stuff you'll be able to use um the standard Wii Remote actually for NES games by turning it on its side which you know ever since I saw that Wii Remote and they announced the virtual console I knew they were going to be able to do that and as well as using the GameCube pads also if you don't want to spend money on the uh classic controller you can use that as well so that's kind of neat and um
2042386	2043767	Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.
2043807	2046548	That's all about the information that they have on that.
2048108	2050049	Comments regarding high definition from our chatroom.
2050729	2053090	PooEater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.
2053110	2059232	I could give a crap less about $1,296,000,000 or whatever.
2059673	2061633	No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.
2061653	2064094	They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.
2064594	2065375	So that's kind of neat.
2065535	2066295	Oh, that is kind of neat.
2066595	2068776	That's like the iTunes books you get.
2069941	2078047	Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there something a while ago about how Nintendo totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming type thing?
2078147	2081230	I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.
2081810	2082310	Was it Sony?
2082370	2082691	I don't know.
2083852	2085553	Somebody wanted to use iTunes as a model?
2086193	2089196	Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.
2090977	2092218	My bad, I got it mixed up then.
2093229	2094110	and DarkSakura.com
2115400	2128944	and it shows in the sound options menu that there's an SD card option in the menu and so it's being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as custom soundtracks in the game.
2129264	2142749	No official word from Nintendo just yet, but this screenshot sure does make things look interesting and since Nintendo has said that there's still some secrets yet to be revealed, this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.
2143249	2144009	Who knows?
2144548	2145329	But that would be kind of neat.
2146309	2150292	I like to use custom soundtracks on 360, unless I'm playing DDR or something.
2150332	2150912	Oh wait, no, just kidding.
2150952	2151693	I can't play DDR on 360.
2151973	2156196	Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that, because that kind of would break the game.
2157096	2159758	But most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.
2162120	2170866	Well, speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of a character in Super Smash Bros.
2170926	2171286	Brawl.
2171746	2172867	Fox McCloud is showing up.
2173719	2179403	And from what I can tell, I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.
2180283	2187268	Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time zero suit.
2189189	2193211	There's also Solid Snake and Wario.
2196994	2199195	Which I am going to have that game so fast.
2199778	2202860	I was kind of disappointed that they didn't announce something new.
2203040	2204861	I mean, we've had Fox before.
2204881	2206282	Even in every single game.
2206422	2207943	Yeah, but, I mean, okay, big deal.
2207963	2211045	They gave them a staff this time, so... Ooh, staff!
2211145	2213267	It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.
2213907	2216309	Great, so they gave us a crappy game, Fox.
2216329	2219250	Great, thank you for reminding us that they made that game.
2219331	2219911	Seriously.
2222934	2227538	We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.
2227578	2234843	We were hoping to... Well, I know you didn't plan it, Jamie, but... I was like, I didn't think that story... We did that on purpose.
2234883	2237464	I want the game anyway, but I personally don't care about Fox News.
2237485	2243749	We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character... Because they've said that there are going to be other third-party characters.
2243769	2248512	That'd be almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi.
2248812	2250193	Didn't see that coming.
2251094	2252295	I want Raiden to be in it.
2252952	2253753	That'd be funny.
2254713	2262118	Our new secret character is... A defective NES card where you have to blow on it.
2262758	2264699	The new fighter is Pantsless Rage.
2265480	2265980	Oh, God.
2266541	2266881	Anyways.
2266941	2267721	Moving on.
2268702	2280249	So, anyway, some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week, in fact, in the form of an episode of South Park where Cartman's actually waiting for the Wii to come out at... It was quite funny.
2280589	2281030	And a...
2282017	2282077	E.L.
2282097	2282237	or E.B.
2310305	2311306	I about cried.
2311326	2315107	I about cried the last... I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal.
2315388	2319149	Like the last minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up.
2319770	2320470	I about cried.
2320510	2321170	It was so funny.
2321951	2323011	This is making me laugh.
2323992	2327613	GS68 in the chatroom says a new secret character, Ken Kudaragi.
2327934	2328834	He wields a crayon sword.
2330835	2331255	He can't.
2331295	2331915	He's going to eat it.
2332336	2333696	Maybe Cartman's the secret character.
2333736	2334036	Who knows?
2334557	2335037	That's the joke.
2335983	2350612	It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that would probably be the big joke.
2351092	2354054	But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.
2354414	2363080	But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty funny.
2363660	2364220	So, anyway.
2366109	2367029	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2390080	2391461	GameCube component cables
2412626	2417188	in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will component cables be available on day one?
2417228	2419588	Kaplan said, yes, at retail and online.
2419668	2424770	Best Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com if you still want to go the online route.
2425830	2431692	Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing to lattes.
2431912	2433733	I didn't get that, but whatever.
2433993	2437374	I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.
2438875	2439695	That makes me very happy.
2441593	2442514	She's insane.
2442554	2443834	Does that make you a happy panda?
2444335	2444515	Yes.
2445715	2447296	She's a crazy, crazy person.
2448597	2448957	Anyways.
2449818	2450918	What the hell was that?
2450938	2457322	It was, no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.
2457342	2463145	It's like, I love Gnarl Sparkly as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing that damn song every time I open up my AIM.
2463185	2464966	You must not like them very much because I don't like them.
2466747	2469028	No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.
2469849	2470489	I like Danger Mouse.
2472126	2482614	Speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play sounds when you don't expect it to, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.
2484276	2484716	Frightening.
2484996	2485417	Cool!
2485457	2486898	Silent Hill 5, finally?
2487138	2488099	Confirmation?
2488659	2488880	What?
2489400	2495005	It's called Otonari Yoku, which means adult power.
2496107	2497128	Adult Power, huh?
2497168	2498929	So is this one of, like, those games?
2499069	2503833	It's a self-help guide to improving your relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.
2504253	2505374	Boring!
2507015	2516262	But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin'... I don't have... It's gonna sell like... Not in this country.
2516702	2517083	In Japan.
2518284	2519725	And, like, five people will import it.
2520165	2521626	And go, I can't read Japanese!
2522647	2525229	Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?
2525976	2527478	Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.
2529120	2531723	Oh, kind of like how he feels like... He's scared us from here.
2532065	2542271	He feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know, like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.
2542491	2544052	What the hell do you do in adult training?
2544352	2550615	No, I think that it'll do, like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, sirens go off, the world gets dark.
2551156	2554157	Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends.
2554398	2558560	I mean, what exactly is going to be trained in this game?
2560177	2565381	Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's accidental.
2565781	2566842	Oops, I crapped my pants.
2569064	2570385	So that's not a good comparison.
2571385	2571906	Nonsense.
2571946	2573607	It's all about control.
2574148	2576149	The thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.
2577370	2580312	Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult, never mind, forget it.
2580532	2583074	No, it was, I was going to ask for Saturday Night Live.
2583915	2584715	Oops, I crapped my pants.
2584816	2585556	Never mind, forget it.
2586016	2586617	But I don't know.
2588238	2592762	I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for elementary school kids.
2594243	2595264	So, you know, in America.
2596424	2597946	So that everyone gets good manners.
2599107	2601769	Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.
2602189	2602789	You know what?
2602929	2604971	I have really good freaking manners, okay?
2605632	2606832	I am so polite.
2607713	2613858	I hold the doors open for people, I smile and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when I think they're being retards.
2614859	2616720	You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.
2616780	2616940	I did!
2616960	2617741	See, I'm nice!
2619097	2620338	I am the nicest person.
2641736	2649300	So, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?
2650181	2651982	Everything possible.
2652422	2654483	They are shipping it by any means possible.
2654543	2659666	Planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name it.
2660107	2660607	Horseback?
2661828	2662148	Yes.
2662968	2666290	Little immigrants too, pulling the crates, you know.
2667030	2668491	Yeah, so any means necessary.
2668811	2671273	Not a huge surprise, but it's nice to
2671960	2672841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2688511	2696197	Now, Miklatov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit because you have certain fears you've expressed to me before.
2696678	2701141	So how do you feel if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?
2701542	2703924	I would cry because I hate UPS.
2704404	2706826	But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS.
2706846	2708467	You've told me you have a fear of UPS.
2708547	2709668	It's a little bit of both.
2709828	2710969	It's all from high school.
2711330	2712010	Tell us your fears.
2712591	2713431	Okay, my fears?
2714012	2716834	Okay, UPS, water, sheep.
2717496	2718196	Flying Bugs.
2718276	2719977	Okay, so water, sheep, and flying bugs.
2720237	2727939	So if a UPS man ever delivered you a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.
2728639	2730080	I would probably just die on the spot.
2730100	2730960	That's like Silent Hill to you.
2731000	2732701	Okay, so why the UPS fear?
2732741	2734461	That has nothing to do with video games.
2734641	2735502	No, but I'm curious.
2736202	2736902	That's just like...
2737645	2751995	When I was in high school, my bus stop was next to UPS Center, and I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.
2754897	2756838	You don't get much more stupid than I have.
2756858	2758960	What would that be, Universal Pwnage Service?
2759961	2761942	I don't know, I just hate them, and they frighten me.
2764545	2767308	I thought maybe like a UPS man beat you up once or something.
2767328	2771593	No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop watching all the trucks go by.
2771893	2774856	And the best part was it was apparently next to a UPS center.
2775217	2776999	And I didn't know that, but I still figured.
2777179	2779101	Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.
2779401	2780022	Show me on the doll.
2780442	2780843	Nowhere.
2780883	2783566	I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.
2786740	2789682	Usagi in our chatroom agrees UPS is the spawn of Satan.
2789902	2791683	I've never had a problem with UPS.
2791903	2792503	I hate them.
2792603	2795885	In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.
2796145	2796545	No such thing.
2796645	2796966	You know what?
2797046	2800167	If they're attractive... At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.
2800187	2801408	This is years before my current job.
2801468	2803249	I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.
2804309	2807171	If they're hot, that means they're really evil.
2808852	2809112	All right.
2810140	2812162	Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.
2812222	2812862	That's what I said.
2813002	2813523	Well, you know.
2813983	2822870	If people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can listen to.
2823190	2826713	Where would you listen to fears about insects and sheep and water?
2826733	2827434	Exactly.
2827634	2834940	You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to do with gaming.
2835500	2837321	Jamie, you're going to make me cry.
2837842	2839183	And when I cry, I get stabby.
2839762	2841663	I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.
2841783	2843124	You know what, they're close enough.
2843184	2843985	Did goats scare you?
2845086	2846707	You know what, I haven't been... What about llamas?
2847127	2847667	Llamas, no.
2847927	2850169	Okay, no, I'm really ready to get back in the game now.
2850189	2853051	Llamas have to do with Tempest, so there you go.
2853371	2854772	Where were llamas in Tempest?
2855072	2857914	Isn't that one guy that makes Tempest something to do with a llama?
2857934	2859315	Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here.
2859355	2860936	Wait, no, I have a question.
2860956	2863898	How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?
2864698	2866539	I feel that they deserve to buy things.
2866799	2867799	Well, guess what?
2867879	2873360	They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.
2873740	2876321	It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.
2876381	2876781	No, no, no.
2877141	2883543	Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.
2883623	2887144	If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.
2887784	2889084	Best Buy employees aren't shut out.
2890402	2891683	Circuit City and CompUSA
2913212	2914313	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2942150	2942770	or Kmart.
2942850	2944671	I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart.
2945772	2946593	And with good reason.
2946893	2950635	But Kmart, I'm telling you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.
2950935	2951315	You know what?
2951355	2954217	I don't have to camp out for a PlayStation 3.
2955357	2956838	I don't either because I'm not getting one.
2957218	2958419	Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.
2959220	2968785	Well, you want to know what's funny is that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else because our credit card was special.
2969346	2972467	But speaking of special... Actually, I wanted to say real quick.
2972667	2972887	What?
2973248	2980811	Neologism, totally mispronouncing his name, 82, says Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.
2981131	2982972	Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.
2983912	2984452	So what does it matter?
2984992	2988354	But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, Ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.
2988454	2988794	Damn it.
2990275	2991335	You open your mouth.
2991355	2993736	If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.
2994520	2995880	I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.
2995920	2996720	You better back that up.
2996981	2998741	I'm going to the one on How.
2999121	3000941	Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.
3001241	3004502	Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.
3004562	3005242	Never mind, forget it.
3005402	3007623	No, that was actually, I was like, oh, Rob is being clever.
3007903	3008523	Don't listen to me.
3008923	3009963	Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.
3009983	3010523	This is the JV show.
3010803	3016004	Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on, there's still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?
3016565	3017405	That's the one I'm going to.
3017525	3018785	Yes, that's the ticket.
3019225	3019625	Go there.
3020305	3021686	No, it's not on Antelope, it's Auburn.
3021846	3023386	Whatever, whatever, anyway.
3024142	3026623	Yeah, here's your Sacramento direction thing.
3027263	3032904	Okay, well, back to the PS3.
3033905	3036245	I hate you, Best Buy, you bitches.
3037086	3040166	Okay, I really don't hate any... Okay, I will rephrase that.
3040586	3043427	I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.
3043567	3046188	I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.
3047332	3053454	18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3 and they're not doing anything for the Wii.
3053954	3054594	You know why?
3054654	3055974	Because Nintendo loves us.
3056654	3058195	And they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.
3059455	3062676	So there are 18 stores total.
3062816	3064116	It's going to be in these cities.
3064616	3065657	Park Lane, Texas.
3067717	3069097	West Los Angeles, California.
3069617	3070278	Chesterfield.
3070618	3071458	Is that... Is M.O.
3071498	3071898	Montana?
3072658	3072898	Yeah.
3073899	3074179	No, M.O.
3074239	3074619	is Missouri.
3074659	3074999	Missouri.
3075019	3075819	I don't know why I thought that.
3076640	3103076	El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria, Texas, Butterfield, Illinois, West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York,
3106250	3108733	Landmark Massachusetts, and Midtown Manhattan.
3109013	3110655	Seriously kids, why bother though?
3111055	3111515	Why bother?
3111615	3111936	Because...
3112797	3126388	Some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games all day long that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can I get Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.
3126928	3128249	So you're screwed.
3128429	3129190	So why bother?
3129350	3134874	I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing it, people are going to be driving in from far away.
3135195	3136396	Somebody is going to beat you to it.
3136616	3137937	So I say why bother?
3139744	3145487	If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.
3146908	3149009	Just go to any big blog you look at.
3149049	3149830	They all have the list.
3150150	3154732	For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.
3156493	3158634	So, yeah.
3158754	3159595	Have fun waiting in line.
3161499	3161960	Now, I don't know.
3162000	3168063	Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid?
3168103	3169284	Like, oh, wait for PlayStation 3.
3169344	3170385	If I can make fun of them.
3170585	3171645	Do we really got to do that?
3171665	3173647	I mean, seriously, everybody else says that.
3174107	3180431	It's just like, that's like reporting on the fucking groundhog, you know, and seeing his shadow or not.
3180471	3181611	I mean, that's just retarded.
3181751	3184833	Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone to steal it.
3185153	3186394	I have a good idea for a parody.
3186754	3189496	Also, to answer questions from the chat room, um, uh,
3190014	3199277	The Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is $6.09, and the Midtown one is $10.28, so that you can look online and see what stores those are.
3199317	3199737	I don't know.
3200837	3202238	I just whispered my parody to Loki.
3202258	3202638	You like that?
3203138	3203498	I like that.
3203518	3205179	Okay, we're going to do that instead, okay?
3205219	3205559	All right.
3205939	3206699	So good luck.
3209540	3209900	All right.
3210260	3212841	I totally missed it because I was doing my job.
3214482	3218583	Anyways, there's some interesting things in, you know,
3219161	3229404	Japan might be waiting a little longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another one-fifth of their initial launch PS3s.
3229524	3234045	Instead of getting 100,000 units at launch, they're going to be getting closer to 80,000.
3234225	3237466	And that kind of sucks.
3237486	3243348	Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United States.
3244408	3246789	So, oh well, kind of seemed
3247446	3252068	Same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week, so... Yeah.
3253349	3254029	Sucks to be them.
3254489	3257591	Sucks to be UK even more, though, because they have to wait until March.
3259795	3266817	Well, it sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City, because that's the only place right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing this.
3266917	3271958	I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America, and we'll hit a store near you soon enough.
3272899	3274719	But this week it hit YouTube.
3274739	3282621	There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.
3282661	3284302	It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.
3284562	3287083	I freaking missed the Wii's and Nintendo World by a week.
3287223	3288343	I missed this by a week.
3289019	3291740	and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.
3291820	3292780	I can't plan for shit.
3292820	3293340	I hate my life.
3294520	3298201	But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming blogs.
3298761	3304382	And if this is showing up at the Times Square Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.
3304562	3307383	So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.
3308323	3311143	Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.
3311223	3316004	Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.
3316124	3317425	My informed decision is poo.
3318385	3318745	Anyway.
3320339	3322121	Disney is having a cow.
3323502	3326785	They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.
3327726	3334893	Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.
3334993	3337795	In fact, if you get the new...
3339637	3341598	I don't want it right now though
3369460	3370060	Now, hold on.
3370100	3377142	You just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl!
3377722	3379262	No, it won't be PS3 fangirl.
3379342	3380922	It'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.
3382223	3383923	I do not care what the platform is.
3384003	3387264	If it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to play the game I want to play.
3387704	3390364	It's not the system that is good.
3390464	3394325	It is the game that is good, that maximizes how well it uses the system.
3394625	3395945	The system is the tool.
3396285	3399186	And so far, no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.
3399867	3403111	Well, my only problem with PlayStation, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier.
3403151	3405635	I think a year from now, PlayStation 3 will be just fine.
3405675	3409420	But right now at launch, there is zero, zip, nada, nothing I want.
3409760	3413085	Because half the launch games you can get, and more than half you can get on another system.
3413585	3416028	And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh.
3416950	3417150	Meh.
3417884	3421965	But, you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this and Final Fantasy XIII.
3422525	3425786	And, yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year.
3425846	3429027	But right now, I see no need to do this crazy campout crap.
3429427	3430107	There's just no need.
3430527	3439389	And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the need to get the PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or whatever.
3439629	3440150	Fuck that.
3440490	3440990	Fuck that.
3442430	3444191	I've kind of gone that route anyways.
3444251	3445491	It's too expensive, and it's...
3446528	3447048	I mean, what?
3447369	3449170	Motorstorm is kind of the only thing I'm looking forward to.
3449390	3453412	I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this.
3453472	3454893	We're just gamers like you.
3454973	3455634	So you know what?
3456034	3461317	If the real list is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the listeners will forgive us a little bit.
3461657	3462358	Oh, yeah, yeah.
3462418	3463718	Jamie, you're special.
3463759	3466000	I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.
3466140	3466540	All right.
3466580	3470322	So you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.
3470763	3470943	Yep.
3471783	3472524	Lord help us all.
3472544	3472804	God damn it.
3473767	3476949	Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.
3476989	3478050	So I played Sonic.
3478350	3478990	It's crap.
3481072	3482733	I played Gran Turismo.
3482913	3483593	It's crap.
3484634	3485555	We'll see, we'll see.
3489458	3493901	Shadowslayer would like to point out they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts 3 is for yet.
3493921	3498824	We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really said exactly which platform it's going to be.
3498924	3500986	That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.
3501557	3504019	JV Mon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.
3504400	3504740	I agree.
3505320	3505841	Oh my god.
3505941	3506821	It'd be what?
3506881	3507662	Hawaii World?
3508343	3508843	Well, whatever.
3511505	3513106	Anyways.
3514207	3521113	So speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not so soon, but Castlevania.
3521633	3527758	The film's in the works right now and unfortunately it's being directed by Paul W.S.
3527958	3528959	Anderson who has
3529639	3541563	made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.
3543144	3544824	So, is he going to take a big poop?
3544844	3547725	There's two winners to be influenced, but actually Blade's kind of cool.
3548105	3556008	I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.
3557289	3558549	So, like Van Helsing.
3559973	3562494	Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably... That was a waste of a movie.
3564054	3564394	I don't know.
3564414	3565514	Okay, let me put it this way.
3565554	3569856	In the spectrum of video game movies, he's not the bottom.
3570156	3571596	So that's good.
3571916	3574137	I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.
3574157	3575777	Mortal Kombat was Resident Evil.
3575797	3576677	A lot of fans of that.
3576777	3578318	Resident Evil, eh, not so great.
3578338	3580978	I mean, Mortal Kombat was cheesy, but, you know, whatever.
3581058	3581519	It was effective.
3581539	3582259	It got the job done.
3582299	3583139	Yeah, so...
3583692	3583852	What?
3583872	3584032	What?
3584052	3584132	What?
3610765	3611906	We'll have Kylie Minogue in it?
3612426	3612986	Probably not.
3613086	3616808	Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.
3617208	3619309	It's just another Street Fighter movie.
3619569	3622170	But this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.
3622930	3624331	So maybe they'll get Ming-Na Wen back.
3624391	3624731	I don't know.
3625091	3625872	She's still on ER?
3626172	3627052	She was a cute Chun-Li.
3627092	3627872	She was a cute Chun-Li.
3627892	3628613	So maybe she'll come back.
3628653	3628893	I don't know.
3628913	3629633	Is she too old now?
3630133	3630414	I don't know.
3630434	3630974	It's been a few years.
3630994	3632254	I don't see why she would.
3632274	3633475	She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?
3634870	3635710	I don't watch TV.
3635750	3636191	There you go.
3636611	3638492	Mikotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do this.
3638512	3641913	All they're going to do is just try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.
3641953	3646295	No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Tide, Zhang Ji, or whatever her name is.
3646535	3647195	Zhang Ji?
3647295	3647755	Yes, her.
3649296	3651017	She'd be cool, actually, because she's...
3652469	3654110	She looks way too innocent.
3654330	3660353	But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news because, you know, it's Hyde Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this.
3660693	3666116	Apparently in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter, they want to get this movie out in time for.
3666136	3668737	They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?
3669017	3673159	No, Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.
3673539	3678762	We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with, you know, a Hadouken.
3680673	3681794	We'll see what happens.
3682874	3683234	Let's see.
3684195	3686596	GS68 in our chatroom says, New Street Fighter movie?
3686796	3687476	Do not want.
3688397	3692098	And Justin says, Hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.
3693079	3696180	You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?
3696440	3696680	What?
3696700	3698121	That was Raul Julia's last role.
3698241	3699101	Yeah, it was kind of sad.
3699401	3701242	It's like, he's going to die.
3702116	3704597	with that being his last movie.
3704737	3708978	But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards.
3709018	3715479	And I think the HBO movie may have technically been... Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter thing.
3715539	3720260	So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his last movie.
3720320	3721840	I do have to say he did make a good bison.
3722540	3724481	He made a great Gomez Adams.
3724721	3725061	Oh, yeah.
3725321	3726141	I'll always remember him for it.
3726161	3727101	Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.
3727542	3728182	Eh, never saw it.
3728982	3729482	All right, anyway.
3731863	3739388	Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Addams Family, but has everything to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.
3739569	3745092	Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.
3746233	3752578	Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.
3754662	3760005	They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3.
3761626	3762946	Well, for the Halo movie, I'm sorry.
3763086	3767269	All we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.
3768029	3775453	They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for it.
3778434	3779035	Well, that's too bad.
3779695	3781276	Which is stupid, because...
3782421	3786567	There's been a market for these type of sci-fi fantasy.
3787508	3790572	Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made but Halo can't?
3790592	3796820	But I'll bet you the problem is you got Peter Jackson attached and they probably want a budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie is going to cost to make.
3796860	3800605	And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses.
3801669	3803230	And there's no short dresses in Halo.
3815726	3821068	True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox live release of Street Fighter.
3821188	3823588	I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.
3823628	3826829	Remember, we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day.
3826909	3829830	Somebody was posting, where's Street Fighter?
3829890	3831070	We want Street Fighter.
3831090	3833571	And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week.
3833611	3836052	And then it was like, where's Luminous?
3836192	3837252	Where's Luminous?
3837292	3838712	Where's Mortal Kombat 3?
3840413	3843994	I do have to say, though, that Sharon is my hero right now.
3844014	3844434	Hmm.
3844938	3845538	Thanks for watching!
3869324	3874085	It came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in... What was that game?
3874165	3875685	The motorcycle game with the chain?
3875925	3876806	Road Rash.
3876886	3878566	It was Road Rash, was the game.
3878866	3879946	I don't know, I like Road Rash.
3880646	3882607	No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.
3882647	3882947	Do we?
3883327	3883747	Exciting.
3883767	3885027	Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.
3886708	3892589	Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GamePro Expo.
3893129	3894169	Is it the new E3?
3894589	3895029	Maybe.
3895769	3898810	But they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the
3899760	3902742	Big Show Event E3 General Mission or Industry Only
3920103	3920603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3941215	3950043	By October, their Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having to build in April.
3950063	3958311	They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?
3958391	3961814	I mean, it's not really any extra work that they have to do.
3962543	3966985	But they're saying that's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.
3967065	3971386	Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well, like tournaments and that sort of thing.
3972767	3976668	See, that's what makes me think it's general mission, because why would you do industry-only tournaments?
3976708	3977729	That kind of defeats purpose.
3977949	3982751	And it's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.
3984551	3985992	It's just L.A.
3986112	3986912	I'll probably go.
3987232	3988113	It sounds kind of exciting.
3988793	3989113	Definitely.
3989413	3989773	I'll be there.
3989994	3990174	Yeah.
3990514	3991214	So, I mean.
3991874	4001652	hopefully we're able to get in hopefully it's not, you know, by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be but we'll see, we'll see alright, well
4002062	4005745	That's it for the news here in this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.
