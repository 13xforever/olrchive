[SPEAKER_06]: Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend, or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out, or a current-gen user who's not upgrading to next-gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this program.

[SPEAKER_06]: We, here at Orange Launch Radio, are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off Part B. If you want to know the details, you have to listen to Part A. Remember, Orange Launch Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.

5
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:03,565
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Part A, which comes out on Monday, and Part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.

6
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:05,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Our chat room is eagerly standing by.

00:01:05,926 --> 00:01:08,628

11
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:24,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, God.

12
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:26,306

[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

15
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's no other reason for it.

16

[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's stop stalling.

17
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:34,169

18
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:34,969
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

19
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm now going to pull up random.org.

20
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So, John, you're going to be picking.

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pulling ten random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away.

22
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:42,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

23
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:46,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is going to tell me which one of the ten numbers I'm picking right now.

24
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:47,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

27
00:01:49,198 --> 00:01:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever email is number six on that list.

28
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Number five, six.

29
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:55,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is great.

30
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:55,764
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

31
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what number six is?

32
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,165
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

33
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It was email number 37.

34
00:01:58,867 --> 00:01:59,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

35
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:00,628
[SPEAKER_06]: In a row?

36
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,309
[SPEAKER_14]: In a row?

37
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I know how it's coming.

38
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:02,390
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

39
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's count them out.

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR or any of that stuff.

41
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:16,442
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-nine,

00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,982

00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:25,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look who won it.

46
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:31,390
[SPEAKER_06]: This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.

47
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,611
[SPEAKER_06]: This person is going to be very excited.

48
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give him a call right now.

49
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:38,695
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's give him a call right now.

[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, did somebody order a pizza?

57
00:02:55,972 --> 00:02:56,392
[SPEAKER_06]: We're kidding.

58
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:57,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this Raven's Dolphin?

59
00:02:57,753 --> 00:02:59,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

80
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,372
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd go crazy too if I were you.

81
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:39,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations.

82
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,013
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to do?

83
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,954
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to do with your Wii?

84
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:44,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you already own a Wii?

85
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: No, uh...

86
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:47,406
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sort of.

00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:47,947
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

88
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of?

89
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,027
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that mean?

90
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:52,509
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I do, but I have plans for this.

91
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what's the plans for this?

92
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:58,813

00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,935

95
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the question is, I'm not going to sell on eBay.

96
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

97
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:11,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.

98
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:12,081
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very generous.

99
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very cool.

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

109
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,691
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as I have you on the line.

110
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:32,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

111
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:35,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Rayman's Raving Rabbits.

116
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:42,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

00:04:47,185 --> 00:05:04,708
[SPEAKER_08]: and you beat the little rabbits to death and it reminds me so much of you and I enjoy it because they play girls that want to have fun and it's such enjoyable alright I haven't played that minigame yet, I'm sorry I guess you did would girls just want to have fun?

119
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:16,950

120
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe I won.

121
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:29,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the fact that he may or may not already own a Wii.

122
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

123
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's fair and square.

124
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: We said it at the front.

125
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:34,784
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, whoever wants to enter the contest can.

126
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:37,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And it sounds like he's got really good plans for the Wii.

127
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:41,326
[SPEAKER_06]: That he's going to, you know, give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas time.

128
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know what?

129
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:43,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't argue with that.

130
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:45,747
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys stop being Scrooges.

131
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

132
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,568
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are just Scrooges.

133
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:48,268
[SPEAKER_06]: You're bitter.

134
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:51,049
[SPEAKER_06]: You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.

135
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, just, you know...

136
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:54,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next time.

137
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,233
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got other stuff to give away.

138
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know what?

139
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:01,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to tell people about this.

140
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:07,321
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've been reading the forums, it's going to be ongoing whenever it happens.

141
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,783
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to have a new contest called Early Release.

142
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:10,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your mind out of the gutter.

143
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:15,567
[SPEAKER_05]: We get games a little early where I work.

144
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:20,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now.

145
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:24,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Announcing games, and we'll probably do the same thing as we did here.

146
00:06:25,263 --> 00:06:34,405
[SPEAKER_05]: If a game comes out, I think we may start it either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare, because a lot of people love that.

147
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,866
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to give away the game before it comes out, so you can rub it in people's faces.

148
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:40,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I played it before it came out.

149
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitches.

150
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll look forward to that.

151
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:47,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance later on.

152
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going to have some cool stuff for you guys too.

153
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:56,824
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.

154
00:06:58,144 --> 00:07:01,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.

155
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to the show, shall we?

156
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And talk about some more gaming news.

157
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's.

158
00:07:11,127 --> 00:07:14,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving...

159
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know what comes after Thanksgiving, other than falling asleep from overeating.

160
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:21,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Friday.

161
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:27,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, with Black Friday, there's always going to be great deals on games and stuff.

162
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.

163
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,778
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.

164
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:42,602
[SPEAKER_03]: For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Games,

165
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:50,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Table Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store before noon.

166
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.

167
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:03,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4, and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.

168
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:05,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not bad either.

169
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:07,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, those are some pretty good games.

170
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Full Auto is fun.

171
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:09,764
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

172
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.

173
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:21,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging you to do it.

174
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, did you know people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia?

175
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:24,975
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty rad.

176
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:43,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia, and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 1-1-1-1-1, or Sony sucks, and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 1-1-1-1-1, DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia to add on Ken Kutaragi's bio, PS, eats crayons.

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:09:11,450
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe it's Macy, who knows so anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down they've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony until further notice so that you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user I'm assuming of some standing there on Wikipedia because if you're registered then they can track what you do and give you the ban of death, the banhammer isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii, Banhammer?

178
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,491
[SPEAKER_06]: no, Project Hammer, I know

179
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

180
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:45,243
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.

181
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

182
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,326
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be in Rising Star Games Evolution series.

183
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:53,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the PSP remakes.

184
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Their DS ones are Revolution.

185
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.

186
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:06,499
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about it.

187
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And for anyone who's bitching that it wasn't out on DS, yeah, it was.

188
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:15,168
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?

189
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,109
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was Rainbow Stars.

190
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:17,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one where you shoot the little rainbows?

191
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Parasol Stars.

192
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sorry.

193
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:19,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbow.

194
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Rainbow Islands.

195
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's fun.

196
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:21,934
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one where you shoot the rainbows.

197
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:22,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's fun.

198
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:24,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.

199
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:29,420
[SPEAKER_11]: See, I actually have it on TurboGrafx, but I would love to have a handheld Parasol Stars.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, of course you don't.

201
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:38,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, technically I do since I have one of the portable TurboGrafx, but I would love to have it on, you know,

202
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,473
[SPEAKER_11]: See, but Rainbow Islands is a classic.

203
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:43,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Not as many people play Parasol Stars.

204
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:45,395
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have to ask this question, though.

205
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Will I be able to get past level 30?

206
00:10:48,276 --> 00:11:01,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.

207
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:02,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

208
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:08,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangenautorated.com said almost the same thing I did when I said it.

209
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,730
[SPEAKER_06]: It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?

210
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very cool.

211
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:12,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma agrees.

212
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:13,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Parasol Stars owns.

213
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:19,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the first time I ever saw Parasol Stars, I want to say, was on Supercade or whatever that game show.

214
00:11:19,977 --> 00:11:20,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Supercade.

215
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:20,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultracade?

216
00:11:20,998 --> 00:11:22,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, the game show.

217
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,082
[SPEAKER_06]: God, it was Starcade.

218
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,183
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.

219
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Starcade was the name of that show.

220
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good.

221
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:31,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember?

222
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:31,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

223
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great show.

224
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:38,184
[SPEAKER_06]: When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starrcade.

225
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:38,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It was awesome.

226
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:40,825
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just craziness.

227
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:41,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy!

228
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:42,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Craziness.

229
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:43,506
Crazy!

230
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe not that crazy.

231
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:55,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, okay, so, of course, with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.

232
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.

233
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:11,265
[SPEAKER_03]: You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.

234
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:16,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a wonderful application to easily install it on there for you.

235
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So homebrew on 2.8.

236
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:25,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.

237
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:32,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?

238
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:33,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been following this at all?

239
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,480
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just keep upgrading.

240
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,100
[SPEAKER_06]: You just keep upgrading.

241
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of lost now wanting to do the whole NES games.

242
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't care anymore.

243
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:40,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

244
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:42,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hardly play.

245
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:47,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.

246
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:51,747
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out.

247
00:12:52,107 --> 00:12:54,368
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, I mean, that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.

248
00:12:55,027 --> 00:13:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I still like my PSP for web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading shows and playing Luminous, of course.

249
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,091
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I don't know.

250
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:08,573
[SPEAKER_06]: John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the PSP's a done deal in 2007?

251
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:09,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

252
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:09,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

253
00:13:10,394 --> 00:13:11,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with all the PS3 support?

254
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:13,375
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

255
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gimmicky.

256
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:15,096
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

257
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:16,676
[SPEAKER_05]: This is honestly what I'm thinking.

258
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:22,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to the Big Daddy console, it sucked.

259
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:26,154
[SPEAKER_05]: With the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.

260
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:29,814
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.

261
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?

262
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:33,455
[SPEAKER_05]: They could.

263
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:35,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I doubt it.

264
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:37,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it would be nice to see something like that work.

265
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:44,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be cool.

266
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:46,558
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.

267
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: We shall see.

268
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:58,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back anyway.

269
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:04,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?

270
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:06,324
[SPEAKER_06]: You buy a DS regular.

271
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here comes the DS Lite.

272
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:10,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here it comes in prettier colors, right?

273
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:11,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

274
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:12,706
[SPEAKER_06]: This happens all the time.

275
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, guess what?

276
00:14:14,161 --> 00:14:14,621
[SPEAKER_06]: GameDaily.biz

277
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:34,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, GameDaily.com, biz.game.com is saying this is confirmed.

278
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:43,237
[SPEAKER_06]: That Nintendo of America confirmed that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii, will be coming to the U.S.

279
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:44,738
[SPEAKER_06]: sometime during 2007.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, there's something, quote, SonicCinePlayerCEDVDNavigator.com.

281
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be bringing high quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.

282
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of interesting.

283
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:02,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So we already know there's probably going to be a souped up Wii somewhere in 2007.

284
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,696
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's going to be more than $249.99.

285
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:09,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say it might be, you know, in the mid $300 range.

286
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: One billion dollars!

287
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,441
[SPEAKER_06]: But you already have yours.

289
00:15:15,242 --> 00:15:17,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, is...

290
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:21,056
[SPEAKER_06]: That many people are going to want to get this just for DVD playback?

291
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

292
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:23,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

293
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:23,557
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not.

294
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:25,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I have several DVD players.

295
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:27,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an Xbox 360 that works just fine as a DVD player.

296
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:32,902
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD player, and an upscaling DVD player.

297
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a five-disc changer in my living room.

298
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,183
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a cookie?

299
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,164
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I want a donut, though.

300
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:39,345
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.

301
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:44,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to my main TV.

302
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.

303
00:15:49,262 --> 00:15:52,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there.

304
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know what each other's doing.

305
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

306
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,007
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

307
00:15:57,127 --> 00:15:57,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see.

308
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:00,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?

309
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:01,149
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

310
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,830
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

311
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what if they sweeten the pot with some, like, maybe different colors?

312
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, maybe get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory.

313
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?

314
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:12,970
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

315
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:37,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrade my memory!

316
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:38,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrade my memory!

317
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:41,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?

318
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,349
[SPEAKER_11]: How about some UK release dates?

319
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sure, why not?

320
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:48,873
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.

321
00:16:48,913 --> 00:16:49,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's show them some love.

322
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,354
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, love them all right now.

323
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.

324
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:06,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Asphalt Urban GT 2, Bionicle Heroes on Multiple Systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets, come out over here!

325
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:13,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, Eragon's coming out on Damn Near Everything based off of the unintelligible book of the same name.

326
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:17,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.

327
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:18,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

328
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:40,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotel Dusk Room 215, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix, Neo Geo Battle Call of C and Phantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Race the Official WTCC game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff that has unconfirmed dates.

329
00:17:41,889 --> 00:17:42,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

330
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:43,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

331
00:17:44,171 --> 00:17:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

332
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:46,474
[SPEAKER_03]: for the US.

333
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:51,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting quite a bit of stuff and of course got to start everything off with our wonderful exclusive information.

334
00:17:52,316 --> 00:18:01,879
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting with a few price drops actually and I'm not too surprised by this but NBA Live 07 they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats.

335
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:02,259
[SPEAKER_03]: The 360 is now $39.99.

336
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:02,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it

337
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:07,543
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA Live 07

338
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: The big game, of course, this week would be Superman Returns.

339
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems.

340
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:48,091
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of my favorite games, though...

341
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:49,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I interrupt real quick?

342
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:49,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

343
00:18:49,805 --> 00:18:50,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anyone play the demo?

344
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I heard the demo went to live this week and I haven't heard a lot of chat about it.

345
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:57,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.

346
00:18:58,168 --> 00:19:02,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look that bad.

347
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,610
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked pretty awesome.

348
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.

349
00:19:07,752 --> 00:19:10,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched someone stack cars and that was pretty funny.

350
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:21,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, so another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.

351
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:29,171
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will be coming out on the 360.

352
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:30,851
Africa.

353
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,232
[SPEAKER_03]: The kind of Africa I like.

354
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:33,672
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Jombo Safari?

355
00:19:33,712 --> 00:19:34,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me that again.

356
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:38,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and

357
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360.

358
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:43,246
[SPEAKER_03]: No one on the PlayStation 2.

359
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:47,469
[SPEAKER_03]: For some reason, that one was delayed to December, which is very interesting.

360
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:51,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Thrillville will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

361
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:56,774
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.

362
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:59,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically the big stuff.

363
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a bunch of crappy DS games.

364
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.

365
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see some of the movie-based games like Open Season and Barnyard.

366
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:19,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me.

367
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Feet has a DDR ripoff in it.

368
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:24,674
[SPEAKER_06]: But Miklatov told me Happy Feet was like the worst movie ever.

369
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:27,236
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love penguins.

370
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it looks so cute.

371
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:31,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say Miklatov is full of evil, but I don't know.

372
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming out.

373
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.

374
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:40,486
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

375
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:41,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

376
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.

377
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:45,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi there, Japan.

378
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:46,360
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you guys doing?

379
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,041
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.

380
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:51,483
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2.

381
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some of you guys are looking forward to that one.

382
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,906
[SPEAKER_06]: NBA Live 07, an X-Men the official game.

383
00:20:56,026 --> 00:20:57,987
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys are getting the HD DVD player this week.

384
00:20:58,328 --> 00:20:59,768
[SPEAKER_06]: This one made me squeal a little bit.

385
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,410
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks don't remember this game.

386
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on the PS2.

387
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,151
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Cold Sept.

388
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:05,712
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360.

389
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:07,874
[SPEAKER_06]: And it does look like it's a sequel to the first game.

390
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,456
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.

391
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:16,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.

392
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:18,757
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a trailer up on live.

393
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It was during the E3 thing for that.

394
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:21,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.

395
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,838
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.

396
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Coldstep, hopefully it's coming out over here.

397
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:26,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it is.

398
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:28,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, one day.

399
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's out in Japan, which means it'll be making its way over here somewhat soon.

400
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, I got something kind of random to mention.

401
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,222
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Disgaea...

402
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,761
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually starting up an anime series for that.

403
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:41,122
[SPEAKER_06]: They already did.

404
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that we reported on that a while ago.

405
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:44,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.

406
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.

407
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:50,343
[SPEAKER_06]: In case you didn't know... Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.

408
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out on the PlayStation 2.

409
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:58,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drum Mania V2 coming out this week.

410
00:21:59,025 --> 00:22:04,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into their Guitar Freaks.

411
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:06,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura, sound like something you might be getting?

412
00:22:06,721 --> 00:22:07,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, I don't know.

413
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:10,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freak since I have Guitar Hero.

414
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:11,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe.

415
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:18,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation 2.

416
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:21,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?

417
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another system this week.

418
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,928
[SPEAKER_06]: We have on the Nintendo DS...

419
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Mina no Diaz Karingu

420
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:44,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Osare Majo Love and Bury.

421
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo DS.

422
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:49,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a puzzle game.

423
00:22:49,078 --> 00:22:49,658
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a puzzle game.

424
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:55,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, is that a game where you love somebody and then knock them off and bury them in your backyard?

425
00:22:55,381 --> 00:22:59,204
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's bury, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.

426
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:00,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Like berry what?

427
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:03,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Like cherry or dingleberry?

428
00:23:03,326 --> 00:23:05,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.

429
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:07,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the hentai game?

430
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:08,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it a hentai game?

431
00:23:08,649 --> 00:23:09,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a hentai game?

432
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:15,976
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising a hentai dating sim for the DS.

433
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:20,537
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to feel up girls to see who's a... No, that's a different game.

434
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:24,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from Sega and it's classified as puzzle.

435
00:23:24,758 --> 00:23:25,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say one thing.

436
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:27,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Touching is good.

437
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,819
[SPEAKER_06]: The female body is a puzzle.

438
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,660
[SPEAKER_12]: The female body is a puzzle, gentlemen.

439
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle in a way, so that could be an appropriate title.

440
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:37,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

441
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:39,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

442
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get back to the news.

443
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:47,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.

444
00:23:48,616 --> 00:23:49,716
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a new demo.

445
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited already before you even mention it.

446
00:23:52,617 --> 00:23:52,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

447
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:53,357
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

448
00:23:53,437 --> 00:23:53,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

449
00:23:53,817 --> 00:23:53,977
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

450
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:54,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

451
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:55,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

452
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:55,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

453
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:56,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

454
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:57,998
[SPEAKER_07]: I will get... Rob.

455
00:23:58,138 --> 00:23:58,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

456
00:23:58,459 --> 00:23:58,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

457
00:23:59,119 --> 00:23:59,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

458
00:23:59,379 --> 00:23:59,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

459
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:00,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit.

460
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:00,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit.

461
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:01,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit.

462
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:01,899
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit.

463
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit.

464
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

465
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

466
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we keep this show moving, please?

467
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:06,901
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

468
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:07,261
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

469
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:07,641
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

470
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Go die in a fire.

471
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:12,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

472
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:13,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

473
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:15,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Game coming out.

474
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:19,015
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually a demo on Xbox Live.

475
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:23,277
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a 360 demo of Cars.

476
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,258
[SPEAKER_11]: 450 megaworth of data.

477
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:31,139
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can play as Lightning McQueen through Radiator Springs.

478
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:36,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I must be a movie reference.

479
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:37,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen a movie.

480
00:24:37,081 --> 00:24:38,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

481
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:38,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

482
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:46,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.

483
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:52,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.

484
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,482
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.

485
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.

486
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:04,084
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good news is next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.

487
00:25:04,404 --> 00:25:06,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.

488
00:25:06,384 --> 00:25:07,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you excited about Cars on the 360?

489
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:12,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

490
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:13,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I kind of am.

491
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:20,844
[SPEAKER_12]: For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.

492
00:25:20,884 --> 00:25:25,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.

493
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:30,669
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm actually excited for it because Megzi is the biggest Pixar nut.

494
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:35,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without she picking out every little speck.

495
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:36,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking forward to it.

496
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:37,763
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, cars, come on.

497
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:39,463
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.

498
00:25:39,483 --> 00:25:39,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Rob.

499
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:53,986
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to have a rainbow conversation.

500
00:25:54,306 --> 00:26:00,911
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.

501
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:05,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.

502
00:26:09,618 --> 00:26:12,520
[SPEAKER_12]: I could tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.

503
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,041
[SPEAKER_12]: We beat people.

504
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:22,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I think we need to give Chris and Megsy their own show where they just talk dirty to us.

505
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:27,851
[SPEAKER_12]: We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast of kind of like rants.

506
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie's going to be in on it.

507
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Just call it Ask a Lesbian.

508
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,474
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.

509
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,755
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get back to games, games, games, games.

510
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:36,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so...

511
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,015
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

512
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:15,313
[SPEAKER_05]: On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens.

513
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:21,076
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to make sure that people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.

514
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:29,460
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit because if I want to go in there and buy one console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.

515
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,921
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you why they do that.

516
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:34,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Because margins on consoles suck.

517
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck.

518
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the accessories, their games...

519
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:46,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Artificially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit this quarter.

520
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show.

521
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Something kind of last minute that came up.

522
00:27:52,385 --> 00:28:00,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE because he pre-ordered a Wii and then they forced a bundle on him.

523
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,573
[SPEAKER_06]: But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle.

524
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,334
[SPEAKER_06]: He had to get, like, crap games.

525
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:08,418
[SPEAKER_06]: He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube and...

526
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:13,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube, but I'm sure if you put in like FYE and WE, it'll come up there somewhere.

527
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing but text telling his story.

528
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:16,744
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of sarcastic.

529
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:20,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems kind of low to do that to pre-orderers.

530
00:28:20,927 --> 00:28:24,270
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.

531
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:31,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the Northwest somewhere where they were trying to do something similar?

532
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:35,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And it even opened up this investigation.

533
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on this.

534
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:39,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob White says, well I don't shop much at FYE anyway.

535
00:28:57,364 --> 00:29:00,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert M says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.

536
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:01,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there should be, of course.

537
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I gotta say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.

538
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:08,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot.

539
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:14,265
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the third party, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise Spongebob type games.

540
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I can't knock it till I've played it, so whatever.

541
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:20,096
[SPEAKER_06]: There's questionable content there at the launch.

542
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:23,137
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCube ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.

543
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:24,257
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

544
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:27,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Excite Truck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.

545
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,461
[SPEAKER_06]: All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good.

546
00:29:34,442 --> 00:29:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch.

547
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:44,806
[SPEAKER_03]: With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out that are just ports from last generation, just kind of

548
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:48,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Robway says, That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?

549
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:51,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.

550
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

551
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Who am I to know?

552
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:54,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Who am I to know?

553
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:54,972
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

554
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,421
[SPEAKER_05]: They released Mario Bros.

555
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,463
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Virtual Console.

556
00:30:14,723 --> 00:30:15,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo!

557
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:15,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Boo!

558
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:16,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen.

559
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:17,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

560
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:17,886
[SPEAKER_06]: You shut your mouth.

561
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I love original Mario Bros.

562
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:19,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bullshit.

563
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:23,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, they put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.

564
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:27,133
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, they put it on every freaking Advance title.

565
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a little bit tired of it at this point.

566
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:32,638
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do love old school Mario Bros.

567
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

568
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:33,799
[SPEAKER_03]: They're virtual.

569
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:34,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Pow, pow.

570
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Soccer and pinball.

571
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:47,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream of games.

572
00:30:48,292 --> 00:30:51,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.

573
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,974
[SPEAKER_06]: That certainly is fair.

574
00:30:53,902 --> 00:31:01,248
[SPEAKER_06]: You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline, and Mario in the pipeline, and Super Smash Bros., absolutely.

575
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:09,613
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good marketing decision, because if you release all these franchises at once, yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the road?

576
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:15,538
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have Diddleio or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.

577
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:19,200
[SPEAKER_05]: You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.

578
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good business decision by Nintendo.

579
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo wants to have multiple franchises.

580
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Pleasure.

581
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:25,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

582
00:31:25,146 --> 00:31:25,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Multiples.

583
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Tantric game releases.

584
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:27,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

585
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:28,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

586
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:29,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good way to put it.

587
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:30,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Giggity, giggity, goo.

588
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:35,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Lounge Radio tonight in the chat room.

589
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:36,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you, Black Boy.

590
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:37,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat, pat, pat.

591
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:37,936
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a gold star.

592
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:38,917
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

593
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:41,439
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

594
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:42,420
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a good comment.

595
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,980
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good comment.

596
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:43,881
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

597
00:31:44,282 --> 00:31:44,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

598
00:31:44,922 --> 00:31:46,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, going to the other end of this.

599
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,505
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going from bundles to the other extreme.

600
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?

601
00:31:51,465 --> 00:31:52,185
[SPEAKER_06]: This is interesting.

602
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:55,126
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some numbers coming from MediaCreate.

603
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Total hardware sales.

604
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:02,308
[SPEAKER_06]: They sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan.

605
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:06,469
[SPEAKER_06]: 45,000 approximately of those were the 60 gig models.

606
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:07,429
[SPEAKER_06]: But get this.

607
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:15,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch title, all the way down to... Thank you.

608
00:32:17,045 --> 00:32:21,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies, but when you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.

609
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,851
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, anyone?

610
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Blu-ray player.

611
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:56,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

612
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,812
[SPEAKER_11]: That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player in Japan.

613
00:33:03,553 --> 00:33:04,954
[SPEAKER_11]: So it makes sense.

614
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:08,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.

615
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:13,426
[SPEAKER_05]: What, and I don't want to sound stereotypical, but what does the average Japanese gamer like to play?

616
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:14,687
[SPEAKER_05]: RPGs.

617
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,388
[SPEAKER_05]: There were none released at launch.

618
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:18,149
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why there were no games sold.

619
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:23,814
[SPEAKER_06]: But racing games are also hugely popular over there, so Ridge Racer 7 should have been, you know, a big, big title.

620
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:27,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Ridge Racer's kind of the sun setting on that franchise.

621
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:28,617
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that good of a franchise anymore.

622
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:30,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, them's fighting words, though.

623
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,800
[SPEAKER_11]: It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.

624
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's about right.

625
00:33:33,661 --> 00:33:34,682
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the last.

626
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:38,085
[SPEAKER_11]: The Ridge Racer 4 bundled with the JogCon.

627
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:39,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Best bundle ever.

628
00:33:40,478 --> 00:33:41,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Since then, nothing's topped it.

629
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Except for having the NegCon when you play Wipeout.

630
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:48,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I like 6.

631
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:51,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't love it, but I liked it.

632
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:52,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good deal now.

633
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:54,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good deal now for $20.

634
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,971
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about Ridge Racer DS.

635
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:56,632
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

636
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:59,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says Ridge Racer 5 is good.

637
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.

638
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,340
[SPEAKER_11]: R4 was the top of it.

639
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:06,900
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

640
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,200
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, take it away.

641
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,780
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, take it away.

642
00:34:30,976 --> 00:34:32,216
[SPEAKER_11]: First email comes up.

643
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:38,258
[SPEAKER_11]: These are sort of being read out of order that I receive them, so I'm being random today.

644
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, random.

645
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,599
[SPEAKER_11]: First one comes from Robway.

646
00:34:42,759 --> 00:34:46,881
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.

647
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,801
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing bothers me in particular.

648
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.

649
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:55,523
[SPEAKER_11]: This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.

650
00:34:56,212 --> 00:35:01,354
[SPEAKER_11]: It more or less validates it, saying, We know you won't be able to get one, so buy your games now and get the system off eBay.

651
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:07,017
[SPEAKER_11]: This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the things won't buy any games.

652
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:12,499
[SPEAKER_11]: This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off it the same as a PS3 with no games.

653
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.

654
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:21,543
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes sense.

655
00:35:21,763 --> 00:35:24,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one comes from AZHP.

656
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,839
[SPEAKER_11]: or as HP, I guess I should say.

657
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?

658
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freak like years ago.

659
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:35,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, who cares?

660
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:35,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

661
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:38,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, may I continue?

662
00:35:38,647 --> 00:35:40,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.

663
00:35:41,317 --> 00:35:47,221
[SPEAKER_11]: A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered 100 PS3s at 30 different stores.

664
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:51,203
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't believe him at first, and then he sent me this picture, and I'll link it in the chat room.

665
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:52,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen this.

666
00:35:52,724 --> 00:35:55,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I saw it over on YouNoob.com.

667
00:35:55,546 --> 00:35:59,828
[SPEAKER_06]: They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.

668
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,751
[SPEAKER_11]: With all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000 in a day.

669
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:11,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.

670
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:12,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Brace yourself.

671
00:36:13,195 --> 00:36:15,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.

672
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:16,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Freaking ridiculous.

673
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:20,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, why are you friends with such a lame-ass person?

674
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:21,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Seriously.

675
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:24,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great idea.

676
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

677
00:36:25,663 --> 00:36:27,063
[SPEAKER_03]: People are selling them on eBay.

678
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:28,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You see an opportunity to make money.

679
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:29,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.

680
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,247
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.

681
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:39,691
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like that.

682
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:40,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

683
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:44,434
[SPEAKER_03]: The dumbasses are the ones that pay that kind of money for PS3.

684
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:50,338
[SPEAKER_11]: I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.

685
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:51,819
[SPEAKER_14]: It's capitalism at work.

686
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,200
[SPEAKER_11]: It's filthy.

687
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,221
[SPEAKER_12]: It's disgusting.

688
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:56,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, I think I have to agree.

689
00:36:56,763 --> 00:36:58,264
[SPEAKER_12]: If you've got the means to do it,

690
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:00,254
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what capitalism is.

691
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:02,735
[SPEAKER_12]: It's playing off of people's stupidity.

692
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,015
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking immoral.

693
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:07,477
[SPEAKER_06]: To take this in a different direction, isn't this really risky?

694
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:19,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, because if the PlayStation 3's bottom fell out, as they're saying is happening on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going to, this guy could stand to lose a poop load of money.

695
00:37:20,123 --> 00:37:25,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel comfortable with the idea... Where I believe that stupid people...

696
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:27,655
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

697
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:45,573
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.

698
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really disgusting.

699
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:53,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person because they are greedy.

700
00:37:53,879 --> 00:38:00,344
[SPEAKER_11]: And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should even be an option to begin with.

701
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:03,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.

702
00:38:04,688 --> 00:38:06,309
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.

703
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:07,250
[SPEAKER_11]: It's extortion, it is.

704
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,951
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's dumb enough to do that.

705
00:38:10,023 --> 00:38:17,311
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah, if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked.

706
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:20,115
[SPEAKER_11]: However, the situation should not exist to begin with.

707
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:26,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't sell it.

708
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,284
[SPEAKER_14]: So either way, justice is done.

709
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:59,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta read some interesting comments from chatroom of course I gotta read the smart ass ones because this one made me laugh Alex of the OL Army says with 100 Playstation 3's you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia and Robway says Robway says I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy one Playstation 3 Robway says I agree with extortion it's very much like selling concert tickets over cost scalping interesting

710
00:38:59,915 --> 00:39:00,135
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

711
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:07,904
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, making that much money off your eBay sales should count as taxable income.

712
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:11,308
[SPEAKER_06]: It is taxable.

713
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with that.

714
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,393
[SPEAKER_06]: But how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?

715
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:17,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, then that gets weird.

716
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:18,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

717
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,339
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.

718
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:20,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

719
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:26,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that it's a sad state that our world has basically been reduced to this.

720
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:29,988
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened to making a fucking honest living, seriously?

721
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:40,030
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened to going out and... Okay, Chris, repeat your comment, though, because I have a follow-up.

722
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,910
[SPEAKER_12]: That died a while ago, making an honest living.

723
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,111
[SPEAKER_06]: It's obsolete.

724
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:47,931
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free donuts?

725
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:50,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

726
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:50,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait.

727
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:55,163
[SPEAKER_12]: The Making Honest Living is... That's what weirded people out?

728
00:39:55,343 --> 00:39:56,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, I don't know how to say the question.

729
00:39:56,504 --> 00:39:58,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I was like, read it.

730
00:39:58,686 --> 00:40:00,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're saying it's a sad state of the world.

731
00:40:00,687 --> 00:40:01,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just playing devil's advocate here.

732
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:04,429
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people buy into.

733
00:40:04,449 --> 00:40:18,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm thinking, is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind of like... They don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games like them?

734
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

735
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean...

736
00:40:21,841 --> 00:40:26,385
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, this is the, I mean, I'm a very idealistic person.

737
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:30,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit.

738
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,551
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.

739
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:39,835
[SPEAKER_12]: It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that stuff in it.

740
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:41,756
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can try and be a nice person.

741
00:40:41,816 --> 00:40:42,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I am a nice person.

742
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry to say, though, but just accepting it blindly is what

743
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically produces this behavior.

744
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:52,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just to give another perspective on this, though, and then we'll keep it moving.

745
00:40:54,108 --> 00:40:54,909
[SPEAKER_06]: What about eBay?

746
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?

747
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?

748
00:41:00,512 --> 00:41:01,833
[SPEAKER_06]: eBay makes a share of all these.

749
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:03,114
[SPEAKER_06]: They could end this if they wanted to.

750
00:41:03,514 --> 00:41:06,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this, too.

751
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:09,658
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that it's a dirty situation.

752
00:41:09,998 --> 00:41:13,961
[SPEAKER_11]: The money is not... They're basically taking Sony's work...

753
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,243
[SPEAKER_11]: and making a profit off of something they had no involvement in.

754
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:22,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, they are stealing somebody else's work.

755
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:26,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future.

756
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:29,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to comment.

757
00:41:29,972 --> 00:41:31,753
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a free market, though.

758
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,896
[SPEAKER_14]: If they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.

759
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:39,319
[SPEAKER_14]: If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much money.

760
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,500
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

761
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:47,596
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?

762
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:55,101
[SPEAKER_06]: We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time, we should probably keep it moving.

763
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:56,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we agree, though, that it is unethical?

764
00:41:58,023 --> 00:41:59,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say it's unethical.

765
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:01,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the problem is everybody's on a different page.

766
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:02,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

767
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to agree to disagree.

768
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:05,989
[SPEAKER_06]: My personal feeling is...

769
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:12,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like to me, and this is me personal, I'm not going to judge you or whatever.

770
00:42:12,357 --> 00:42:13,598
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to do whatever you're going to do.

771
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But my thing is I feel like it's like the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's stolen.

772
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:18,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

773
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,444
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, that's... I've said this before.

774
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:27,789
[SPEAKER_11]: If Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.

775
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:29,751
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's you guys.

776
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:30,831
[SPEAKER_06]: That's between you and him.

777
00:42:31,772 --> 00:42:32,052
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

778
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:33,613
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to keep it moving, folks.

779
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:34,274
[SPEAKER_06]: We have more emails?

780
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:38,096
[SPEAKER_06]: AJ Twist

781
00:42:55,397 --> 00:42:57,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of this email.

782
00:42:58,039 --> 00:42:59,120
[SPEAKER_11]: I work at KB Toys.

783
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month, but they're having a big video game sale.

784
00:43:06,305 --> 00:43:10,488
[SPEAKER_11]: All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and DS titles.

785
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:11,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool, huh?

786
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:15,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.

787
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,272
[SPEAKER_11]: She told me no.

788
00:43:16,712 --> 00:43:19,094
[SPEAKER_11]: KB is trying to get away from selling video games.

789
00:43:19,554 --> 00:43:20,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder why.

790
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:23,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games...

791
00:43:24,161 --> 00:43:25,462
[SPEAKER_11]: KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.

792
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:56,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games and I didn't really think about it until I heard this email.

793
00:43:56,662 --> 00:44:00,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.

794
00:44:00,186 --> 00:44:03,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB.

795
00:44:04,351 --> 00:44:05,973
[SPEAKER_10]: There are KBs that are outside malls.

796
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:07,435
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one.

797
00:44:07,455 --> 00:44:08,356
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty of strip malls.

798
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:11,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, it's KB.

799
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I walk past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.

800
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:19,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's like we've lost our lease sale.

801
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,009
[SPEAKER_03]: All toys must go.

802
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,650
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it always looks like.

803
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:28,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Robway says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.

804
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,056
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the inflatable pools.

805
00:44:33,116 --> 00:44:38,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop where there was a Wii.

806
00:44:39,534 --> 00:44:40,654
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so excited to see it.

807
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:41,535
[SPEAKER_11]: It is small.

808
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:52,859
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with the Nintendo Wii was there.

809
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:56,340
[SPEAKER_11]: No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.

810
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it.

811
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:00,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I've always wanted the first, but never had time or money to buy it.

812
00:45:01,262 --> 00:45:04,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually chose Beatmania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.

813
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:08,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.

814
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:11,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Freespops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.

815
00:45:12,053 --> 00:45:14,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.

816
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:16,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I've played it once and loved it more than the first.

817
00:45:16,816 --> 00:45:19,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.

818
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:26,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking better makes me a happy bunny.

819
00:45:27,164 --> 00:45:28,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess that's all for now.

820
00:45:28,065 --> 00:45:30,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.

821
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:34,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay, Guitar Hero.

822
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, Guitar Hero.

823
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:36,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

824
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:45,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Also to state, I am going to be posting my little Ponykillers letter in our forums momentarily as my letter of the week.

825
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So as it is long, it will not be read.

826
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:48,792
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be on our forums.

827
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:49,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Make sure you go there and read it.

828
00:45:50,653 --> 00:45:59,740
[SPEAKER_11]: But our other really good email I got from GrinWithoutACat is if we're all ready to listen.

829
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm listening.

830
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:00,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

831
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:03,543
[SPEAKER_06]: John's making nasty motions at me.

832
00:46:04,773 --> 00:46:05,073
[SPEAKER_11]: or HaloWare.

833
00:46:05,093 --> 00:46:05,193
[SPEAKER_11]: It's

834
00:46:35,097 --> 00:46:36,398
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

835
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:09,816
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide-and-seek than a shooter.

836
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:20,244
[SPEAKER_11]: In my first game, I was revived my teammate only to hear him tell, behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle by a chainsaw.

837
00:47:21,565 --> 00:47:28,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters, but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.

838
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep up the good work, grin without a cap.

839
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually agree with the email that Gears of War I think is one of those games I think you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the shooter genre.

840
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:44,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Be very careful about all this hype behind the game because it's not for everybody.

841
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:45,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a good game?

842
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

843
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it for everybody?

844
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

845
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,070
[SPEAKER_06]: So try before you buy if you're curious.

846
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:55,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And a fair warning, I mean, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10.

847
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:59,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's ultimately up to you if you're going to like the game or not.

848
00:47:59,435 --> 00:47:59,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

849
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:00,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely play a demo.

850
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever let the hype sell the game.

851
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.

852
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:12,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let the hype sell you a game because it's not always going to be rewarding.

853
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.

854
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:18,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.

855
00:48:18,703 --> 00:48:19,723
[SPEAKER_06]: No demo on live.

856
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:26,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other big Xbox 360 games.

857
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet anyway.

858
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:33,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So, alrighty.

859
00:48:34,264 --> 00:48:35,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Any more emails for this week?

860
00:48:35,985 --> 00:48:39,147
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it, and I've just posted up my little pony killer's email in our forum.

861
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:39,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

862
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:47,372
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundryader.com is the place to deliver those lovely little messages.

863
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:49,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.

864
00:48:49,502 --> 00:49:00,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, moving on, talking about the 360, there's been one cool little mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a VGA AV out on it.

865
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:14,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the Xbox 360 as far as AV stuff goes actually have all the pins for pretty much every video format you'd possibly want.

866
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:18,844
[SPEAKER_03]: So simply re-soldering some of the connectors...

867
00:49:19,997 --> 00:49:23,358
[SPEAKER_03]: to a VGA jack, you know, caused it to work.

868
00:49:24,038 --> 00:49:24,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty simple.

869
00:49:25,238 --> 00:49:31,079
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it.

870
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll save you some money that way.

871
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty cool.

872
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:38,761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

873
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:46,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about, you know, controversial methods of making extra money.

874
00:49:46,803 --> 00:49:48,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we can all agree this is a good thing.

875
00:49:49,139 --> 00:49:49,500
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

876
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:07,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony's ATV Offroad Fury 2, Splashdown Rides Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.

877
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.

878
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:18,200
[SPEAKER_06]: They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.

879
00:50:18,421 --> 00:50:19,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, ESA!

880
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, indeed.

881
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:35,271
[SPEAKER_11]: And also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda artwork being sold from the old CD-i games.

882
00:50:39,675 --> 00:50:40,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

883
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:51,669
[SPEAKER_11]: From the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devin, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction with the original art that inspired these titles.

884
00:50:53,169 --> 00:51:09,578
[SPEAKER_11]: The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but has signed artwork, a letter from the artist, a half a dozen CD-i games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that featured the Zelda titles.

885
00:51:10,011 --> 00:51:12,872
[SPEAKER_03]: The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.

886
00:51:15,713 --> 00:51:34,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the mention of the Zelda CD-i games made us verp a little bit, I think it's, you know, for the Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so, you know, definitely something I'd want if I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, yeah, crazed Link fans.

887
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:37,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Anywho, um,

888
00:51:39,691 --> 00:51:45,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose.

889
00:51:46,354 --> 00:51:57,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an interesting game, had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the young girl on girl action going on there.

890
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:04,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, apparently Rome's mayor is demanding a ban of Rule of Rose.

891
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:08,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently finds that the erotic themes are too...

892
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:17,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Too strong and that there's no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says.

893
00:52:17,255 --> 00:52:20,258
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

894
00:52:20,298 --> 00:52:21,278
[SPEAKER_12]: I own that game.

895
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.

896
00:52:25,241 --> 00:52:30,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy vibe of it.

897
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:33,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?

898
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was very subtle.

899
00:52:34,868 --> 00:52:35,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like, you know...

900
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,781
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden they just start making out and getting it on.

901
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:41,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a little much.

902
00:52:42,523 --> 00:52:50,668
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like, you know when little kids are doing stuff that they don't quite understand what they're doing?

903
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,630
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of the vibe I got.

904
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,813
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not like they're... I mean, it's really, really subtle.

905
00:52:57,993 --> 00:52:59,954
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, unless you're looking for it.

906
00:53:00,034 --> 00:53:01,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Fucking sickos.

907
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:04,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the only way this is ever going to get banned... What it boils down to is that they're all gay.

908
00:53:05,873 --> 00:53:06,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

909
00:53:06,774 --> 00:53:07,634
[SPEAKER_03]: The fat chick.

910
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:09,496
[SPEAKER_03]: The fat chick was awesome.

911
00:53:09,676 --> 00:53:13,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, the Pope, he no like the rule of Rose, okay, so.

912
00:53:13,878 --> 00:53:15,159
He's not the mayor of Rome.

913
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care, he doesn't like rule of Rose.

914
00:53:18,101 --> 00:53:19,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if he's the mayor.

915
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:22,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Captain Obvious over there in the corner.

916
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: The Pope's not the mayor of Rome.

917
00:53:24,945 --> 00:53:25,566
[SPEAKER_06]: No crap.

918
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:27,887
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but he is the God of Rome.

919
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:28,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

920
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:30,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

921
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:30,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Um.

922
00:53:31,883 --> 00:53:32,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Car Area Network

923
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:56,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

924
00:54:25,509 --> 00:54:26,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

925
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:57,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Two DSs.

926
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:58,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Twelve gauge, I don't know.

927
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:01,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Or ferret.

928
00:55:02,605 --> 00:55:03,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Sedatives.

929
00:55:03,325 --> 00:55:04,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Ferret justice.

930
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:06,926
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

931
00:55:06,986 --> 00:55:08,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't hate children that much.

932
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:10,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't want any.

933
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:10,908
[SPEAKER_06]: She loves them.

934
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:12,088
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants to squeeze them until they choke.

935
00:55:12,228 --> 00:55:17,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't be breeding shouldn't breed.

936
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I am not in a position to take care of one right now.

937
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:21,531
[SPEAKER_11]: And those people shouldn't have one either.

938
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:22,071
[SPEAKER_11]: So there.

939
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:23,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I live by my morals.

940
00:55:23,912 --> 00:55:24,712
[SPEAKER_06]: You practice what you preach.

941
00:55:25,094 --> 00:55:25,534
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

942
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:26,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for you.

943
00:55:26,534 --> 00:55:27,555
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it, I do.

944
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:30,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I want another donut.

945
00:55:30,636 --> 00:55:31,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have donuts.

946
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:32,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a powdered donut.

947
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:46,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday just like everybody else.

948
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:49,221
[SPEAKER_11]: They had less than we got.

949
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:54,183
[SPEAKER_11]: They got 500 total for the entire...

950
00:55:55,605 --> 00:55:56,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I can top that.

951
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:58,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Hong Kong got $200.

952
00:55:59,047 --> 00:55:59,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

953
00:56:00,047 --> 00:56:05,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries worth a piece.

954
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:07,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they got $750.

955
00:56:08,151 --> 00:56:11,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?

956
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:11,933
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say.

957
00:56:12,273 --> 00:56:13,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's too bad.

958
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:17,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they have people pushing each other into flagpoles like they did here?

959
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:20,696
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they just probably strung them up from the light post.

960
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:22,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I got a question.

961
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:23,998
[SPEAKER_12]: How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?

962
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:27,974
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

963
00:56:28,314 --> 00:56:28,615
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot.

964
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:30,796
[SPEAKER_11]: It had to have been the comparable amount.

965
00:56:30,976 --> 00:56:34,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.

966
00:56:34,518 --> 00:56:56,652
[SPEAKER_12]: They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China are, you know, not that... They're not that... I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of stupid to give them a system that is overpriced and, you know... So maybe that's why they got so little...

967
00:56:57,921 --> 00:56:59,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.

968
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:01,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order.

969
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

970
00:57:04,725 --> 00:57:05,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

971
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:05,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

972
00:57:07,827 --> 00:57:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for the Wii.

973
00:57:14,443 --> 00:57:15,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the case.

974
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:18,164
[SPEAKER_03]: The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.

975
00:57:18,404 --> 00:57:18,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Quiet, you.

976
00:57:19,044 --> 00:57:21,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, I hear you sighing over there.

977
00:57:22,344 --> 00:57:24,065
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an accurate gripe, okay?

978
00:57:24,185 --> 00:57:28,365
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they are not coming out until December 5th, and probably later than that.

979
00:57:29,186 --> 00:57:33,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.

980
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:35,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

981
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,247
[SPEAKER_03]: To be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming out either.

982
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:41,948
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.

983
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

984
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:50,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get component cables.

985
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:54,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.

986
00:57:54,252 --> 00:57:55,733
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it yourself on the show.

987
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, they're not coming out today.

988
00:57:58,715 --> 00:58:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You had to order them on Nintendo.com.

989
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:03,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.

990
00:58:04,637 --> 00:58:09,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii saying, I can't wait until I get one of these.

991
00:58:11,899 --> 00:58:20,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.

992
00:58:22,223 --> 00:58:26,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.

993
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.

994
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:47,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Take Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.

995
00:58:47,415 --> 00:59:00,664
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that 20 are coming from Rockstar.

996
00:59:00,924 --> 00:59:02,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, Take Two makes some of those games.

997
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:06,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles.

998
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:07,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We salute you.

999
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:07,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1000
00:59:07,396 --> 00:59:08,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are the games for the Wii?

1001
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:33,395
[SPEAKER_06]: PC Gamer

1002
00:59:56,008 --> 01:00:23,796
[SPEAKER_11]: uh inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows it's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue a display stand photographed on the Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming PC games Microsoft would not confirm um but they said they didn't really have any current plans on that however it was you know it was around discussing Windows Vista and the new things supported so it could happen

1003
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be also noted that that's, I think, that was the first issue of their name change, right?

1004
01:00:32,443 --> 01:00:33,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?

1005
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:34,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Or am I mixing up magazines?

1006
01:00:34,944 --> 01:00:35,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1007
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:36,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

1008
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:36,665
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1009
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:37,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1010
01:00:37,785 --> 01:00:38,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

1011
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:42,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.

1012
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:44,409
[SPEAKER_06]: You think it's for real?

1013
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:46,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Think it would sell pretty good on the PC?

1014
01:00:46,249 --> 01:00:46,509
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1015
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:47,350
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1016
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:47,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1017
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:51,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.

1018
01:00:52,563 --> 01:00:57,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based things.

1019
01:00:57,824 --> 01:01:00,265
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one PC game that's selling right now.

1020
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:02,145
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called World of Warcraft.

1021
01:01:03,585 --> 01:01:04,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Civ IV?

1022
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:09,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Black Boy says, by the way, it's computer gaming world that is now games for Windows, not PC gamer.

1023
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:09,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my bad.

1024
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:10,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1025
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:12,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just be honest.

1026
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:14,608
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a huge PC gamer.

1027
01:01:14,768 --> 01:01:20,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.

1028
01:01:21,607 --> 01:01:22,888
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Mac games.

1029
01:01:24,349 --> 01:01:25,750
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm playing one right now.

1030
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:29,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.

1031
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,555
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.

1032
01:01:33,276 --> 01:01:33,936
[SPEAKER_12]: I need it.

1033
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:35,897
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just teasing, of course.

1034
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:36,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just teasing.

1035
01:01:36,918 --> 01:01:43,183
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.

1036
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:46,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody said ooh?

1037
01:01:46,145 --> 01:01:46,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh?

1038
01:01:47,227 --> 01:01:47,847
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna call in.

1039
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:48,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna call in right now.

1040
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:20,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?

1041
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:22,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I have been playing with my Wii all day long.

1042
01:02:23,431 --> 01:02:24,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you been stroking it?

1043
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:25,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1044
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:28,514
[SPEAKER_06]: What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?

1045
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:37,619
[SPEAKER_13]: I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.

1046
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,040
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

1047
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Wii Sports is fun.

1048
01:02:45,244 --> 01:02:45,604
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cute.

1049
01:02:45,644 --> 01:02:53,130
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or hit the putter or whatever.

1050
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.

1051
01:02:56,932 --> 01:02:58,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have friends?

1052
01:02:58,133 --> 01:03:01,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?

1053
01:03:02,016 --> 01:03:04,177
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.

1054
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:04,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

1055
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:10,782
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports when there's not a lot of people around.

1056
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, pretty much.

1057
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:14,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you need to have a Wii Orgy, my friend.

1058
01:03:14,513 --> 01:03:15,154
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, right?

1059
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:16,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Chris.

1060
01:03:16,415 --> 01:03:16,915
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah?

1061
01:03:17,155 --> 01:03:17,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Want to come over?

1062
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:18,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1063
01:03:19,237 --> 01:03:19,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now.

1064
01:03:21,758 --> 01:03:26,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you guys need to take this conversation offline, because we're going to have a lot of folks getting pretty hot about this.

1065
01:03:27,242 --> 01:03:29,264
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about PlayStation 3 magazine?

1066
01:03:31,865 --> 01:03:33,126
[SPEAKER_06]: That didn't sound too promising.

1067
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:36,228
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with the PS3?

1068
01:03:36,288 --> 01:03:37,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Why no love for the PS3?

1069
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:38,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Just too expensive?

1070
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:38,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1071
01:03:38,934 --> 01:03:39,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Too expensive.

1072
01:03:40,235 --> 01:03:46,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come out for it are out right now.

1073
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,303
[SPEAKER_13]: You know how I feel about Sony in general, so, meh.

1074
01:03:51,103 --> 01:03:53,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Megzy, Megzy, what is your favorite color?

1075
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:55,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Lime green.

1076
01:03:56,888 --> 01:03:57,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1077
01:03:57,348 --> 01:04:00,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, it says no good if you answer the question for her.

1078
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:00,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cheating.

1079
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:01,691
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1080
01:04:01,772 --> 01:04:04,754
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know...

1081
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:06,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Your favorite color is green.

1082
01:04:06,706 --> 01:04:08,747
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the capital of California.

1083
01:04:09,007 --> 01:04:09,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Sacramento, answer.

1084
01:04:10,908 --> 01:04:12,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

1085
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:13,209
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1086
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:14,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I know her favorite color.

1087
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Megzy, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?

1088
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,674
[SPEAKER_13]: Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.

1089
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:22,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, Smash Bros.

1090
01:04:22,435 --> 01:04:22,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl.

1091
01:04:23,115 --> 01:04:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?

1092
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:33,861
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.

1093
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:35,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yes.

1094
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:38,537
[SPEAKER_13]: He would make such a great Super Smash Bros.

1095
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:38,957
[SPEAKER_13]: character.

1096
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the virtual console, so you never know.

1097
01:04:44,518 --> 01:04:45,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard that.

1098
01:04:45,158 --> 01:04:46,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so excited.

1099
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:47,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be very hot.

1100
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:48,959
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she told me all about it.

1101
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:49,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Very hot.

1102
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1103
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:52,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Maisie, any other thoughts for our listeners today?

1104
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:53,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Chris.

1105
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris.

1106
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:55,680
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1107
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,901
[SPEAKER_13]: We totally owned those army guys down the hall.

1108
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we did.

1109
01:05:02,758 --> 01:05:03,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Blink, blink, blink, blink.

1110
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:04,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1111
01:05:04,178 --> 01:05:04,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you later.

1112
01:05:04,979 --> 01:05:06,240
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, tell me later.

1113
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie says hi.

1114
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:07,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Amy!

1115
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:09,301
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got a microphone.

1116
01:05:09,321 --> 01:05:09,942
[SPEAKER_13]: She heard me.

1117
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:10,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, huh?

1118
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:15,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?

1119
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:16,005
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a weesom.

1120
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:17,666
[SPEAKER_06]: This show is growing a vagina.

1121
01:05:17,686 --> 01:05:18,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be part of the weesom.

1122
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:20,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, you are a vagina.

1123
01:05:20,908 --> 01:05:21,929
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1124
01:05:21,969 --> 01:05:27,752
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we have the weird-looking, horn-shaped weesom.

1125
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,081
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea what that is.

1126
01:05:30,141 --> 01:05:30,561
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1127
01:05:30,901 --> 01:05:31,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Just look at the map.

1128
01:05:31,642 --> 01:05:33,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Macy, thanks for calling.

1129
01:05:33,584 --> 01:05:34,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Come back to California, you hear?

1130
01:05:35,466 --> 01:05:35,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1131
01:05:35,946 --> 01:05:36,207
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1132
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:36,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, babe.

1133
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:37,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, baby.

1134
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:38,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1135
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:39,270
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1136
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to another phone call.

1137
01:05:41,832 --> 01:05:43,794
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to this call right here.

1138
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:48,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1139
01:05:48,919 --> 01:05:49,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1140
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:51,021
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Ryoma.

1141
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,422
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm in the chat room right now.

1142
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:53,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Ryoma.

1143
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:54,044
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1144
01:05:55,050 --> 01:06:01,975
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting, um, with all the Wii stuff going on tonight.

1145
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:02,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what's up?

1146
01:06:02,816 --> 01:06:06,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.

1147
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:07,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1148
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,641
[SPEAKER_15]: I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.

1149
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:12,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes!

1150
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:13,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, how did that happen?

1151
01:06:13,663 --> 01:06:17,205
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.

1152
01:06:17,446 --> 01:06:17,806
[SPEAKER_15]: I was...

1153
01:06:18,362 --> 01:06:44,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Like doing some kind of math homework And I was listening to Radio Disney Because I used to have horrible taste in music And so they were saying, hey Be careful, Chris still listens to Radio Disney And you're offending her, be careful But, so anyways Wait, wait, hold on, I'm so sorry Hey, come on Chris Zippity-doo-dah, zippity-ay Oh, sorry, okay Now this show is just Turning into a preschool Sorry, Ranma, finish the story

1154
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't worry about it.

1155
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:55,406
[SPEAKER_15]: But so anyways, they had this thing called the code word of the day, where if you remembered it and you were like the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the code word, you would win something.

1156
01:06:55,787 --> 01:07:03,335
[SPEAKER_15]: And so like November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.

1157
01:07:03,355 --> 01:07:07,019
[SPEAKER_15]: So I called in and I was the seventh caller and I got a GameCube.

1158
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, go you.

1159
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:11,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?

1160
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:12,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this just bring back memories?

1161
01:07:12,752 --> 01:07:18,497
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away and it was Nintendo related.

1162
01:07:18,797 --> 01:07:20,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight?

1163
01:07:20,979 --> 01:07:21,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1164
01:07:21,379 --> 01:07:22,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you enter the contest?

1165
01:07:24,361 --> 01:07:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

1166
01:07:25,963 --> 01:07:27,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you bitter that you didn't win?

1167
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,225
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very bitter.

1168
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, get over it.

1169
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:31,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to tell you.

1170
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just messing with you.

1171
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:35,330
[SPEAKER_06]: You can try next time.

1172
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:36,872
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be something even better next time.

1173
01:07:36,892 --> 01:07:37,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1174
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:39,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You can win a date with Rob.

1175
01:07:39,933 --> 01:07:42,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, okay, dude, hold on.

1176
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:43,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Not cool.

1177
01:07:43,215 --> 01:07:48,700
[SPEAKER_06]: If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.

1178
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,441
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're 18.

1179
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:49,441
15.

1180
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:52,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait three years.

1181
01:07:52,623 --> 01:07:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll wait for you.

1182
01:07:54,665 --> 01:07:55,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1183
01:07:56,606 --> 01:07:59,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?

1184
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:07,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my PSP.

1185
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:10,054
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?

1186
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:11,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1187
01:08:12,735 --> 01:08:14,056
[SPEAKER_06]: What goods do you have in your PSP?

1188
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:16,697
[SPEAKER_15]: I have nothing for my PSP.

1189
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:21,159
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.

1190
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,241
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what... How much are you selling it for?

1191
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:24,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1192
01:08:24,881 --> 01:08:26,342
[SPEAKER_15]: However much GameStop takes it for.

1193
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:27,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, hey, you know what...

1194
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:32,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to me online, like when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.

1195
01:08:33,894 --> 01:08:36,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you got two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.

1196
01:08:36,535 --> 01:08:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob might have bought me, might have sold me on the PSP of Luminous 2, so we'll talk.

1197
01:08:41,477 --> 01:08:42,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.

1198
01:08:43,978 --> 01:08:47,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at this, Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.

1199
01:08:47,659 --> 01:08:48,980
[SPEAKER_06]: This might be good news for you, Ryoma.

1200
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:49,880
Yes!

1201
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:53,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.

1202
01:08:54,382 --> 01:08:54,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1203
01:08:54,782 --> 01:08:57,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, have a good one, Ryoma, thanks so much for calling.

1204
01:08:57,663 --> 01:08:57,943
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

1205
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:02,241
[SPEAKER_06]: HitStun says don't sell things to GameStop.

1206
01:09:02,561 --> 01:09:03,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki says $130.

1207
01:09:05,322 --> 01:09:17,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a brand new PSP and I was just curious because I got one from a work promotion thing or something and I was like okay well let me see how much they're going to take it for.

1208
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:18,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they said like $130.

1209
01:09:19,536 --> 01:09:20,017
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 or something.

1210
01:09:20,057 --> 01:09:22,538
[SPEAKER_03]: They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.

1211
01:09:23,298 --> 01:09:26,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll take it.

1212
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:27,760
[SPEAKER_06]: We got another call.

1213
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1214
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:29,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is this?

1215
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:31,182
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma.

1216
01:09:31,202 --> 01:09:31,842
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, guys?

1217
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:32,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Ranma.

1218
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:33,102
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

1219
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:37,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw your picture on Joystick today.

1220
01:09:38,665 --> 01:09:39,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.

1221
01:09:39,946 --> 01:09:41,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?

1222
01:09:42,307 --> 01:09:42,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1223
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know what the caption said on Joystick?

1224
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see it?

1225
01:09:45,703 --> 01:09:46,343
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I missed it.

1226
01:09:46,423 --> 01:09:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you'll love this.

1227
01:09:47,164 --> 01:09:49,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It said, here's a Super Mario brother.

1228
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:52,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the funny thing is?

1229
01:09:52,246 --> 01:09:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, hey, Luigi's not black, and I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian, hey!

1230
01:09:58,609 --> 01:10:02,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Luigi, mother... You know what?

1231
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,351
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just having fun with it.

1232
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:07,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares if you're not... Oh my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.

1233
01:10:08,093 --> 01:10:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't dress up as Barret your entire life.

1234
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:13,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not your fault that, you know...

1235
01:10:14,059 --> 01:10:15,920
[SPEAKER_06]: You're underrepresented in video games.

1236
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,221
[SPEAKER_06]: You could be 90% of the roster in NBA Live.

1237
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:19,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, John.

1238
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:21,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.

1239
01:10:22,784 --> 01:10:23,264
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1240
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:23,905
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1241
01:10:24,005 --> 01:10:25,726
[SPEAKER_12]: Cosplay for the win.

1242
01:10:25,966 --> 01:10:27,047
[SPEAKER_12]: Cosplay for the win.

1243
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so what happened?

1244
01:10:28,508 --> 01:10:29,668
[SPEAKER_06]: You were at the NYC.

1245
01:10:30,048 --> 01:10:30,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what happened?

1246
01:10:30,609 --> 01:10:35,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped out at Nintendo World Store.

1247
01:10:35,512 --> 01:10:35,932
[SPEAKER_06]: What happened?

1248
01:10:37,194 --> 01:10:45,696
[SPEAKER_02]: The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures, you know?

1249
01:10:45,777 --> 01:10:48,537
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, Louise, let me get your picture, let me get your picture!

1250
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are shouting, where's Mario?

1251
01:10:50,618 --> 01:10:54,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.

1252
01:11:00,041 --> 01:11:00,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1253
01:11:00,781 --> 01:11:01,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario was getting his link on.

1254
01:11:02,021 --> 01:11:05,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?

1255
01:11:05,882 --> 01:11:07,663
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and I'm really pissed off about that.

1256
01:11:07,703 --> 01:11:13,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping the damn line at Nintendo World.

1257
01:11:13,968 --> 01:11:15,569
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted it so badly.

1258
01:11:15,769 --> 01:11:18,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.

1259
01:11:18,971 --> 01:11:22,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time, playing the Wii.

1260
01:11:22,874 --> 01:11:25,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, were you originally planning on getting a Wii?

1261
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:31,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really, because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come down, and I'm like, okay, sure.

1262
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were just going along for, like, moral support?

1263
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:34,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1264
01:11:34,521 --> 01:11:35,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, that's cool.

1265
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you meet Reggie?

1266
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:37,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you meet my boss?

1267
01:11:38,062 --> 01:11:39,002
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I did not.

1268
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:41,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw this hair.

1269
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:43,546
[SPEAKER_06]: He saw the hair.

1270
01:11:44,766 --> 01:11:45,627
[SPEAKER_06]: There he is.

1271
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do we see a picture of him on Joystick?

1272
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:50,150
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing to that poor woman, Ranma?

1273
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:50,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it is.

1274
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:53,433
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, Folks love this Super Mario brother.

1275
01:11:55,134 --> 01:11:56,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're a brother, get it?

1276
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:58,256
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1277
01:11:58,769 --> 01:11:59,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you're going to be mad with me.

1278
01:11:59,489 --> 01:11:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1279
01:11:59,589 --> 01:12:00,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.

1280
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:31,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Get up on him, traitor.

1281
01:12:32,164 --> 01:12:34,566
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked for me, and I'm like, okay, sure.

1282
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:36,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know until after the fact.

1283
01:12:36,888 --> 01:12:38,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you pimp our show?

1284
01:12:38,349 --> 01:12:39,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have a button on?

1285
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I had nothing.

1286
01:12:40,871 --> 01:12:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just caught on right there.

1287
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:44,794
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

1288
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:45,675
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

1289
01:12:45,915 --> 01:12:47,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we really want that crowd?

1290
01:12:47,056 --> 01:12:52,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, people that are still watching G4, do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?

1291
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,281
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Ranma, enjoy your 15 minutes.

1292
01:12:55,342 --> 01:12:56,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I always do.

1293
01:12:56,103 --> 01:12:57,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Tick-tock, tick-tock.

1294
01:12:57,143 --> 01:12:57,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Clock's tickin'.

1295
01:12:58,314 --> 01:12:59,355
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

1296
01:12:59,996 --> 01:13:02,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I wake up getting ready to line up to get the wheeze.

1297
01:13:03,079 --> 01:13:04,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I turn around.

1298
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:09,505
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like 150 people that jump in line because they have everybody lining up up against the street.

1299
01:13:09,605 --> 01:13:10,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they have cops?

1300
01:13:10,366 --> 01:13:11,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't they have the NYPD out there?

1301
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:13,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but cops didn't do nothing.

1302
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean... They should have had the LAPD.

1303
01:13:17,053 --> 01:13:18,694
[SPEAKER_05]: They would have taught them a lesson.

1304
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:19,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

1305
01:13:20,547 --> 01:13:22,829
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the guys on the line started screaming, what the hell are you doing?

1306
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:23,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned around.

1307
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:27,792
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.

1308
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:29,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what the hell, dude?

1309
01:13:29,553 --> 01:13:31,635
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.

1310
01:13:31,755 --> 01:13:33,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.

1311
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was changing.

1312
01:13:35,857 --> 01:13:43,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I saw some video on Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of us.

1313
01:13:43,963 --> 01:13:44,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It was crazy.

1314
01:13:44,683 --> 01:13:45,944
[SPEAKER_06]: That's exactly what happened.

1315
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:47,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Rama, I got to end this call.

1316
01:13:47,305 --> 01:13:48,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other final thoughts for us?

1317
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have your wee Miklatov You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN

1318
01:14:17,065 --> 01:14:23,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had to oblige him.

1319
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.

1320
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:29,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.

1321
01:14:30,715 --> 01:14:31,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell us his name on air?

1322
01:14:31,896 --> 01:14:34,118
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm not going to.

1323
01:14:35,219 --> 01:14:38,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But we all know now, see, if you work with Mikotov, you know that he has a crush on one of his co-workers.

1324
01:14:38,762 --> 01:14:40,123
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.

1325
01:14:40,423 --> 01:14:40,943
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1326
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,747
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say how amazing the Wii is.

1327
01:14:46,645 --> 01:14:48,146
[SPEAKER_09]: and how much I'm big in Zelda.

1328
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You are loving the Wii and Zelda?

1329
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:52,388
[SPEAKER_06]: What's so great about Zelda in your mind?

1330
01:14:53,509 --> 01:15:05,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you go into the Twilight World for the first time and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.

1331
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:07,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Even without component cables?

1332
01:15:08,657 --> 01:15:10,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.

1333
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:13,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be picking them up once they come in.

1334
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:17,897
[SPEAKER_09]: I can make do with this for another month.

1335
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:19,318
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still beautiful.

1336
01:15:19,718 --> 01:15:20,999
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did you pick up besides Zelda?

1337
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:21,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything?

1338
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:28,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I got some Wii points and I picked up Solomon's Key.

1339
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:29,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what it was?

1340
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:30,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.

1341
01:15:31,786 --> 01:15:33,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.

1342
01:15:33,587 --> 01:15:34,848
[SPEAKER_09]: I forgot how awesome that was.

1343
01:15:34,928 --> 01:15:38,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up very soon, hopefully.

1344
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:39,431
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1345
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:46,033
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as I get a Wii Classic controller, I will be taking up SimCity because that's actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.

1346
01:15:46,553 --> 01:15:49,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll probably lend you a GameCube controller.

1347
01:15:50,674 --> 01:15:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.

1348
01:15:53,995 --> 01:15:55,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?

1349
01:15:56,216 --> 01:15:56,716
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

1350
01:15:56,736 --> 01:15:58,916
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have like 50 of them.

1351
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:02,858
[SPEAKER_06]: She's offering to let you borrow a GameCube controller.

1352
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1353
01:16:05,658 --> 01:16:06,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1354
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:08,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now you have a reason to come up again.

1355
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:10,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, I always have a reason.

1356
01:16:11,797 --> 01:16:15,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.

1357
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane says he'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.

1358
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:22,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow.

1359
01:16:23,847 --> 01:16:24,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanksgiving.

1360
01:16:25,969 --> 01:16:28,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway.

1361
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be gone.

1362
01:16:30,592 --> 01:16:31,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be gone during the next show.

1363
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:34,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?

1364
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:36,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm actually going to

1365
01:16:36,823 --> 01:16:40,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Go have it with Extifer's family because his mom invited me.

1366
01:16:41,025 --> 01:16:41,805
[SPEAKER_11]: How about that weekend?

1367
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:43,466
[SPEAKER_09]: That weekend?

1368
01:16:43,546 --> 01:16:43,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Totally.

1369
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:47,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I will bring you a GameCube controller.

1370
01:16:48,208 --> 01:16:48,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Not cool.

1371
01:16:48,849 --> 01:16:50,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be gone all next weekend.

1372
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:52,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.

1373
01:16:52,891 --> 01:16:53,971
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can play it on my TV.

1374
01:16:55,952 --> 01:16:56,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

1375
01:16:56,532 --> 01:16:56,792
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1376
01:16:56,892 --> 01:16:58,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to throw one other thing in real quick?

1377
01:16:58,793 --> 01:16:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes.

1378
01:16:59,454 --> 01:17:00,014
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could.

1379
01:17:00,791 --> 01:17:06,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.

1380
01:17:06,617 --> 01:17:06,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

1381
01:17:06,818 --> 01:17:07,198
[SPEAKER_07]: What happened?

1382
01:17:07,218 --> 01:17:19,692
[SPEAKER_09]: They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III, and they promised Wii Classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.

1383
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:29,446
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm sick of going in there and them forcing me to, not forcing me, but pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked in the store and they sell everything $5 higher.

1384
01:17:29,706 --> 01:17:32,028
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they can suck it and I hate them.

1385
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:35,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have an offer for you?

1386
01:17:35,531 --> 01:17:41,435
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.

1387
01:17:41,936 --> 01:17:43,497
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, okay.

1388
01:17:43,557 --> 01:17:50,122
[SPEAKER_12]: To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they, you know, I don't know about the Lost, you know,

1389
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:52,974
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just

1390
01:18:03,271 --> 01:18:07,414
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.

1391
01:18:30,174 --> 01:18:33,075
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.

1392
01:18:33,155 --> 01:18:39,217
[SPEAKER_11]: I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management, so they can all bite my ass.

1393
01:18:39,777 --> 01:18:40,838
[SPEAKER_11]: The employees are awesome.

1394
01:18:40,918 --> 01:18:42,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.

1395
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:44,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Left cheek or right cheek?

1396
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:45,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Both.

1397
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,341
[SPEAKER_09]: With a flaming corncob stuck up it.

1398
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what, Miklotov, what?

1399
01:18:52,042 --> 01:18:55,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody go buy Sneak King, because Sneak King is the best.

1400
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,964
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to line right now.

1401
01:18:57,244 --> 01:18:57,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

1402
01:18:58,519 --> 01:19:02,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball cheap.

1403
01:19:02,622 --> 01:19:05,745
[SPEAKER_03]: This show is not for you to hock your games on.

1404
01:19:06,045 --> 01:19:08,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.

1405
01:19:08,627 --> 01:19:09,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk about it later, Shane.

1406
01:19:09,668 --> 01:19:10,128
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta go.

1407
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:10,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1408
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:11,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye.

1409
01:19:11,389 --> 01:19:12,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, whatever.

1410
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:13,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta play Zelda.

1411
01:19:13,391 --> 01:19:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1412
01:19:13,711 --> 01:19:13,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1413
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:14,752
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you a message.

1414
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, send him a WeMail.

1415
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:18,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1416
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:19,555
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today.

1417
01:19:19,575 --> 01:19:20,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It was WeMail.

1418
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:21,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'll tell you what.

1419
01:19:21,377 --> 01:19:28,082
[SPEAKER_03]: You friend me on the WeCons thing because we do have a thread going on in the OLR Army forum.

1420
01:19:28,967 --> 01:19:30,028
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do, friend me.

1421
01:19:30,328 --> 01:19:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I will send you a bunch of memes.

1422
01:19:31,689 --> 01:19:32,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, snap.

1423
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:33,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, here we go.

1424
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:34,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's another call.

1425
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:35,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1426
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:36,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1427
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the one and only Legend of Sakurama.

1428
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:40,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously.

1429
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:42,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you're in New York City, too.

1430
01:19:42,255 --> 01:19:45,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?

1431
01:19:46,258 --> 01:19:46,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I stayed home.

1432
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:47,879
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I have to say.

1433
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You stayed home?

1434
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:49,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1435
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?

1436
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:54,443
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't want to deal with it.

1437
01:19:54,483 --> 01:19:57,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already seen the massive lines for the PS3 around my way.

1438
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:08,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd just rather just take a break Yeah, but those were quote-unquote business people Oh, yeah, the greed monsters Alright, what possessed you to call in tonight, Zagu?

1439
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:19,941
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like 30 seconds of just stomping on a soft pad.

1440
01:20:20,061 --> 01:20:30,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped the shark already, something to that effect.

1441
01:20:30,704 --> 01:20:33,924
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch Total Request Live.

1442
01:20:34,024 --> 01:20:36,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?

1443
01:20:37,008 --> 01:20:37,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing you didn't.

1444
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:41,992
[SPEAKER_01]: They made him play Fallout Boy and they only showed it for 30 seconds.

1445
01:20:42,933 --> 01:20:49,938
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what I hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had a play on Softpads.

1446
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,420
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?

1447
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,063
[SPEAKER_01]: No YouTube link as far as I know.

1448
01:20:56,323 --> 01:20:56,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

1449
01:20:56,844 --> 01:20:59,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good thing because it's just not worth it.

1450
01:21:00,326 --> 01:21:02,508
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, but on the flip side, it's just,

1451
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:09,194
[SPEAKER_01]: It might draw more people into DDR because if they see Fall Out Boy on a dance pad, they'll drive into it.

1452
01:21:09,895 --> 01:21:16,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's kind of... It's basically... Some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target of it.

1453
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:23,165
[SPEAKER_05]: The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls, thank you.

1454
01:21:23,206 --> 01:21:25,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, but think about it.

1455
01:21:26,808 --> 01:21:28,470
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to think about it.

1456
01:21:28,610 --> 01:21:31,072
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to... Look,

1457
01:21:32,817 --> 01:21:41,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we gotta wrap it up, because we gotta start ending this show, because we're running, like, super long tonight, but how do you feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?

1458
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:42,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Overall.

1459
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:45,041
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really depends.

1460
01:21:45,141 --> 01:22:01,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it might be, like, stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much of, you know, of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only play the game, but also live lives, and have, you know, and make friends out of the thing.

1461
01:22:02,455 --> 01:22:04,436
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR is not just about arrow stopping.

1462
01:22:04,476 --> 01:22:10,981
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about, you know, in certain ways, you meet people and you make, you know, make good and long friendships out of it.

1463
01:22:14,223 --> 01:22:15,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say one other thing real quick.

1464
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:20,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever happened to La Machina del Bailar or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie about DDR?

1465
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:22,268
[SPEAKER_06]: That just randomly crossed my mind.

1466
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:23,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever happened to that?

1467
01:22:23,589 --> 01:22:24,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded it.

1468
01:22:24,049 --> 01:22:26,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.

1469
01:22:27,172 --> 01:22:27,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And?

1470
01:22:27,952 --> 01:22:30,074
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard is, like, they didn't even...

1471
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:43,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, they kind of like, I wouldn't say they bastardized it, but from what I hear, they only played like the demo mode is just about, you know, the whole story was revolving about just winning this competition.

1472
01:22:43,632 --> 01:22:51,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say that La Machina del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food restaurants?

1473
01:22:52,657 --> 01:22:52,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

1474
01:22:53,017 --> 01:22:55,318
[SPEAKER_06]: 10K commotion in the movie.

1475
01:22:55,358 --> 01:22:57,139
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's more like you got served.

1476
01:22:57,859 --> 01:22:58,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

1477
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.

1478
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:00,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, buddy.

1479
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:02,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, peace out.

1480
01:23:02,634 --> 01:23:02,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1481
01:23:23,743 --> 01:23:29,427
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, I'd like to start by saying there's this one post on GoNintendo.com.

1482
01:23:29,947 --> 01:23:37,431
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii because apparently his company did not hook him up.

1483
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:40,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was funny.

1484
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:47,844
[SPEAKER_06]: To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see on the TV.

1485
01:23:48,204 --> 01:23:49,145
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not his fault.

1486
01:23:49,405 --> 01:23:53,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like we did?

1487
01:23:54,247 --> 01:23:54,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1488
01:23:54,527 --> 01:23:55,388
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1489
01:23:56,068 --> 01:24:05,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so of course amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3, the Boston Mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino,

1490
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:17,558
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to charge Sony for the police manpower that it took to basically bring this whole chaotic situation to order.

1491
01:24:18,379 --> 01:24:19,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was kind of funny.

1492
01:24:21,881 --> 01:24:25,624
[SPEAKER_03]: WePlay has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S.

1493
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:28,166
[SPEAKER_03]: in January, according to Reggie.

1494
01:24:28,566 --> 01:24:33,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a

1495
01:24:33,854 --> 01:24:36,995
[SPEAKER_03]: controller for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.

1496
01:24:37,915 --> 01:24:48,559
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360 apparently aren't 720p when they say they are.

1497
01:24:48,919 --> 01:24:53,260
[SPEAKER_03]: The resolution's a little bit less than that, which I think is kind of interesting.

1498
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of get gypped there.

1499
01:24:54,240 --> 01:25:01,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Killzone 2's going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.

1500
01:25:02,023 --> 01:25:03,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise there.

1501
01:25:04,069 --> 01:25:14,057
[SPEAKER_03]: EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction policy.

1502
01:25:14,478 --> 01:25:20,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites, and those websites are making money by selling advertising.

1503
01:25:21,443 --> 01:25:26,307
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.

1504
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:32,972
[SPEAKER_03]: I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going to be able to access content they want.

1505
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:36,003
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest though, I think that's still stupid.

1506
01:25:36,483 --> 01:25:37,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Dumb excuse.

1507
01:25:38,304 --> 01:25:40,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's see here.

1508
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:47,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Kuduragi, um, said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network storage system for the PlayStation 3.

1509
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:49,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's crazy.

1510
01:25:50,853 --> 01:25:58,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you, um, buy a 40 inch HDTV, um, you get the reserve of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.

1511
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:00,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

1512
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the PlayStation 3.

1513
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:04,629
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the best one I read this week.

1514
01:26:05,409 --> 01:26:12,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, if you do have an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i.

1515
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:13,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, it will downscale it to 480p.

1516
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:24,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I thought was very interesting.

1517
01:26:24,131 --> 01:26:33,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have just a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for the PlayStation 3.

1518
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:39,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, the HDMI for the PlayStation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is interesting.

1519
01:26:40,425 --> 01:26:44,468
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, a couple last ones here.

1520
01:26:45,271 --> 01:26:55,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony's Vice President of Marketing was talking about the Crying Babies commercial that they have for the PlayStation 3 and basically saying it's like a rough shot test.

1521
01:26:55,714 --> 01:27:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you think about the commercials, what you think about the PlayStation 3.

1522
01:27:00,435 --> 01:27:05,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess my take on PlayStation 3 would be I don't get it and it's slightly creepy.

1523
01:27:07,616 --> 01:27:11,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense.

1524
01:27:11,337 --> 01:27:14,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.

1525
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:16,225
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that, I could see that.

1526
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, the last one.

1527
01:27:19,787 --> 01:27:20,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you say that on the last one?

1528
01:27:22,027 --> 01:27:22,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Forget it, forget it.

1529
01:27:23,448 --> 01:27:23,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1530
01:27:23,908 --> 01:27:26,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is the very last one.

1531
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:38,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.

1532
01:27:38,974 --> 01:27:42,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently a nearby apartment

1533
01:27:43,351 --> 01:27:47,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain their line.

1534
01:27:48,174 --> 01:27:48,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, God.

1535
01:27:48,955 --> 01:28:02,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young girls became underage, or apparently underage girls, and somebody called the cops.

1536
01:28:02,344 --> 01:28:08,729
[SPEAKER_06]: They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3, apparently, or whatever the F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.

1537
01:28:10,650 --> 01:28:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, anything else?

1538
01:28:12,955 --> 01:28:13,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

1539
01:28:13,775 --> 01:28:14,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?

1540
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:14,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

1541
01:28:15,416 --> 01:28:15,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?

1542
01:28:16,077 --> 01:28:16,437
[SPEAKER_05]: DMN?

1543
01:28:17,097 --> 01:28:18,318
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to adjourn.

1544
01:28:18,798 --> 01:28:19,058
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1545
01:28:19,458 --> 01:28:19,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

1546
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:21,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's time to wrap up the show.

1547
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:22,420
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been running very long tonight.

1548
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:30,724
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks, of course, to all you guys who download us in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.

1549
01:28:30,744 --> 01:28:31,724
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

1550
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:32,605
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you very much.

1551
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks, of course, to our guests.

1552
01:28:35,786 --> 01:28:37,687
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way from Seattle.

1553
01:28:37,707 --> 01:28:38,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thank you for having me.

1554
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:39,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a great time.

1555
01:28:39,608 --> 01:28:40,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, thank you for being here.

1556
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:41,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, thanks again for...

1557
01:28:42,205 --> 01:28:44,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Horring Out Orange Lingerie the way you did last night.

1558
01:28:44,506 --> 01:28:44,926
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

1559
01:28:44,986 --> 01:28:45,486
[SPEAKER_12]: I enjoyed it.

1560
01:28:45,506 --> 01:28:46,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for having me on.

1561
01:28:46,386 --> 01:28:46,866
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

1562
01:28:47,346 --> 01:28:50,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always.

1563
01:28:50,227 --> 01:28:52,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1564
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:53,448
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with our guests.

1565
01:28:53,608 --> 01:28:54,548
[SPEAKER_06]: DMN, your final thought.

1566
01:28:55,829 --> 01:28:56,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hungry.

1567
01:28:58,309 --> 01:28:59,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris, your final thought.

1568
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not hungry.

1569
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:02,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I just had a donut.

1570
01:29:04,491 --> 01:29:05,851
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

1571
01:29:06,651 --> 01:29:09,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.

1572
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:15,221
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.

1573
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:16,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Cry.

1574
01:29:16,442 --> 01:29:16,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1575
01:29:17,342 --> 01:29:19,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want any more orange soda.

1576
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:24,686
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already had four cans of it and that's... More orange soda.

1577
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:29,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.

1578
01:29:29,728 --> 01:29:30,569
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys rock.

1579
01:29:31,349 --> 01:29:35,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, next week on Orange Launch Radio, I do not believe we're going to be live.

1580
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:36,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we already talk about that?

1581
01:29:37,382 --> 01:29:39,724
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to be live during the holiday

1582
01:30:05,993 --> 01:30:07,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

1583
01:30:35,532 --> 01:30:42,314
