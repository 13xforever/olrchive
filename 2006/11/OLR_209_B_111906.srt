00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,160
All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 209 for this November

2
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
the 19th of 2006.

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,360
Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend,

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,760
or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out or a current gen user who's not upgrading

5
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,480
to next gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,960
program.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,960
We here at Orange Lounge Radio are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,600
away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off part B.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,340
If you want to know the details, you have to listen to part A. Remember Orange Lounge

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,560
Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,880
There's part A, which comes out on Monday, and part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,360
instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,960
Our chat room is eagerly standing by.

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,980
This is something special we did for our live listeners only.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,780
We only advertise this on our live journal and our MySpace communities, so if you want

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,920
to find out about future contests before anyone else does, you might want to sign up.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,000
Live journal, our user name is Orange Lounge, and on MySpace we're MySpace.com slash Orange

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Lounge Radio.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,040
All right, we should stop stalling, huh, DMN?

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Yeah.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
God.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,080
DMN, AKA John, is just doing this out of the goodness of his heart, so there's no other

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
reason for it.

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,400
All right, let's stop, let's stop stalling.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Let's get to the winner.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
All right, here we go.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm now going to pull up random.org, so John, you're going to be picking, I'm pulling 10

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,160
random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away, and he is going to tell me which

29
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,320
one of the 10 numbers I'm picking right now.

30
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
Rob?

31
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Yes.

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Whatever email is number six on that list.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, oh, this is great.

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,440
All right, guess what number six is?

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,280
It was email number 37.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
In a row?

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
In a row?

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Yeah, I know how it's coming.

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
All right, let's count them out, and I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
or any of that stuff.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,840
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen,

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,400
eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty, thirty-two,

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,080
thirty-four, thirty-six, here it is, thirty-seven.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, look who won it.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
Let's give them...

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Oh, they're going to be...

47
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,760
Oh, I'm...

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
You know what?

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,480
This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,060
This person is going to be very excited.

51
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,960
Let's give them a call right now.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,600
All right, let's give them a call right now.

53
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,640
It's connecting.

54
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,080
Yeah, it's ringing right now, boys and girls.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Let's hope it works.

56
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
Here it goes.

57
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
It's ringing.

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
It's ringing.

59
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Hello?

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Hi.

61
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,080
Did somebody order a pizza?

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Hi.

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
We're kidding.

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Is this Raven's Dolphin?

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,200
Just kidding.

66
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,440
This is Orange Lounge Radio calling.

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
You just won a Wii.

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
No, you won the Wii, my friend.

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
We're kidding.

71
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
No, no, no.

72
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
You just won it.

73
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Oh, my God.

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,440
I won a Wii.

75
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Yep.

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
You won the Wii, my friend.

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
Oh, my God.

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,920
Dude, I've got to say, I'm jazzed for you, calling to this show all the time.

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
And for once, we're Skyping you.

80
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,960
And for once, we're calling you to tell you that you won a Wii.

81
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
You did it.

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
You were emailed number 37 in the inbox.

83
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,560
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
So you did it.

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
I'm literally speechless.

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
I know.

87
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,540
I'd go crazy, too, if I were you.

88
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,120
So congratulations.

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,000
So what are you going to do with your Wii?

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,720
Do you already own a Wii?

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
No.

92
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
No.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Sort of.

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
What?

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Sort of?

96
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
What does that mean?

97
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
All right.

98
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
I do.

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
But I have plans for this.

100
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Oh.

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
What's the plans for this?

102
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
All right.

103
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,920
I was going to do something similar to DMN, but I won a Wii.

104
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I'm happy about that.

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,920
The question is, I'm not going to go on an eBay.

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
Good.

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
That's very generous.

109
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
That's very cool.

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
That's very cool.

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,560
So someone's going to get it.

112
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
That's awesome.

113
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,160
Well, congratulations, Ravenstaufen.

114
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,180
We need to get in touch with DMN.

115
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,880
You know my personal email on the site, right?

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,600
Just send me an email and we'll get your shipping address and get it taken care of, all right?

117
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,320
Oh, one more thing, Rob.

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
Yes.

119
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Long time you on the line.

120
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Yes.

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Rayman's Raven Rabbits.

122
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Yes.

123
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Give me one.

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
What about it?

125
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Rayman's Raven Rabbits.

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
What about it?

127
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:48,160
All right, there's this DDR team that you drum this deck with it and you beat the little

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,520
rabbits to death, and it reminds me so much of you, and I enjoy it because they play girls

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
that want to have fun, and it's such an enjoyable.

130
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Gee, thanks.

131
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
All right.

132
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,640
I haven't played that mini game yet.

133
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
Yes, you did.

135
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
That one?

136
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Would girls just want to have fun?

137
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
No.

138
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
When we played the one with the...

139
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
It was Misery Loo that played.

140
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes.

141
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
But we played that one.

142
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,640
All right.

143
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Raven's off.

144
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,960
We've got to get back into the show, but thanks so much for entering and supporting Orange

145
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,160
Launch Radio, and now we're giving something back to you.

146
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Oh, my gosh.

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
All right.

148
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I can't believe I won.

149
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
All right.

150
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Have a good one.

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Have a good one.

152
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
See you back.

153
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
All right.

154
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,480
And of course, everybody in our chat was very bitter over the fact that he may or may not

155
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
already own a Wii, but you know what?

156
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,220
Hey, it's fair and square.

157
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
We said it in front.

158
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,340
Whoever wants to enter the contest can, and it sounds like he's got really good plans

159
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,280
for the Wii that he's going to give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas

160
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
time.

161
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
So you know what?

162
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
I can't argue with that.

163
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
That's going to be great.

164
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
You guys stop being Scrooges.

165
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
That's right.

166
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
You guys are just Scrooge.

167
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
You're bitter.

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,520
You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.

169
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,060
So just, you know, maybe next time.

170
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,640
We got other stuff to give away and I've come to see your bundle of flip.

171
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Oh, you know what?

172
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,440
Oh, I was going to tell people about this.

173
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,480
If you've been reading the forms, it's going to be ongoing, you know, whenever it happens,

174
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,080
but we're going to have a new contest called early release.

175
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,880
Get your mind out of the gutter where we get games a little early where I work.

176
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,880
So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now announcing games and we'll probably

177
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,300
do the same thing as we did here.

178
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,960
Like if a game comes out, like, you know, I think we may start it either next month,

179
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,040
either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare because a lot of people

180
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,240
love that.

181
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,880
We're going to give away the game before it comes out so you can rub it in people's faces.

182
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,640
I played it before it came out.

183
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,640
Bitches.

184
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,640
All right.

185
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,640
We'll look forward to that.

186
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,920
So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance

187
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
later on.

188
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,200
And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going

189
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
to have some cool stuff for you guys too.

190
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,640
We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really

191
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,960
catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,680
So anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,760
Let's go back to the show, shall we?

194
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,200
And talk about some more gaming news.

195
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
All right, let's.

196
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,240
So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving, and we all know it comes after Thanksgiving

197
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,040
other than, you know, falling asleep from overeating Black Friday.

198
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,680
And of course, you know, with Black Friday there's always going to be, you know, great

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,000
deals on games and stuff.

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,100
And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.

201
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,400
They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.

202
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:43,520
For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Table

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,480
Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store

204
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,740
before noon.

205
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,360
And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,920
Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4,

207
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,600
and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.

208
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
So that's not bad either.

209
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
I mean, those are some pretty good games.

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,440
Full Auto is fun.

211
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
All right.

212
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,040
Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are

213
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,560
taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.

214
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,900
You know, I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging

215
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,900
you to do it.

216
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,960
I don't know if people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia, it's pretty rad.

217
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,760
But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia,

218
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,080
and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 11111, or Sony sucks

219
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,440
and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 111DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia

220
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
to add a...

221
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
The hell I have.

222
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,760
Ken Kutaragi's Bio PS eats crayons, or maybe it's Macy, who knows.

223
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,800
So anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down.

224
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,400
They've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony, for until further notice, so that

225
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,960
you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user, I'm assuming of some standing

226
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,520
there on Wikipedia, because if you're registered, then they can track what you do and give you

227
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,160
the ban of death, the ban hammer.

228
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,120
Isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii?

229
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Ban hammer?

230
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
No, project hammer, I know.

231
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,080
Whatever happened to project hammer?

232
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,840
I remember hearing about that at E3, but where did it go?

233
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
Oh, next year.

234
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
All right.

235
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,720
So anyway, be good when you're editing Wikipedia articles, or else you'll get the project hammer

236
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
slammed on you by the staff at Wikipedia.

237
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,440
Well, not that it has too much to do with hammers, but I guess you could take it that

238
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,640
way.

239
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,960
Guess what game's coming out on PSP?

240
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Super Mario Brothers?

241
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Luminous 3.

242
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,440
No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.

243
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Really?

244
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:55,680
In Rising Star Games Evolution series, those are the PSP remakes, their DS ones are Revolution,

245
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
and it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:06,440
Should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about

247
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
it.

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,960
And for anyone who's bitching that it was not on DS, yeah, it was.

249
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,160
You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?

250
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
I thought it was Rainbow Stars.

251
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
That's the one that you shoot?

252
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
That's Parasol Stars.

253
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,660
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbows.

254
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,660
I love Rainbow Islands.

255
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,040
That's the one that you shoot the rainbows.

256
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Yeah, that's fun.

257
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,920
I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.

258
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,720
See, I universes actually have it on Turbo Graphics, but I would love to have a hand-held

259
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Parasol Stars.

260
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,320
Well, I mean, technically I do, since I have one of the portable Turbo Graphics.

261
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,520
But I would love to have it on, you know...

262
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,120
But Rainbow Islands is the classic.

263
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,000
Not as many people play Parasol Stars.

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,640
You know I have to ask this question though, will I be able to get past level 30?

265
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,540
Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe

266
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,440
eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might

267
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,840
function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.

268
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,120
Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangeonserator.com said almost the same thing I did when I said

269
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
it.

270
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,020
It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?

271
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,280
So very cool.

272
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,480
Rama agrees, Paracel Stars owns.

273
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,480
I think the first time I ever saw Paracel Stars, I want to say was on Supercade or whatever

274
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
that game show.

275
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
No, Supercade.

276
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Ultracade?

277
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
No, the game show.

278
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
God, Starcade.

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,320
No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.

280
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,060
Starcade was the name of that show.

281
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,600
They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good, remember?

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,480
That was a great show.

283
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,240
When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starcade.

284
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,740
It was awesome.

285
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,360
That's just craziness.

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Crazy.

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Craziness.

288
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Crazy.

289
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,800
Okay, maybe not that crazy.

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:56,480
Anywho, okay, so of course with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.

291
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,360
And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.

292
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:11,080
You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.

293
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,720
And they have a wonderful little application to easily install it on there for you.

294
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,800
So homebrew on 2.8.

295
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,540
I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly

296
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:28,620
upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.

297
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,280
Are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?

298
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,440
Have you been following this at all?

299
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
No, I just keep upgrading.

300
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,440
You just keep upgrading?

301
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,520
It's kind of lost now, wanting to do the whole NES games on this.

302
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,880
I just don't care anymore.

303
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,920
I don't hardly play.

304
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,100
I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.

305
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,400
The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out, but really

306
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,920
I mean that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.

307
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
I still like my PSP for like web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading

308
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,760
shows and playing Luminous, of course, but I don't know.

309
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
Somebody was telling me, John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the

310
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,120
PSP's a done deal in 2007?

311
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Yes.

312
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,920
Even with all the PS3 support?

313
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It doesn't matter.

314
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
It's gimmicky.

315
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
No, no, no.

316
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
This is honestly what I'm thinking.

317
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,760
Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to

318
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,440
like the Big Daddy console, it sucked, and with the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.

319
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,060
The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.

320
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,020
Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?

321
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
They could.

322
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,200
I doubt it.

323
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,880
I mean it would be nice to see something like that work.

324
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:43,760
I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be

325
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
cool.

326
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,360
I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.

327
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
We shall see.

328
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,180
Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that

329
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,320
pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back

330
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
anyway.

331
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,680
Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?

332
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,640
You buy a DS regular, oh, here comes the DS Lite, oh, here it comes in prettier colors,

333
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,640
right?

334
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Right?

335
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
This happens all the time.

336
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
Well, guess what?

337
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,240
You knew this was going to happen when you saw those pictures of the Wiis at E3, and

338
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,800
then suddenly you saw the Wiis in the different colors, and then now you only have the white

339
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Wii, right?

340
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, sure enough, it is, now this is kind of a rumor, but Game Daily, who originally

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,640
reported this, gamedaily.com is saying this is confirmed, that Nintendo of America confirmed

342
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,800
that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii,

343
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,240
will be coming to the U.S. sometime during 2007.

344
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,600
Let's see, there's something, quote, Sonic Cineplayer CE DVD Navigator will be bringing

345
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,320
high-quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.

346
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,720
So kind of interesting, so we already know there's probably going to be a souped-up Wii

347
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
somewhere in 2007.

348
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,720
But it's going to be more than $249.99.

349
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,440
I would say it might be, you know, in the mid-300 dollar range.

350
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:19,840
One billion dollars, not really, but you know, is that many people going to want to get this

351
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
just for DVD playback?

352
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
I mean, it's...

353
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
I don't think so.

354
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Who cares?

355
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm not.

356
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
I have several DVD players.

357
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
I have 60 that works just fine as a DVD player.

358
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,020
I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD

359
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,080
player, and you know, an upscaling DVD player.

360
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
Why do I want...

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,640
I have a five-disc changer in my living room.

362
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
You want a cookie?

363
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
No, I want a donut, though.

364
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Okay.

365
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
No, not really.

366
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,840
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to

367
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,000
my main TV.

368
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,120
Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand, doesn't know what the right hand

369
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
is doing.

370
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,600
So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there, they don't

371
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,880
know what each other's doing.

372
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Interesting.

373
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,880
All right.

374
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,080
Well, we'll see.

375
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,000
Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?

376
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No.

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No.

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,480
Now, what if they sweetened the pot with some, like, maybe different colors, like maybe

379
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,960
get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory?

380
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?

381
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,640
If they get a pink Wii, they're buying that for my girlfriend, because that's all she's

382
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
going to want.

383
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
I want the pink Wii!

384
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,680
It's so cute!

385
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,000
If it were a big black Wii, maybe.

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,360
Just inserting the media into the pink slot is, you know.

387
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,480
I just want you to put this card in my pink Wii slot.

388
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,000
Wow!

389
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,140
Upgrade my memory!

390
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,140
Upgrade my memory!

391
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,400
Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?

392
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,000
How about some UK release dates?

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,940
All right, sure, why not?

394
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,000
We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's show them some love.

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,180
Dark Sakura, love them all right now.

397
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,680
Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.

398
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,360
Asphalt Urban GT2, Bionicle Heroes on multiple systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty

399
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,560
Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets!

400
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Come out over here!

401
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Hell fucking yes!

402
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,520
Aragon's coming out on damn near everything based off of the unintelligible book of the

403
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
same name.

404
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,080
Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.

405
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,600
Hotel Duskroom 2-15, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix,

406
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Fantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Arrival

407
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Swords, Race the Official WTCC Game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns

408
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,760
the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff

409
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,440
that has unconfirmed dates.

410
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
Excellent.

411
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
Cool.

412
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,560
Anyways, for the US, we're getting quite a bit of stuff, and of course got to start everything

413
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,360
off with our wonderful exclusive information.

414
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,880
So starting with a few price drops actually, and I'm not too surprised by this, but NBA

415
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Live 07, they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats, the 360 is now

416
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
$39.99.

417
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,320
I guess NBA Live 07 really didn't sell that well, so that's interesting.

418
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,000
Blazing Angels has been delayed for the Wii to March 14th, and then finally not really

419
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,240
game related, but Final Fantasy Advent Children, the collector's gift set, with a bonus DVD,

420
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:31,720
script and postcards will be coming to your favorite video outlet on February 6th.

421
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,000
So that'll be pretty fun.

422
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,520
Now for game release dates of course, the big game of course this week would be Superman

423
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,920
Returns, and that's coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems, and

424
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,200
some of my favorite games though.

425
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
Can I interrupt real quick?

426
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
I'm sorry.

427
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Did anyone play the demo?

428
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,720
Because I heard the demo went to live this week, and I haven't heard a lot of chat about

429
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
it.

430
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,060
I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.

431
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,080
I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look

432
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
that bad.

433
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
It looked pretty awesome.

434
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,640
I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.

435
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,760
I watched someone stack cars, and that was pretty funny.

436
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,800
Another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally

437
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,200
coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.

438
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,680
If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will

439
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,360
be coming out on the 360, Africa, the kind of Africa I like.

440
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,760
How about Jambo Safari?

441
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,640
Give me that again.

442
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,360
And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and the Xbox 360.

443
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,560
No one on the Playstation 2, for some reason that one was delayed to December, which is

444
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
very interesting.

445
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,120
And then Thrillville will be coming out on Playstation 2 and Xbox, and if you're a fan

446
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:58,480
of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.

447
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,960
That's basically the big stuff.

448
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,840
Get a bunch of crappy DS games.

449
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,280
I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.

450
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,400
I want to see some of the movie-based games, like Open Season and Barnyard.

451
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Stuff you probably wouldn't want to pick up anyways.

452
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,360
I might if I had children.

453
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,600
I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me, Happy Feet has a DDR rip-off in it.

454
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,320
But Miklotov told me Happy Feet was the worst movie ever.

455
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
But I love penguins.

456
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,440
I know, it looks so cute.

457
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,240
I want to say Miklotov is full of evil, but I don't know.

458
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming

459
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,240
out.

460
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,600
Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.

461
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,920
And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.

462
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Hi there, Japan.

463
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
How are you guys doing?

464
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,440
You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.

465
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,040
On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, I know some of you guys are looking forward

466
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
to that one.

467
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,800
NBA Live 07, X-Men the official game, and you guys are getting the HD DVD player this

468
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
week.

469
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
This one made me squeal a little bit.

470
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,400
A lot of folks don't remember this game.

471
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
It was on the PS2.

472
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
It's called Cold Sept.

473
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,760
There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360, and it does look like it's

474
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,080
a sequel to the first game.

475
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,560
It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.

476
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,320
But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.

477
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,360
They have a trailer up on live for, it was during the E3 thing for that.

478
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
Oh, I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.

479
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,200
Cold Sept, hopefully it's coming out over here.

480
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm sure it is.

481
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Eventually.

482
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Eventually.

483
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,880
It's coming out from Japan, which means it will be making its way over here somewhat

484
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
soon.

485
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,440
Well, hey, I got some kind of random dimension.

486
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,920
You know Disgaea?

487
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,720
They're actually starting up an anime series for that.

488
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,080
I thought that we reported on that a while ago.

489
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,480
Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.

490
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
I noticed it the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.

491
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,600
In case you didn't know.

492
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,280
Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.

493
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,640
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drummania V2 coming

494
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,400
out this week.

495
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Gonna cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into

496
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
their Guitar Freaks.

497
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,480
Darsakha, sound like something you might be getting?

498
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
Maybe, I don't know.

499
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freaks since I have Guitar Hero.

500
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Maybe.

501
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,200
Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation

502
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
2.

503
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
Let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?

504
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,500
Let's go to another system this week.

505
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:32,840
We have on the Nintendo DS, Minna no DS Karingu, and this is my favorite title of the week,

506
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,600
and I love the box art, too, as well.

507
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,160
It's like these two little, you know, kawaii girls there, making their little poses there.

508
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:47,160
The game is called Osare Majo Love and Berry, and it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo

509
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
DS.

510
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
It's a puzzle game.

511
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
It's a puzzle game.

512
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,120
Let's see, is that a game where you, you know, love somebody and then knock them off and

513
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
bury them in your backyard?

514
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,720
No, it's Berry, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.

515
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Berry what?

516
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
Like cherry or dingleberry?

517
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,840
I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.

518
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Is that the hentai game?

519
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Is it a hentai game?

520
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,120
There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising, like, a hentai dating sim

521
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,360
for the DS.

522
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,660
We have to feel up girls to see who's a- No, that's a different game.

523
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,360
It's from Sega, and it's class- Oh, it's not Sega, then.

524
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,280
It's classified as puzzle, so I don't- I'll say one thing, it sounds right.

525
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Touching is good.

526
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,960
The female body is a puzzle.

527
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,920
The female body is a puzzle, generally.

528
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,160
Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle, in a way, so that could be an appropriate

529
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,160
title.

530
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,160
I don't know.

531
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,000
Anyway, let's get back to the news.

532
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,120
Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.

533
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,760
There is a new demo- I'm excited already before you even mention

534
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,760
it.

535
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Rob.

536
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
What?

537
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Rob.

538
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
What?

539
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
Rob.

540
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
What?

541
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Rob.

542
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
What?

543
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Rob.

544
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
I will get- Rob.

545
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Rob.

546
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
Rob.

547
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I quit, I quit, I quit, I quit.

548
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
Rob.

549
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Rob.

550
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Can we keep this show moving, please?

551
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
What?

552
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Attention!

553
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
What?

554
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Quit dying of fire.

555
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
Okay.

556
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Anyway.

557
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,360
A game coming out, it's actually a demo on Xbox Live.

558
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:29,660
There is a 360 demo of Cars, 450 megawatts of data, so you can play as Lightning McQueen

559
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,440
through Radiator Springs.

560
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Ka-chow!

561
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
Ka-chow!

562
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
God dammit.

563
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,320
I must be a movie reference, I haven't seen a movie, so.

564
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,160
But anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland,

565
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.

566
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:54,200
I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.

567
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,600
By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.

568
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,260
I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.

569
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,440
But the good news is, next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.

570
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,420
Now I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.

571
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,000
Are you excited about Cars on the 360?

572
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,120
Give me a mic.

573
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,480
You know what, actually I kind of am.

574
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,040
For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.

575
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,520
Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.

576
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,400
So I'm actually excited for it, because Meg Z is the biggest Pixar nut.

577
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,940
I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without picking out every little speck.

578
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,880
So I'm just excited that it's coming out, so I can kind of, I don't know.

579
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,460
She's a big Pixar fan, and her passion makes me excited.

580
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,240
So I'm looking forward to it.

581
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
I mean, Cars, come on.

582
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.

583
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,080
Rob, we need to have a rainbow conversation.

584
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,040
SSG100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.

585
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:09,400
I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.

586
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,880
I can tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.

587
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,840
We beat people.

588
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,240
I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I

589
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,720
think we need to give Chris and Meg Z their own show where they just talk dirty to us.

590
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,880
We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast, kind of like Rance.

591
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,360
Jamie's going to be in on it.

592
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
Just call it Ask a Lesbian.

593
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,560
We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.

594
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,960
We've got to get back to games, games, games, games, games, games, games.

595
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Anyway, so with the whole launches of the big systems and stuff, you've got the PlayStation

596
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,360
3 and Wii bundling going on, and one of those stores actually doing that would be Fry's,

597
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,800
and apparently some of their bundles, they were actually creating eight-game bundles,

598
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,560
and basically bundles as large as, you know, $1,080, $1,080, that's funny.

599
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,680
But anyways, so, I don't know, what do you guys think of these bundles, you know, forcing

600
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,080
people to buy eight games?

601
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,440
On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens, they want to make sure that

602
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,680
people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.

603
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,440
However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit, because if I want to go in there and buy one

604
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,720
console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.

605
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,260
I'll tell you why they do that, because margins on consoles suck.

606
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,600
Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck, especially

607
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,780
the accessories.

608
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:46,360
Their games are officially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit

609
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
this quarter.

610
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,280
Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show, something

611
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,660
kind of last minute that came up.

612
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,240
Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE

613
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,640
because he preordered a Wii, and then they forced a bundle on him.

614
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle, he had to get like crap

615
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
games.

616
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:10,040
He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube, and I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube,

617
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:14,080
but I'm sure if you put in FYE and Wii, it'll come up there somewhere.

618
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,960
It's nothing but text telling his story.

619
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,120
It's kind of sarcastic, so that seems kind of low, to do that to pre-orders.

620
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,400
And something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.

621
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,960
Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the northwest somewhere where

622
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,320
they were trying to do something similar?

623
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,680
And it even opened up this investigation, and I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on trying

624
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,120
to think back that far, but I seem to recall that this bundling thing has been very much

625
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,760
frowned upon before, that you're kind of forcing consumers to buy these things together, so

626
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
huh?

627
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,320
Well, it's linked to the, apparently the YouTube link in our channel.

628
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,120
Oh, thank you, Bandit.

629
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,400
Rob White says, well, I don't shop much at FYE anyway.

630
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,520
Robert M. says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.

631
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,000
I know there should be, of course.

632
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,840
You know, I've got to say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.

633
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,520
I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot, and some of the third party, I mean,

634
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,000
yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise, SpongeBob type, well, I can't knock it till

635
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,480
I've played it, so whatever.

636
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,760
There's questionable content there at the launch.

637
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,040
Game 2 ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.

638
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,920
Yeah, but you know what, Cytruck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.

639
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,920
All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good, so I don't know.

640
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,240
Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch, all things considered, too.

641
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,240
With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out

642
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,880
that are just ports from last generation just kind of being enhanced a little bit, and you

643
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,200
know, you just got to notice them for what they are, and just don't buy them if you don't

644
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
want them.

645
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,520
Rob Way says, someday Nintendo will launch with Zelda and Mario.

646
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,960
That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?

647
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,280
Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.

648
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
I don't know.

649
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Who am I to know?

650
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Who am I to know?

651
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,280
I'm sorry?

652
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,400
I'm sorry?

653
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,520
They released Mario Bros. on the virtual platform.

654
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Boo!

655
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,520
Boo!

656
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Listen.

657
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

658
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
You shut your mouth.

659
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,520
I love original Mario Bros.

660
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Oh, bullshit, okay?

661
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,360
You put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.

662
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,280
To be fair, they've put it on every frickin' Advance title.

663
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,760
I am a little bit tired of it at this point, but I do love old school Mario Bros.

664
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
I mean, come on.

665
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
They're virtual.

666
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Pow, pow.

667
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
Soccer and pinball.

668
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,840
Yeah, I know, I know.

669
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,840
That's fine.

670
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Whatever.

671
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
The original Mario Bros., we've got to go in order.

672
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
That's fine.

673
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,440
Black Boy says, I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream

674
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
of games.

675
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,040
So, in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.

676
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,980
That certainly is fair, right?

677
00:30:53,980 --> 00:31:00,120
You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline and Mario in the pipeline and Super Smash

678
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,320
Bros., absolutely.

679
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,880
It's a good marketing decision because if you release all these franchises at once,

680
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,240
yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the

681
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
road?

682
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,640
You're going to have Diddly-O or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.

683
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,600
You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.

684
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
It's a good business decision by Nintendo.

685
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,360
Nintendo wants to have multiple pleasure, yes, multiples.

686
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
Tantric game releases.

687
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
Yes.

688
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Thank you.

689
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
That's a very good way to put it.

690
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Giggity, giggity, goo.

691
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,080
Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Launch Radio tonight in the chat room.

692
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Good for you, Black Boy.

693
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Pat, pat, pat.

694
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
You got a gold star.

695
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
All right.

696
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,080
Okay.

697
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
All right.

698
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
That was a good comment.

699
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,080
It was a good comment.

700
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
All right.

701
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,080
Let's see.

702
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,080
Oh, going to the other end of this.

703
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,560
We're going from bundles to the other extreme.

704
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,540
Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?

705
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
This is interesting.

706
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,280
There are some numbers coming from Media Create.

707
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:04,320
Multiple hardware sales, they sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan, 45,000 approximately

708
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,560
of those were the 60 gig models.

709
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:13,040
But get this, they sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch

710
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:21,240
title, all the way down to Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies.

711
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,440
Poor Sega.

712
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:31,800
When you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.

713
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,040
That's less than one game of consoles.

714
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,520
And there's no bundle like there is with the Wii.

715
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,960
If these figures came out for the Wii, you could go, well, at least there's Wii Sports.

716
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,880
We talked to some people last night, so Drew Nami is sitting in the back going, eBay, maybe.

717
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,600
Or do people just really want a cheap Blu-ray player?

718
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
I don't know.

719
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
What do you think?

720
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
Dark Soccer?

721
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,320
Cheap Blu-ray player.

722
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,000
I don't know.

723
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,320
That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player

724
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
in Japan.

725
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
It makes sense.

726
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,280
I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.

727
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,160
What does the average Japanese gamer like to play?

728
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
RPGs.

729
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,020
There were none released at launch.

730
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,360
That's why there were no games sold.

731
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,000
But racing games are also hugely popular over there.

732
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,080
So Ridge Racer 7 should have been a big, big title.

733
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,160
Well, Ridge Racer is kind of the sun setting on that franchise.

734
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,720
It's not that good of a franchise anymore.

735
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,120
Oh, then it's Fightin' Words, though.

736
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.

737
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,960
Yeah, that's about right.

738
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Really?

739
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
That was the last.

740
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,600
The Ridge Racer 4 bundle with the Jogcon, best bundle ever.

741
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,240
Since then, nothing's topped it.

742
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,620
Except for having the Negcon when you play Wipeout.

743
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,880
I like 6.

744
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,560
I didn't love it, but I liked it.

745
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,120
It's all about Ridge Racer DS.

746
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,880
It's a really good deal now for 20 bucks.

747
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,520
All about Ridge Racer DS.

748
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,880
All right.

749
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,440
Act Def says Ridge Racer 5 is good.

750
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,040
Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.

751
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,880
R4 was the top of it.

752
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
All right.

753
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,760
Well, we've got a lot of opinions here tonight, and certainly you have some of your own, and

754
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,480
you like to email those to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

755
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,840
And once a week, Dark Soccer likes to dive into Mailbag and pull out some of her favorite

756
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,880
emails to read to you here, live, on air, and it's called our Mailbag Segment.

757
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:31,200
Dark Soccer, take it away.

758
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,320
First email comes up.

759
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,000
These are sort of being read out of order that I received them, so I'm being random

760
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
today.

761
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Ooh.

762
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey, random.

763
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,680
First one comes from Robway.

764
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,400
I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.

765
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,000
Something bothers me in particular.

766
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,640
You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.

767
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,280
This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.

768
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,720
It more or less validates it, saying, we know you won't be able to get one, so buy your

769
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,080
games now and get the system off eBay.

770
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,560
This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the

771
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,580
things won't buy any games.

772
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:13,080
This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off at the same as a PS3 with no games.

773
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:21,960
I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.

774
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,040
Another one comes from AZHP, or AsHP, I guess I should say.

775
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Dear Dark Soccer...

776
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?

777
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,280
I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freakbook years ago.

778
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
I thought it was Asian hit points.

779
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
Oh, well, who cares?

780
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Sorry.

781
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Okay.

782
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
May I continue?

783
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,240
Yeah, so that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.

784
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,800
A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered

785
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,720
100 PS3s at 30 different stores.

786
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I didn't believe him at first and then he sent me this picture and I'll link it in the

787
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
chat room.

788
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,800
I've seen this.

789
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
I want to say I saw it over on YouN00B.com.

790
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,920
They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.

791
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,880
Listen, with all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000

792
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
in a day.

793
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,120
Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm

794
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,840
not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.

795
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
Brace yourself.

796
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
Dirty.

797
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Dirty.

798
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Dirty.

799
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Dirty.

800
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Freaking ridiculous.

801
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Oh, my God.

802
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,880
Why are you friends with such a lame-ass person, seriously?

803
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,780
I think it's a great idea.

804
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,920
You know what, though?

805
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,320
People are selling them on eBay.

806
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,680
You see an opportunity to make money, go for it.

807
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,000
If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.

808
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,700
That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like

809
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,700
that.

810
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,700
You know what?

811
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,120
The dumbasses are the ones that paid that kind of money for a PS3.

812
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,580
I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.

813
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,720
It's capitalism at work.

814
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,720
It's filthy.

815
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
It's disgusting.

816
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,780
Jamie, I think I have to agree.

817
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,940
If you've got the means to do it, that's what capitalism is.

818
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,760
It's playing off of people's stupidity.

819
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,380
It's fucking immoral.

820
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,320
Take this in a different direction.

821
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,080
Isn't this really risky?

822
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,100
I mean, because if the PlayStation 3s, the bottom fell out as they're saying is happening

823
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,340
on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going

824
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,940
to, this guy could stand to lose a poop-load of money.

825
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:28,680
I don't feel comfortable with the idea where I believe that stupid people who buy the systems

826
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,760
deserve what they get.

827
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,820
That was my next question, is how much is the buyer to blame in this scenario?

828
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,920
The buyer is very much to blame, however, I think being responsible for creating that

829
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:45,880
sort of situation is, I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.

830
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,980
I think it's really disgusting, you know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person

831
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,920
because they are greedy.

832
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,860
And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should

833
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,360
even be an option to begin with.

834
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,680
I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.

835
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,380
So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.

836
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
It's extortion, it is.

837
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,500
But if you're dumb enough to do it...

838
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,120
No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah,

839
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,880
if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked, however, the situation

840
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,680
should not exist to begin with.

841
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,720
Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't

842
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
sell it.

843
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,660
So either way, justice is done.

844
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,900
I got to read some interesting comments from Chat Room, of course, I got to read the smart

845
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,840
ass ones because this one made me laugh.

846
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:41,780
Alex of the OL Army says, with 100 PlayStation 3s you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia.

847
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:48,800
And Rob Way says, I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy

848
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,840
one PlayStation 3.

849
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,360
Rob Way says, I agree with extortion, it's very much like selling concert tickets over

850
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
cost.

851
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Scalping?

852
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
Interesting.

853
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
Yeah.

854
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,360
All right.

855
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,640
You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, this should, making that much money

856
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,120
off your eBay sale should count as taxable income.

857
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,520
I would agree with that, but how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?

858
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,600
I don't, then that gets weird.

859
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
I don't know.

860
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,760
It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.

861
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,380
I just think that it's a sad state that our, you know, that our world has basically been

862
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,380
reduced to this.

863
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,520
You know, what happened to making a fucking honest living seriously?

864
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,800
What happened, what happened to going out and

865
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,560
Okay, Chris, repeat your comment though, cause I have a follow up.

866
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,480
That died a while ago, making an honest living.

867
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
It's obsolete.

868
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,840
But do you, do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free

869
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
donuts?

870
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Why?

871
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,240
Wait, the making honest living is, that's what weirded people out?

872
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,360
Wait, I don't know how to say the questions, I was like, redo your question.

873
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,280
Cause you're saying it's a sad state of the world, you know, I'm just playing devil's

874
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
advocate here.

875
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,280
You're saying it's a, you know, it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people

876
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,080
buy into, so I'm thinking is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind

877
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,860
of like, they, they don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded

878
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,000
out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games

879
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
like them?

880
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Oh yeah.

881
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,400
I mean, it's, this is the, I mean, I'm, I'm a very idealistic person.

882
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,200
I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit, but at the

883
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,000
same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.

884
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,560
It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that, all of that stuff in it, you know, and I can

885
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,560
try and be a nice person.

886
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,160
I mean, I am a nice person.

887
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,320
I'm sorry to say though, but just accepting it blindly is what basically produces this

888
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
behavior.

889
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,200
You know, just, just to give another, another perspective on this though, and then we'll

890
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
keep it moving.

891
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
What about eBay?

892
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,400
Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?

893
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,840
Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?

894
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
Oh no, I fully...

895
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,200
eBay makes the share of all these, they could end this if they wanted to.

896
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,480
Oh no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this too.

897
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,020
I just think that it's a dirty situation.

898
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,820
The money is not, they're basically taking Sony's work and making a profit off of something

899
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,680
they had no involvement in.

900
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,000
They're basically, they're stealing somebody else's work.

901
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,680
Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

902
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
If you want to comment.

903
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Oh, Drew, last word.

904
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,480
It is a free market though, if they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.

905
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,960
If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much

906
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,960
money.

907
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,960
Alright.

908
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,520
And one thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?

909
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,880
We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time we should

910
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,880
probably keep it moving.

911
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,720
Do we agree though that it is unethical?

912
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,840
I don't want to say it's unethical, I think the problem is everybody's on a different

913
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
page.

914
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,040
I think so, we just have to agree to disagree.

915
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,200
I don't know, but my personal feeling is I feel like to me, and this is me personally,

916
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm not going to judge you or whatever, you're going to do whatever you're going to do, but

917
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,240
my thing is I feel like it's the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's

918
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
stolen.

919
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,480
I don't know, to me that's...

920
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,600
I've said this before, if Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what

921
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,400
he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.

922
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,600
But that's you guys, that's between you and him, so.

923
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,720
Alright, we've got to keep it moving folks.

924
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
We have more emails?

925
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:46,640
Okay, we have, I'm only going to read a few more of them because we actually did get quite

926
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,460
a number of them in.

927
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:57,480
One of them is from AJ Twist, speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of

928
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
this email.

929
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,640
I work at KB Toys, I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month,

930
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,360
but they're having a big video game sale.

931
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,960
All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and

932
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
DS titles.

933
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Cool, huh?

934
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,440
Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.

935
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,440
She told me no.

936
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,360
KB is trying to get away from selling video games.

937
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
I wonder why.

938
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,140
Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games cause people to break

939
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,140
into stores.

940
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,720
They are the most stolen item in a robbery, so now KB is trying to get rid of these games,

941
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,880
but they are keeping the Nintendo handhelds because they sell better to younger kids.

942
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,120
So there's an answer to all those people out there who are wondering about KB's lack of

943
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:44,200
good and new games, and new gen systems, but maybe there's a bigger explanation behind

944
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
it.

945
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,320
Yeah, I'll keep it simple, KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.

946
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:55,120
It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games, and I didn't

947
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,640
really think about it until I heard this email.

948
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,240
I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.

949
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,600
Yeah, it's like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB to

950
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
steal games from them.

951
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
There are KB's that are outside malls.

952
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,600
There was one.

953
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,160
There's plenty of strip malls.

954
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,200
Whatever, it's KB.

955
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,800
Last time, every time I walked past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.

956
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,840
I mean, seriously, it's like, you know, we've lost our lease sale, you know, all toys must

957
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
go.

958
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
That's what it always looks like.

959
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:28,920
Rob Roy says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.

960
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,320
It's all about the inflatable pools.

961
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,120
Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop

962
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,500
where there was a Wii.

963
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:40,920
I was so excited to see it.

964
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,920
It is small.

965
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,520
I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a

966
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,180
month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with a Nintendo's

967
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,360
Wii was there.

968
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:56,720
No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.

969
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,440
Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it, I've always wanted the first but never had time or money

970
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,440
to buy it.

971
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,760
I actually chose BeatMania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.

972
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,520
Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.

973
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,040
Freeze Pops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.

974
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,160
Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.

975
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,400
I've played it once and loved it more than the first.

976
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,720
I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.

977
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,340
I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking

978
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,080
better makes me a happy bunny.

979
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,080
I guess that's all for now.

980
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:37,160
Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.

981
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,080
Also to state, I am going to be posting My Little Pony Killer's letter in our forums

982
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:48,240
momentarily as my letter of the week, so as long as it will not be read, it will be on

983
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
our forums.

984
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,840
Make sure you go there and read it.

985
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:59,040
But our other really good email I got from Grin without a Cat is if we're all ready to

986
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
listen.

987
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,040
Uh-huh, I'm listening.

988
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
Okay.

989
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
John's making nasty motions at me.

990
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,120
Hey guys, I thought I'd let you know my thoughts on Gears of War, someone who's not into shooters

991
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
in a big way.

992
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,120
I did speak briefly with Sky about it on live, as I know it's a great game for fans of the

993
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,160
genre, but with the 10 out of 10 scores it's been getting, I was wondering if it was something

994
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
everyone should try.

995
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,040
I'm certainly not disappointed with the game.

996
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,920
It plays good, it looks good, it sounds good, but I don't think it's quite as good as a

997
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,360
lot of reviews have made out.

998
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,960
I can't see it becoming a milestone in gaming in the same way titles such as Mario 64, Ocarina

999
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,240
of Time, GTA 3, or Halo were.

1000
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,860
It's still just a shooter, and there's not a whole lot of variety in what you'll be doing.

1001
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:47,460
The story was a bit, well, non-existent, which I found surprising, as I had heard, they had

1002
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:50,980
the guy who wrote the Halo novels to do it.

1003
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,620
I've not read those books, but I heard they were quite good, so assumed having an actual

1004
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,140
author to do the story might make it pretty decent, but there's just nothing there besides

1005
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,600
a little blurb in the manual.

1006
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,400
It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially

1007
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,440
the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide and seek than a shooter.

1008
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,160
In my first game, I was relieved my teammate, I was revived my teammate only to hear him

1009
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,560
tell behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle

1010
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,440
by a chainsaw.

1011
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,000
I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters,

1012
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,820
but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.

1013
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,560
Keep up the good work, Gryn, without a cat.

1014
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,000
I actually agree with the email that Gears of War, I think, is one of those games I think

1015
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,720
you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the

1016
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,160
shooter genre.

1017
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,080
Be very careful about all this hype behind the game, because it's not for everybody.

1018
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,080
Is it a good game?

1019
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,080
Yes.

1020
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,080
But is it for everybody?

1021
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,080
No.

1022
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,080
So try before you buy if you're curious.

1023
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:57,520
And a fair warning, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10, it's ultimately

1024
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,060
up to you if you're going to like the game or not, so definitely play a demo.

1025
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:03,600
Don't ever let the hype sell the game.

1026
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,760
I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.

1027
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,500
Don't let the hype sell you a game, because it's not always going to be rewarding.

1028
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,040
Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.

1029
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,760
MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.

1030
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,360
No demo on live.

1031
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:25,360
So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other

1032
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,000
big Xbox 360 games.

1033
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,440
Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet, anyway.

1034
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Yeah.

1035
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
All righty.

1036
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,200
Any more emails for this week?

1037
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
That's it.

1038
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,560
And I've just posted up My Little Pony Killer's email in our forum.

1039
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Sweet.

1040
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,680
If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundrader.com is the place to deliver

1041
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,520
those lovely little messages.

1042
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,520
Excellent.

1043
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,620
Well, moving on, talking about the 360.

1044
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,720
There's been one cool mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a

1045
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,600
VGA AV out on it.

1046
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,240
And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the

1047
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:13,720
Xbox 360, as far as AV stuff goes, actually have all the pins for pretty much every video

1048
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,600
format you'd possibly want.

1049
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:24,080
So simply re-soldering some of the connectors to a VGA jack caused it to work.

1050
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,320
So it's pretty simple.

1051
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:32,800
There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it, and it'll save

1052
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,840
you some money that way.

1053
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,240
So that's pretty cool.

1054
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,240
All right.

1055
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,960
Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about controversial methods of

1056
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,280
making extra money, but I think we can all agree this is a good thing.

1057
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,700
The Entertainment Software Association, also known as the ESA, announced the proceeds from

1058
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,480
their 2005 charity game pack.

1059
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,960
It was a game pack that consisted of three games, Sony's ATV Off-Road Fury 2, Splashdown

1060
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,480
Ride's Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.

1061
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,480
They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.

1062
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,360
They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.

1063
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,080
Good job, ESA.

1064
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:31,960
Good indeed, and also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda

1065
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:40,760
artwork being sold from the old CDI games.

1066
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:48,520
On the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devon, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction

1067
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,200
with the original art that inspired these titles.

1068
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:01,120
The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but had signed artwork, a letter from

1069
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,700
the artist, a half a dozen CDI games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that

1070
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,020
featured the Zelda titles.

1071
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:16,280
The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.

1072
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:22,480
Even though the mention of the Zelda CDI games made us verp a little bit, I think for the

1073
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,200
Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so it definitely is something I'd want if

1074
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,200
I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, crazed

1075
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,920
Link fans.

1076
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,640
Thank you.

1077
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:47,240
We actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose, and it's

1078
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,240
an interesting game.

1079
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:55,320
It had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the, you know, young

1080
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:02,280
girl on girl action going on there, but anyways, apparently, Rome's mayor is demanding a band

1081
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:11,800
of Rule of Rose, apparently finds that the erotic themes are too strong, and that there's

1082
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,320
no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says,

1083
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,320
so I don't know.

1084
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,440
I own that game?

1085
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,200
I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.

1086
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,200
I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy

1087
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
vibe of it.

1088
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,320
Was there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?

1089
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,040
Yeah, it was very subtle, it wasn't like, you know, all of a sudden they just start

1090
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,600
making out and like, getting it on, I mean, that's a little much, so.

1091
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:46,720
You know when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like,

1092
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,120
you know when little kids are like, doing stuff that they don't quite understand what

1093
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:56,480
they're doing, they just, that's kind of the vibe I got, and it's not like they're, I mean,

1094
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,760
it's really, really subtle, I mean, unless you're looking for it.

1095
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,920
The only way this, you know, the only way this is ever going to get bandaged at least.

1096
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,560
What it boils down to is that they're all gay.

1097
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,560
Yeah.

1098
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,560
I'm kidding.

1099
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,560
You know what I mean?

1100
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,560
The fat chick.

1101
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,560
The fat chick was awesome.

1102
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:13,560
Listen, the Pope, he no like either the Rule of Rose, okay, so.

1103
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,600
He's not the mayor of Rome.

1104
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,560
I don't care, he doesn't like Rule of Rose.

1105
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:22,320
It doesn't matter if he's the mayor of, thank you, Captain Obvious over there in the corner.

1106
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,160
The Pope's not the mayor of Rome?

1107
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,160
No crap.

1108
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,160
No, but he is the god of Rome.

1109
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:36,200
Moving on to a completely different topic, maybe this is something you could drive around

1110
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:41,760
Rome or any other city for that matter, Nintendo recently filed, well, at least back in August,

1111
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,440
they filed an in-car gaming system.

1112
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,760
It's called a car area network, and what it supposedly does, it beams game information

1113
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,640
from the server to the game console.

1114
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,760
The wireless network could be between your game server in the trunk and the game console

1115
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,760
in the back seat.

1116
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,920
It could also possibly download new games and do all those wireless updates like that

1117
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,880
whole Wii Connect 24 thing.

1118
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,860
The controller looks very similar to what we know as the virtual console classic controller.

1119
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,880
Very interesting kind of thing to be marketing.

1120
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,140
I hope they just don't promote driving or playing Wii or any of these type of games

1121
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:18,760
while you're in the front seat of your car, because that's not good.

1122
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,320
So it sounds like Skymall in your car.

1123
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,700
Possibly, because they could probably do this on a plane too.

1124
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,700
It would be easy.

1125
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,840
I mean, if they patented it for the car, it would be easy to do it on the plane.

1126
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:34,400
If there's anything wireless involved on the plane, then they really can't do it.

1127
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,280
It does interfere with the controls.

1128
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,320
I was trying to think how they do the satellite TV, maybe they did some type of satellite

1129
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,000
thing, because some of the airlines have satellites.

1130
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,920
You don't even have car satellite systems.

1131
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,840
They got to do something too, because remember the...

1132
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
How about drive?

1133
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,740
Well, what if I have Bratz in the back seat?

1134
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:52,740
Read a book?

1135
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,740
Set it is.

1136
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,800
I don't know what the DS is for.

1137
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:56,800
Two DSs.

1138
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,080
12 gauge, I don't know.

1139
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,080
Or ferret.

1140
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,080
Sedatives.

1141
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,080
Ferret justice.

1142
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,080
Ferret.

1143
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,080
I don't...

1144
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,080
No, no, no.

1145
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,300
I don't hate children that much.

1146
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,480
I just don't want any.

1147
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
She loves them.

1148
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,560
She wants to squeeze them until they choke.

1149
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,400
And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't

1150
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,240
be breeding shouldn't breed.

1151
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,100
I am not in a position to take care of one right now, and those people shouldn't have

1152
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,100
one either.

1153
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,100
So there.

1154
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,100
I don't want to buy my morals.

1155
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,100
You practice what you preach.

1156
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,100
I do.

1157
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,100
Good for you.

1158
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,100
God damn it, I do.

1159
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,100
Do you want a cookie?

1160
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,100
No, I want another donut.

1161
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,480
I think we have donuts.

1162
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
No.

1163
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,480
I want a powdered donut.

1164
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:44,920
Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, um, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday

1165
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,400
just like everybody else.

1166
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,380
They had less than we got.

1167
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:55,160
They got 500 total for the entire country.

1168
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,960
I can top that.

1169
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Hong Kong got 200.

1170
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,080
Really?

1171
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:07,360
So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries' worth of PS3s because

1172
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,360
they got 750.

1173
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,480
Well, did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?

1174
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
It doesn't say.

1175
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,720
Oh, that's too bad.

1176
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,720
Did they have people pushing each other into flag poles like they did here?

1177
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,880
Uh, no, they just probably strung them up from the light post.

1178
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,320
I got a question.

1179
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?

1180
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,320
I don't know.

1181
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,320
A lot.

1182
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,840
It had to have been the comparable amount.

1183
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,600
Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.

1184
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:40,640
They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China

1185
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,760
are not that rich.

1186
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,840
I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of

1187
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:57,840
stupid to give them a system that is overpriced, so maybe that's why they got so little.

1188
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,600
I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.

1189
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:05,880
I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order, god damn it!

1190
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Anyways, wow.

1191
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,600
So as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for

1192
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,600
the Wii.

1193
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,600
And that is the case.

1194
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,280
The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.

1195
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,280
Quiet, you!

1196
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,440
Listen, I hear you sighing over there.

1197
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,280
This is an accurate gripe, okay?

1198
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:29,740
So they are not coming out until December 5th and probably later than that, and also

1199
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:34,120
the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.

1200
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,920
So you know what, to be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming

1201
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,240
out either, but you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.

1202
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:46,440
So I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight,

1203
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,960
because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get

1204
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
component cables.

1205
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,300
I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.

1206
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,280
You said it yourself on the show.

1207
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,760
Loki, they're not coming out today.

1208
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,720
You had to order them on Nintendo.com.

1209
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,800
Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.

1210
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,760
Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii, saying, I can't wait

1211
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,760
until I get one of these?

1212
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,840
I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me

1213
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:22,240
for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.

1214
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,280
We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.

1215
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,080
My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote

1216
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:37,440
detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's

1217
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,520
dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.

1218
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:47,520
All right, anyway, Take-Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.

1219
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,720
This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like

1220
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,720
myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that

1221
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,280
20 are coming from Rockstar.

1222
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,920
Of course, Take-Two makes some of those games.

1223
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,400
Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles, already has a date, October

1224
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:18,640
16, 2007 in North America, and then, of course, 2K Sports has given NBA 2K7 and NHL 2K7, various

1225
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:25,800
things across 2K, so good job, Take-Two, on keeping the games coming for the PS3 fans.

1226
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,200
We salute you.

1227
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Absolutely.

1228
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,920
Where are the games for the Wii?

1229
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,520
There's already a ton of them on shelves, but we know there's more under development.

1230
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,400
Yeah, but 2K doesn't make any of those.

1231
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,880
Well, then, shame, shame.

1232
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,960
If you're a 2K fan, maybe the Wii's not for you.

1233
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:51,760
Well, continuing on, there actually is a leak out there stating that Gears of War may be

1234
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,200
coming out on the PC.

1235
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,360
PC Gamer inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows.

1236
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,080
It's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue.

1237
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,280
A display stand photographed on a Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming

1238
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,840
PC games.

1239
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:15,400
Microsoft would not confirm, but they said they didn't really have any current plans

1240
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
on that.

1241
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:23,360
However, it was around disgusting Windows Vista and the new things supported, so it

1242
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,320
could happen.

1243
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:32,280
It should be also noted that I think that was the first issue of their name change,

1244
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,280
right?

1245
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,280
Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?

1246
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Am I mixing up magazines?

1247
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,280
I don't know.

1248
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Is it?

1249
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,280
No?

1250
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
Okay.

1251
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Interesting.

1252
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,480
Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.

1253
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,720
You think it's for real?

1254
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,400
Think it would sell pretty good on PC?

1255
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,400
No.

1256
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,400
No?

1257
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,400
Why not?

1258
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,160
Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.

1259
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:57,980
Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based thing.

1260
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:00,780
There's one PC game that's selling right now.

1261
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,800
It's called World of Warcraft.

1262
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,800
Civ IV?

1263
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:08,200
Black Boy says, by the way, it's Computer Gaming World that is now Games for Windows,

1264
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,200
not PC Gamer.

1265
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh, my bad.

1266
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,200
Sorry.

1267
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,680
I'm going to be, I'll just be honest, I'm not a huge PC gamer.

1268
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:21,520
I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.

1269
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,240
I like Mac games.

1270
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,120
I'm playing one right now.

1271
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:29,680
Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.

1272
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,120
Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.

1273
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,120
I need it.

1274
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,120
No.

1275
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,120
I'm just teasing, of course.

1276
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,120
I'm just teasing.

1277
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,120
All right.

1278
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:43,400
Let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.

1279
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,040
Somebody said, ooh?

1280
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,920
I said, ooh, because I'm going to call in.

1281
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:48,920
I'm going to call in right now.

1282
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,920
No, you're not going to call.

1283
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,920
I'm not picking up your call.

1284
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:51,920
All right.

1285
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,920
Yeah, you can call in right now.

1286
01:01:52,920 --> 01:02:01,000
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, so we're

1287
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,840
going to head on over to the telephone and take some calls.

1288
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
Hi.

1289
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1290
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Who's this?

1291
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
This is Meg Z.

1292
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
Hi, Meg Z.

1293
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Hi, baby.

1294
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
Hey.

1295
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,960
You got through.

1296
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,920
What's on your mind, my friend?

1297
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,400
Wii.

1298
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,760
Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?

1299
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,920
I have been playing with my Wii all day long.

1300
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,920
Yes.

1301
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,920
Have you been stroking it?

1302
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,920
Yeah.

1303
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,680
What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?

1304
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,400
I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing

1305
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,600
Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.

1306
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,240
What do you think?

1307
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,320
Wii Sports is fun.

1308
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,320
It's cute.

1309
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,960
It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or

1310
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,880
hit the putter or whatever.

1311
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,520
I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.

1312
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,920
Do you have friends that you're having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?

1313
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,280
I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.

1314
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,280
I see.

1315
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:11,160
So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports, and there's not a lot of people around.

1316
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,160
Yeah, pretty much.

1317
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,440
Well, you need to have a Wii orgy, my friend.

1318
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,440
I know, right?

1319
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,440
Hey, Chris.

1320
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,440
Yeah?

1321
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,440
Want to come over?

1322
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,440
Oh, yeah.

1323
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,440
Right now.

1324
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,720
I think you guys need to take this conversation off the line, because I know a lot of folks

1325
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,560
getting pretty hot about this.

1326
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,960
What do you think about PlayStation 3, Megzi?

1327
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,840
That didn't sound too promising.

1328
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,320
What's wrong with the PS3?

1329
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,680
Why no love for the PS3?

1330
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,680
Just too expensive?

1331
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,680
Too expensive.

1332
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,360
Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come

1333
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,720
out for it are out right now.

1334
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,600
You know how I feel about Sony in general, so meh.

1335
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Hey, Megzi.

1336
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,600
Megzi.

1337
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,760
What is your favorite color?

1338
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,760
Lime green.

1339
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:56,760
Yes.

1340
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:57,760
Wait.

1341
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,760
Wait.

1342
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,480
It's no good if you answer the question for her.

1343
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,480
That's cheating.

1344
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,480
No.

1345
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,480
That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know.

1346
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,880
Your favorite color is green.

1347
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,120
This is the capital of California.

1348
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,120
Sacramento.

1349
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,120
Answer.

1350
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,120
I don't get it.

1351
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,120
All right.

1352
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,120
Sorry.

1353
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,120
All right.

1354
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,120
I know her favorite color.

1355
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,600
Megzi, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?

1356
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,120
Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.

1357
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,240
Ah, Smash Brothers Brawl.

1358
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:27,120
Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?

1359
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:34,840
You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.

1360
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,360
Hell yes.

1361
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:39,340
He would make such a great Super Smash Brothers character.

1362
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:44,120
You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the Virtual Console, so you never know.

1363
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,120
We get tired.

1364
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
I heard that.

1365
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,120
I was so excited.

1366
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
I'll be very hot.

1367
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120
Yeah.

1368
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,120
She told me all about it.

1369
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Very hot.

1370
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
All right.

1371
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,440
Who are our listeners today?

1372
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,440
Hey, Chris.

1373
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,440
Chris.

1374
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,440
Chris.

1375
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,440
What?

1376
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,240
We totally owned those army guys down the hall.

1377
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,760
Yes, we did.

1378
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,760
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

1379
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
I don't know.

1380
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:05,760
I'll tell you later.

1381
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,760
All right.

1382
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Tell me later.

1383
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:08,760
Megzi.

1384
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
Jamie says hi.

1385
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,760
Amy.

1386
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
I've got a microphone.

1387
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,760
She heard me.

1388
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,760
Oh, yeah, huh?

1389
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,760
Megzi.

1390
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,760
Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?

1391
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,760
We have our...

1392
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,760
We have a Wii-some.

1393
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,760
This show is growing a vagina.

1394
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,760
I want to be part of the Wii-some.

1395
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
Rob, you are a vagina.

1396
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,760
All right.

1397
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,760
No, no, no.

1398
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,040
We have like the weird-looking horn-shaped Wii-some.

1399
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,200
I have no idea what that is.

1400
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,200
All right.

1401
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,200
Just look at the map.

1402
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,200
Megzi, thanks for calling.

1403
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Come back to California, you hear?

1404
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,200
Oh, yeah.

1405
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,200
All right.

1406
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
Later, babe.

1407
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Bye, baby.

1408
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Bye.

1409
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Bye.

1410
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
All right.

1411
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
Let's go to another phone call.

1412
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
We'll go to this call right here.

1413
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Hi.

1414
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1415
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Who's this?

1416
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
This is Riella.

1417
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,720
I'm in the chat room right now.

1418
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,720
Hi, Riella.

1419
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,360
What's on your mind, buddy?

1420
01:05:55,360 --> 01:06:00,920
I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting with all the Wii

1421
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,320
stuff going on tonight.

1422
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:03,320
Okay.

1423
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,320
What's up?

1424
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:07,520
I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.

1425
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,520
Okay.

1426
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,000
I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.

1427
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yes!

1428
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Wow.

1429
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,000
How did that happen?

1430
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,280
When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.

1431
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:22,200
I was doing some kind of math homework, and I was listening to Radio Disney because I

1432
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,440
used to have horrible taste in music, and so they were saying, �Hey, you�

1433
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,440
Oh, be careful.

1434
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,920
Chris still listens to Radio Disney, and you're offending her.

1435
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,920
Be careful.

1436
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:30,920
Wait, wait.

1437
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:31,920
Hold on.

1438
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,920
I'm sorry.

1439
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,920
I'm so sorry, Riella.

1440
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Come on, Chris.

1441
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
Oh, sorry.

1442
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Okay.

1443
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,960
Now this show is just turning into a preschool.

1444
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,960
Sorry, Riella.

1445
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:44,960
Finish your story.

1446
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,960
Don't worry about it.

1447
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:50,560
But anyways, they had this thing called the codeword of the day, where if you remembered

1448
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,880
it and you were the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the codeword, you would win something.

1449
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:01,100
And so in November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they

1450
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,400
were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.

1451
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,360
So I called in, and I was the seventh caller, and I got a GameCube.

1452
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,360
Well, go you.

1453
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,400
So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?

1454
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
Does this just bring back memories?

1455
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,440
It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away, and it was

1456
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,440
Nintendo-related.

1457
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:20,640
Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight.

1458
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,640
Yeah.

1459
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,640
Did you enter the contest?

1460
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,640
Yeah, I did.

1461
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,400
Are you bitter that you didn't win?

1462
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,720
I am very bitter.

1463
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,160
Well, get over it.

1464
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,360
I don't know what else to tell you.

1465
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,560
I'm just messing with you.

1466
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,600
You can try next time.

1467
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,240
There might be something even better next time.

1468
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,240
Who knows?

1469
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,240
You can win a date with Rob.

1470
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,600
Dude, okay, dude, hold on.

1471
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:43,600
Not cool.

1472
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,720
If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.

1473
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,720
When you're 18.

1474
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,720
Okay.

1475
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,720
15.

1476
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,720
Okay, wait three years.

1477
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:53,720
We'll have the...

1478
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:54,720
Anyway.

1479
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
We'll wait for you.

1480
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,720
Anyway.

1481
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,200
Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?

1482
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:06,480
Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going

1483
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,480
to sell my PSP.

1484
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,040
You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?

1485
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,040
Yes.

1486
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Huh.

1487
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,040
What goods do you have with your PSP?

1488
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,000
I have nothing for my PSP.

1489
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,760
It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.

1490
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,760
You know what?

1491
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,160
How much are you selling it for?

1492
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,160
I don't know.

1493
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,480
However much GameStop takes it for.

1494
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,480
Hey, hey, hey.

1495
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,800
You know what?

1496
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Talk to me online.

1497
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:33,800
Like, when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.

1498
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,480
I know you have two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.

1499
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,440
Rob might have sold me on the PSP at Luminous, too, so we'll talk.

1500
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,560
Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.

1501
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,600
Oh, look at this.

1502
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,720
Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.

1503
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,040
This might be good news for you, Ryoma.

1504
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
I'll sign you down!

1505
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,040
Yes!

1506
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:52,040
All right.

1507
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,760
Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.

1508
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:54,760
All right.

1509
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,760
All right.

1510
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:56,760
All right, have a good one, Ryoma.

1511
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,760
Thanks for what you're calling.

1512
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:58,760
You, too.

1513
01:08:58,760 --> 01:08:59,760
All right, later.

1514
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:00,760
All right, have a good one.

1515
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,640
Hitstunna says, don't sell things to GameStop.

1516
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:03,920
Loki says...

1517
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,640
You will get kind of jacked.

1518
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,640
$1.30 for...

1519
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:13,800
I had a brand new PSP, and I was just curious, because I got one from a work promotion thing

1520
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,920
or something, and I was like, okay, well, let me see how much they're going to take

1521
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
it for.

1522
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,160
I think they said like $1.13 or something.

1523
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,840
They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.

1524
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,840
Ouch.

1525
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,500
Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll

1526
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,500
take it.

1527
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,500
We got another call.

1528
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1529
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,500
Who is this?

1530
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,500
It's Rama.

1531
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,500
What's up, guys?

1532
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Hey, girls.

1533
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,500
Hey, Rama.

1534
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,500
How you doing?

1535
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,500
Hey, everyone.

1536
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,640
I saw your picture on Joystick today.

1537
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,000
Sweet.

1538
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,360
You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?

1539
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,360
Yep.

1540
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:44,360
Yeah.

1541
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
You know what the caption said on Joystick?

1542
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,360
Did you see it?

1543
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,360
No, I missed it.

1544
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
Oh, you'll love this.

1545
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,840
It said, here's a Super Mario brother.

1546
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,280
Do you know what the funny thing is?

1547
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,360
Someone's like, hey, Luigi's not black.

1548
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,600
I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian.

1549
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:58,600
Hey.

1550
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,320
I'm Luigi, motherfucker.

1551
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,320
You know what?

1552
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,440
You're just having fun with it.

1553
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,120
Who cares if you're not, oh, my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.

1554
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,360
You can't dress up as Barrett your entire life.

1555
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:16,040
I mean, it's not your fault that you're underrepresented in video games.

1556
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,200
90% of the roster in NBA Live.

1557
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,200
Shut up, John.

1558
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,840
I'll just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.

1559
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,840
There you go.

1560
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,840
There you go.

1561
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,840
Cosplay for the win.

1562
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,840
What?

1563
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,840
Cosplay for the win.

1564
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
All right.

1565
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,840
So what happened?

1566
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,840
You were at the NYC.

1567
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,840
Now, what happened?

1568
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,040
Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped

1569
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,600
out at a Nintendo World store.

1570
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,220
What happened?

1571
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,760
The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find

1572
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,400
some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures,

1573
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:46,400
you know?

1574
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,920
People are like, Luigi, let me get your picture, let me get your picture.

1575
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,680
And people are shouting, where's Mario?

1576
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:56,120
And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.

1577
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,000
Wow.

1578
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,080
Mario was getting his link on.

1579
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,680
So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?

1580
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,800
No, and I'm really pissed off about that.

1581
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,680
Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping

1582
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,800
the damn line at Nintendo World.

1583
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Ouch.

1584
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
They wanted it so badly.

1585
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,960
I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.

1586
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,920
I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time playing the Wii.

1587
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,220
Were you originally planning on getting a Wii?

1588
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,220
Not really.

1589
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,220
Oh, okay.

1590
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,160
Because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come

1591
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,720
down, and I'm like, okay, sure.

1592
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,760
So you were just going along for, like, moral support?

1593
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,760
Yes.

1594
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,760
All right, well, that's cool.

1595
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:36,760
Did you meet Reggie?

1596
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,760
Did you meet my boss?

1597
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,560
No, I did not.

1598
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,760
I saw this hair.

1599
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
He saw the hair?

1600
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:44,760
There he is.

1601
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,760
All right.

1602
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,760
What?

1603
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:47,760
Oh, do we see a picture of him?

1604
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,760
Oh, that's great.

1605
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:49,760
Somebody posted it in the chat there.

1606
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:50,760
What are you doing with that poor woman?

1607
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,760
I'm sorry.

1608
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:52,760
Oh, there it is.

1609
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,760
It says, folks love this Super Mario brother.

1610
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,080
Because you're a brother.

1611
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,080
Get it?

1612
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,080
Ha, ha, ha.

1613
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,080
All right.

1614
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,080
Yeah, I know.

1615
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,080
It's a great costume.

1616
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,880
You know, when we made Dark Soccer, Loki and I had little hats, very similar to the one

1617
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:04,880
he has on in that picture.

1618
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,240
Or at least, well, you didn't make them, but you had them made by one of your friends or

1619
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,240
something, right?

1620
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,240
Yes.

1621
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,240
Who made those?

1622
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,240
My friend Carrie Wink.

1623
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:16,600
She has a, she runs Wearable Wink, and she does all types of custom hats and cosplay

1624
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:17,600
commissions.

1625
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,840
Well, good job to you, Miss Wink.

1626
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
I applaud you.

1627
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,560
Hey, email me your information, I might have a commission for her.

1628
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,560
God, I will.

1629
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,560
Oh, Rob, you're going to be mad with me.

1630
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:26,560
Why?

1631
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,560
I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.

1632
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,360
Shut up on them, traitor.

1633
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,360
No.

1634
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,360
They asked for me.

1635
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,640
I'm like, okay, sure.

1636
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,240
I didn't know until after the fact.

1637
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,080
Were you, did you pimp our show?

1638
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,600
Did you have a button on?

1639
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,600
No.

1640
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:41,600
I had nothing.

1641
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
I was caught on right there.

1642
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,600
No, no, no.

1643
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,600
Don't, don't.

1644
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,600
No.

1645
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,600
Rama, it's fine.

1646
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,600
Do we really want that crowd?

1647
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,600
I mean, people that are still watching G4.

1648
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,600
Exactly.

1649
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,600
Do you really want them listening?

1650
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?

1651
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,600
No.

1652
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,280
So, Rama, enjoy your 15 minutes.

1653
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,280
I always do.

1654
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,280
Tick tock, tick tock.

1655
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Clock's ticking.

1656
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,720
But here's the thing, though.

1657
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:02,960
I wake up getting ready to, you know, line up to get the wheeze.

1658
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:03,960
I turn around.

1659
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,800
There's like a hundred people that jump on because they have everybody lining up up against

1660
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,800
the street.

1661
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,800
Didn't they have cops?

1662
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
Didn't they have the NYPD out there?

1663
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:12,800
Yeah.

1664
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,800
But cops didn't do nothing.

1665
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
I mean.

1666
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,800
They should have had the LAPD.

1667
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,600
They would have taught him a lesson.

1668
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,840
And then one of the guys on the line starts screaming, what the hell are you doing?

1669
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,960
I turn around.

1670
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,040
The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.

1671
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,640
And I'm like, what the hell, dude?

1672
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,440
He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.

1673
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,200
And I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.

1674
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,600
Nobody was changing.

1675
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,940
I want to say I saw some video on, like, Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they

1676
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:43,760
were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of

1677
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,760
us.

1678
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,760
It was crazy.

1679
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
That's exactly what happened.

1680
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,760
Rama, I got to end this call.

1681
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,280
Any other final thoughts for us?

1682
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:51,280
Fuck you, Sony.

1683
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,280
All right.

1684
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,280
Have a good one, Rama.

1685
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,280
All right.

1686
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,280
Don't hold back.

1687
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,920
We have very, very angry people against Sony here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1688
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,920
Well, let's see.

1689
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,920
Maybe our next caller might have some good things to say about Sony.

1690
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:02,920
Who knows?

1691
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1692
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,920
Who's this?

1693
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:06,960
Like, I'd have good things to say about Sony.

1694
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:07,960
Who is this?

1695
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,960
This is Miklotov.

1696
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,680
Oh, Miklotov, our old buddy.

1697
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,080
I still have your wee Miklotov.

1698
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,080
Mr. Miklotov.

1699
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,680
You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN.

1700
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:22,400
Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had

1701
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,400
to oblige him.

1702
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,160
I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.

1703
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:30,800
I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.

1704
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,280
Can you tell us his name on air?

1705
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,280
No, I'm not going to, sorry.

1706
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,040
But we all know now, see, if you work with Miklotov, you know that he has a crush on

1707
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,040
one of his co-workers.

1708
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,520
No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.

1709
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
What's on your mind?

1710
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:48,480
I just wanted to say how amazing the wee is and how much I'm big in Zelda.

1711
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,800
You are loving the wee in Zelda?

1712
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,960
What's so great about Zelda in your mind?

1713
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:00,160
I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you

1714
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:06,160
go into the Twilight World for the first time, and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.

1715
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:07,640
Even without component cables?

1716
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,000
Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.

1717
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,720
I will be picking them up once they come in, but yeah, I can make do with this for another

1718
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:18,720
month.

1719
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:19,840
It's still beautiful.

1720
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,400
What else did you pick up besides Zelda?

1721
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,400
Anything?

1722
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:29,960
Oh, I got some wee points, and I picked up Solomon's Key, is that what it was?

1723
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,520
Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.

1724
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,480
Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.

1725
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,000
I forgot how awesome that was.

1726
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,660
It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up

1727
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,660
very soon, hopefully.

1728
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:39,660
You know what?

1729
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,240
As soon as I get a wee classic controller, I will be picking up SimCity, because that's

1730
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,620
actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.

1731
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:47,620
Very cool.

1732
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,720
We'll lend you a GameCube controller.

1733
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,640
Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.

1734
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,360
Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?

1735
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
That's good.

1736
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,520
Because I have like 50 of them.

1737
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:03,480
She's offering to borrow a GameCube controller.

1738
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,160
Oh, yeah, thank you.

1739
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,520
Well, now you have a reason to come up again.

1740
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,200
Yeah, well, I always have a reason.

1741
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:17,240
Anything that came in, I'll beat all the Silent Oaks for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.

1742
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,880
Shane says he'll be all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.

1743
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:21,880
Okay.

1744
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,880
Tomorrow.

1745
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,880
Thanksgiving.

1746
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:30,520
I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway, so I'm going to be gone.

1747
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,800
I'm going to be gone during the next show.

1748
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,080
Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?

1749
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:40,160
Well, I'm actually going to go have it with X to First Family, because his mom invited

1750
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,160
me.

1751
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,040
How about that weekend?

1752
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,040
That weekend?

1753
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,040
Totally.

1754
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,040
Okay.

1755
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,040
Four-day weekend.

1756
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,360
I'm going to be gone during the GameCube controller.

1757
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:49,360
Not cool.

1758
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,360
I'm going to be gone all next weekend.

1759
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.

1760
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
And you can play it on my TV.

1761
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
Cool.

1762
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,360
All right.

1763
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:59,360
Well, I do want to throw one other thing in real quick, Rob, if I could.

1764
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,360
Yes, yes.

1765
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,360
Okay.

1766
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,680
I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.

1767
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,680
Why?

1768
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:08,680
What happened?

1769
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,840
They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III.

1770
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:20,680
And they promised me classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.

1771
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:26,760
And I'm sick of going in there and pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked

1772
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
in the store.

1773
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,560
And they sell everything five dollars higher.

1774
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,380
So they didn't suck it, and I hate them.

1775
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,560
Do I have an offer for you?

1776
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:41,800
We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.

1777
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:43,600
Yeah, okay.

1778
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,680
To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they...

1779
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:55,880
I don't know about the lost reserves, but if they don't get the stuff in when Sony tells

1780
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,040
them or whatever they tell them they're going to get in, it's not their fault.

1781
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,320
I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just...

1782
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:06,640
You put up with so much from them, and then you're like, okay, that's just...

1783
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,840
I know, but for someone who's dating someone who works at GameStop who constantly gets

1784
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,400
harassed, it's like somebody comes and it's like, why don't you have this?

1785
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,400
Why don't you have this?

1786
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,400
And she's like, I don't know.

1787
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,400
They didn't send it to us.

1788
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,920
Well, it's not her fault.

1789
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,080
There's a management or district...

1790
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,680
It's just like how it changes from store to store.

1791
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:30,280
And GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.

1792
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,520
It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.

1793
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,120
I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management.

1794
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,800
So they can all bite my ass.

1795
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,000
The employees are awesome.

1796
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,960
Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.

1797
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,640
Left cheek or right cheek?

1798
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,640
All right, wow.

1799
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,640
Harsh words.

1800
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,640
Both.

1801
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,640
With the flaming corn cob stuff up it.

1802
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,640
Wait, what?

1803
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,640
Meikle Top, what?

1804
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,920
Everybody go by Sneaking, because Sneaking is the best.

1805
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,640
All right, now Meikle Top, we're going to line right now.

1806
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:02,700
Seriously, I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball Cheap.

1807
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,240
This show is not for you to hawk your canes on.

1808
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,740
Okay, well, I'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.

1809
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,740
Talk about it later, Shane.

1810
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,740
I got to go.

1811
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:11,740
Okay.

1812
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,740
All right, bye.

1813
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,740
Fine, whatever.

1814
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,740
I got to play Zelda.

1815
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:15,740
Bye.

1816
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:16,740
Bye.

1817
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,740
I'll send you a message.

1818
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:18,740
Yeah, send him a Wii mail.

1819
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,740
Exactly.

1820
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,740
That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today was Wii mail.

1821
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:21,740
Hey, I'll tell you what.

1822
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:27,240
You friend me on the Wii console thing, because we do have a thread going on in the OLR army

1823
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,000
forum.

1824
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,040
If you do friend me, I will send you a bunch of memes.

1825
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,040
Oh, snap.

1826
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,040
Oh, well, here we go.

1827
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,040
Here's another call.

1828
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,040
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

1829
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,040
Who's this?

1830
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,880
Obviously, the one and only Legend of Zaku.

1831
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Obviously.

1832
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,240
Now, you're in New York City, too.

1833
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:46,160
Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?

1834
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:47,160
I stayed home.

1835
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,160
That's all I have to say.

1836
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,160
You stayed home?

1837
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,160
Why?

1838
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?

1839
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,160
No.

1840
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,440
No, I didn't want to deal with it.

1841
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,240
I've already seen the massive lines with the PS3 around my way.

1842
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,280
I'd just rather just take a break from it.

1843
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,280
Yeah, but those were quote, unquote, business people.

1844
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,200
Oh, yeah.

1845
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,200
The greed monsters?

1846
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,200
Oh, yeah.

1847
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,160
What possessed you to call in tonight, Zaku?

1848
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:15,540
You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like

1849
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:20,360
30 seconds of just stopping on a soft pad.

1850
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,520
I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I

1851
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,860
teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped

1852
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:32,800
the shark already, something to that effect, but I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch

1853
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,080
Total Request Live.

1854
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,080
So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?

1855
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,080
Good thing you didn't.

1856
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:43,360
They made him play Fallout Boy, and they only showed it for 30 seconds, and from what I

1857
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,680
hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had to

1858
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,680
play on soft pads.

1859
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,680
And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?

1860
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:59,440
No YouTube link, as far as I know, and it's a good thing, because it's just not worth

1861
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,440
it.

1862
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:06,560
But on the flip side, it might draw more people into DDR, because if they see Fallout Boy

1863
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,720
on the dance pad, they'll drive into it.

1864
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:15,920
I don't know, it's basically, some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target

1865
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:16,920
of it.

1866
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:22,720
The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls,

1867
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:23,720
thank you.

1868
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,720
All right.

1869
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,840
But think about it, you can't-

1870
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,640
There's no need to think about it.

1871
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,640
You don't have to-

1872
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:31,640
Look-

1873
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:35,520
I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we've got to wrap it up, because we've

1874
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,600
got to start ending this show, because we're running super long tonight, but how do you

1875
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,600
feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?

1876
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,600
Overall?

1877
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,240
I mean, it really depends.

1878
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:51,120
Some of it might be stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much

1879
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:56,800
of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only

1880
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,040
play the game, but also live lives and make friends out of the thing.

1881
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:07,700
DDR is not just about arrow stomping, it's about, in certain communities, you meet people

1882
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:14,120
and you make good and long friendships out of it.

1883
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,440
I was going to say one other thing real quick.

1884
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:20,040
Whatever happened to La Maschine del Bailar, or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie

1885
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,040
about DDR?

1886
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:22,040
That just randomly crossed my mind.

1887
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,040
What ever happened to that?

1888
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,040
I downloaded it.

1889
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:28,000
I actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.

1890
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,080
What I heard is they didn't even, I don't know, I wouldn't say they bastardized it,

1891
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,320
but from what I hear, they only played, like the demo mode is just about, the whole story

1892
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:43,760
was revolving about just winning this competition.

1893
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:51,600
Would you say that La Maschine del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food

1894
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,600
restaurants?

1895
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,400
I would say it's more like you got served.

1896
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:58,680
All right, fair enough.

1897
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,240
All right, Zaku, we got to let you go.

1898
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,240
Have a good one, buddy.

1899
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:02,240
All right.

1900
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,240
Have fun.

1901
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,240
Peace out.

1902
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,240
Bye.

1903
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,240
I love our colors.

1904
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,960
You guys are funny, but no more time tonight, I'm sorry to say.

1905
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,680
So sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.

1906
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:15,320
We're getting kind of hammered tonight, so sorry kids, I'll try again next week.

1907
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,280
Late last minute stories here in studio.

1908
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:18,520
Last minute stories.

1909
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,520
Last call for alcohol.

1910
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,640
I've got some quick ones.

1911
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,280
I'll make them very, very quick.

1912
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:30,000
Anyways, first off, I'd like to start by seeing, there's this one post on GoNintendo.com, they

1913
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,600
actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii, because

1914
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,480
apparently his company did not hook him up.

1915
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,240
I just thought it was funny.

1916
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:47,000
To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see

1917
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
on the TV.

1918
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
No, it's not at all.

1919
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,080
But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like

1920
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:54,080
we did?

1921
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:55,080
Maybe.

1922
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,080
I don't know.

1923
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:02,040
Anyways, so of course, amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3,

1924
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:13,240
the Boston mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino, is going to charge Sony for the police manpower

1925
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:21,920
that it took to bring this whole chaotic situation to order, so I thought that was kind of funny.

1926
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:28,600
Wii Play has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S. in January, according to Reggie,

1927
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:34,440
and that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a controller

1928
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,040
for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.

1929
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:45,480
And then, some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360,

1930
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:50,560
apparently aren't 720p when they say they are, and the resolution's a little bit less

1931
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,360
than that, which I think is kind of interesting, kind of getting gipped there.

1932
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:02,120
Let's see, Killzone 2 is going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.

1933
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,960
Not a big surprise there.

1934
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:13,400
EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction

1935
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:18,280
policy, and it says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites,

1936
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,520
and those websites are making money by selling advertising.

1937
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,580
They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.

1938
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:31,120
I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going

1939
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,560
to be able to access content they want.

1940
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:39,640
To be honest though, I think that's still stupid, dumb excuse.

1941
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:46,440
Let's see here, Ken Kutaragi said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network

1942
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,280
storage system for the Playstation 3, and he's crazy.

1943
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:57,080
CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you buy a 40 inch HDTV, you get the reserve

1944
01:25:57,080 --> 01:26:01,480
of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.

1945
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:05,780
Let's see, oh the Playstation 3, this was the best one I read this week.

1946
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:13,240
Apparently if you do not have, or if you do have HDMI cables, or not HDMI, if you have

1947
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:20,080
an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i, instead

1948
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:25,640
will downscale it to 480p, which I thought was very interesting, so if you have just

1949
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:32,920
a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for

1950
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,720
the Playstation 3.

1951
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,240
And by the way, the HDMI for the Playstation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is

1952
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:40,240
interesting.

1953
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:48,440
And then finally, a couple last ones here, Sony's vice president of marketing was talking

1954
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:53,300
about the crying babies commercial that they have for the Playstation 3, and basically

1955
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,200
saying it's like a Rorschach test, whatever you think about the commercials, which you

1956
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:04,600
think about the Playstation 3, so I guess my take on the Playstation 3 would be I don't

1957
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:07,760
get it, and it's slightly creepy.

1958
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,080
Also apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense, I've noticed that

1959
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,920
with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.

1960
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,120
I can see that, I can see that.

1961
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:22,040
And then finally, the last one, did you say that on the last one?

1962
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,600
Forget it, forget it.

1963
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,600
Shut up.

1964
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:27,720
Okay, this is the very last one.

1965
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:35,360
Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some

1966
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:39,360
in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.

1967
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:47,080
Apparently a nearby apartment had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain

1968
01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:48,080
their line.

1969
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,080
Oh god.

1970
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:53,640
This is, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young

1971
01:27:53,640 --> 01:28:02,400
girls became apparently underaged girls, and somebody called the cops.

1972
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,080
They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3 apparently, or whatever

1973
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,800
F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.

1974
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,600
Alrighty, anything else?

1975
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,600
Anyone?

1976
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,600
Anyone?

1977
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,600
Wow.

1978
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,600
DMN.

1979
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,600
Yes, DMN?

1980
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,600
I motion to adjourn.

1981
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,600
Alright.

1982
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:20,600
I agree.

1983
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,600
I think it's time to wrap up the show.

1984
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,520
We've been running very long tonight, so thanks of course to all you guys who download us

1985
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,800
in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.

1986
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,800
You guys are awesome.

1987
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:32,800
We love you very much.

1988
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,800
Mwah, mwah.

1989
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:37,560
And thanks of course to our guests, DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way to

1990
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,560
Seattle.

1991
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,560
Again, thank you for having me.

1992
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,560
I had a great time.

1993
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,000
Chris, thank you for being here, and of course, thanks again for whoring out Orange Lodge

1994
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,120
Radio the way you did last night.

1995
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,120
Oh, no problem.

1996
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,120
I enjoyed it.

1997
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,120
Thanks for having me on.

1998
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,120
No problem.

1999
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:52,320
Thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always, it's time to go around and get everybody's final

2000
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,320
thought.

2001
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,320
We'll start with our guests.

2002
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,720
DMN, your final thought.

2003
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,720
I'm hungry.

2004
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,720
Chris, your final thought.

2005
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:01,720
I'm not hungry.

2006
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,640
I just had a donut.

2007
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,840
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

2008
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,840
Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.

2009
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:15,800
My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.

2010
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Cry.

2011
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,040
I don't want any more orange soda.

2012
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:25,240
I've already had four cans of it, and that's more orange soda.

2013
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:29,760
All right, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.

2014
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,760
You guys rock.

2015
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,720
Oh, next week on Orange Lodge Radio, I do not believe we're going to be live.

2016
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,160
Did we already talk about that?

2017
01:29:37,160 --> 01:29:38,160
I'm not sure.

2018
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:39,560
We're not going to be live during the holiday.

2019
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,080
Yeah, we're not going to be live during the holiday.

2020
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:42,440
Are we pre-taping?

2021
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,440
I don't know.

2022
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,440
We have to talk about that.

2023
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,440
Yeah.

2024
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,440
There'll be a pre-taping at some point.

2025
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,880
You can go to our website, orangelodgeradio.com.

2026
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:50,840
So sorry to our live listeners, but it is kind of a holiday weekend.

2027
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,280
Some of us are going out of town.

2028
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,840
And rejects false icons.

2029
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,840
Thank you.

2030
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:58,880
And yeah, have a great turkey day for those of you guys in the U.S. that celebrate that.

2031
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,700
And certainly, we here at OLR are thankful for just you guys that support us and have

2032
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:07,140
been spreading the word about our little program.

2033
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:10,700
Like we said at the top of the show, we don't get paid for this yet.

2034
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:15,040
We don't really get a whole lot of reward except for the fact that we get to meet other

2035
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:19,800
geeks in the process, and it's pretty rad to know that we're not alone in our hardcoreness

2036
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,040
for games.

2037
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,040
So that being said, hmm.

2038
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,040
Nothing.

2039
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,040
Oh, okay.

2040
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,040
That being said, have a great week.

2041
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,040
We'll see you next time on OLR.

2042
