19946	24767	All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 209 for this November the 19th of 2006.
26088	40952	Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend, or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out, or a current-gen user who's not upgrading to next-gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this program.
41912	57161	We, here at Orange Launch Radio, are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off Part B. If you want to know the details, you have to listen to Part A. Remember, Orange Launch Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.
57441	63565	There's Part A, which comes out on Monday, and Part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.
63725	65886	Our chat room is eagerly standing by.
65926	68628	This is something special we did for our live listeners only.
68928	76737	We only advertise this on our LiveJournal and our MySpace communities, so if you want to find out about future contests before anyone else does, you might want to sign up.
76817	81783	LiveJournal, our username is OrangeLounge, and on MySpace, we're MySpace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
82303	83745	All right, we should stop stalling, huh, DMN?
83945	84965	Yeah, God.
85306	86306	And DMN, a.k.a.
86346	88307	John, is just doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
88687	88867	Yeah.
88887	90747	So there's no other reason for it.
91108	93228	All right, let's stop stalling.
93288	94169	Let's get to the winner.
94249	94969	All right, here we go.
95489	97010	I'm now going to pull up random.org.
97050	98030	So, John, you're going to be picking.
98310	102292	I'm pulling ten random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away.
102312	102912	Okay.
102932	106533	And he is going to tell me which one of the ten numbers I'm picking right now.
107694	107954	Rob.
107994	108054	Yes.
108394	108614	Yes.
109198	112581	Whatever email is number six on that list.
112721	113942	Number five, six.
114182	115003	Oh, this is great.
115063	115764	All right.
115824	116805	Guess what number six is?
116825	117165	What?
117425	118726	It was email number 37.
118867	119427	Okay.
120248	120628	In a row?
120888	121309	In a row?
121389	122149	I know how it's coming.
122169	122390	All right.
122410	123010	Let's count them out.
123030	125612	And I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR or any of that stuff.
126153	136442	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-nine,
137261	138982	32, 34, 36, here it is, 37.
142825	145326	Oh, look who won it.
145346	146647	Oh, they're going to be.
146667	147808	You know what?
147868	151390	This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.
151430	153611	This person is going to be very excited.
153972	155393	Let's give him a call right now.
157154	158695	All right, let's give him a call right now.
161376	162877	It's connecting.
162897	164078	Yeah, it's ringing right now, boys and girls.
166049	166669	Let's hope it works.
167109	167489	Here it goes.
167549	167910	It's ringing.
172031	172351	Hello?
172831	174111	Hi, did somebody order a pizza?
175972	176392	We're kidding.
176432	177733	Is this Raven's Dolphin?
177753	179713	Just kidding.
180093	182034	This is Orange Lounge Radio calling.
182374	183954	You just won a Wii!
184194	185875	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
185935	187635	No, you won the Wii, my friend!
188396	189196	We're kidding!
189276	190176	No, no, no!
190196	191017	Congratulations!
191037	192817	No, we are joking.
192837	194197	Oh my God, I won a Wii!
194257	195758	Yep, you won the Wii, my friend!
197159	197940	Oh my God!
198040	200701	Dude, I gotta say, I'm jazzed for you.
200721	202702	You call into this show all the time.
202822	204423	Every once, we're Skyping you.
204503	207805	Every once, we're calling you to tell you that you won a Wii.
207905	208446	You did it.
208566	210727	You were email number 37 in the inbox.
211467	213048	Oh my God!
213148	215110	I'm literally speechless.
215670	216010	I know.
216831	218372	I'd go crazy too if I were you.
218492	219772	So congratulations.
220093	221013	So what are you going to do?
221033	222954	What are you going to do with your Wii?
222994	224075	Do you already own a Wii?
225136	225696	No, uh...
226846	227406	No, sort of.
227747	227947	What?
228027	228447	Sort of?
228507	229027	What's that mean?
230528	232509	All right, I do, but I have plans for this.
232830	234210	Oh, what's the plans for this?
235591	238813	All right, I was going to do something similar to DMN.
238833	239674	Uh-huh.
240234	241935	I wonder we, I'm happy about that.
241955	244697	It's just the question is, I'm not going to sell on eBay.
245397	245597	Good.
245637	251161	Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.
251441	252081	That's very generous.
252121	253002	That's very cool.
253102	253802	That's very cool.
253842	256504	So someone's going to get it, so.
257145	257925	That's awesome!
257945	259906	Well, congratulations, Raven Stolfen.
260366	262867	And you need to get in touch with DMN.
263127	264768	You know my personal email on the site, right?
264788	268149	Just send me an email and we'll get your shipping address and get it taken care of, alright?
269250	270310	Oh, one more thing, Rob.
270370	270550	Yes.
270570	271691	As long as I have you on the line.
271931	272151	Yes.
274432	275612	Rayman's Raving Rabbits.
275893	276733	Yes.
277273	277753	What about it?
278834	280034	Rayman's Raving Rabbits.
280755	281195	What about it?
282375	282755	Alright.
283115	286757	There's this DDR team that you drum the stick with it and you
287185	304708	and you beat the little rabbits to death and it reminds me so much of you and I enjoy it because they play girls that want to have fun and it's such enjoyable alright I haven't played that minigame yet, I'm sorry I guess you did would girls just want to have fun?
306708	316950	it was Misery Lou that played yeah, but we played that one alright, Ravenstaff, we've got to get back into the show but thanks so much for entering and supporting Orange Launch Radio and now we're giving something back to you
317891	319254	I can't believe I won.
326041	329462	Over the fact that he may or may not already own a Wii.
329782	330402	But you know what?
330522	332063	Hey, it's fair and square.
332163	333103	We said it at the front.
333123	334784	You know, whoever wants to enter the contest can.
334824	337084	And it sounds like he's got really good plans for the Wii.
337184	341326	That he's going to, you know, give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas time.
341426	343086	So, you know what?
343186	343986	I can't argue with that.
344046	345747	You guys stop being Scrooges.
345847	346327	That's right.
346367	347568	You guys are just Scrooges.
347588	348268	You're bitter.
348668	351049	You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.
351449	352309	So, just, you know...
353811	354972	Maybe next time.
354992	356233	We've got other stuff to give away.
356353	358275	Oh, you know what?
359896	361297	I was going to tell people about this.
361377	367321	If you've been reading the forums, it's going to be ongoing whenever it happens.
367381	369783	But we're going to have a new contest called Early Release.
370023	370923	Get your mind out of the gutter.
372324	375567	We get games a little early where I work.
375847	380090	So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now.
381262	384003	Announcing games, and we'll probably do the same thing as we did here.
385263	394405	If a game comes out, I think we may start it either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare, because a lot of people love that.
395145	398866	We're going to give away the game before it comes out, so you can rub it in people's faces.
398886	400206	I played it before it came out.
400666	401127	Bitches.
401387	403007	Alright, we'll look forward to that.
403067	407448	So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance later on.
407742	411763	And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going to have some cool stuff for you guys too.
412063	416824	We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.
418144	421445	Anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.
421505	423666	Let's go back to the show, shall we?
425646	427506	And talk about some more gaming news.
428627	429627	Alright, let's.
431127	434428	So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving...
435069	440171	And we all know what comes after Thanksgiving, other than falling asleep from overeating.
440892	441492	Black Friday.
441932	447135	And of course, with Black Friday, there's always going to be great deals on games and stuff.
447855	450977	And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.
451017	454778	They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.
455339	462602	For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Games,
463174	470297	Table Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store before noon.
470637	473498	And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.
475339	483262	Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4, and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.
483522	485562	So that's not bad either.
485662	487143	I mean, those are some pretty good games.
487363	488083	Full Auto is fun.
489444	489764	All right.
490270	495935	Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.
496993	501354	I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging you to do it.
501374	504395	But yeah, did you know people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia?
504415	504975	It's pretty rad.
505775	523959	But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia, and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 1-1-1-1-1, or Sony sucks, and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 1-1-1-1-1, DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia to add on Ken Kutaragi's bio, PS, eats crayons.
526000	551450	or maybe it's Macy, who knows so anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down they've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony until further notice so that you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user I'm assuming of some standing there on Wikipedia because if you're registered then they can track what you do and give you the ban of death, the banhammer isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii, Banhammer?
551570	552491	no, Project Hammer, I know
553919	554459	Super Mario Bros.
583081	585243	No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.
585463	585783	Really?
585983	589326	It will be in Rising Star Games Evolution series.
590146	593169	Those are the PSP remakes.
593209	594610	Their DS ones are Revolution.
595510	598533	And it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.
599093	606499	It should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about it.
607259	610562	And for anyone who's bitching that it wasn't out on DS, yeah, it was.
611885	615168	You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?
615188	616109	I thought it was Rainbow Stars.
616129	617190	That's the one where you shoot the little rainbows?
617210	617850	That's Parasol Stars.
617990	618491	Okay, I'm sorry.
618511	619592	I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbow.
619852	620532	I love Rainbow Islands.
620552	620833	That one's fun.
620853	621934	That's the one where you shoot the rainbows.
621974	622574	Yeah, that's fun.
622634	624936	I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.
624976	629420	See, I actually have it on TurboGrafx, but I would love to have a handheld Parasol Stars.
629600	630200	Now, of course you don't.
630220	638387	Well, I mean, technically I do since I have one of the portable TurboGrafx, but I would love to have it on, you know,
639432	641473	See, but Rainbow Islands is a classic.
642213	643774	Not as many people play Parasol Stars.
643954	645395	You know, I have to ask this question, though.
645455	646755	Will I be able to get past level 30?
648276	661442	Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.
662002	662122	Huh.
662843	668208	Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangenautorated.com said almost the same thing I did when I said it.
668248	670730	It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?
670990	672131	So, very cool.
672331	672872	Ranma agrees.
672912	673932	Parasol Stars owns.
674593	679917	I think the first time I ever saw Parasol Stars, I want to say, was on Supercade or whatever that game show.
679977	680438	No, Supercade.
680458	680898	Ultracade?
680998	682179	Oh, no, the game show.
683340	685082	God, it was Starcade.
685382	687183	No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.
687203	688444	Starcade was the name of that show.
689025	690966	They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good.
691307	691547	Remember?
691567	691647	Yeah.
692261	693021	That was a great show.
695222	698184	When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starrcade.
698224	698824	It was awesome.
699505	700825	That's just craziness.
700945	701525	Crazy!
702106	702606	Craziness.
702946	703506	Crazy!
704747	706048	Okay, maybe not that crazy.
708329	715852	Anywho, okay, so, of course, with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.
716393	719854	And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.
722322	731265	You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.
732185	736586	And they have a wonderful application to easily install it on there for you.
736666	738407	So homebrew on 2.8.
739867	745329	I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.
747837	752179	And are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?
752239	753279	Have you been following this at all?
753419	754480	No, I just keep upgrading.
754640	756100	You just keep upgrading.
756341	758561	It's kind of lost now wanting to do the whole NES games.
758621	760042	I just don't care anymore.
760062	760482	I know.
760982	762323	I don't hardly play.
763023	767225	I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.
768085	771747	The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out.
772107	774368	But really, I mean, that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.
775027	782010	Yeah, I still like my PSP for web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading shows and playing Luminous, of course.
782450	785091	But, you know, I don't know.
785572	788573	John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the PSP's a done deal in 2007?
789233	789433	Yes.
789733	789914	Why?
790394	791754	Even with all the PS3 support?
792855	793375	It doesn't matter.
793435	794515	It's gimmicky.
794616	795096	No, no, no.
795136	796676	This is honestly what I'm thinking.
796756	802639	Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to the Big Daddy console, it sucked.
803693	806154	With the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.
806434	809814	The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.
810895	812795	Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?
812995	813455	They could.
814575	815115	I doubt it.
815275	817796	I mean, it would be nice to see something like that work.
817956	824077	I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be cool.
824097	826558	I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.
827318	827778	We shall see.
828499	838842	Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back anyway.
839402	844203	Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?
844623	846324	You buy a DS regular.
846784	848285	Oh, here comes the DS Lite.
848705	850985	Oh, here it comes in prettier colors, right?
851205	851565	Right?
851645	852706	This happens all the time.
852726	853526	Well, guess what?
854161	854621	GameDaily.biz
871368	874951	I'm sorry, GameDaily.com, biz.game.com is saying this is confirmed.
875391	883237	That Nintendo of America confirmed that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii, will be coming to the U.S.
883697	884738	sometime during 2007.
887120	891863	Let's see, there's something, quote, SonicCinePlayerCEDVDNavigator.com.
892170	896852	I'll be bringing high quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.
897273	898773	So, kind of interesting.
898953	902835	So we already know there's probably going to be a souped up Wii somewhere in 2007.
903256	904696	But it's going to be more than $249.99.
905577	909179	I would say it might be, you know, in the mid $300 range.
909419	910679	One billion dollars!
911360	911580	Not really.
911600	914441	But you already have yours.
915242	917203	But, you know, is...
918675	921056	That many people are going to want to get this just for DVD playback?
921096	922557	I don't think so.
922577	923057	Who cares?
923217	923557	I'm not.
923817	925078	I have several DVD players.
925118	927459	I have an Xbox 360 that works just fine as a DVD player.
927479	932902	I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD player, and an upscaling DVD player.
933382	935403	I have a five-disc changer in my living room.
935603	936183	You want a cookie?
937124	938164	No, I want a donut, though.
938844	939345	No, not really.
940445	944407	Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to my main TV.
944960	948642	Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
949262	952384	So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there.
952404	954025	They don't know what each other's doing.
954766	955246	Interesting.
956747	957007	All right.
957127	957947	Well, we'll see.
958007	960709	Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?
960929	961149	No.
961810	962830	No.
962890	966212	Now, what if they sweeten the pot with some, like, maybe different colors?
966232	969614	Like, maybe get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory.
969874	971015	Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?
971949	972970	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
996684	997685	Upgrade my memory!
997845	998766	Upgrade my memory!
998786	1001187	Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?
1001487	1003349	How about some UK release dates?
1004850	1005851	Alright, sure, why not?
1006691	1008873	We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.
1008913	1009733	Let's show them some love.
1009913	1011354	DarkSakura, love them all right now.
1011975	1014857	Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.
1015840	1026143	Asphalt Urban GT 2, Bionicle Heroes on Multiple Systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets, come out over here!
1026163	1033045	Um, Eragon's coming out on Damn Near Everything based off of the unintelligible book of the same name.
1033545	1037446	Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.
1038286	1038366	Um...
1039128	1060708	Hotel Dusk Room 215, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix, Neo Geo Battle Call of C and Phantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Race the Official WTCC game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff that has unconfirmed dates.
1061889	1062289	Excellent.
1063410	1063670	Cool.
1064171	1064471	Anyways.
1065113	1066474	for the US.
1066914	1071776	We're getting quite a bit of stuff and of course got to start everything off with our wonderful exclusive information.
1072316	1081879	So starting with a few price drops actually and I'm not too surprised by this but NBA Live 07 they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats.
1081899	1082259	The 360 is now $39.99.
1082339	1082700	I guess it
1087043	1087543	NBA Live 07
1117458	1120101	The big game, of course, this week would be Superman Returns.
1120662	1124967	And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems.
1125788	1128091	And some of my favorite games, though...
1128444	1129304	Can I interrupt real quick?
1129324	1129705	I'm sorry.
1129805	1130825	Did anyone play the demo?
1130865	1133686	Because I heard the demo went to live this week and I haven't heard a lot of chat about it.
1133906	1137888	I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.
1138168	1142670	I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look that bad.
1142810	1143610	It looked pretty awesome.
1143910	1147732	But I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.
1147752	1150233	I watched someone stack cars and that was pretty funny.
1151408	1161610	But anyway, so another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.
1162190	1169171	If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will be coming out on the 360.
1170391	1170851	Africa.
1171031	1172232	The kind of Africa I like.
1172652	1173672	How about Jombo Safari?
1173712	1174452	Give me that again.
1175572	1178653	And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and
1180985	1182186	The Xbox 360.
1182346	1183246	No one on the PlayStation 2.
1183446	1187469	For some reason, that one was delayed to December, which is very interesting.
1187829	1191171	And then Thrillville will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
1191291	1196774	And if you're a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.
1196794	1199715	And that's basically the big stuff.
1199875	1201976	Get a bunch of crappy DS games.
1202217	1203837	I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.
1204318	1210301	I want to see some of the movie-based games like Open Season and Barnyard.
1211463	1219029	I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me.
1219269	1220931	Happy Feet has a DDR ripoff in it.
1222532	1224674	But Miklatov told me Happy Feet was like the worst movie ever.
1225234	1227236	But I love penguins.
1227256	1228416	I know, it looks so cute.
1228456	1231139	I want to say Miklatov is full of evil, but I don't know.
1231159	1235362	Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming out.
1235382	1240046	Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.
1240306	1240486	So,
1241036	1241496	Anyways.
1242477	1244779	And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.
1244859	1245599	Hi there, Japan.
1245639	1246360	How are you guys doing?
1246520	1248041	You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.
1248381	1251483	On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
1251883	1253244	I know some of you guys are looking forward to that one.
1253584	1255906	NBA Live 07, an X-Men the official game.
1256026	1257987	And you guys are getting the HD DVD player this week.
1258328	1259768	This one made me squeal a little bit.
1259809	1261410	A lot of folks don't remember this game.
1261450	1262110	It was on the PS2.
1262150	1263151	It's called Cold Sept.
1263431	1265712	There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360.
1266133	1267874	And it does look like it's a sequel to the first game.
1270015	1273456	It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.
1273716	1276196	But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.
1277057	1278757	They have a trailer up on live.
1278877	1281078	It was during the E3 thing for that.
1281498	1281838	Oh, cool.
1281898	1283838	I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.
1284459	1285839	Coldstep, hopefully it's coming out over here.
1286379	1286799	I'm sure it is.
1286859	1288340	Eventually, one day.
1288540	1292061	Well, it's out in Japan, which means it'll be making its way over here somewhat soon.
1292301	1295022	Well, hey, I got something kind of random to mention.
1295422	1296222	You know Disgaea...
1296801	1298761	They're actually starting up an anime series for that.
1298781	1301122	They already did.
1301142	1302722	I thought that we reported on that a while ago.
1303022	1304442	Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.
1304502	1306503	I noticed that the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.
1307043	1310343	In case you didn't know... Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.
1310923	1312704	Coming out on the PlayStation 2.
1313504	1318345	Hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drum Mania V2 coming out this week.
1319025	1324306	It's going to cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into their Guitar Freaks.
1324626	1326106	Dark Sakura, sound like something you might be getting?
1326721	1327681	Maybe, I don't know.
1327741	1330142	I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freak since I have Guitar Hero.
1330743	1331483	Maybe.
1332743	1338105	Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation 2.
1338866	1341287	And let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?
1341307	1343447	Let's go to another system this week.
1343467	1344928	We have on the Nintendo DS...
1345639	1347101	Mina no Diaz Karingu
1362074	1364615	Osare Majo Love and Bury.
1364896	1367757	And it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo DS.
1368157	1369058	And it's a puzzle game.
1369078	1369658	It's a puzzle game.
1369818	1375301	I was going to say, is that a game where you love somebody and then knock them off and bury them in your backyard?
1375381	1379204	No, it's bury, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.
1379224	1380044	Like berry what?
1380084	1383166	Like cherry or dingleberry?
1383326	1385747	I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.
1386828	1387788	Is that the hentai game?
1387968	1388629	Is it a hentai game?
1388649	1389029	Is it a hentai game?
1390755	1395976	There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising a hentai dating sim for the DS.
1396756	1400537	We have to feel up girls to see who's a... No, that's a different game.
1400557	1404558	It's from Sega and it's classified as puzzle.
1404758	1405798	I'll say one thing.
1405818	1407259	Touching is good.
1407279	1410819	The female body is a puzzle.
1410919	1412660	The female body is a puzzle, gentlemen.
1412760	1417201	Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle in a way, so that could be an appropriate title.
1417261	1417601	I don't know.
1418521	1419021	Anyway...
1421354	1423054	Let's get back to the news.
1424275	1427836	Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.
1428616	1429716	There is a new demo.
1429776	1431797	I'm excited already before you even mention it.
1432617	1432877	Rob.
1433137	1433357	What?
1433437	1433677	Rob.
1433817	1433977	What?
1434037	1434317	Rob.
1434597	1435038	Rob.
1435158	1435478	Rob.
1435698	1436558	Rob.
1436778	1437998	I will get... Rob.
1438138	1438418	Rob.
1438459	1438699	Rob.
1439119	1439339	Rob.
1439379	1439579	Rob.
1439879	1440319	I quit.
1440419	1440799	I quit.
1440899	1441119	I quit.
1441379	1441899	I quit.
1441919	1442300	I quit.
1442940	1443160	Rob.
1443640	1444180	Rob.
1444820	1446641	Can we keep this show moving, please?
1446681	1446901	What?
1446921	1447261	What?
1447401	1447641	What?
1450492	1451372	Go die in a fire.
1452713	1452953	Okay.
1453673	1453973	Anyway.
1454734	1455514	Game coming out.
1456154	1459015	It's actually a demo on Xbox Live.
1460195	1463277	There is a 360 demo of Cars.
1464517	1466258	450 megaworth of data.
1467318	1471139	So you can play as Lightning McQueen through Radiator Springs.
1475421	1476361	I must be a movie reference.
1476381	1477061	I haven't seen a movie.
1477081	1478362	Anyway.
1478442	1478762	Anyway.
1479475	1486938	Anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.
1486958	1492179	I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.
1494160	1498482	By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.
1499022	1500442	I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.
1501183	1504084	But the good news is next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.
1504404	1506344	Now, I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.
1506384	1507805	Are you excited about Cars on the 360?
1511959	1512259	You know what?
1512339	1513480	Actually, I kind of am.
1515441	1520844	For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.
1520884	1525026	Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.
1525486	1530669	So I'm actually excited for it because Megzi is the biggest Pixar nut.
1530729	1535352	I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without she picking out every little speck.
1536182	1536902	I'm looking forward to it.
1536922	1537763	I mean, cars, come on.
1537863	1539463	That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.
1539483	1539543	Rob.
1552244	1553986	We need to have a rainbow conversation.
1554306	1560911	SSJ100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.
1561131	1565274	I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.
1569618	1572520	I could tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.
1572860	1574041	We beat people.
1574964	1582328	I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I think we need to give Chris and Megsy their own show where they just talk dirty to us.
1582608	1587851	We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast of kind of like rants.
1587891	1588672	Jamie's going to be in on it.
1589212	1590653	Just call it Ask a Lesbian.
1590673	1592474	We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.
1593554	1595755	We've got to get back to games, games, games, games.
1595996	1596476	Anyway, so...
1601115	1603015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1633072	1635313	On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens.
1636214	1641076	They want to make sure that people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.
1641416	1649460	However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit because if I want to go in there and buy one console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.
1650820	1651921	I'll tell you why they do that.
1652281	1654082	Because margins on consoles suck.
1655002	1659004	Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck.
1659284	1661245	Especially the accessories, their games...
1662216	1666920	Artificially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit this quarter.
1667440	1671003	Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show.
1671104	1672345	Something kind of last minute that came up.
1672385	1680291	Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE because he pre-ordered a Wii and then they forced a bundle on him.
1680591	1682573	But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle.
1682593	1684334	He had to get, like, crap games.
1684775	1688418	He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube and...
1688738	1693281	I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube, but I'm sure if you put in like FYE and WE, it'll come up there somewhere.
1693522	1695583	It's nothing but text telling his story.
1695903	1696744	It's kind of sarcastic.
1696804	1700487	So that seems kind of low to do that to pre-orderers.
1700927	1704270	That's something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.
1704550	1711635	Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the Northwest somewhere where they were trying to do something similar?
1712175	1715038	And it even opened up this investigation.
1715138	1716879	And I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on this.
1717546	1719388	Rob White says, well I don't shop much at FYE anyway.
1737364	1740488	Robert M says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.
1740528	1741589	I know there should be, of course.
1741950	1745614	You know, I gotta say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.
1745935	1748818	I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot.
1749239	1754265	And some of the third party, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise Spongebob type games.
1754285	1755967	Well, I can't knock it till I've played it, so whatever.
1756274	1760096	There's questionable content there at the launch.
1760116	1763137	GameCube ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.
1763397	1764257	But you know what?
1764618	1767499	Excite Truck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.
1767839	1772461	All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good.
1774442	1776002	Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch.
1777163	1784806	With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out that are just ports from last generation, just kind of
1785165	1788507	Robway says, That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?
1788527	1791970	Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.
1791990	1792630	I don't know.
1792670	1793231	Who am I to know?
1793271	1794572	Who am I to know?
1794612	1794972	I'm sorry?
1811360	1812421	They released Mario Bros.
1812461	1814463	on the Virtual Console.
1814723	1815243	Boo!
1815303	1815804	Boo!
1816224	1816685	Listen.
1816725	1817285	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1817305	1817886	You shut your mouth.
1817946	1819127	I love original Mario Bros.
1819207	1819847	Oh, bullshit.
1819887	1823510	Okay, they put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.
1824311	1827133	To be fair, they put it on every freaking Advance title.
1827434	1829255	I am a little bit tired of it at this point.
1829736	1832638	But I do love old school Mario Bros.
1832698	1833359	I mean, come on.
1833379	1833799	They're virtual.
1833819	1834700	Pow, pow.
1834820	1835921	Soccer and pinball.
1843189	1847991	I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream of games.
1848292	1851453	So in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.
1851933	1852974	That certainly is fair.
1853902	1861248	You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline, and Mario in the pipeline, and Super Smash Bros., absolutely.
1862268	1869613	It's a good marketing decision, because if you release all these franchises at once, yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the road?
1869693	1875538	You're going to have Diddleio or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.
1875598	1879200	You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.
1879260	1881282	It's a good business decision by Nintendo.
1881462	1883043	Nintendo wants to have multiple franchises.
1883925	1884325	Pleasure.
1884846	1885106	Yes.
1885146	1885646	Multiples.
1886007	1887048	Tantric game releases.
1887308	1887508	Yes.
1887828	1888289	Thank you.
1888409	1889309	That's a very good way to put it.
1889329	1890310	Giggity, giggity, goo.
1890811	1895975	So, Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Lounge Radio tonight in the chat room.
1896015	1896755	Good for you, Black Boy.
1896795	1897216	Pat, pat, pat.
1897336	1897936	You got a gold star.
1898597	1898917	All right.
1900999	1901439	All right.
1901459	1902420	That was a good comment.
1902440	1902980	It was a good comment.
1903561	1903881	All right.
1904282	1904702	Let's see.
1904922	1906543	Oh, going to the other end of this.
1906583	1908505	We're going from bundles to the other extreme.
1908525	1910987	Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?
1911465	1912185	This is interesting.
1912225	1915126	There are some numbers coming from MediaCreate.
1915946	1917587	Total hardware sales.
1917747	1922308	They sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan.
1923368	1926469	45,000 approximately of those were the 60 gig models.
1926829	1927429	But get this.
1927769	1935731	They sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch title, all the way down to... Thank you.
1937045	1941811	Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies, but when you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.
1951650	1952851	DarkSakura, Loki, anyone?
1952931	1953451	Blu-ray player.
1976488	1976989	I don't know.
1977909	1982812	That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player in Japan.
1983553	1984954	So it makes sense.
1985554	1988216	I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.
1988942	1993426	What, and I don't want to sound stereotypical, but what does the average Japanese gamer like to play?
1993966	1994687	RPGs.
1994927	1996388	There were none released at launch.
1996848	1998149	That's why there were no games sold.
1998229	2003814	But racing games are also hugely popular over there, so Ridge Racer 7 should have been, you know, a big, big title.
2004154	2007036	Well, Ridge Racer's kind of the sun setting on that franchise.
2007116	2008617	It's not that good of a franchise anymore.
2008938	2010139	Ooh, them's fighting words, though.
2010159	2011800	It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.
2011960	2013561	Yeah, that's about right.
2013661	2014682	That was the last.
2015343	2018085	The Ridge Racer 4 bundled with the JogCon.
2018757	2019798	Best bundle ever.
2020478	2021619	Since then, nothing's topped it.
2022200	2027324	Except for having the NegCon when you play Wipeout.
2027724	2028145	I like 6.
2028465	2031387	I didn't love it, but I liked it.
2031507	2032628	It's a good deal now.
2033069	2034030	It's a really good deal now for $20.
2034110	2035971	It's all about Ridge Racer DS.
2036231	2036632	All right.
2037813	2039614	Actdeft says Ridge Racer 5 is good.
2040375	2043597	Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.
2045319	2046340	R4 was the top of it.
2046700	2046900	All right.
2047679	2048200	DarkSakura, take it away.
2048220	2048780	DarkSakura, take it away.
2070976	2072216	First email comes up.
2072236	2078258	These are sort of being read out of order that I receive them, so I'm being random today.
2078578	2080479	Yay, random.
2080559	2081599	First one comes from Robway.
2082759	2086881	I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.
2087341	2088801	One thing bothers me in particular.
2088921	2092122	You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.
2092522	2095523	This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.
2096212	2101354	It more or less validates it, saying, We know you won't be able to get one, so buy your games now and get the system off eBay.
2101975	2107017	This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the things won't buy any games.
2107477	2112499	This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off it the same as a PS3 with no games.
2113140	2118162	I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.
2120063	2121543	That makes sense.
2121763	2124085	Another one comes from AZHP.
2126418	2127839	or as HP, I guess I should say.
2127859	2130301	Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?
2130641	2133803	I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freak like years ago.
2134043	2135384	Oh, well, who cares?
2135504	2135745	Sorry.
2137166	2138566	Okay, may I continue?
2138647	2140728	Yes, if that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.
2141317	2147221	A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered 100 PS3s at 30 different stores.
2147821	2151203	I didn't believe him at first, and then he sent me this picture, and I'll link it in the chat room.
2152064	2152564	I've seen this.
2152724	2155526	I want to say I saw it over on YouNoob.com.
2155546	2159828	They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.
2160629	2163751	With all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000 in a day.
2165891	2171574	Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.
2171995	2172595	Brace yourself.
2173195	2175357	Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.
2175697	2176797	Freaking ridiculous.
2177038	2180299	Oh my god, why are you friends with such a lame-ass person?
2180359	2181000	Seriously.
2183021	2184162	I think it's a great idea.
2184742	2185402	You know what, though?
2185663	2187063	People are selling them on eBay.
2187263	2188624	You see an opportunity to make money.
2188924	2189465	Go for it.
2189645	2194247	If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.
2195848	2199691	That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like that.
2199771	2200351	And you know what?
2201072	2204434	The dumbasses are the ones that pay that kind of money for PS3.
2205335	2210338	I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.
2210498	2211819	It's capitalism at work.
2212640	2213200	It's filthy.
2213400	2214221	It's disgusting.
2214401	2216523	Jamie, I think I have to agree.
2216763	2218264	If you've got the means to do it,
2219293	2220254	That's what capitalism is.
2220834	2222735	It's playing off of people's stupidity.
2222995	2224015	It's fucking immoral.
2224075	2227477	To take this in a different direction, isn't this really risky?
2228197	2239543	I mean, because if the PlayStation 3's bottom fell out, as they're saying is happening on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going to, this guy could stand to lose a poop load of money.
2240123	2245906	I don't feel comfortable with the idea... Where I believe that stupid people...
2247034	2247655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2259808	2265573	I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.
2266033	2267454	I think it's really disgusting.
2267895	2273359	You know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person because they are greedy.
2273879	2280344	And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should even be an option to begin with.
2280504	2283927	I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.
2284688	2286309	So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.
2286349	2287250	It's extortion, it is.
2288150	2288951	But it's dumb enough to do that.
2290023	2297311	No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah, if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked.
2297512	2300115	However, the situation should not exist to begin with.
2301376	2306181	Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't sell it.
2306762	2308284	So either way, justice is done.
2310201	2339092	I gotta read some interesting comments from chatroom of course I gotta read the smart ass ones because this one made me laugh Alex of the OL Army says with 100 Playstation 3's you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia and Robway says Robway says I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy one Playstation 3 Robway says I agree with extortion it's very much like selling concert tickets over cost scalping interesting
2339915	2340135	All right.
2340255	2347904	You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, making that much money off your eBay sales should count as taxable income.
2348325	2351308	It is taxable.
2351408	2352009	I would agree with that.
2352830	2355393	But how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?
2355573	2357195	I don't, then that gets weird.
2357695	2358016	I don't know.
2358256	2360339	It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.
2360479	2360639	Yeah.
2361886	2366087	I just think that it's a sad state that our world has basically been reduced to this.
2366707	2369988	What happened to making a fucking honest living, seriously?
2370448	2380030	What happened to going out and... Okay, Chris, repeat your comment, though, because I have a follow-up.
2380410	2382910	That died a while ago, making an honest living.
2383370	2384111	It's obsolete.
2384151	2387931	But do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free donuts?
2389792	2390132	Why?
2390152	2390232	Wait.
2391581	2395163	The Making Honest Living is... That's what weirded people out?
2395343	2396484	Wait, I don't know how to say the question.
2396504	2398285	I was like, read it.
2398686	2400547	Because you're saying it's a sad state of the world.
2400687	2401768	I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
2401788	2404429	You're saying it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people buy into.
2404449	2418318	So I'm thinking, is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind of like... They don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games like them?
2419559	2420080	Oh, yeah.
2420240	2420460	I mean...
2421841	2426385	It's, this is the, I mean, I'm a very idealistic person.
2426485	2430307	I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit.
2430428	2434551	But at the same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.
2434931	2439835	It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that stuff in it.
2439935	2441756	And I can try and be a nice person.
2441816	2442957	I mean, I am a nice person.
2443237	2445559	I'm sorry to say, though, but just accepting it blindly is what
2446343	2447744	Basically produces this behavior.
2448264	2452867	You know, just to give another perspective on this, though, and then we'll keep it moving.
2454108	2454909	What about eBay?
2455829	2457210	Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?
2457230	2460172	Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?
2460512	2461833	eBay makes a share of all these.
2461873	2463114	They could end this if they wanted to.
2463514	2466916	Oh, no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this, too.
2467577	2469658	I just think that it's a dirty situation.
2469998	2473961	The money is not... They're basically taking Sony's work...
2474600	2478243	and making a profit off of something they had no involvement in.
2480324	2482606	Basically, they are stealing somebody else's work.
2483727	2486369	Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future.
2486409	2489411	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to comment.
2489972	2491753	It is a free market, though.
2492454	2494896	If they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.
2495496	2499319	If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much money.
2500300	2500500	All right.
2501531	2507596	One thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?
2508476	2515101	We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time, we should probably keep it moving.
2515121	2516662	Do we agree, though, that it is unethical?
2518023	2519044	I don't want to say it's unethical.
2519104	2521926	I think the problem is everybody's on a different page.
2522326	2522807	I think so.
2522867	2524288	We just have to agree to disagree.
2524928	2525989	My personal feeling is...
2526913	2532317	I feel like to me, and this is me personal, I'm not going to judge you or whatever.
2532357	2533598	You're going to do whatever you're going to do.
2533919	2537561	But my thing is I feel like it's like the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's stolen.
2538462	2538862	I don't know.
2539403	2541444	To me, that's... I've said this before.
2541664	2547789	If Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.
2548349	2549751	But that's you guys.
2549791	2550831	That's between you and him.
2551772	2552052	All right.
2552332	2553613	We've got to keep it moving, folks.
2553693	2554274	We have more emails?
2557896	2558096	AJ Twist
2575397	2577999	Speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of this email.
2578039	2579120	I work at KB Toys.
2579200	2586245	I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month, but they're having a big video game sale.
2586305	2590488	All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and DS titles.
2590868	2591288	Cool, huh?
2591568	2595371	Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.
2595411	2596272	She told me no.
2596712	2599094	KB is trying to get away from selling video games.
2599554	2600215	I wonder why.
2600395	2603377	Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games...
2604161	2605462	KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.
2630214	2636642	It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games and I didn't really think about it until I heard this email.
2636662	2640146	I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.
2640186	2643951	Yes, like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB.
2644351	2645973	There are KBs that are outside malls.
2646394	2647435	There was one.
2647455	2648356	There's plenty of strip malls.
2649642	2651483	Whatever, it's KB.
2651723	2654745	Every time I walk past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.
2655485	2659648	Seriously, it's like we've lost our lease sale.
2659948	2661009	All toys must go.
2661049	2662650	That's what it always looks like.
2663070	2668633	Robway says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.
2668833	2673056	It's all about the inflatable pools.
2673116	2678839	Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop where there was a Wii.
2679534	2680654	I was so excited to see it.
2680855	2681535	It is small.
2681675	2692859	I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with the Nintendo Wii was there.
2693279	2696340	No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.
2696701	2698161	Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it.
2698601	2700922	I've always wanted the first, but never had time or money to buy it.
2701262	2704163	I actually chose Beatmania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.
2704664	2708185	Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.
2708510	2711492	Freespops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.
2712053	2714154	Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.
2714234	2716396	I've played it once and loved it more than the first.
2716816	2719698	I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.
2720819	2726824	I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking better makes me a happy bunny.
2727164	2728045	I guess that's all for now.
2728065	2730647	Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.
2730667	2734710	Yay, Guitar Hero.
2734730	2735470	Yay, Guitar Hero.
2736211	2736271	Um...
2737003	2745690	Also to state, I am going to be posting my little Ponykillers letter in our forums momentarily as my letter of the week.
2745990	2747811	So as it is long, it will not be read.
2747851	2748792	It will be on our forums.
2748872	2749933	Make sure you go there and read it.
2750653	2759740	But our other really good email I got from GrinWithoutACat is if we're all ready to listen.
2760000	2760461	I'm listening.
2760561	2760801	Okay.
2761581	2763543	John's making nasty motions at me.
2764773	2765073	or HaloWare.
2765093	2765193	It's
2795097	2796398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2821570	2829816	It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide-and-seek than a shooter.
2830417	2840244	In my first game, I was revived my teammate only to hear him tell, behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle by a chainsaw.
2841565	2848290	I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters, but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.
2848710	2850071	Keep up the good work, grin without a cap.
2850805	2859808	I actually agree with the email that Gears of War I think is one of those games I think you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the shooter genre.
2860128	2864969	Be very careful about all this hype behind the game because it's not for everybody.
2865069	2865749	Is it a good game?
2866109	2866389	Yes.
2866769	2867590	But is it for everybody?
2867850	2868050	No.
2868230	2870070	So try before you buy if you're curious.
2870170	2875572	And a fair warning, I mean, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10.
2876414	2879295	You know, it's ultimately up to you if you're going to like the game or not.
2879435	2879895	Absolutely.
2879915	2880756	So definitely play a demo.
2880836	2883557	Don't ever let the hype sell the game.
2883757	2886978	I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.
2887478	2892240	Don't let the hype sell you a game because it's not always going to be rewarding.
2892380	2894221	Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.
2895621	2898683	And MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.
2898703	2899723	No demo on live.
2900316	2906580	So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other big Xbox 360 games.
2906900	2910442	Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet anyway.
2911303	2913244	So, alrighty.
2914264	2915705	Any more emails for this week?
2915985	2919147	That's it, and I've just posted up my little pony killer's email in our forum.
2919287	2919808	Sweet.
2920308	2927372	If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundryader.com is the place to deliver those lovely little messages.
2928653	2929033	Excellent.
2929502	2940690	Well, moving on, talking about the 360, there's been one cool little mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a VGA AV out on it.
2941471	2954941	And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the Xbox 360 as far as AV stuff goes actually have all the pins for pretty much every video format you'd possibly want.
2955541	2958844	So simply re-soldering some of the connectors...
2959997	2963358	to a VGA jack, you know, caused it to work.
2964038	2964778	So it's pretty simple.
2965238	2971079	There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it.
2971900	2974080	And it'll save you some money that way.
2974800	2975680	So that's pretty cool.
2978321	2978761	All right.
2978821	2986783	Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about, you know, controversial methods of making extra money.
2986803	2988683	But I think we can all agree this is a good thing.
2989139	2989500	and DarkSakura.
3000959	3007167	Sony's ATV Offroad Fury 2, Splashdown Rides Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.
3007447	3012213	They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.
3012453	3018200	They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.
3018421	3019442	Good job, ESA!
3021977	3022478	Good, indeed.
3022518	3035271	And also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda artwork being sold from the old CD-i games.
3039675	3040036	Sorry.
3040643	3051669	From the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devin, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction with the original art that inspired these titles.
3053169	3069578	The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but has signed artwork, a letter from the artist, a half a dozen CD-i games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that featured the Zelda titles.
3070011	3072872	The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.
3075713	3094800	Even though the mention of the Zelda CD-i games made us verp a little bit, I think it's, you know, for the Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so, you know, definitely something I'd want if I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, yeah, crazed Link fans.
3097660	3097981	Anywho, um,
3099691	3105894	So, we actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose.
3106354	3117019	And it's an interesting game, had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the young girl on girl action going on there.
3117079	3124083	But anyways, apparently Rome's mayor is demanding a ban of Rule of Rose.
3124843	3128305	Apparently finds that the erotic themes are too...
3129690	3137035	Too strong and that there's no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says.
3137255	3140258	So, I don't know.
3140298	3141278	I own that game.
3142539	3145161	I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.
3145241	3150885	I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy vibe of it.
3151005	3153107	Wasn't there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?
3153167	3154848	Yeah, it was very subtle.
3154868	3155909	It wasn't like, you know...
3157239	3159781	All of a sudden they just start making out and getting it on.
3159821	3161462	I mean, that's a little much.
3162523	3170668	You know, when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like, you know when little kids are doing stuff that they don't quite understand what they're doing?
3171769	3173630	That's kind of the vibe I got.
3174010	3177813	And it's not like they're... I mean, it's really, really subtle.
3177993	3179954	I mean, unless you're looking for it.
3180034	3181035	Fucking sickos.
3181095	3184337	You know, the only way this is ever going to get banned... What it boils down to is that they're all gay.
3185873	3186314	I'm kidding.
3186774	3187634	The fat chick.
3188255	3189496	The fat chick was awesome.
3189676	3193458	Listen, the Pope, he no like the rule of Rose, okay, so.
3193878	3195159	He's not the mayor of Rome.
3195720	3197341	I don't care, he doesn't like rule of Rose.
3198101	3199242	It doesn't matter if he's the mayor.
3200382	3202284	Thank you Captain Obvious over there in the corner.
3202324	3203905	The Pope's not the mayor of Rome.
3204945	3205566	No crap.
3206246	3207887	No, but he is the God of Rome.
3207907	3208267	Alright.
3210749	3210869	Um.
3210889	3210929	Um.
3211883	3212464	Car Area Network
3235879	3236699	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3265509	3266430	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3296603	3297323	Two DSs.
3297543	3298524	Twelve gauge, I don't know.
3300744	3301665	Or ferret.
3302605	3303145	Sedatives.
3303325	3304346	Ferret justice.
3306346	3306926	No, no, no.
3306986	3308167	I don't hate children that much.
3309387	3310047	I just don't want any.
3310407	3310908	She loves them.
3310948	3312088	She wants to squeeze them until they choke.
3312228	3317850	And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't be breeding shouldn't breed.
3318430	3320191	I am not in a position to take care of one right now.
3320371	3321531	And those people shouldn't have one either.
3321631	3322071	So there.
3322511	3323892	I live by my morals.
3323912	3324712	You practice what you preach.
3325094	3325534	I do.
3325594	3326254	Good for you.
3326534	3327555	God damn it, I do.
3328815	3330156	Now I want another donut.
3330636	3331476	I think we have donuts.
3331936	3332936	I want a powdered donut.
3333777	3346601	Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday just like everybody else.
3347361	3349221	They had less than we got.
3349321	3354183	They got 500 total for the entire...
3355605	3356506	I can top that.
3357026	3358006	Hong Kong got $200.
3359047	3359387	Really?
3360047	3365930	So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries worth a piece.
3367170	3367691	Because they got $750.
3368151	3371092	Did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?
3371472	3371933	It doesn't say.
3372273	3373033	Oh, that's too bad.
3374654	3377095	Did they have people pushing each other into flagpoles like they did here?
3378716	3380696	No, they just probably strung them up from the light post.
3381477	3382197	I got a question.
3382277	3383998	How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?
3387634	3387974	I don't know.
3388314	3388615	A lot.
3388675	3390796	It had to have been the comparable amount.
3390976	3394478	Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.
3394518	3416652	They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China are, you know, not that... They're not that... I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of stupid to give them a system that is overpriced and, you know... So maybe that's why they got so little...
3417921	3419582	I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.
3419642	3421843	I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order.
3421903	3422564	God damn it.
3424725	3425085	Anyways.
3425625	3425966	Wow.
3427827	3433930	So, as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for the Wii.
3434443	3435323	And that is the case.
3435363	3438164	The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.
3438404	3438864	Quiet, you.
3439044	3441804	Listen, I hear you sighing over there.
3442344	3444065	This is an accurate gripe, okay?
3444185	3448365	So, they are not coming out until December 5th, and probably later than that.
3449186	3453466	And also, the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.
3454026	3455427	So, you know what?
3455487	3459247	To be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming out either.
3459447	3461948	But, you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.
3462168	3462348	So...
3463427	3470731	I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get component cables.
3470771	3474212	I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.
3474252	3475733	You said it yourself on the show.
3476573	3478354	Loki, they're not coming out today.
3478715	3480535	You had to order them on Nintendo.com.
3480796	3483757	Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.
3484637	3489800	Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii saying, I can't wait until I get one of these.
3491899	3500123	I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.
3502223	3506445	We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.
3507245	3519590	My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.
3523052	3527395	Take Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.
3527415	3540664	This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that 20 are coming from Rockstar.
3540924	3542866	Of course, Take Two makes some of those games.
3543866	3546208	Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles.
3546755	3547155	We salute you.
3547175	3547376	Absolutely.
3547396	3548436	Where are the games for the Wii?
3573015	3573395	PC Gamer
3596008	3623796	uh inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows it's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue a display stand photographed on the Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming PC games Microsoft would not confirm um but they said they didn't really have any current plans on that however it was you know it was around discussing Windows Vista and the new things supported so it could happen
3626320	3632423	It should be also noted that that's, I think, that was the first issue of their name change, right?
3632443	3633804	Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?
3633844	3634744	Or am I mixing up magazines?
3634944	3635224	I don't know.
3636265	3636465	Is it?
3636525	3636665	No?
3636765	3637185	Okay.
3637785	3638306	Very interesting.
3638346	3642127	Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.
3643248	3644409	You think it's for real?
3644609	3646069	Think it would sell pretty good on the PC?
3646249	3646509	No.
3647150	3647350	No?
3647410	3647730	Why not?
3648090	3651672	Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.
3652563	3657684	Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based things.
3657824	3660265	There's one PC game that's selling right now.
3660685	3662145	It's called World of Warcraft.
3663585	3664646	Civ IV?
3664786	3669027	Black Boy says, by the way, it's computer gaming world that is now games for Windows, not PC gamer.
3669207	3669747	Oh, my bad.
3669887	3670107	Sorry.
3671767	3672547	I'll just be honest.
3672667	3674608	I'm not a huge PC gamer.
3674768	3680309	I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.
3681607	3682888	I like Mac games.
3684349	3685750	I'm playing one right now.
3686471	3689092	Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.
3690253	3692555	Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.
3693276	3693936	I need it.
3694717	3695897	No, I'm just teasing, of course.
3695917	3696498	I'm just teasing.
3696918	3703183	All right, let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.
3705685	3706125	Somebody said ooh?
3706145	3706205	Ooh?
3707227	3707847	I'm gonna call in.
3707947	3708727	I'm gonna call in right now.
3738308	3740349	Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?
3740849	3742931	I have been playing with my Wii all day long.
3743431	3744511	Have you been stroking it?
3745152	3745512	Yeah.
3745932	3748514	What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?
3749914	3757619	I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.
3759560	3760040	What do you think?
3761281	3763162	Wii Sports is fun.
3765244	3765604	It's cute.
3765644	3773130	It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or hit the putter or whatever.
3773950	3776912	I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.
3776932	3778053	Do you have friends?
3778133	3781535	Are you having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?
3782016	3784177	I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.
3784498	3784898	I see.
3784978	3790782	So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports when there's not a lot of people around.
3791371	3792312	Yeah, pretty much.
3792552	3794013	Well, you need to have a Wii Orgy, my friend.
3794513	3795154	I know, right?
3795474	3796034	Hey, Chris.
3796415	3796915	Yeah?
3797155	3797756	Want to come over?
3798436	3798776	Oh, yeah.
3799237	3799617	Right now.
3801758	3806922	I think you guys need to take this conversation offline, because we're going to have a lot of folks getting pretty hot about this.
3807242	3809264	What do you think about PlayStation 3 magazine?
3811865	3813126	That didn't sound too promising.
3814747	3816228	What's wrong with the PS3?
3816288	3817529	Why no love for the PS3?
3817589	3818330	Just too expensive?
3818350	3818430	Yeah.
3818934	3819835	Too expensive.
3820235	3826120	Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come out for it are out right now.
3826700	3830303	You know how I feel about Sony in general, so, meh.
3831103	3833605	Hey, Megzy, Megzy, what is your favorite color?
3834726	3835367	Lime green.
3836888	3837108	Yes.
3837348	3840270	Wait, wait, it says no good if you answer the question for her.
3840330	3840991	That's cheating.
3841451	3841691	No.
3841772	3844754	That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know...
3845365	3846646	Your favorite color is green.
3846706	3848747	This is the capital of California.
3849007	3849868	Sacramento, answer.
3850908	3852009	I don't get it.
3852889	3853209	All right.
3853430	3854150	I know her favorite color.
3854170	3857532	Megzy, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?
3858312	3861674	Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.
3861694	3862354	Ah, Smash Bros.
3862435	3862795	Brawl.
3863115	3866477	Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?
3867037	3873861	You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.
3874636	3875716	Hell yes.
3876296	3878537	He would make such a great Super Smash Bros.
3878557	3878957	character.
3879237	3884018	You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the virtual console, so you never know.
3884518	3885118	I heard that.
3885158	3886258	I was so excited.
3886478	3887279	I'll be very hot.
3887299	3888959	Yeah, she told me all about it.
3888999	3889419	Very hot.
3889759	3890079	All right.
3890479	3892940	Well, Maisie, any other thoughts for our listeners today?
3893500	3893800	Hey, Chris.
3893960	3894180	Chris.
3895480	3895680	What?
3896420	3898901	We totally owned those army guys down the hall.
3902077	3902718	Yes, we did.
3902758	3903598	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
3903738	3904118	I don't know.
3904178	3904919	I'll tell you later.
3904979	3906240	All right, tell me later.
3906640	3907380	Jamie says hi.
3907720	3907941	Amy!
3908041	3909301	I've got a microphone.
3909321	3909942	She heard me.
3910382	3910882	Oh, yeah, huh?
3912003	3915145	Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?
3915225	3916005	We have a weesom.
3916285	3917666	This show is growing a vagina.
3917686	3918787	I want to be part of the weesom.
3919427	3920428	Rob, you are a vagina.
3920908	3921929	All right.
3921969	3927752	No, we have the weird-looking, horn-shaped weesom.
3929400	3930081	I have no idea what that is.
3930141	3930561	All right.
3930901	3931522	Just look at the map.
3931642	3933224	Macy, thanks for calling.
3933584	3934825	Come back to California, you hear?
3935466	3935746	Oh, yeah.
3935946	3936207	All right.
3936307	3936667	Later, babe.
3936927	3937568	Bye, baby.
3937708	3938048	Bye.
3938949	3939270	All right.
3939950	3941792	Let's go to another phone call.
3941832	3943794	We'll go to this call right here.
3947758	3948879	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3948919	3949299	Who's this?
3950300	3951021	This is Ryoma.
3951281	3952422	I'm in the chat room right now.
3952703	3953343	Hi, Ryoma.
3953363	3954044	What's on your mind, buddy?
3955050	3961975	Um, I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting, um, with all the Wii stuff going on tonight.
3962175	3962696	Okay, what's up?
3962816	3966858	Um, I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.
3967379	3967619	Okay.
3968600	3970641	I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.
3971482	3972142	Yes!
3972202	3973563	Wow, how did that happen?
3973663	3977205	When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.
3977446	3977806	I was...
3978362	4004166	Like doing some kind of math homework And I was listening to Radio Disney Because I used to have horrible taste in music And so they were saying, hey Be careful, Chris still listens to Radio Disney And you're offending her, be careful But, so anyways Wait, wait, hold on, I'm so sorry Hey, come on Chris Zippity-doo-dah, zippity-ay Oh, sorry, okay Now this show is just Turning into a preschool Sorry, Ranma, finish the story
4004875	4005456	Don't worry about it.
4006196	4015406	But so anyways, they had this thing called the code word of the day, where if you remembered it and you were like the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the code word, you would win something.
4015787	4023335	And so like November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.
4023355	4027019	So I called in and I was the seventh caller and I got a GameCube.
4028208	4029269	Well, go you.
4029289	4031251	So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?
4031291	4032672	Does this just bring back memories?
4032752	4038497	It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away and it was Nintendo related.
4038797	4040418	Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight?
4040979	4041279	Yeah.
4041379	4042400	Did you enter the contest?
4044361	4045702	Yeah, I did.
4045963	4047044	Are you bitter that you didn't win?
4047544	4048225	I am very bitter.
4048625	4050106	Well, get over it.
4050126	4051127	I don't know what else to tell you.
4053449	4054490	I'm just messing with you.
4054530	4055330	You can try next time.
4055531	4056872	There might be something even better next time.
4056892	4057172	Who knows?
4057751	4059092	You can win a date with Rob.
4059933	4062255	Dude, okay, dude, hold on.
4062475	4063055	Not cool.
4063215	4068700	If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.
4068720	4069441	When you're 18.
4070682	4069441	15.
4071222	4072203	Okay, wait three years.
4072623	4074244	We'll wait for you.
4074665	4075045	Anyway.
4076606	4079649	Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?
4080829	4087833	Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my PSP.
4088533	4090054	You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?
4090634	4091995	Yes.
4092735	4094056	What goods do you have in your PSP?
4095437	4096697	I have nothing for my PSP.
4096917	4101159	It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.
4101720	4103241	You know what... How much are you selling it for?
4104321	4104841	I don't know.
4104881	4106342	However much GameStop takes it for.
4106362	4107423	Hey, hey, hey, you know what...
4108652	4112273	Talk to me online, like when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.
4113894	4116475	I know, you got two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.
4116535	4121117	Rob might have bought me, might have sold me on the PSP of Luminous 2, so we'll talk.
4121477	4122917	Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.
4123978	4127379	Oh, look at this, Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.
4127659	4128980	This might be good news for you, Ryoma.
4129680	4129880	Yes!
4130680	4133381	Alright, Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.
4134382	4134682	Alright.
4134782	4137103	Alright, have a good one, Ryoma, thanks so much for calling.
4137663	4137943	You too.
4138460	4142241	HitStun says don't sell things to GameStop.
4142561	4143121	Loki says $130.
4145322	4157266	I had a brand new PSP and I was just curious because I got one from a work promotion thing or something and I was like okay well let me see how much they're going to take it for.
4157646	4158266	I think they said like $130.
4159536	4160017	13 or something.
4160057	4162538	They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.
4163298	4166880	Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll take it.
4167040	4167760	We got another call.
4167800	4168941	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4168981	4169521	Who is this?
4170561	4171182	It's Ranma.
4171202	4171842	What's up, guys?
4171962	4172562	Hey, Ranma.
4172582	4173102	How you doing?
4176204	4177985	I saw your picture on Joystick today.
4178665	4179125	Sweet.
4179946	4181746	You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?
4182307	4182507	Yep.
4182667	4184528	Yeah, you know what the caption said on Joystick?
4184548	4185028	Did you see it?
4185703	4186343	No, I missed it.
4186423	4187064	Oh, you'll love this.
4187164	4189665	It said, here's a Super Mario brother.
4190785	4192186	Do you know what the funny thing is?
4192246	4197488	I was like, hey, Luigi's not black, and I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian, hey!
4198609	4202790	I'm Luigi, mother... You know what?
4202830	4204351	You're just having fun with it.
4204411	4207873	Who cares if you're not... Oh my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.
4208093	4210334	You can't dress up as Barret your entire life.
4210474	4213495	I mean, it's not your fault that, you know...
4214059	4215920	You're underrepresented in video games.
4215960	4218221	You could be 90% of the roster in NBA Live.
4218282	4219182	Shut up, John.
4219302	4221704	I just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.
4222784	4223264	There you go.
4223385	4223905	There you go.
4224005	4225726	Cosplay for the win.
4225966	4227047	Cosplay for the win.
4227487	4228307	All right, so what happened?
4228508	4229668	You were at the NYC.
4230048	4230589	Now, what happened?
4230609	4235472	Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped out at Nintendo World Store.
4235512	4235932	What happened?
4237194	4245696	The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures, you know?
4245777	4248537	People are like, Louise, let me get your picture, let me get your picture!
4248857	4250498	And people are shouting, where's Mario?
4250618	4254119	And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.
4260041	4260361	Wow.
4260781	4261761	Mario was getting his link on.
4262021	4265122	So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?
4265882	4267663	No, and I'm really pissed off about that.
4267703	4273647	Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping the damn line at Nintendo World.
4273968	4275569	They wanted it so badly.
4275769	4278931	I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.
4278971	4282794	I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time, playing the Wii.
4282874	4285215	Wait, were you originally planning on getting a Wii?
4286076	4291219	Not really, because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come down, and I'm like, okay, sure.
4291680	4293501	So you were just going along for, like, moral support?
4294021	4294241	Yes.
4294521	4295122	Alright, well, that's cool.
4295680	4296521	Did you meet Reggie?
4296841	4297581	Did you meet my boss?
4298062	4299002	No, I did not.
4299883	4301084	I saw this hair.
4302725	4303546	He saw the hair.
4304766	4305627	There he is.
4305707	4307729	Oh, do we see a picture of him on Joystick?
4308009	4310150	What are you doing to that poor woman, Ranma?
4310390	4310791	Oh, there it is.
4310851	4313433	It says, Folks love this Super Mario brother.
4315134	4316275	Because you're a brother, get it?
4317956	4318256	All right.
4318769	4319469	Rob, you're going to be mad with me.
4319489	4319569	Why?
4319589	4320229	I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.
4349702	4351223	Get up on him, traitor.
4352164	4354566	They asked for me, and I'm like, okay, sure.
4354686	4356728	I didn't know until after the fact.
4356888	4358249	Did you pimp our show?
4358349	4359510	Did you have a button on?
4359530	4360851	I had nothing.
4360871	4363193	I was just caught on right there.
4363233	4364794	No, no, no.
4365214	4365675	It's fine.
4365915	4367036	Do we really want that crowd?
4367056	4372500	I mean, people that are still watching G4, do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?
4372600	4374281	So, Ranma, enjoy your 15 minutes.
4375342	4376043	I always do.
4376103	4377123	Tick-tock, tick-tock.
4377143	4377684	Clock's tickin'.
4378314	4379355	But here's the thing, though.
4379996	4382939	I wake up getting ready to line up to get the wheeze.
4383079	4384000	I turn around.
4384140	4389505	There's like 150 people that jump in line because they have everybody lining up up against the street.
4389605	4390346	Didn't they have cops?
4390366	4391687	Didn't they have the NYPD out there?
4392328	4393629	Yeah, but cops didn't do nothing.
4393750	4395972	I mean... They should have had the LAPD.
4397053	4398694	They would have taught them a lesson.
4399555	4399836	And then...
4400547	4402829	One of the guys on the line started screaming, what the hell are you doing?
4402869	4403689	I turned around.
4403909	4407792	The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.
4407892	4409353	I'm like, what the hell, dude?
4409553	4411635	He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.
4411755	4413916	I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.
4414176	4415337	Nobody was changing.
4415857	4423883	I want to say I saw some video on Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of us.
4423963	4424663	It was crazy.
4424683	4425944	That's exactly what happened.
4426204	4427285	Rama, I got to end this call.
4427305	4428546	Any other final thoughts for us?
4430214	4433356	I still have your wee Miklatov You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN
4457065	4463070	Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had to oblige him.
4463250	4464991	I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.
4465732	4469735	I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.
4470715	4471836	Can you tell us his name on air?
4471896	4474118	No, I'm not going to.
4475219	4478722	But we all know now, see, if you work with Mikotov, you know that he has a crush on one of his co-workers.
4478762	4480123	No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.
4480423	4480943	What's on your mind?
4482524	4485747	I just wanted to say how amazing the Wii is.
4486645	4488146	and how much I'm big in Zelda.
4488446	4490227	You are loving the Wii and Zelda?
4490687	4492388	What's so great about Zelda in your mind?
4493509	4505775	Well, I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you go into the Twilight World for the first time and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.
4506035	4507196	Even without component cables?
4508657	4510978	Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.
4511078	4513279	I will be picking them up once they come in.
4515075	4517897	I can make do with this for another month.
4518537	4519318	It's still beautiful.
4519718	4520999	What else did you pick up besides Zelda?
4521039	4521319	Anything?
4523720	4528964	Oh, I got some Wii points and I picked up Solomon's Key.
4528984	4529844	Is that what it was?
4530004	4530945	Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.
4531786	4533547	Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.
4533587	4534848	I forgot how awesome that was.
4534928	4538410	It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up very soon, hopefully.
4538891	4539431	You know what?
4539691	4546033	As soon as I get a Wii Classic controller, I will be taking up SimCity because that's actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.
4546553	4549254	I'll probably lend you a GameCube controller.
4550674	4552975	Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.
4553995	4555736	Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?
4556216	4556716	That's good.
4556736	4558916	Because I have like 50 of them.
4560357	4562858	She's offering to let you borrow a GameCube controller.
4564458	4565298	Oh, yeah.
4565658	4566178	Thank you.
4566699	4568219	Well, now you have a reason to come up again.
4569315	4570536	Yeah, well, I always have a reason.
4571797	4575920	I'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.
4577642	4580204	Shane says he'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.
4582165	4582546	Tomorrow.
4583847	4584447	Thanksgiving.
4585969	4588250	I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway.
4589291	4590352	I'm going to be gone.
4590592	4591833	I'm going to be gone during the next show.
4591933	4594095	Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?
4595216	4596257	Well, I'm actually going to
4596823	4600365	Go have it with Extifer's family because his mom invited me.
4601025	4601805	How about that weekend?
4602966	4603466	That weekend?
4603546	4603966	Totally.
4604287	4607908	Okay, I will bring you a GameCube controller.
4608208	4608829	Not cool.
4608849	4610269	I'm going to be gone all next weekend.
4610289	4612470	I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.
4612891	4613971	And you can play it on my TV.
4615952	4616292	Cool.
4616532	4616792	All right.
4616892	4618733	Do you want to throw one other thing in real quick?
4618793	4619414	Yes, yes.
4619454	4620014	If I could.
4620791	4626357	Okay, I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.
4626617	4626778	Why?
4626818	4627198	What happened?
4627218	4639692	They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III, and they promised Wii Classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.
4640559	4649446	and I'm sick of going in there and them forcing me to, not forcing me, but pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked in the store and they sell everything $5 higher.
4649706	4652028	So, they can suck it and I hate them.
4653329	4655090	Do I have an offer for you?
4655531	4661435	We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.
4661936	4663497	Yeah, okay.
4663557	4670122	To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they, you know, I don't know about the Lost, you know,
4670652	4672974	I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just
4683271	4687414	GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.
4710174	4713075	It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.
4713155	4719217	I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management, so they can all bite my ass.
4719777	4720838	The employees are awesome.
4720918	4722719	Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.
4723279	4724379	Left cheek or right cheek?
4724619	4725039	Both.
4725119	4729341	With a flaming corncob stuck up it.
4729541	4730721	Wait, what, Miklotov, what?
4732042	4735323	Everybody go buy Sneak King, because Sneak King is the best.
4735463	4736964	We're going to line right now.
4737244	4737704	Seriously.
4738519	4742502	I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball cheap.
4742622	4745745	This show is not for you to hock your games on.
4746045	4748086	Okay, we'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.
4748627	4749628	Talk about it later, Shane.
4749668	4750128	We gotta go.
4750608	4750849	Okay.
4750909	4751349	Alright, bye.
4751389	4752250	Fine, whatever.
4752370	4753310	I gotta play Zelda.
4753391	4753671	Bye.
4753711	4753971	Bye.
4754031	4754752	I'll send you a message.
4755852	4757093	Yeah, send him a WeMail.
4757494	4758014	Exactly.
4758134	4759555	That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today.
4759575	4760276	It was WeMail.
4760536	4761357	Hey, I'll tell you what.
4761377	4768082	You friend me on the WeCons thing because we do have a thread going on in the OLR Army forum.
4768967	4770028	If you do, friend me.
4770328	4771609	I will send you a bunch of memes.
4771689	4772229	Oh, snap.
4772790	4773810	Oh, well, here we go.
4773850	4774451	Here's another call.
4774491	4775952	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
4775972	4776312	Who's this?
4777172	4779153	Obviously, the one and only Legend of Sakurama.
4779574	4780294	Obviously.
4780935	4782195	Now, you're in New York City, too.
4782255	4785597	Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?
4786258	4786818	I stayed home.
4787038	4787879	That's all I have to say.
4788119	4788639	You stayed home?
4788659	4789320	Why?
4789700	4791681	Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?
4792421	4794443	No, I didn't want to deal with it.
4794483	4797505	I've already seen the massive lines for the PS3 around my way.
4798877	4808836	I'd just rather just take a break Yeah, but those were quote-unquote business people Oh, yeah, the greed monsters Alright, what possessed you to call in tonight, Zagu?
4810099	4819941	You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like 30 seconds of just stomping on a soft pad.
4820061	4830144	I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped the shark already, something to that effect.
4830704	4833924	But I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch Total Request Live.
4834024	4836365	So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?
4837008	4837729	Good thing you didn't.
4838249	4841992	They made him play Fallout Boy and they only showed it for 30 seconds.
4842933	4849938	And from what I hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had a play on Softpads.
4850639	4852420	And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?
4853641	4856063	No YouTube link as far as I know.
4856323	4856623	Really?
4856844	4859726	And it's a good thing because it's just not worth it.
4860326	4862508	But on the other hand, but on the flip side, it's just,
4863109	4869194	It might draw more people into DDR because if they see Fall Out Boy on a dance pad, they'll drive into it.
4869895	4876200	I don't know, it's kind of... It's basically... Some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target of it.
4876260	4883165	The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls, thank you.
4883206	4885547	Alright, but think about it.
4886808	4888470	There's no need to think about it.
4888610	4891072	You don't have to... Look,
4892817	4901260	I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we gotta wrap it up, because we gotta start ending this show, because we're running, like, super long tonight, but how do you feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?
4902200	4902641	Overall.
4903541	4905041	I mean, it really depends.
4905141	4921447	Some of it might be, like, stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much of, you know, of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only play the game, but also live lives, and have, you know, and make friends out of the thing.
4922455	4924436	DDR is not just about arrow stopping.
4924476	4930981	It's about, you know, in certain ways, you meet people and you make, you know, make good and long friendships out of it.
4934223	4935364	I was going to say one other thing real quick.
4935384	4940787	Whatever happened to La Machina del Bailar or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie about DDR?
4941047	4942268	That just randomly crossed my mind.
4942488	4943129	Whatever happened to that?
4943589	4944009	I downloaded it.
4944049	4946671	I've actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.
4947172	4947312	And?
4947952	4950074	What I heard is, like, they didn't even...
4951345	4963251	I don't know, they kind of like, I wouldn't say they bastardized it, but from what I hear, they only played like the demo mode is just about, you know, the whole story was revolving about just winning this competition.
4963632	4971656	Would you say that La Machina del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food restaurants?
4972657	4972997	Maybe.
4973017	4975318	10K commotion in the movie.
4975358	4977139	I would say it's more like you got served.
4977859	4978520	Alright, fair enough.
4978840	4980161	Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
4980201	4980841	Have a good one, buddy.
4981573	4982453	Alright, peace out.
4982634	4982874	Bye.
5003743	5009427	First off, I'd like to start by saying there's this one post on GoNintendo.com.
5009947	5017431	They actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii because apparently his company did not hook him up.
5019553	5020273	I just thought it was funny.
5021181	5027844	To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see on the TV.
5028204	5029145	No, it's not his fault.
5029405	5033427	But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like we did?
5034247	5034507	Maybe.
5034527	5035388	I don't know.
5036068	5045833	Anyways, so of course amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3, the Boston Mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino,
5046790	5057558	is going to charge Sony for the police manpower that it took to basically bring this whole chaotic situation to order.
5058379	5059500	So I thought that was kind of funny.
5061881	5065624	WePlay has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S.
5065864	5068166	in January, according to Reggie.
5068566	5073310	And that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a
5073854	5076995	controller for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.
5077915	5088559	And then some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360 apparently aren't 720p when they say they are.
5088919	5093260	The resolution's a little bit less than that, which I think is kind of interesting.
5093280	5094220	You kind of get gypped there.
5094240	5101583	Let's see, Killzone 2's going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.
5102023	5103003	Not a big surprise there.
5104069	5114057	EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction policy.
5114478	5120883	It says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites, and those websites are making money by selling advertising.
5121443	5126307	They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.
5126667	5132972	I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going to be able to access content they want.
5133561	5136003	To be honest though, I think that's still stupid.
5136483	5137043	Dumb excuse.
5138304	5140246	Um, let's see here.
5141927	5147911	Ken Kuduragi, um, said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network storage system for the PlayStation 3.
5149031	5149712	And he's crazy.
5150853	5158998	Um, CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you, um, buy a 40 inch HDTV, um, you get the reserve of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.
5160079	5160199	Um,
5162208	5162929	Oh, the PlayStation 3.
5163149	5164629	This was the best one I read this week.
5165409	5172512	Apparently, if you do have an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i.
5172632	5173452	Instead, it will downscale it to 480p.
5182810	5184051	Which I thought was very interesting.
5184131	5193719	So if you have just a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for the PlayStation 3.
5194640	5199724	And by the way, the HDMI for the PlayStation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is interesting.
5200425	5204468	And then finally, a couple last ones here.
5205271	5215153	Sony's Vice President of Marketing was talking about the Crying Babies commercial that they have for the PlayStation 3 and basically saying it's like a rough shot test.
5215714	5220135	Whatever you think about the commercials, what you think about the PlayStation 3.
5220435	5225956	So I guess my take on PlayStation 3 would be I don't get it and it's slightly creepy.
5227616	5231297	Also, apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense.
5231337	5234678	I've noticed that with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.
5235145	5236225	I could see that, I could see that.
5237046	5239146	And then finally, the last one.
5239787	5240947	Didn't you say that on the last one?
5242027	5242648	Forget it, forget it.
5243448	5243728	Shut up.
5243908	5246169	Okay, this is the very last one.
5247409	5258533	Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.
5258974	5262815	Apparently a nearby apartment
5263351	5267754	I had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain their line.
5268174	5268715	Oh, God.
5268955	5282304	And it says, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young girls became underage, or apparently underage girls, and somebody called the cops.
5282344	5288729	They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3, apparently, or whatever the F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.
5290650	5291751	Alrighty, anything else?
5292955	5293255	Anyone?
5293775	5294056	Anyone?
5294296	5294516	Wow.
5295416	5295596	Yes?
5296077	5296437	DMN?
5297097	5298318	I motion to adjourn.
5298798	5299058	All right.
5299458	5299898	I agree.
5299958	5301319	I think it's time to wrap up the show.
5301339	5302420	We've been running very long tonight.
5302480	5310724	So thanks, of course, to all you guys who download us in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.
5310744	5311724	You guys are awesome.
5311764	5312605	We love you very much.
5313685	5315166	And thanks, of course, to our guests.
5315786	5317687	DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way from Seattle.
5317707	5318627	Again, thank you for having me.
5318647	5319328	I had a great time.
5319608	5320608	Chris, thank you for being here.
5320628	5321669	And, of course, thanks again for...
5322205	5324086	Horring Out Orange Lingerie the way you did last night.
5324506	5324926	No problem.
5324986	5325486	I enjoyed it.
5325506	5326206	Thanks for having me on.
5326386	5326866	No problem.
5327346	5330187	And of course, thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always.
5330227	5332608	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5332628	5333448	We'll start with our guests.
5333608	5334548	DMN, your final thought.
5335829	5336469	I'm hungry.
5338309	5339329	Chris, your final thought.
5340790	5341450	I'm not hungry.
5341490	5342370	I just had a donut.
5344491	5345851	DarkSakura, your final thought.
5346651	5349132	Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.
5350819	5355221	My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.
5355701	5356062	Cry.
5356442	5356742	Loki.
5357342	5359043	I don't want any more orange soda.
5361064	5364686	I've already had four cans of it and that's... More orange soda.
5366267	5369408	Alright, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.
