0	24160	All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 209 for this November
24160	26160	the 19th of 2006.
26160	31360	Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend,
31360	36760	or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out or a current gen user who's not upgrading
36760	40480	to next gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this
40480	41960	program.
41960	45960	We here at Orange Lounge Radio are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving
45960	50600	away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off part B.
50600	54340	If you want to know the details, you have to listen to part A. Remember Orange Lounge
54340	57560	Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.
57560	61880	There's part A, which comes out on Monday, and part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday
61880	64360	instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.
64360	65960	Our chat room is eagerly standing by.
65960	68980	This is something special we did for our live listeners only.
68980	72780	We only advertise this on our live journal and our MySpace communities, so if you want
72780	76920	to find out about future contests before anyone else does, you might want to sign up.
76920	81000	Live journal, our user name is Orange Lounge, and on MySpace we're MySpace.com slash Orange
81000	82000	Lounge Radio.
82000	84040	All right, we should stop stalling, huh, DMN?
84040	85040	Yeah.
85040	86040	God.
86040	90080	DMN, AKA John, is just doing this out of the goodness of his heart, so there's no other
90080	91080	reason for it.
91080	93400	All right, let's stop, let's stop stalling.
93400	94400	Let's get to the winner.
94400	95400	All right, here we go.
95400	99600	I'm now going to pull up random.org, so John, you're going to be picking, I'm pulling 10
99600	104160	random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away, and he is going to tell me which
104160	107320	one of the 10 numbers I'm picking right now.
107320	108320	Rob?
108320	109320	Yes.
109320	112840	Whatever email is number six on that list.
112840	115080	One, two, three, four, five, six, oh, this is great.
115080	117440	All right, guess what number six is?
117440	120280	It was email number 37.
120280	121280	In a row?
121280	122280	In a row?
122280	123280	Yeah, I know how it's coming.
123280	124880	All right, let's count them out, and I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR
124880	125880	or any of that stuff.
125880	132840	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen,
132840	137400	eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty, thirty-two,
137400	141080	thirty-four, thirty-six, here it is, thirty-seven.
141080	144760	Oh, look who won it.
144760	145760	Let's give them...
145760	146760	Oh, they're going to be...
146760	147760	Oh, I'm...
147760	148760	You know what?
148760	151480	This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.
151480	154060	This person is going to be very excited.
154060	155960	Let's give them a call right now.
155960	159600	All right, let's give them a call right now.
159600	161640	It's connecting.
161640	166080	Yeah, it's ringing right now, boys and girls.
166080	167080	Let's hope it works.
167080	168080	Here it goes.
168080	169080	It's ringing.
169080	171080	It's ringing.
171080	172080	Hello?
172080	173080	Hi.
173080	175080	Did somebody order a pizza?
175080	176080	Hi.
176080	177080	We're kidding.
177080	178080	Is this Raven's Dolphin?
178080	180200	Just kidding.
180200	182440	This is Orange Lounge Radio calling.
182440	183440	You just won a Wii.
183440	184440	Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
184440	185440	No, you won the Wii, my friend.
185440	186440	We're kidding.
186440	187440	No, no, no.
187440	188440	You just won it.
188440	189440	Oh, my God.
189440	190440	I won a Wii.
190440	191440	Yep.
191440	192440	You won the Wii, my friend.
192440	193440	Oh, my God.
193440	202920	Dude, I've got to say, I'm jazzed for you, calling to this show all the time.
202920	204640	And for once, we're Skyping you.
204640	207960	And for once, we're calling you to tell you that you won a Wii.
207960	208960	You did it.
208960	210840	You were emailed number 37 in the inbox.
210840	212560	Oh, my God.
212560	213560	So you did it.
213560	214560	I'm literally speechless.
214560	215560	I know.
215560	218540	I'd go crazy, too, if I were you.
218540	220120	So congratulations.
220120	223000	So what are you going to do with your Wii?
223000	224720	Do you already own a Wii?
224720	225720	No.
225720	226720	No.
226720	227720	Sort of.
227720	228720	What?
228720	229720	Sort of?
229720	230720	What does that mean?
230720	231720	All right.
231720	232720	I do.
232720	233720	But I have plans for this.
233720	234720	Oh.
234720	235720	What's the plans for this?
235720	236720	All right.
236720	240920	I was going to do something similar to DMN, but I won a Wii.
240920	241920	I'm happy about that.
241920	244920	The question is, I'm not going to go on an eBay.
244920	245920	Good.
245920	251280	Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.
251280	252280	That's very generous.
252280	253280	That's very cool.
253280	254280	That's very cool.
254280	256560	So someone's going to get it.
256560	257560	That's awesome.
257560	261160	Well, congratulations, Ravenstaufen.
261160	263180	We need to get in touch with DMN.
263180	264880	You know my personal email on the site, right?
264880	268600	Just send me an email and we'll get your shipping address and get it taken care of, all right?
268600	270320	Oh, one more thing, Rob.
270320	271320	Yes.
271320	272320	Long time you on the line.
272320	273320	Yes.
273320	274320	Rayman's Raven Rabbits.
274320	275320	Yes.
275320	276320	Give me one.
276320	277320	What about it?
277320	278320	Rayman's Raven Rabbits.
278320	279320	What about it?
279320	288160	All right, there's this DDR team that you drum this deck with it and you beat the little
288160	293520	rabbits to death, and it reminds me so much of you, and I enjoy it because they play girls
293520	297320	that want to have fun, and it's such an enjoyable.
297320	298320	Gee, thanks.
298320	299320	All right.
299320	301640	I haven't played that mini game yet.
301640	302640	I'm sorry.
302640	303640	Yes, you did.
303640	304640	That one?
304640	305640	Would girls just want to have fun?
305640	306640	No.
306640	307640	When we played the one with the...
307640	308640	It was Misery Loo that played.
308640	309640	Yes.
309640	310640	But we played that one.
310640	311640	All right.
311640	312640	Raven's off.
312640	314960	We've got to get back into the show, but thanks so much for entering and supporting Orange
314960	317160	Launch Radio, and now we're giving something back to you.
317160	318160	Oh, my gosh.
318160	319160	All right.
319160	320160	I can't believe I won.
320160	321160	All right.
321160	322160	Have a good one.
322160	323160	Have a good one.
323160	324160	See you back.
324160	325160	All right.
325160	328480	And of course, everybody in our chat was very bitter over the fact that he may or may not
328480	330680	already own a Wii, but you know what?
330680	332220	Hey, it's fair and square.
332220	333220	We said it in front.
333220	336340	Whoever wants to enter the contest can, and it sounds like he's got really good plans
336340	341280	for the Wii that he's going to give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas
341280	342280	time.
342280	343280	So you know what?
343280	344280	I can't argue with that.
344280	345280	That's going to be great.
345280	346280	You guys stop being Scrooges.
346280	347280	That's right.
347280	348280	You guys are just Scrooge.
348280	349280	You're bitter.
349280	351520	You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.
351520	355060	So just, you know, maybe next time.
355060	358640	We got other stuff to give away and I've come to see your bundle of flip.
358640	359640	Oh, you know what?
359640	361440	Oh, I was going to tell people about this.
361440	367480	If you've been reading the forms, it's going to be ongoing, you know, whenever it happens,
367480	370080	but we're going to have a new contest called early release.
370080	375880	Get your mind out of the gutter where we get games a little early where I work.
375880	382880	So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now announcing games and we'll probably
382880	385300	do the same thing as we did here.
385300	389960	Like if a game comes out, like, you know, I think we may start it either next month,
389960	394040	either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare because a lot of people
394040	395240	love that.
395240	398880	We're going to give away the game before it comes out so you can rub it in people's faces.
398880	400640	I played it before it came out.
400640	401640	Bitches.
401640	402640	All right.
402640	403640	We'll look forward to that.
403640	406920	So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance
406920	407920	later on.
407920	410200	And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going
410200	412120	to have some cool stuff for you guys too.
412120	414640	We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really
414640	416960	catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.
416960	421680	So anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.
421680	425760	Let's go back to the show, shall we?
425760	428200	And talk about some more gaming news.
428200	431200	All right, let's.
431200	437240	So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving, and we all know it comes after Thanksgiving
437240	442040	other than, you know, falling asleep from overeating Black Friday.
442040	445680	And of course, you know, with Black Friday there's always going to be, you know, great
445680	448000	deals on games and stuff.
448000	451100	And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.
451100	455400	They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.
455400	463520	For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Table
463520	469480	Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store
469480	470740	before noon.
470740	475360	And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.
475360	480920	Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4,
480920	484600	and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.
484600	485600	So that's not bad either.
485600	487440	I mean, those are some pretty good games.
487440	489440	Full Auto is fun.
489440	490440	All right.
490440	494040	Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are
494040	496560	taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.
496560	500900	You know, I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging
500900	501900	you to do it.
501900	505960	I don't know if people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia, it's pretty rad.
505960	510760	But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia,
510760	516080	and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 11111, or Sony sucks
516080	520440	and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 111DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia
520440	521440	to add a...
521440	522440	The hell I have.
522440	527760	Ken Kutaragi's Bio PS eats crayons, or maybe it's Macy, who knows.
527760	531800	So anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down.
531800	537400	They've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony, for until further notice, so that
537400	542960	you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user, I'm assuming of some standing
542960	546520	there on Wikipedia, because if you're registered, then they can track what you do and give you
546520	549160	the ban of death, the ban hammer.
549160	551120	Isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii?
551120	552120	Ban hammer?
552120	553120	No, project hammer, I know.
553120	555080	Whatever happened to project hammer?
555080	557840	I remember hearing about that at E3, but where did it go?
557840	558840	Oh, next year.
558840	559840	All right.
559840	566720	So anyway, be good when you're editing Wikipedia articles, or else you'll get the project hammer
566720	569680	slammed on you by the staff at Wikipedia.
569680	575440	Well, not that it has too much to do with hammers, but I guess you could take it that
575440	577640	way.
577640	580960	Guess what game's coming out on PSP?
580960	581960	Super Mario Brothers?
581960	582960	Luminous 3.
582960	585440	No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.
585440	586440	Really?
586440	595680	In Rising Star Games Evolution series, those are the PSP remakes, their DS ones are Revolution,
595680	599360	and it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.
599360	606440	Should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about
606440	607440	it.
607440	611960	And for anyone who's bitching that it was not on DS, yeah, it was.
611960	615160	You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?
615160	616160	I thought it was Rainbow Stars.
616160	617160	That's the one that you shoot?
617160	618160	That's Parasol Stars.
618160	619660	Okay, I'm sorry, I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbows.
619660	620660	I love Rainbow Islands.
620660	622040	That's the one that you shoot the rainbows.
622040	623040	Yeah, that's fun.
623040	624920	I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.
624920	628720	See, I universes actually have it on Turbo Graphics, but I would love to have a hand-held
628720	629720	Parasol Stars.
629720	635320	Well, I mean, technically I do, since I have one of the portable Turbo Graphics.
635320	639520	But I would love to have it on, you know...
639520	642120	But Rainbow Islands is the classic.
642120	644000	Not as many people play Parasol Stars.
644000	647640	You know I have to ask this question though, will I be able to get past level 30?
647640	653540	Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe
653540	658440	eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might
658440	662840	function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.
662840	668120	Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangeonserator.com said almost the same thing I did when I said
668120	669120	it.
669120	671020	It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?
671020	672280	So very cool.
672280	674480	Rama agrees, Paracel Stars owns.
674480	679480	I think the first time I ever saw Paracel Stars, I want to say was on Supercade or whatever
679480	680480	that game show.
680480	681480	No, Supercade.
681480	682480	Ultracade?
682480	683480	No, the game show.
683480	684480	God, Starcade.
684480	687320	No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.
687320	689060	Starcade was the name of that show.
689060	691600	They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good, remember?
691600	693480	That was a great show.
693480	698240	When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starcade.
698240	699740	It was awesome.
699740	701360	That's just craziness.
701360	702360	Crazy.
702360	703360	Craziness.
703360	704360	Crazy.
704360	706800	Okay, maybe not that crazy.
706800	716480	Anywho, okay, so of course with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.
716480	722360	And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.
722360	731080	You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.
731080	736720	And they have a wonderful little application to easily install it on there for you.
736720	739800	So homebrew on 2.8.
739800	743540	I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly
743540	748620	upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.
748620	752280	Are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?
752280	753440	Have you been following this at all?
753440	754440	No, I just keep upgrading.
754440	756440	You just keep upgrading?
756440	758520	It's kind of lost now, wanting to do the whole NES games on this.
758520	760880	I just don't care anymore.
760880	762920	I don't hardly play.
762920	768100	I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.
768100	772400	The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out, but really
772400	775920	I mean that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.
775920	779760	I still like my PSP for like web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading
779760	784760	shows and playing Luminous, of course, but I don't know.
784760	787480	Somebody was telling me, John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the
787480	789120	PSP's a done deal in 2007?
789120	790120	Yes.
790120	792920	Even with all the PS3 support?
792920	793920	It doesn't matter.
793920	794920	It's gimmicky.
794920	795920	No, no, no.
795920	796920	This is honestly what I'm thinking.
796920	800760	Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to
800760	806440	like the Big Daddy console, it sucked, and with the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.
806440	811060	The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.
811060	813020	Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?
813020	814020	They could.
814020	815200	I doubt it.
815200	817880	I mean it would be nice to see something like that work.
817880	823760	I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be
823760	824760	cool.
824760	827360	I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.
827360	828360	We shall see.
828360	833180	Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that
833180	838320	pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back
838320	839320	anyway.
839320	844680	Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?
844680	850640	You buy a DS regular, oh, here comes the DS Lite, oh, here it comes in prettier colors,
850640	851640	right?
851640	852640	Right?
852640	853640	This happens all the time.
853640	854640	Well, guess what?
854640	858240	You knew this was going to happen when you saw those pictures of the Wiis at E3, and
858240	862800	then suddenly you saw the Wiis in the different colors, and then now you only have the white
862800	863800	Wii, right?
863800	869000	Well, sure enough, it is, now this is kind of a rumor, but Game Daily, who originally
869000	876640	reported this, gamedaily.com is saying this is confirmed, that Nintendo of America confirmed
876640	881800	that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii,
881800	887240	will be coming to the U.S. sometime during 2007.
887240	892600	Let's see, there's something, quote, Sonic Cineplayer CE DVD Navigator will be bringing
892600	897320	high-quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.
897320	901720	So kind of interesting, so we already know there's probably going to be a souped-up Wii
901720	903320	somewhere in 2007.
903320	905720	But it's going to be more than $249.99.
905720	909440	I would say it might be, you know, in the mid-300 dollar range.
909440	919840	One billion dollars, not really, but you know, is that many people going to want to get this
919840	920840	just for DVD playback?
920840	921840	I mean, it's...
921840	922840	I don't think so.
922840	923840	Who cares?
923840	924840	I'm not.
924840	925840	I have several DVD players.
925840	927400	I have 60 that works just fine as a DVD player.
927400	931020	I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD
931020	933080	player, and you know, an upscaling DVD player.
933080	934080	Why do I want...
934080	935640	I have a five-disc changer in my living room.
935640	936640	You want a cookie?
936640	938640	No, I want a donut, though.
938640	939640	Okay.
939640	940640	No, not really.
940640	943840	Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to
943840	945000	my main TV.
945000	948120	Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand, doesn't know what the right hand
948120	949320	is doing.
949320	952600	So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there, they don't
952600	954880	know what each other's doing.
954880	955880	Interesting.
955880	956880	All right.
956880	958080	Well, we'll see.
958080	961000	Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?
961000	962000	No.
962000	963000	No.
963000	966480	Now, what if they sweetened the pot with some, like, maybe different colors, like maybe
966480	969960	get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory?
969960	970960	Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?
970960	974640	If they get a pink Wii, they're buying that for my girlfriend, because that's all she's
974640	975640	going to want.
975640	977640	I want the pink Wii!
977640	978680	It's so cute!
978680	984000	If it were a big black Wii, maybe.
984000	990360	Just inserting the media into the pink slot is, you know.
990360	994480	I just want you to put this card in my pink Wii slot.
994480	997000	Wow!
997000	998140	Upgrade my memory!
998140	999140	Upgrade my memory!
999140	1001400	Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?
1001400	1004000	How about some UK release dates?
1004000	1006940	All right, sure, why not?
1006940	1009000	We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.
1009000	1010000	Let's show them some love.
1010000	1012180	Dark Sakura, love them all right now.
1012180	1015680	Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.
1015680	1021360	Asphalt Urban GT2, Bionicle Heroes on multiple systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty
1021360	1025560	Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets!
1025560	1026560	Come out over here!
1026560	1028560	Hell fucking yes!
1028560	1032520	Aragon's coming out on damn near everything based off of the unintelligible book of the
1032520	1033520	same name.
1033520	1039080	Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.
1039080	1044600	Hotel Duskroom 2-15, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix,
1044600	1048600	Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Fantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Arrival
1048600	1054600	Swords, Race the Official WTCC Game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns
1054600	1059760	the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff
1059760	1061440	that has unconfirmed dates.
1061440	1062440	Excellent.
1062440	1063440	Cool.
1063440	1069560	Anyways, for the US, we're getting quite a bit of stuff, and of course got to start everything
1069560	1072360	off with our wonderful exclusive information.
1072360	1076880	So starting with a few price drops actually, and I'm not too surprised by this, but NBA
1076880	1083480	Live 07, they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats, the 360 is now
1083480	1085480	$39.99.
1085480	1091320	I guess NBA Live 07 really didn't sell that well, so that's interesting.
1091320	1097000	Blazing Angels has been delayed for the Wii to March 14th, and then finally not really
1097000	1103240	game related, but Final Fantasy Advent Children, the collector's gift set, with a bonus DVD,
1103240	1111720	script and postcards will be coming to your favorite video outlet on February 6th.
1111720	1114000	So that'll be pretty fun.
1114000	1119520	Now for game release dates of course, the big game of course this week would be Superman
1119520	1126920	Returns, and that's coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems, and
1126920	1128200	some of my favorite games though.
1128200	1129360	Can I interrupt real quick?
1129360	1130360	I'm sorry.
1130360	1131360	Did anyone play the demo?
1131360	1133720	Because I heard the demo went to live this week, and I haven't heard a lot of chat about
1133720	1134720	it.
1134720	1138060	I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.
1138060	1142080	I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look
1142080	1143080	that bad.
1143080	1144080	It looked pretty awesome.
1144080	1147640	I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.
1147640	1153760	I watched someone stack cars, and that was pretty funny.
1153760	1157800	Another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally
1157800	1162200	coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.
1162200	1167680	If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will
1167680	1172360	be coming out on the 360, Africa, the kind of Africa I like.
1172360	1173760	How about Jambo Safari?
1173760	1175640	Give me that again.
1175640	1182360	And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and the Xbox 360.
1182360	1186560	No one on the Playstation 2, for some reason that one was delayed to December, which is
1186560	1187560	very interesting.
1187560	1192120	And then Thrillville will be coming out on Playstation 2 and Xbox, and if you're a fan
1192120	1198480	of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.
1198480	1199960	That's basically the big stuff.
1199960	1201840	Get a bunch of crappy DS games.
1201840	1204280	I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.
1204280	1211400	I want to see some of the movie-based games, like Open Season and Barnyard.
1211400	1214200	Stuff you probably wouldn't want to pick up anyways.
1214200	1217360	I might if I had children.
1217360	1222600	I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me, Happy Feet has a DDR rip-off in it.
1222600	1225320	But Miklotov told me Happy Feet was the worst movie ever.
1225320	1226320	But I love penguins.
1226320	1228440	I know, it looks so cute.
1228440	1231240	I want to say Miklotov is full of evil, but I don't know.
1231240	1235240	Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming
1235240	1236240	out.
1236240	1242600	Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.
1242600	1244920	And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.
1244920	1245920	Hi there, Japan.
1245920	1246920	How are you guys doing?
1246920	1248440	You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.
1248440	1253040	On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, I know some of you guys are looking forward
1253040	1254040	to that one.
1254040	1257800	NBA Live 07, X-Men the official game, and you guys are getting the HD DVD player this
1257800	1258800	week.
1258800	1259800	This one made me squeal a little bit.
1259800	1261400	A lot of folks don't remember this game.
1261400	1262400	It was on the PS2.
1262400	1263400	It's called Cold Sept.
1263400	1266760	There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360, and it does look like it's
1266760	1270080	a sequel to the first game.
1270080	1273560	It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.
1273560	1276320	But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.
1276320	1281360	They have a trailer up on live for, it was during the E3 thing for that.
1281360	1284480	Oh, I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.
1284480	1286200	Cold Sept, hopefully it's coming out over here.
1286200	1287200	I'm sure it is.
1287200	1288200	Eventually.
1288200	1289200	Eventually.
1289200	1291880	It's coming out from Japan, which means it will be making its way over here somewhat
1291880	1292880	soon.
1292880	1295440	Well, hey, I got some kind of random dimension.
1295440	1296920	You know Disgaea?
1296920	1300720	They're actually starting up an anime series for that.
1300720	1303080	I thought that we reported on that a while ago.
1303080	1304480	Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.
1304480	1307040	I noticed it the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.
1307040	1308600	In case you didn't know.
1308600	1311280	Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.
1311280	1317640	Coming out on the PlayStation 2, hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drummania V2 coming
1317640	1320400	out this week.
1320400	1323600	Gonna cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into
1323600	1324600	their Guitar Freaks.
1324600	1326480	Darsakha, sound like something you might be getting?
1326480	1327760	Maybe, I don't know.
1327760	1330960	I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freaks since I have Guitar Hero.
1330960	1331960	Maybe.
1331960	1338200	Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation
1338200	1339200	2.
1339200	1341360	Let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?
1341360	1343500	Let's go to another system this week.
1343500	1352840	We have on the Nintendo DS, Minna no DS Karingu, and this is my favorite title of the week,
1352840	1354600	and I love the box art, too, as well.
1354600	1360160	It's like these two little, you know, kawaii girls there, making their little poses there.
1360160	1367160	The game is called Osare Majo Love and Berry, and it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo
1367160	1368160	DS.
1368160	1369160	It's a puzzle game.
1369160	1370160	It's a puzzle game.
1370160	1374120	Let's see, is that a game where you, you know, love somebody and then knock them off and
1374120	1375120	bury them in your backyard?
1375120	1379720	No, it's Berry, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.
1379720	1380720	Berry what?
1380720	1383240	Like cherry or dingleberry?
1383240	1386840	I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.
1386840	1387840	Is that the hentai game?
1387840	1388840	Is it a hentai game?
1388840	1395120	There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising, like, a hentai dating sim
1395120	1397360	for the DS.
1397360	1400660	We have to feel up girls to see who's a- No, that's a different game.
1400660	1403360	It's from Sega, and it's class- Oh, it's not Sega, then.
1403360	1406280	It's classified as puzzle, so I don't- I'll say one thing, it sounds right.
1406280	1407280	Touching is good.
1407280	1410960	The female body is a puzzle.
1410960	1412920	The female body is a puzzle, generally.
1412920	1417160	Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle, in a way, so that could be an appropriate
1417160	1418160	title.
1418160	1420160	I don't know.
1420160	1424000	Anyway, let's get back to the news.
1424000	1428120	Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.
1428120	1431760	There is a new demo- I'm excited already before you even mention
1431760	1432760	it.
1432760	1433760	Rob.
1433760	1434760	What?
1434760	1435760	Rob.
1435760	1436760	What?
1436760	1437760	Rob.
1437760	1438760	What?
1438760	1439760	Rob.
1439760	1440760	What?
1440760	1441760	Rob.
1441760	1442760	I will get- Rob.
1442760	1443760	Rob.
1443760	1444760	Rob.
1444760	1445760	I quit, I quit, I quit, I quit.
1445760	1446760	Rob.
1446760	1447760	Rob.
1447760	1448760	Can we keep this show moving, please?
1448760	1449760	What?
1449760	1450760	Attention!
1450760	1451760	What?
1451760	1452760	Quit dying of fire.
1452760	1453760	Okay.
1453760	1454760	Anyway.
1454760	1460360	A game coming out, it's actually a demo on Xbox Live.
1460360	1469660	There is a 360 demo of Cars, 450 megawatts of data, so you can play as Lightning McQueen
1469660	1471440	through Radiator Springs.
1471440	1472440	Ka-chow!
1472440	1473440	Ka-chow!
1473440	1474440	God dammit.
1474440	1478320	I must be a movie reference, I haven't seen a movie, so.
1478320	1485160	But anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland,
1485160	1486160	Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.
1486160	1494200	I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.
1494200	1498600	By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.
1498600	1501260	I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.
1501260	1504440	But the good news is, next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.
1504440	1506420	Now I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.
1506420	1509000	Are you excited about Cars on the 360?
1509000	1511120	Give me a mic.
1511120	1515480	You know what, actually I kind of am.
1515480	1521040	For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.
1521040	1525520	Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.
1525520	1530400	So I'm actually excited for it, because Meg Z is the biggest Pixar nut.
1530400	1535940	I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without picking out every little speck.
1535940	1539880	So I'm just excited that it's coming out, so I can kind of, I don't know.
1539880	1543460	She's a big Pixar fan, and her passion makes me excited.
1543460	1545240	So I'm looking forward to it.
1545240	1547240	I mean, Cars, come on.
1547240	1549640	That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.
1549640	1554080	Rob, we need to have a rainbow conversation.
1554080	1561040	SSG100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.
1561040	1569400	I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.
1569400	1572880	I can tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.
1572880	1574840	We beat people.
1574840	1579240	I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I
1579240	1582720	think we need to give Chris and Meg Z their own show where they just talk dirty to us.
1582720	1587880	We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast, kind of like Rance.
1587880	1589360	Jamie's going to be in on it.
1589360	1591360	Just call it Ask a Lesbian.
1591360	1593560	We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.
1593560	1598960	We've got to get back to games, games, games, games, games, games, games.
1598960	1605560	Anyway, so with the whole launches of the big systems and stuff, you've got the PlayStation
1605560	1611360	3 and Wii bundling going on, and one of those stores actually doing that would be Fry's,
1611360	1616800	and apparently some of their bundles, they were actually creating eight-game bundles,
1616800	1624560	and basically bundles as large as, you know, $1,080, $1,080, that's funny.
1624560	1629680	But anyways, so, I don't know, what do you guys think of these bundles, you know, forcing
1629680	1633080	people to buy eight games?
1633080	1637440	On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens, they want to make sure that
1637440	1641680	people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.
1641680	1646440	However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit, because if I want to go in there and buy one
1646440	1649720	console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.
1649720	1655260	I'll tell you why they do that, because margins on consoles suck.
1655260	1659600	Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck, especially
1659600	1660780	the accessories.
1660780	1666360	Their games are officially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit
1666360	1667360	this quarter.
1667360	1671280	Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show, something
1671280	1672660	kind of last minute that came up.
1672660	1677240	Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE
1677240	1680640	because he preordered a Wii, and then they forced a bundle on him.
1680640	1683760	But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle, he had to get like crap
1683760	1684760	games.
1684760	1690040	He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube, and I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube,
1690040	1694080	but I'm sure if you put in FYE and Wii, it'll come up there somewhere.
1694080	1695960	It's nothing but text telling his story.
1695960	1701120	It's kind of sarcastic, so that seems kind of low, to do that to pre-orders.
1701120	1704400	And something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.
1704400	1709960	Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the northwest somewhere where
1709960	1712320	they were trying to do something similar?
1712320	1717680	And it even opened up this investigation, and I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on trying
1717680	1722120	to think back that far, but I seem to recall that this bundling thing has been very much
1722120	1726760	frowned upon before, that you're kind of forcing consumers to buy these things together, so
1726760	1727760	huh?
1727760	1731320	Well, it's linked to the, apparently the YouTube link in our channel.
1731320	1734120	Oh, thank you, Bandit.
1734120	1737400	Rob White says, well, I don't shop much at FYE anyway.
1737400	1740520	Robert M. says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.
1740520	1742000	I know there should be, of course.
1742000	1745840	You know, I've got to say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.
1745840	1750520	I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot, and some of the third party, I mean,
1750520	1755000	yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise, SpongeBob type, well, I can't knock it till
1755000	1756480	I've played it, so whatever.
1756480	1759760	There's questionable content there at the launch.
1759760	1763040	Game 2 ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.
1763040	1767920	Yeah, but you know what, Cytruck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.
1767920	1773920	All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good, so I don't know.
1773920	1777240	Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch, all things considered, too.
1777240	1781240	With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out
1781240	1787880	that are just ports from last generation just kind of being enhanced a little bit, and you
1787880	1793200	know, you just got to notice them for what they are, and just don't buy them if you don't
1793200	1794200	want them.
1794200	1800520	Rob Way says, someday Nintendo will launch with Zelda and Mario.
1800520	1802960	That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?
1802960	1805280	Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.
1805280	1806280	I don't know.
1806280	1807280	Who am I to know?
1807280	1808280	Who am I to know?
1808280	1809280	I'm sorry?
1809280	1811400	I'm sorry?
1811400	1813520	They released Mario Bros. on the virtual platform.
1813520	1814520	Boo!
1814520	1815520	Boo!
1815520	1816520	Listen.
1816520	1817520	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1817520	1818520	You shut your mouth.
1818520	1819520	I love original Mario Bros.
1819520	1820520	Oh, bullshit, okay?
1820520	1824360	You put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.
1824360	1827280	To be fair, they've put it on every frickin' Advance title.
1827280	1832760	I am a little bit tired of it at this point, but I do love old school Mario Bros.
1832760	1833760	I mean, come on.
1833760	1834760	They're virtual.
1834760	1835760	Pow, pow.
1835760	1836760	Soccer and pinball.
1836760	1838840	Yeah, I know, I know.
1838840	1839840	That's fine.
1839840	1840840	Whatever.
1840840	1842840	The original Mario Bros., we've got to go in order.
1842840	1843840	That's fine.
1843840	1847440	Black Boy says, I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream
1847440	1848440	of games.
1848440	1852040	So, in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.
1852040	1853980	That certainly is fair, right?
1853980	1860120	You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline and Mario in the pipeline and Super Smash
1860120	1862320	Bros., absolutely.
1862320	1865880	It's a good marketing decision because if you release all these franchises at once,
1865880	1869240	yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the
1869240	1870240	road?
1870240	1875640	You're going to have Diddly-O or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.
1875640	1879600	You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.
1879600	1881400	It's a good business decision by Nintendo.
1881400	1886360	Nintendo wants to have multiple pleasure, yes, multiples.
1886360	1887360	Tantric game releases.
1887360	1888360	Yes.
1888360	1889360	Thank you.
1889360	1890360	That's a very good way to put it.
1890360	1891360	Giggity, giggity, goo.
1891360	1896080	Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Launch Radio tonight in the chat room.
1896080	1897080	Good for you, Black Boy.
1897080	1898080	Pat, pat, pat.
1898080	1899080	You got a gold star.
1899080	1900080	All right.
1900080	1901080	Okay.
1901080	1902080	All right.
1902080	1903080	That was a good comment.
1903080	1904080	It was a good comment.
1904080	1905080	All right.
1905080	1906080	Let's see.
1906080	1907080	Oh, going to the other end of this.
1907080	1908560	We're going from bundles to the other extreme.
1908560	1911540	Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?
1911540	1912540	This is interesting.
1912540	1916280	There are some numbers coming from Media Create.
1916280	1924320	Multiple hardware sales, they sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan, 45,000 approximately
1924320	1926560	of those were the 60 gig models.
1926560	1933040	But get this, they sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch
1933040	1941240	title, all the way down to Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies.
1941240	1942440	Poor Sega.
1942440	1951800	When you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.
1951800	1955040	That's less than one game of consoles.
1955040	1957520	And there's no bundle like there is with the Wii.
1957520	1960960	If these figures came out for the Wii, you could go, well, at least there's Wii Sports.
1960960	1965880	We talked to some people last night, so Drew Nami is sitting in the back going, eBay, maybe.
1965880	1968600	Or do people just really want a cheap Blu-ray player?
1968600	1969600	I don't know.
1969600	1970600	What do you think?
1970600	1971600	Dark Soccer?
1971600	1976320	Cheap Blu-ray player.
1976320	1978000	I don't know.
1978000	1982320	That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player
1982320	1984320	in Japan.
1984320	1985320	It makes sense.
1985320	1991280	I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.
1991280	1994160	What does the average Japanese gamer like to play?
1994160	1995160	RPGs.
1995160	1997020	There were none released at launch.
1997020	1998360	That's why there were no games sold.
1998360	2001000	But racing games are also hugely popular over there.
2001000	2004080	So Ridge Racer 7 should have been a big, big title.
2004080	2007160	Well, Ridge Racer is kind of the sun setting on that franchise.
2007160	2008720	It's not that good of a franchise anymore.
2008720	2010120	Oh, then it's Fightin' Words, though.
2010120	2012440	It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.
2012440	2013960	Yeah, that's about right.
2013960	2014960	Really?
2014960	2015960	That was the last.
2015960	2020600	The Ridge Racer 4 bundle with the Jogcon, best bundle ever.
2020600	2022240	Since then, nothing's topped it.
2022240	2027620	Except for having the Negcon when you play Wipeout.
2027620	2028880	I like 6.
2028880	2030560	I didn't love it, but I liked it.
2030560	2033120	It's all about Ridge Racer DS.
2033120	2034880	It's a really good deal now for 20 bucks.
2034880	2036520	All about Ridge Racer DS.
2036520	2037880	All right.
2037880	2040440	Act Def says Ridge Racer 5 is good.
2040440	2045040	Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.
2045040	2046880	R4 was the top of it.
2046880	2047880	All right.
2047880	2051760	Well, we've got a lot of opinions here tonight, and certainly you have some of your own, and
2051760	2055480	you like to email those to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2055480	2058840	And once a week, Dark Soccer likes to dive into Mailbag and pull out some of her favorite
2058840	2063880	emails to read to you here, live, on air, and it's called our Mailbag Segment.
2063880	2071200	Dark Soccer, take it away.
2071200	2072320	First email comes up.
2072320	2077000	These are sort of being read out of order that I received them, so I'm being random
2077000	2078000	today.
2078000	2079000	Ooh.
2079000	2080000	Hey, random.
2080000	2082680	First one comes from Robway.
2082680	2087400	I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.
2087400	2089000	Something bothers me in particular.
2089000	2092640	You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.
2092640	2096280	This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.
2096280	2099720	It more or less validates it, saying, we know you won't be able to get one, so buy your
2099720	2102080	games now and get the system off eBay.
2102080	2105560	This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the
2105560	2107580	things won't buy any games.
2107580	2113080	This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off at the same as a PS3 with no games.
2113080	2121960	I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.
2121960	2128040	Another one comes from AZHP, or AsHP, I guess I should say.
2128040	2129040	Dear Dark Soccer...
2129040	2130600	Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?
2130600	2133280	I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freakbook years ago.
2133280	2134280	I thought it was Asian hit points.
2134280	2135280	Oh, well, who cares?
2135280	2136280	Sorry.
2136280	2137280	Okay.
2137280	2138280	May I continue?
2138280	2141240	Yeah, so that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.
2141240	2144800	A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered
2144800	2147720	100 PS3s at 30 different stores.
2147720	2150720	I didn't believe him at first and then he sent me this picture and I'll link it in the
2150720	2151720	chat room.
2151720	2152800	I've seen this.
2152800	2155560	I want to say I saw it over on YouN00B.com.
2155560	2159920	They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.
2159920	2164880	Listen, with all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000
2164880	2165880	in a day.
2165880	2169120	Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm
2169120	2171840	not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.
2171840	2172840	Brace yourself.
2172840	2173840	Dirty.
2173840	2174840	Dirty.
2174840	2175840	Dirty.
2175840	2176840	Dirty.
2176840	2177840	Freaking ridiculous.
2177840	2178840	Oh, my God.
2178840	2182880	Why are you friends with such a lame-ass person, seriously?
2182880	2184780	I think it's a great idea.
2184780	2185920	You know what, though?
2185920	2187320	People are selling them on eBay.
2187320	2189680	You see an opportunity to make money, go for it.
2189680	2196000	If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.
2196000	2199700	That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like
2199700	2200700	that.
2200700	2201700	You know what?
2201700	2205120	The dumbasses are the ones that paid that kind of money for a PS3.
2205120	2210580	I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.
2210580	2212720	It's capitalism at work.
2212720	2213720	It's filthy.
2213720	2214720	It's disgusting.
2214720	2216780	Jamie, I think I have to agree.
2216780	2220940	If you've got the means to do it, that's what capitalism is.
2220940	2222760	It's playing off of people's stupidity.
2222760	2224380	It's fucking immoral.
2224380	2226320	Take this in a different direction.
2226320	2228080	Isn't this really risky?
2228080	2233100	I mean, because if the PlayStation 3s, the bottom fell out as they're saying is happening
2233100	2236340	on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going
2236340	2239940	to, this guy could stand to lose a poop-load of money.
2239940	2248680	I don't feel comfortable with the idea where I believe that stupid people who buy the systems
2248680	2249760	deserve what they get.
2249760	2252820	That was my next question, is how much is the buyer to blame in this scenario?
2252820	2257920	The buyer is very much to blame, however, I think being responsible for creating that
2257920	2265880	sort of situation is, I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.
2265880	2271980	I think it's really disgusting, you know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person
2271980	2273920	because they are greedy.
2273920	2278860	And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should
2278860	2280360	even be an option to begin with.
2280360	2284680	I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.
2284680	2286380	So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.
2286380	2287380	It's extortion, it is.
2287380	2289500	But if you're dumb enough to do it...
2289500	2294120	No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah,
2294120	2298880	if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked, however, the situation
2298880	2300680	should not exist to begin with.
2300680	2305720	Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't
2305720	2306720	sell it.
2306720	2309660	So either way, justice is done.
2309660	2312900	I got to read some interesting comments from Chat Room, of course, I got to read the smart
2312900	2314840	ass ones because this one made me laugh.
2314840	2321780	Alex of the OL Army says, with 100 PlayStation 3s you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia.
2321780	2328800	And Rob Way says, I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy
2328800	2331840	one PlayStation 3.
2331840	2336360	Rob Way says, I agree with extortion, it's very much like selling concert tickets over
2336360	2337360	cost.
2337360	2338360	Scalping?
2338360	2339360	Interesting.
2339360	2340360	Yeah.
2340360	2341360	All right.
2341360	2345640	You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, this should, making that much money
2345640	2351120	off your eBay sale should count as taxable income.
2351120	2355520	I would agree with that, but how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?
2355520	2357600	I don't, then that gets weird.
2357600	2358600	I don't know.
2358600	2361760	It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.
2361760	2365380	I just think that it's a sad state that our, you know, that our world has basically been
2365380	2366380	reduced to this.
2366380	2370520	You know, what happened to making a fucking honest living seriously?
2370520	2375800	What happened, what happened to going out and
2375800	2380560	Okay, Chris, repeat your comment though, cause I have a follow up.
2380560	2383480	That died a while ago, making an honest living.
2383480	2384480	It's obsolete.
2384480	2387840	But do you, do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free
2387840	2388840	donuts?
2388840	2389840	Why?
2389840	2395240	Wait, the making honest living is, that's what weirded people out?
2395240	2398360	Wait, I don't know how to say the questions, I was like, redo your question.
2398360	2401280	Cause you're saying it's a sad state of the world, you know, I'm just playing devil's
2401280	2402280	advocate here.
2402280	2404280	You're saying it's a, you know, it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people
2404280	2408080	buy into, so I'm thinking is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind
2408080	2412860	of like, they, they don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded
2412860	2418000	out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games
2418000	2419000	like them?
2419000	2420000	Oh yeah.
2420000	2426400	I mean, it's, this is the, I mean, I'm, I'm a very idealistic person.
2426400	2431200	I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit, but at the
2431200	2435000	same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.
2435000	2440560	It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that, all of that stuff in it, you know, and I can
2440560	2441560	try and be a nice person.
2441560	2443160	I mean, I am a nice person.
2443160	2447320	I'm sorry to say though, but just accepting it blindly is what basically produces this
2447320	2448320	behavior.
2448320	2452200	You know, just, just to give another, another perspective on this though, and then we'll
2452200	2454200	keep it moving.
2454200	2455200	What about eBay?
2455200	2457400	Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?
2457400	2459840	Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?
2459840	2460840	Oh no, I fully...
2460840	2463200	eBay makes the share of all these, they could end this if they wanted to.
2463200	2467480	Oh no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this too.
2467480	2470020	I just think that it's a dirty situation.
2470020	2475820	The money is not, they're basically taking Sony's work and making a profit off of something
2475820	2479680	they had no involvement in.
2479680	2484000	They're basically, they're stealing somebody else's work.
2484000	2488680	Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2488680	2489680	If you want to comment.
2489680	2490680	Oh, Drew, last word.
2490680	2495480	It is a free market though, if they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.
2495480	2498960	If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much
2498960	2499960	money.
2499960	2500960	Alright.
2500960	2508520	And one thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?
2508520	2513880	We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time we should
2513880	2514880	probably keep it moving.
2514880	2517720	Do we agree though that it is unethical?
2517720	2521840	I don't want to say it's unethical, I think the problem is everybody's on a different
2521840	2522840	page.
2522840	2524040	I think so, we just have to agree to disagree.
2524040	2529200	I don't know, but my personal feeling is I feel like to me, and this is me personally,
2529200	2534000	I'm not going to judge you or whatever, you're going to do whatever you're going to do, but
2534000	2537240	my thing is I feel like it's the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's
2537240	2538240	stolen.
2538240	2540480	I don't know, to me that's...
2540480	2544600	I've said this before, if Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what
2544600	2548400	he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.
2548400	2551600	But that's you guys, that's between you and him, so.
2551600	2553720	Alright, we've got to keep it moving folks.
2553720	2555720	We have more emails?
2555720	2566640	Okay, we have, I'm only going to read a few more of them because we actually did get quite
2566640	2570460	a number of them in.
2570460	2577480	One of them is from AJ Twist, speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of
2577480	2578480	this email.
2578480	2584640	I work at KB Toys, I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month,
2584640	2586360	but they're having a big video game sale.
2586360	2589960	All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and
2589960	2590960	DS titles.
2590960	2591960	Cool, huh?
2591960	2595440	Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.
2595440	2596440	She told me no.
2596440	2599360	KB is trying to get away from selling video games.
2599360	2600360	I wonder why.
2600360	2605140	Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games cause people to break
2605140	2606140	into stores.
2606140	2610720	They are the most stolen item in a robbery, so now KB is trying to get rid of these games,
2610720	2614880	but they are keeping the Nintendo handhelds because they sell better to younger kids.
2614880	2618120	So there's an answer to all those people out there who are wondering about KB's lack of
2618120	2624200	good and new games, and new gen systems, but maybe there's a bigger explanation behind
2624200	2625200	it.
2625200	2630320	Yeah, I'll keep it simple, KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.
2630320	2635120	It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games, and I didn't
2635120	2636640	really think about it until I heard this email.
2636640	2640240	I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.
2640240	2644600	Yeah, it's like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB to
2644600	2645600	steal games from them.
2645600	2646600	There are KB's that are outside malls.
2646600	2647600	There was one.
2647600	2649160	There's plenty of strip malls.
2649160	2651200	Whatever, it's KB.
2651200	2654800	Last time, every time I walked past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.
2654800	2660840	I mean, seriously, it's like, you know, we've lost our lease sale, you know, all toys must
2660840	2661840	go.
2661840	2662840	That's what it always looks like.
2662840	2668920	Rob Roy says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.
2668920	2673320	It's all about the inflatable pools.
2673320	2678120	Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop
2678120	2679500	where there was a Wii.
2679500	2680920	I was so excited to see it.
2680920	2681920	It is small.
2681920	2688520	I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a
2688520	2692180	month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with a Nintendo's
2692180	2693360	Wii was there.
2693360	2696720	No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.
2696720	2700440	Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it, I've always wanted the first but never had time or money
2700440	2701440	to buy it.
2701440	2704760	I actually chose BeatMania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.
2704760	2708520	Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.
2708520	2712040	Freeze Pops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.
2712040	2714160	Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.
2714160	2716400	I've played it once and loved it more than the first.
2716400	2720720	I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.
2720720	2725340	I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking
2725340	2727080	better makes me a happy bunny.
2727080	2728080	I guess that's all for now.
2728080	2737160	Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.
2737160	2743080	Also to state, I am going to be posting My Little Pony Killer's letter in our forums
2743080	2748240	momentarily as my letter of the week, so as long as it will not be read, it will be on
2748240	2749240	our forums.
2749240	2750840	Make sure you go there and read it.
2750840	2759040	But our other really good email I got from Grin without a Cat is if we're all ready to
2759040	2760040	listen.
2760040	2761040	Uh-huh, I'm listening.
2761040	2762040	Okay.
2762040	2764040	John's making nasty motions at me.
2764040	2769120	Hey guys, I thought I'd let you know my thoughts on Gears of War, someone who's not into shooters
2769120	2770120	in a big way.
2770120	2774120	I did speak briefly with Sky about it on live, as I know it's a great game for fans of the
2774120	2778160	genre, but with the 10 out of 10 scores it's been getting, I was wondering if it was something
2778160	2779160	everyone should try.
2779160	2781040	I'm certainly not disappointed with the game.
2781040	2783920	It plays good, it looks good, it sounds good, but I don't think it's quite as good as a
2783920	2785360	lot of reviews have made out.
2785360	2790960	I can't see it becoming a milestone in gaming in the same way titles such as Mario 64, Ocarina
2790960	2795240	of Time, GTA 3, or Halo were.
2795240	2799860	It's still just a shooter, and there's not a whole lot of variety in what you'll be doing.
2799860	2807460	The story was a bit, well, non-existent, which I found surprising, as I had heard, they had
2807460	2810980	the guy who wrote the Halo novels to do it.
2810980	2814620	I've not read those books, but I heard they were quite good, so assumed having an actual
2814620	2819140	author to do the story might make it pretty decent, but there's just nothing there besides
2819140	2821600	a little blurb in the manual.
2821600	2825400	It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially
2825400	2830440	the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide and seek than a shooter.
2830440	2836160	In my first game, I was relieved my teammate, I was revived my teammate only to hear him
2836160	2839560	tell behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle
2839560	2841440	by a chainsaw.
2841440	2845000	I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters,
2845000	2848820	but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.
2848820	2850560	Keep up the good work, Gryn, without a cat.
2850560	2854000	I actually agree with the email that Gears of War, I think, is one of those games I think
2854000	2858720	you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the
2858720	2860160	shooter genre.
2860160	2865080	Be very careful about all this hype behind the game, because it's not for everybody.
2865080	2866080	Is it a good game?
2866080	2867080	Yes.
2867080	2868080	But is it for everybody?
2868080	2869080	No.
2869080	2870080	So try before you buy if you're curious.
2870080	2877520	And a fair warning, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10, it's ultimately
2877520	2881060	up to you if you're going to like the game or not, so definitely play a demo.
2881060	2883600	Don't ever let the hype sell the game.
2883600	2887760	I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.
2887760	2892500	Don't let the hype sell you a game, because it's not always going to be rewarding.
2892500	2896040	Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.
2896040	2898760	MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.
2898760	2900360	No demo on live.
2900360	2905360	So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other
2905360	2907000	big Xbox 360 games.
2907000	2911440	Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet, anyway.
2911440	2912440	Yeah.
2912440	2913440	All righty.
2913440	2916200	Any more emails for this week?
2916200	2917200	That's it.
2917200	2919560	And I've just posted up My Little Pony Killer's email in our forum.
2919560	2920560	Sweet.
2920560	2925680	If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundrader.com is the place to deliver
2925680	2927520	those lovely little messages.
2927520	2928520	Excellent.
2928520	2931620	Well, moving on, talking about the 360.
2931620	2936720	There's been one cool mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a
2936720	2941600	VGA AV out on it.
2941600	2947240	And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the
2947240	2953720	Xbox 360, as far as AV stuff goes, actually have all the pins for pretty much every video
2953720	2955600	format you'd possibly want.
2955600	2964080	So simply re-soldering some of the connectors to a VGA jack caused it to work.
2964080	2965320	So it's pretty simple.
2965320	2972800	There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it, and it'll save
2972800	2974840	you some money that way.
2974840	2976240	So that's pretty cool.
2976240	2978240	All right.
2978240	2984960	Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about controversial methods of
2984960	2989280	making extra money, but I think we can all agree this is a good thing.
2989280	2994700	The Entertainment Software Association, also known as the ESA, announced the proceeds from
2994700	2998480	their 2005 charity game pack.
2998480	3003960	It was a game pack that consisted of three games, Sony's ATV Off-Road Fury 2, Splashdown
3003960	3007480	Ride's Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.
3007480	3012480	They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.
3012480	3018360	They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.
3018360	3022080	Good job, ESA.
3022080	3031960	Good indeed, and also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda
3031960	3040760	artwork being sold from the old CDI games.
3040760	3048520	On the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devon, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction
3048520	3053200	with the original art that inspired these titles.
3053200	3061120	The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but had signed artwork, a letter from
3061120	3066700	the artist, a half a dozen CDI games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that
3066700	3070020	featured the Zelda titles.
3070020	3076280	The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.
3076280	3082480	Even though the mention of the Zelda CDI games made us verp a little bit, I think for the
3082480	3089200	Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so it definitely is something I'd want if
3089200	3094200	I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, crazed
3094200	3097920	Link fans.
3097920	3101640	Thank you.
3101640	3107240	We actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose, and it's
3107240	3108240	an interesting game.
3108240	3115320	It had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the, you know, young
3115320	3122280	girl on girl action going on there, but anyways, apparently, Rome's mayor is demanding a band
3122280	3131800	of Rule of Rose, apparently finds that the erotic themes are too strong, and that there's
3131800	3137320	no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says,
3137320	3140320	so I don't know.
3140320	3142440	I own that game?
3142440	3145200	I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.
3145200	3150200	I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy
3150200	3151200	vibe of it.
3151200	3153320	Was there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?
3153320	3158040	Yeah, it was very subtle, it wasn't like, you know, all of a sudden they just start
3158040	3162600	making out and like, getting it on, I mean, that's a little much, so.
3162600	3166720	You know when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like,
3166720	3170120	you know when little kids are like, doing stuff that they don't quite understand what
3170120	3176480	they're doing, they just, that's kind of the vibe I got, and it's not like they're, I mean,
3176480	3179760	it's really, really subtle, I mean, unless you're looking for it.
3179760	3182920	The only way this, you know, the only way this is ever going to get bandaged at least.
3182920	3184560	What it boils down to is that they're all gay.
3184560	3185560	Yeah.
3185560	3186560	I'm kidding.
3186560	3187560	You know what I mean?
3187560	3188560	The fat chick.
3188560	3189560	The fat chick was awesome.
3189560	3193560	Listen, the Pope, he no like either the Rule of Rose, okay, so.
3193560	3195600	He's not the mayor of Rome.
3195600	3197560	I don't care, he doesn't like Rule of Rose.
3197560	3202320	It doesn't matter if he's the mayor of, thank you, Captain Obvious over there in the corner.
3202320	3204160	The Pope's not the mayor of Rome?
3204160	3205160	No crap.
3205160	3209160	No, but he is the god of Rome.
3209160	3216200	Moving on to a completely different topic, maybe this is something you could drive around
3216200	3221760	Rome or any other city for that matter, Nintendo recently filed, well, at least back in August,
3221760	3224440	they filed an in-car gaming system.
3224440	3228760	It's called a car area network, and what it supposedly does, it beams game information
3228760	3230640	from the server to the game console.
3230640	3234760	The wireless network could be between your game server in the trunk and the game console
3234760	3235760	in the back seat.
3235760	3239920	It could also possibly download new games and do all those wireless updates like that
3239920	3241880	whole Wii Connect 24 thing.
3241880	3247860	The controller looks very similar to what we know as the virtual console classic controller.
3247860	3251880	Very interesting kind of thing to be marketing.
3251880	3256140	I hope they just don't promote driving or playing Wii or any of these type of games
3256140	3258760	while you're in the front seat of your car, because that's not good.
3258760	3261320	So it sounds like Skymall in your car.
3261320	3265700	Possibly, because they could probably do this on a plane too.
3265700	3266700	It would be easy.
3266700	3268840	I mean, if they patented it for the car, it would be easy to do it on the plane.
3268840	3274400	If there's anything wireless involved on the plane, then they really can't do it.
3274400	3276280	It does interfere with the controls.
3276280	3280320	I was trying to think how they do the satellite TV, maybe they did some type of satellite
3280320	3282000	thing, because some of the airlines have satellites.
3282000	3284920	You don't even have car satellite systems.
3284920	3286840	They got to do something too, because remember the...
3286840	3287840	How about drive?
3287840	3291740	Well, what if I have Bratz in the back seat?
3291740	3292740	Read a book?
3292740	3293740	Set it is.
3293740	3295800	I don't know what the DS is for.
3295800	3296800	Two DSs.
3296800	3301080	12 gauge, I don't know.
3301080	3302080	Or ferret.
3302080	3303080	Sedatives.
3303080	3304080	Ferret justice.
3304080	3305080	Ferret.
3305080	3306080	I don't...
3306080	3307080	No, no, no.
3307080	3309300	I don't hate children that much.
3309300	3310480	I just don't want any.
3310480	3311480	She loves them.
3311480	3312560	She wants to squeeze them until they choke.
3312560	3316400	And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't
3316400	3318240	be breeding shouldn't breed.
3318240	3321100	I am not in a position to take care of one right now, and those people shouldn't have
3321100	3322100	one either.
3322100	3323100	So there.
3323100	3324100	I don't want to buy my morals.
3324100	3325100	You practice what you preach.
3325100	3326100	I do.
3326100	3327100	Good for you.
3327100	3328100	God damn it, I do.
3328100	3329100	Do you want a cookie?
3329100	3330100	No, I want another donut.
3330100	3331480	I think we have donuts.
3331480	3332480	No.
3332480	3334480	I want a powdered donut.
3334480	3344920	Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, um, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday
3344920	3347400	just like everybody else.
3347400	3349380	They had less than we got.
3349380	3355160	They got 500 total for the entire country.
3355160	3356960	I can top that.
3356960	3358960	Hong Kong got 200.
3358960	3360080	Really?
3360080	3367360	So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries' worth of PS3s because
3367360	3368360	they got 750.
3368360	3371480	Well, did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?
3371480	3372480	It doesn't say.
3372480	3374720	Oh, that's too bad.
3374720	3377720	Did they have people pushing each other into flag poles like they did here?
3377720	3380880	Uh, no, they just probably strung them up from the light post.
3380880	3382320	I got a question.
3382320	3384320	How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?
3384320	3386320	I don't know.
3386320	3387320	A lot.
3387320	3390840	It had to have been the comparable amount.
3390840	3394600	Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.
3394600	3400640	They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China
3400640	3403760	are not that rich.
3403760	3409840	I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of
3409840	3417840	stupid to give them a system that is overpriced, so maybe that's why they got so little.
3417840	3419600	I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.
3419600	3425880	I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order, god damn it!
3425880	3427880	Anyways, wow.
3427880	3433600	So as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for
3433600	3434600	the Wii.
3434600	3435600	And that is the case.
3435600	3438280	The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.
3438280	3439280	Quiet, you!
3439280	3442440	Listen, I hear you sighing over there.
3442440	3444280	This is an accurate gripe, okay?
3444280	3449740	So they are not coming out until December 5th and probably later than that, and also
3449740	3454120	the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.
3454120	3458920	So you know what, to be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming
3458920	3462240	out either, but you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.
3462240	3466440	So I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight,
3466440	3469960	because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get
3469960	3470960	component cables.
3470960	3474300	I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.
3474300	3476280	You said it yourself on the show.
3476280	3478760	Loki, they're not coming out today.
3478760	3480720	You had to order them on Nintendo.com.
3480720	3483800	Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.
3483800	3488760	Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii, saying, I can't wait
3488760	3491760	until I get one of these?
3491760	3495840	I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me
3495840	3502240	for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.
3502240	3507280	We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.
3507280	3511080	My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote
3511080	3517440	detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's
3517440	3520520	dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.
3520520	3527520	All right, anyway, Take-Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.
3527520	3532720	This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like
3532720	3538720	myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that
3538720	3540280	20 are coming from Rockstar.
3540280	3543920	Of course, Take-Two makes some of those games.
3543920	3548400	Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles, already has a date, October
3548400	3558640	16, 2007 in North America, and then, of course, 2K Sports has given NBA 2K7 and NHL 2K7, various
3558640	3565800	things across 2K, so good job, Take-Two, on keeping the games coming for the PS3 fans.
3565800	3567200	We salute you.
3567200	3568200	Absolutely.
3568200	3573920	Where are the games for the Wii?
3573920	3577520	There's already a ton of them on shelves, but we know there's more under development.
3577520	3579400	Yeah, but 2K doesn't make any of those.
3579400	3580880	Well, then, shame, shame.
3580880	3583960	If you're a 2K fan, maybe the Wii's not for you.
3583960	3591760	Well, continuing on, there actually is a leak out there stating that Gears of War may be
3591760	3594200	coming out on the PC.
3594200	3599360	PC Gamer inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows.
3599360	3602080	It's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue.
3602080	3607280	A display stand photographed on a Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming
3607280	3608840	PC games.
3608840	3615400	Microsoft would not confirm, but they said they didn't really have any current plans
3615400	3616400	on that.
3616400	3623360	However, it was around disgusting Windows Vista and the new things supported, so it
3623360	3626320	could happen.
3626320	3632280	It should be also noted that I think that was the first issue of their name change,
3632280	3633280	right?
3633280	3634280	Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?
3634280	3635280	Am I mixing up magazines?
3635280	3636280	I don't know.
3636280	3637280	Is it?
3637280	3638280	No?
3638280	3639280	Okay.
3639280	3640280	Interesting.
3640280	3642480	Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.
3642480	3644720	You think it's for real?
3644720	3646400	Think it would sell pretty good on PC?
3646400	3647400	No.
3647400	3648400	No?
3648400	3649400	Why not?
3649400	3652160	Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.
3652160	3657980	Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based thing.
3657980	3660780	There's one PC game that's selling right now.
3660780	3663800	It's called World of Warcraft.
3663800	3664800	Civ IV?
3664800	3668200	Black Boy says, by the way, it's Computer Gaming World that is now Games for Windows,
3668200	3669200	not PC Gamer.
3669200	3670200	Oh, my bad.
3670200	3671200	Sorry.
3671200	3674680	I'm going to be, I'll just be honest, I'm not a huge PC gamer.
3674680	3681520	I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.
3681520	3684240	I like Mac games.
3684240	3686120	I'm playing one right now.
3686120	3689680	Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.
3689680	3693120	Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.
3693120	3694120	I need it.
3694120	3695120	No.
3695120	3696120	I'm just teasing, of course.
3696120	3697120	I'm just teasing.
3697120	3699120	All right.
3699120	3703400	Let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.
3703400	3705040	Somebody said, ooh?
3705040	3707920	I said, ooh, because I'm going to call in.
3707920	3708920	I'm going to call in right now.
3708920	3709920	No, you're not going to call.
3709920	3710920	I'm not picking up your call.
3710920	3711920	All right.
3711920	3712920	Yeah, you can call in right now.
3712920	3721000	The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, so we're
3721000	3724840	going to head on over to the telephone and take some calls.
3724840	3725840	Hi.
3725840	3726840	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3726840	3727840	Who's this?
3727840	3728840	This is Meg Z.
3728840	3729840	Hi, Meg Z.
3729840	3730840	Hi, baby.
3730840	3731840	Hey.
3731840	3733960	You got through.
3733960	3736920	What's on your mind, my friend?
3736920	3738400	Wii.
3738400	3740760	Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?
3740760	3742920	I have been playing with my Wii all day long.
3742920	3743920	Yes.
3743920	3744920	Have you been stroking it?
3744920	3745920	Yeah.
3745920	3749680	What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?
3749680	3755400	I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing
3755400	3759600	Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.
3759600	3762240	What do you think?
3762240	3765320	Wii Sports is fun.
3765320	3766320	It's cute.
3766320	3771960	It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or
3771960	3773880	hit the putter or whatever.
3773880	3777520	I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.
3777520	3781920	Do you have friends that you're having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?
3781920	3784280	I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.
3784280	3785280	I see.
3785280	3791160	So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports, and there's not a lot of people around.
3791160	3792160	Yeah, pretty much.
3792160	3794440	Well, you need to have a Wii orgy, my friend.
3794440	3795440	I know, right?
3795440	3796440	Hey, Chris.
3796440	3797440	Yeah?
3797440	3798440	Want to come over?
3798440	3799440	Oh, yeah.
3799440	3800440	Right now.
3800440	3805720	I think you guys need to take this conversation off the line, because I know a lot of folks
3805720	3807560	getting pretty hot about this.
3807560	3811960	What do you think about PlayStation 3, Megzi?
3811960	3814840	That didn't sound too promising.
3814840	3816320	What's wrong with the PS3?
3816320	3817680	Why no love for the PS3?
3817680	3818680	Just too expensive?
3818680	3819680	Too expensive.
3819680	3824360	Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come
3824360	3826720	out for it are out right now.
3826720	3829600	You know how I feel about Sony in general, so meh.
3829600	3830600	Hey, Megzi.
3830600	3831600	Megzi.
3831600	3834760	What is your favorite color?
3834760	3835760	Lime green.
3835760	3836760	Yes.
3836760	3837760	Wait.
3837760	3838760	Wait.
3838760	3840480	It's no good if you answer the question for her.
3840480	3841480	That's cheating.
3841480	3842480	No.
3842480	3845480	That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know.
3845480	3846880	Your favorite color is green.
3846880	3849120	This is the capital of California.
3849120	3850120	Sacramento.
3850120	3851120	Answer.
3851120	3852120	I don't get it.
3852120	3853120	All right.
3853120	3854120	Sorry.
3854120	3855120	All right.
3855120	3856120	I know her favorite color.
3856120	3858600	Megzi, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?
3858600	3861120	Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.
3861120	3863240	Ah, Smash Brothers Brawl.
3863240	3867120	Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?
3867120	3874840	You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.
3874840	3876360	Hell yes.
3876360	3879340	He would make such a great Super Smash Brothers character.
3879340	3884120	You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the Virtual Console, so you never know.
3884120	3885120	We get tired.
3885120	3886120	I heard that.
3886120	3887120	I was so excited.
3887120	3888120	I'll be very hot.
3888120	3889120	Yeah.
3889120	3890120	She told me all about it.
3890120	3891120	Very hot.
3891120	3892120	All right.
3892120	3893440	Who are our listeners today?
3893440	3894440	Hey, Chris.
3894440	3895440	Chris.
3895440	3896440	Chris.
3896440	3897440	What?
3897440	3900240	We totally owned those army guys down the hall.
3900240	3902760	Yes, we did.
3902760	3903760	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
3903760	3904760	I don't know.
3904760	3905760	I'll tell you later.
3905760	3906760	All right.
3906760	3907760	Tell me later.
3907760	3908760	Megzi.
3908760	3909760	Jamie says hi.
3909760	3910760	Amy.
3910760	3911760	I've got a microphone.
3911760	3912760	She heard me.
3912760	3913760	Oh, yeah, huh?
3913760	3914760	Megzi.
3914760	3915760	Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?
3915760	3916760	We have our...
3916760	3917760	We have a Wii-some.
3917760	3918760	This show is growing a vagina.
3918760	3919760	I want to be part of the Wii-some.
3919760	3920760	Rob, you are a vagina.
3920760	3921760	All right.
3921760	3922760	No, no, no.
3922760	3927040	We have like the weird-looking horn-shaped Wii-some.
3927040	3930200	I have no idea what that is.
3930200	3931200	All right.
3931200	3932200	Just look at the map.
3932200	3933200	Megzi, thanks for calling.
3933200	3935200	Come back to California, you hear?
3935200	3936200	Oh, yeah.
3936200	3937200	All right.
3937200	3938200	Later, babe.
3938200	3939200	Bye, baby.
3939200	3940200	Bye.
3940200	3941200	Bye.
3941200	3942200	All right.
3942200	3943200	Let's go to another phone call.
3943200	3944200	We'll go to this call right here.
3944200	3945200	Hi.
3945200	3949000	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3949000	3950000	Who's this?
3950000	3951000	This is Riella.
3951000	3952720	I'm in the chat room right now.
3952720	3953720	Hi, Riella.
3953720	3955360	What's on your mind, buddy?
3955360	3960920	I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting with all the Wii
3960920	3962320	stuff going on tonight.
3962320	3963320	Okay.
3963320	3964320	What's up?
3964320	3967520	I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.
3967520	3968520	Okay.
3968520	3971000	I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.
3971000	3972000	Yes!
3972000	3973000	Wow.
3973000	3974000	How did that happen?
3974000	3977280	When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.
3977280	3982200	I was doing some kind of math homework, and I was listening to Radio Disney because I
3982200	3985440	used to have horrible taste in music, and so they were saying, �Hey, you�
3985440	3986440	Oh, be careful.
3986440	3988920	Chris still listens to Radio Disney, and you're offending her.
3988920	3989920	Be careful.
3989920	3990920	Wait, wait.
3990920	3991920	Hold on.
3991920	3992920	I'm sorry.
3992920	3993920	I'm so sorry, Riella.
3993920	3994920	Come on, Chris.
3994920	3995920	Oh, sorry.
3995920	3996920	Okay.
3996920	4002960	Now this show is just turning into a preschool.
4002960	4003960	Sorry, Riella.
4003960	4004960	Finish your story.
4004960	4005960	Don't worry about it.
4005960	4010560	But anyways, they had this thing called the codeword of the day, where if you remembered
4010560	4015880	it and you were the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the codeword, you would win something.
4015880	4021100	And so in November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they
4021100	4023400	were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.
4023400	4028360	So I called in, and I was the seventh caller, and I got a GameCube.
4028360	4029360	Well, go you.
4029360	4031400	So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?
4031400	4032400	Does this just bring back memories?
4032400	4037440	It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away, and it was
4037440	4038440	Nintendo-related.
4038440	4040640	Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight.
4040640	4041640	Yeah.
4041640	4042640	Did you enter the contest?
4042640	4044640	Yeah, I did.
4044640	4047400	Are you bitter that you didn't win?
4047400	4048720	I am very bitter.
4048720	4050160	Well, get over it.
4050160	4053360	I don't know what else to tell you.
4053360	4054560	I'm just messing with you.
4054560	4055600	You can try next time.
4055600	4057240	There might be something even better next time.
4057240	4058240	Who knows?
4058240	4060240	You can win a date with Rob.
4060240	4062600	Dude, okay, dude, hold on.
4062600	4063600	Not cool.
4063600	4068720	If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.
4068720	4069720	When you're 18.
4069720	4070720	Okay.
4070720	4071720	15.
4071720	4072720	Okay, wait three years.
4072720	4073720	We'll have the...
4073720	4074720	Anyway.
4074720	4075720	We'll wait for you.
4075720	4076720	Anyway.
4076720	4080200	Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?
4080200	4086480	Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going
4086480	4087480	to sell my PSP.
4087480	4091040	You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?
4091040	4092040	Yes.
4092040	4093040	Huh.
4093040	4095040	What goods do you have with your PSP?
4095040	4097000	I have nothing for my PSP.
4097000	4101760	It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.
4101760	4102760	You know what?
4102760	4104160	How much are you selling it for?
4104160	4105160	I don't know.
4105160	4106480	However much GameStop takes it for.
4106480	4107480	Hey, hey, hey.
4107480	4108800	You know what?
4108800	4109800	Talk to me online.
4109800	4113800	Like, when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.
4113800	4116480	I know you have two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.
4116480	4121440	Rob might have sold me on the PSP at Luminous, too, so we'll talk.
4121440	4123560	Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.
4123560	4125600	Oh, look at this.
4125600	4127720	Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.
4127720	4129040	This might be good news for you, Ryoma.
4129040	4130040	I'll sign you down!
4130040	4131040	Yes!
4131040	4132040	All right.
4132040	4133760	Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.
4133760	4134760	All right.
4134760	4135760	All right.
4135760	4136760	All right, have a good one, Ryoma.
4136760	4137760	Thanks for what you're calling.
4137760	4138760	You, too.
4138760	4139760	All right, later.
4139760	4140760	All right, have a good one.
4140760	4142640	Hitstunna says, don't sell things to GameStop.
4142640	4143920	Loki says...
4143920	4145640	You will get kind of jacked.
4145640	4146640	$1.30 for...
4146640	4153800	I had a brand new PSP, and I was just curious, because I got one from a work promotion thing
4153800	4156920	or something, and I was like, okay, well, let me see how much they're going to take
4156920	4157920	it for.
4157920	4160160	I think they said like $1.13 or something.
4160160	4162840	They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.
4162840	4163840	Ouch.
4163840	4166500	Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll
4166500	4167500	take it.
4167500	4168500	We got another call.
4168500	4169500	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4169500	4170500	Who is this?
4170500	4171500	It's Rama.
4171500	4172500	What's up, guys?
4172500	4173500	Hey, girls.
4173500	4174500	Hey, Rama.
4174500	4175500	How you doing?
4175500	4176500	Hey, everyone.
4176500	4178640	I saw your picture on Joystick today.
4178640	4180000	Sweet.
4180000	4182360	You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?
4182360	4183360	Yep.
4183360	4184360	Yeah.
4184360	4185360	You know what the caption said on Joystick?
4185360	4186360	Did you see it?
4186360	4187360	No, I missed it.
4187360	4188360	Oh, you'll love this.
4188360	4190840	It said, here's a Super Mario brother.
4190840	4192280	Do you know what the funny thing is?
4192280	4194360	Someone's like, hey, Luigi's not black.
4194360	4197600	I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian.
4197600	4198600	Hey.
4198600	4202320	I'm Luigi, motherfucker.
4202320	4203320	You know what?
4203320	4204440	You're just having fun with it.
4204440	4208120	Who cares if you're not, oh, my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.
4208120	4210360	You can't dress up as Barrett your entire life.
4210360	4216040	I mean, it's not your fault that you're underrepresented in video games.
4216040	4218200	90% of the roster in NBA Live.
4218200	4219200	Shut up, John.
4219200	4222840	I'll just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.
4222840	4223840	There you go.
4223840	4224840	There you go.
4224840	4225840	Cosplay for the win.
4225840	4226840	What?
4226840	4227840	Cosplay for the win.
4227840	4228840	All right.
4228840	4229840	So what happened?
4229840	4230840	You were at the NYC.
4230840	4231840	Now, what happened?
4231840	4234040	Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped
4234040	4235600	out at a Nintendo World store.
4235600	4237220	What happened?
4237220	4240760	The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find
4240760	4245400	some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures,
4245400	4246400	you know?
4246400	4248920	People are like, Luigi, let me get your picture, let me get your picture.
4248920	4250680	And people are shouting, where's Mario?
4250680	4256120	And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.
4256120	4258000	Wow.
4258000	4262080	Mario was getting his link on.
4262080	4265680	So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?
4265680	4267800	No, and I'm really pissed off about that.
4267800	4271680	Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping
4271680	4273800	the damn line at Nintendo World.
4273800	4274800	Ouch.
4274800	4275800	They wanted it so badly.
4275800	4278960	I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.
4278960	4282920	I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time playing the Wii.
4282920	4286220	Were you originally planning on getting a Wii?
4286220	4287220	Not really.
4287220	4288220	Oh, okay.
4288220	4290160	Because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come
4290160	4291720	down, and I'm like, okay, sure.
4291720	4293760	So you were just going along for, like, moral support?
4293760	4294760	Yes.
4294760	4295760	All right, well, that's cool.
4295760	4296760	Did you meet Reggie?
4296760	4297760	Did you meet my boss?
4297760	4299560	No, I did not.
4299560	4302760	I saw this hair.
4302760	4303760	He saw the hair?
4303760	4304760	There he is.
4304760	4305760	All right.
4305760	4306760	What?
4306760	4307760	Oh, do we see a picture of him?
4307760	4308760	Oh, that's great.
4308760	4309760	Somebody posted it in the chat there.
4309760	4310760	What are you doing with that poor woman?
4310760	4311760	I'm sorry.
4311760	4312760	Oh, there it is.
4312760	4313760	It says, folks love this Super Mario brother.
4313760	4316080	Because you're a brother.
4316080	4317080	Get it?
4317080	4318080	Ha, ha, ha.
4318080	4319080	All right.
4319080	4320080	Yeah, I know.
4320080	4321080	It's a great costume.
4321080	4323880	You know, when we made Dark Soccer, Loki and I had little hats, very similar to the one
4323880	4324880	he has on in that picture.
4324880	4328240	Or at least, well, you didn't make them, but you had them made by one of your friends or
4328240	4329240	something, right?
4329240	4330240	Yes.
4330240	4331240	Who made those?
4331240	4332240	My friend Carrie Wink.
4332240	4336600	She has a, she runs Wearable Wink, and she does all types of custom hats and cosplay
4336600	4337600	commissions.
4337600	4338840	Well, good job to you, Miss Wink.
4338840	4339840	I applaud you.
4339840	4342560	Hey, email me your information, I might have a commission for her.
4342560	4343560	God, I will.
4343560	4345560	Oh, Rob, you're going to be mad with me.
4345560	4346560	Why?
4346560	4349560	I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.
4349560	4351360	Shut up on them, traitor.
4351360	4352360	No.
4352360	4353360	They asked for me.
4353360	4354640	I'm like, okay, sure.
4354640	4356240	I didn't know until after the fact.
4356240	4358080	Were you, did you pimp our show?
4358080	4359600	Did you have a button on?
4359600	4360600	No.
4360600	4361600	I had nothing.
4361600	4362600	I was caught on right there.
4362600	4363600	No, no, no.
4363600	4364600	Don't, don't.
4364600	4365600	No.
4365600	4366600	Rama, it's fine.
4366600	4367600	Do we really want that crowd?
4367600	4368600	I mean, people that are still watching G4.
4368600	4369600	Exactly.
4369600	4370600	Do you really want them listening?
4370600	4372600	Do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?
4372600	4373600	No.
4373600	4375280	So, Rama, enjoy your 15 minutes.
4375280	4376280	I always do.
4376280	4377280	Tick tock, tick tock.
4377280	4378280	Clock's ticking.
4378280	4379720	But here's the thing, though.
4379720	4382960	I wake up getting ready to, you know, line up to get the wheeze.
4382960	4383960	I turn around.
4383960	4388800	There's like a hundred people that jump on because they have everybody lining up up against
4388800	4389800	the street.
4389800	4390800	Didn't they have cops?
4390800	4391800	Didn't they have the NYPD out there?
4391800	4392800	Yeah.
4392800	4393800	But cops didn't do nothing.
4393800	4394800	I mean.
4394800	4395800	They should have had the LAPD.
4395800	4399600	They would have taught him a lesson.
4399600	4402840	And then one of the guys on the line starts screaming, what the hell are you doing?
4402840	4403960	I turn around.
4403960	4408040	The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.
4408040	4409640	And I'm like, what the hell, dude?
4409640	4411440	He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.
4411440	4414200	And I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.
4414200	4415600	Nobody was changing.
4415600	4420940	I want to say I saw some video on, like, Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they
4420940	4423760	were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of
4423760	4424760	us.
4424760	4425760	It was crazy.
4425760	4426760	That's exactly what happened.
4426760	4427760	Rama, I got to end this call.
4427760	4430280	Any other final thoughts for us?
4430280	4431280	Fuck you, Sony.
4431280	4432280	All right.
4432280	4433280	Have a good one, Rama.
4433280	4434280	All right.
4434280	4435280	Don't hold back.
4435280	4438920	We have very, very angry people against Sony here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4438920	4439920	Well, let's see.
4439920	4441920	Maybe our next caller might have some good things to say about Sony.
4441920	4442920	Who knows?
4442920	4443920	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4443920	4444920	Who's this?
4444920	4446960	Like, I'd have good things to say about Sony.
4446960	4447960	Who is this?
4447960	4448960	This is Miklotov.
4448960	4450680	Oh, Miklotov, our old buddy.
4450680	4452080	I still have your wee Miklotov.
4452080	4453080	Mr. Miklotov.
4453080	4455680	You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN.
4455680	4462400	Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had
4462400	4463400	to oblige him.
4463400	4466160	I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.
4466160	4470800	I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.
4470800	4472280	Can you tell us his name on air?
4472280	4475280	No, I'm not going to, sorry.
4475280	4478040	But we all know now, see, if you work with Miklotov, you know that he has a crush on
4478040	4479040	one of his co-workers.
4479040	4480520	No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.
4480520	4481520	What's on your mind?
4481520	4488480	I just wanted to say how amazing the wee is and how much I'm big in Zelda.
4488480	4490800	You are loving the wee in Zelda?
4490800	4493960	What's so great about Zelda in your mind?
4493960	4500160	I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you
4500160	4506160	go into the Twilight World for the first time, and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.
4506160	4507640	Even without component cables?
4507640	4511000	Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.
4511000	4517720	I will be picking them up once they come in, but yeah, I can make do with this for another
4517720	4518720	month.
4518720	4519840	It's still beautiful.
4519840	4521400	What else did you pick up besides Zelda?
4521400	4522400	Anything?
4522400	4529960	Oh, I got some wee points, and I picked up Solomon's Key, is that what it was?
4529960	4531520	Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.
4531520	4533480	Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.
4533480	4535000	I forgot how awesome that was.
4535000	4537660	It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up
4537660	4538660	very soon, hopefully.
4538660	4539660	You know what?
4539660	4544240	As soon as I get a wee classic controller, I will be picking up SimCity, because that's
4544240	4546620	actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.
4546620	4547620	Very cool.
4547620	4550720	We'll lend you a GameCube controller.
4550720	4553640	Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.
4553640	4556360	Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?
4556360	4557360	That's good.
4557360	4558520	Because I have like 50 of them.
4558520	4563480	She's offering to borrow a GameCube controller.
4563480	4566160	Oh, yeah, thank you.
4566160	4568520	Well, now you have a reason to come up again.
4568520	4571200	Yeah, well, I always have a reason.
4571200	4577240	Anything that came in, I'll beat all the Silent Oaks for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.
4577240	4580880	Shane says he'll be all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.
4580880	4581880	Okay.
4581880	4582880	Tomorrow.
4582880	4583880	Thanksgiving.
4583880	4590520	I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway, so I'm going to be gone.
4590520	4591800	I'm going to be gone during the next show.
4591800	4594080	Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?
4594080	4600160	Well, I'm actually going to go have it with X to First Family, because his mom invited
4600160	4601160	me.
4601160	4603040	How about that weekend?
4603040	4604040	That weekend?
4604040	4605040	Totally.
4605040	4606040	Okay.
4606040	4607040	Four-day weekend.
4607040	4608360	I'm going to be gone during the GameCube controller.
4608360	4609360	Not cool.
4609360	4610360	I'm going to be gone all next weekend.
4610360	4611360	I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.
4611360	4612360	And you can play it on my TV.
4612360	4613360	Cool.
4613360	4614360	All right.
4614360	4619360	Well, I do want to throw one other thing in real quick, Rob, if I could.
4619360	4620360	Yes, yes.
4620360	4621360	Okay.
4621360	4626680	I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.
4626680	4627680	Why?
4627680	4628680	What happened?
4628680	4632840	They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III.
4632840	4640680	And they promised me classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.
4640680	4646760	And I'm sick of going in there and pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked
4646760	4647760	in the store.
4647760	4649560	And they sell everything five dollars higher.
4649560	4653380	So they didn't suck it, and I hate them.
4653380	4655560	Do I have an offer for you?
4655560	4661800	We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.
4661800	4663600	Yeah, okay.
4663600	4668680	To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they...
4668680	4675880	I don't know about the lost reserves, but if they don't get the stuff in when Sony tells
4675880	4680040	them or whatever they tell them they're going to get in, it's not their fault.
4680040	4683320	I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just...
4683320	4686640	You put up with so much from them, and then you're like, okay, that's just...
4686640	4690840	I know, but for someone who's dating someone who works at GameStop who constantly gets
4690840	4694400	harassed, it's like somebody comes and it's like, why don't you have this?
4694400	4695400	Why don't you have this?
4695400	4696400	And she's like, I don't know.
4696400	4697400	They didn't send it to us.
4697400	4699920	Well, it's not her fault.
4699920	4702080	There's a management or district...
4702080	4704680	It's just like how it changes from store to store.
4704680	4710280	And GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.
4710280	4713520	It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.
4713520	4718120	I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management.
4718120	4719800	So they can all bite my ass.
4719800	4721000	The employees are awesome.
4721000	4722960	Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.
4722960	4724640	Left cheek or right cheek?
4724640	4725640	All right, wow.
4725640	4726640	Harsh words.
4726640	4727640	Both.
4727640	4729640	With the flaming corn cob stuff up it.
4729640	4730640	Wait, what?
4730640	4731640	Meikle Top, what?
4731640	4734920	Everybody go by Sneaking, because Sneaking is the best.
4734920	4737640	All right, now Meikle Top, we're going to line right now.
4737640	4742700	Seriously, I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball Cheap.
4742700	4745240	This show is not for you to hawk your canes on.
4745240	4748740	Okay, well, I'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.
4748740	4749740	Talk about it later, Shane.
4749740	4750740	I got to go.
4750740	4751740	Okay.
4751740	4752740	All right, bye.
4752740	4753740	Fine, whatever.
4753740	4754740	I got to play Zelda.
4754740	4755740	Bye.
4755740	4756740	Bye.
4756740	4757740	I'll send you a message.
4757740	4758740	Yeah, send him a Wii mail.
4758740	4759740	Exactly.
4759740	4760740	That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today was Wii mail.
4760740	4761740	Hey, I'll tell you what.
4761740	4767240	You friend me on the Wii console thing, because we do have a thread going on in the OLR army
4767240	4769000	forum.
4769000	4772040	If you do friend me, I will send you a bunch of memes.
4772040	4773040	Oh, snap.
4773040	4774040	Oh, well, here we go.
4774040	4775040	Here's another call.
4775040	4776040	Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
4776040	4777040	Who's this?
4777040	4779880	Obviously, the one and only Legend of Zaku.
4779880	4780880	Obviously.
4780880	4782240	Now, you're in New York City, too.
4782240	4786160	Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?
4786160	4787160	I stayed home.
4787160	4788160	That's all I have to say.
4788160	4789160	You stayed home?
4789160	4790160	Why?
4790160	4792160	Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?
4792160	4793160	No.
4793160	4794440	No, I didn't want to deal with it.
4794440	4798240	I've already seen the massive lines with the PS3 around my way.
4798240	4800280	I'd just rather just take a break from it.
4800280	4803280	Yeah, but those were quote, unquote, business people.
4803280	4805200	Oh, yeah.
4805200	4806200	The greed monsters?
4806200	4807200	Oh, yeah.
4807200	4810160	What possessed you to call in tonight, Zaku?
4810160	4815540	You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like
4815540	4820360	30 seconds of just stopping on a soft pad.
4820360	4824520	I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I
4824520	4827860	teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped
4827860	4832800	the shark already, something to that effect, but I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch
4832800	4834080	Total Request Live.
4834080	4837080	So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?
4837080	4838080	Good thing you didn't.
4838080	4843360	They made him play Fallout Boy, and they only showed it for 30 seconds, and from what I
4843360	4848680	hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had to
4848680	4850680	play on soft pads.
4850680	4853680	And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?
4853680	4859440	No YouTube link, as far as I know, and it's a good thing, because it's just not worth
4859440	4860440	it.
4860440	4866560	But on the flip side, it might draw more people into DDR, because if they see Fallout Boy
4866560	4869720	on the dance pad, they'll drive into it.
4869720	4875920	I don't know, it's basically, some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target
4875920	4876920	of it.
4876920	4882720	The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls,
4882720	4883720	thank you.
4883720	4884720	All right.
4884720	4886840	But think about it, you can't-
4886840	4888640	There's no need to think about it.
4888640	4890640	You don't have to-
4890640	4891640	Look-
4891640	4895520	I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we've got to wrap it up, because we've
4895520	4898600	got to start ending this show, because we're running super long tonight, but how do you
4898600	4901600	feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?
4901600	4902600	Overall?
4902600	4905240	I mean, it really depends.
4905240	4911120	Some of it might be stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much
4911120	4916800	of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only
4916800	4922040	play the game, but also live lives and make friends out of the thing.
4922040	4927700	DDR is not just about arrow stomping, it's about, in certain communities, you meet people
4927700	4934120	and you make good and long friendships out of it.
4934120	4935440	I was going to say one other thing real quick.
4935440	4940040	Whatever happened to La Maschine del Bailar, or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie
4940040	4941040	about DDR?
4941040	4942040	That just randomly crossed my mind.
4942040	4943040	What ever happened to that?
4943040	4944040	I downloaded it.
4944040	4948000	I actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.
4948000	4955080	What I heard is they didn't even, I don't know, I wouldn't say they bastardized it,
4955080	4960320	but from what I hear, they only played, like the demo mode is just about, the whole story
4960320	4963760	was revolving about just winning this competition.
4963760	4971600	Would you say that La Maschine del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food
4971600	4972600	restaurants?
4972600	4977400	I would say it's more like you got served.
4977400	4978680	All right, fair enough.
4978680	4980240	All right, Zaku, we got to let you go.
4980240	4981240	Have a good one, buddy.
4981240	4982240	All right.
4982240	4983240	Have fun.
4983240	4984240	Peace out.
4984240	4985240	Bye.
4985240	4986240	I love our colors.
4986240	4988960	You guys are funny, but no more time tonight, I'm sorry to say.
4988960	4990680	So sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.
4990680	4995320	We're getting kind of hammered tonight, so sorry kids, I'll try again next week.
4995320	4997280	Late last minute stories here in studio.
4997280	4998520	Last minute stories.
4998520	4999520	Last call for alcohol.
4999520	5000640	I've got some quick ones.
5000640	5002280	I'll make them very, very quick.
5002280	5010000	Anyways, first off, I'd like to start by seeing, there's this one post on GoNintendo.com, they
5010000	5015600	actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii, because
5015600	5019480	apparently his company did not hook him up.
5019480	5021240	I just thought it was funny.
5021240	5027000	To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see
5027000	5028000	on the TV.
5028000	5029000	No, it's not at all.
5029000	5033080	But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like
5033080	5034080	we did?
5034080	5035080	Maybe.
5035080	5036080	I don't know.
5036080	5042040	Anyways, so of course, amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3,
5042040	5053240	the Boston mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino, is going to charge Sony for the police manpower
5053240	5061920	that it took to bring this whole chaotic situation to order, so I thought that was kind of funny.
5061920	5068600	Wii Play has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S. in January, according to Reggie,
5068600	5074440	and that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a controller
5074440	5078040	for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.
5078040	5085480	And then, some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360,
5085480	5090560	apparently aren't 720p when they say they are, and the resolution's a little bit less
5090560	5095360	than that, which I think is kind of interesting, kind of getting gipped there.
5095360	5102120	Let's see, Killzone 2 is going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.
5102120	5103960	Not a big surprise there.
5103960	5113400	EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction
5113400	5118280	policy, and it says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites,
5118280	5121520	and those websites are making money by selling advertising.
5121520	5126580	They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.
5126580	5131120	I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going
5131120	5133560	to be able to access content they want.
5133560	5139640	To be honest though, I think that's still stupid, dumb excuse.
5139640	5146440	Let's see here, Ken Kutaragi said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network
5146440	5151280	storage system for the Playstation 3, and he's crazy.
5151280	5157080	CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you buy a 40 inch HDTV, you get the reserve
5157080	5161480	of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.
5161480	5165780	Let's see, oh the Playstation 3, this was the best one I read this week.
5165780	5173240	Apparently if you do not have, or if you do have HDMI cables, or not HDMI, if you have
5173240	5180080	an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i, instead
5180080	5185640	will downscale it to 480p, which I thought was very interesting, so if you have just
5185640	5192920	a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for
5192920	5194720	the Playstation 3.
5194720	5199240	And by the way, the HDMI for the Playstation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is
5199240	5200240	interesting.
5200240	5208440	And then finally, a couple last ones here, Sony's vice president of marketing was talking
5208440	5213300	about the crying babies commercial that they have for the Playstation 3, and basically
5213300	5218200	saying it's like a Rorschach test, whatever you think about the commercials, which you
5218200	5224600	think about the Playstation 3, so I guess my take on the Playstation 3 would be I don't
5224600	5227760	get it, and it's slightly creepy.
5227760	5232080	Also apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense, I've noticed that
5232080	5234920	with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.
5234920	5237120	I can see that, I can see that.
5237120	5242040	And then finally, the last one, did you say that on the last one?
5242040	5243600	Forget it, forget it.
5243600	5244600	Shut up.
5244600	5247720	Okay, this is the very last one.
5247720	5255360	Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some
5255360	5259360	in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.
5259360	5267080	Apparently a nearby apartment had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain
5267080	5268080	their line.
5268080	5269080	Oh god.
5269080	5273640	This is, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young
5273640	5282400	girls became apparently underaged girls, and somebody called the cops.
5282400	5286080	They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3 apparently, or whatever
5286080	5289800	F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.
5289800	5292600	Alrighty, anything else?
5292600	5293600	Anyone?
5293600	5294600	Anyone?
5294600	5295600	Wow.
5295600	5296600	DMN.
5296600	5297600	Yes, DMN?
5297600	5298600	I motion to adjourn.
5298600	5299600	Alright.
5299600	5300600	I agree.
5300600	5301600	I think it's time to wrap up the show.
5301600	5305520	We've been running very long tonight, so thanks of course to all you guys who download us
5305520	5310800	in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.
5310800	5311800	You guys are awesome.
5311800	5312800	We love you very much.
5312800	5313800	Mwah, mwah.
5313800	5317560	And thanks of course to our guests, DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way to
5317560	5318560	Seattle.
5318560	5319560	Again, thank you for having me.
5319560	5320560	I had a great time.
5320560	5323000	Chris, thank you for being here, and of course, thanks again for whoring out Orange Lodge
5323000	5324120	Radio the way you did last night.
5324120	5325120	Oh, no problem.
5325120	5326120	I enjoyed it.
5326120	5327120	Thanks for having me on.
5327120	5328120	No problem.
5328120	5332320	Thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always, it's time to go around and get everybody's final
5332320	5333320	thought.
5333320	5334320	We'll start with our guests.
5334320	5335720	DMN, your final thought.
5335720	5337720	I'm hungry.
5337720	5340720	Chris, your final thought.
5340720	5341720	I'm not hungry.
5341720	5344640	I just had a donut.
5344640	5346840	Dark Sakura, your final thought.
5346840	5350840	Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.
5350840	5355800	My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.
5355800	5356800	Cry.
5356800	5361040	I don't want any more orange soda.
5361040	5365240	I've already had four cans of it, and that's more orange soda.
5365240	5369760	All right, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.
5369760	5370760	You guys rock.
5370760	5375720	Oh, next week on Orange Lodge Radio, I do not believe we're going to be live.
5375720	5377160	Did we already talk about that?
5377160	5378160	I'm not sure.
5378160	5379560	We're not going to be live during the holiday.
5379560	5381080	Yeah, we're not going to be live during the holiday.
5381080	5382440	Are we pre-taping?
5382440	5383440	I don't know.
5383440	5384440	We have to talk about that.
5384440	5385440	Yeah.
5385440	5386440	There'll be a pre-taping at some point.
5386440	5387880	You can go to our website, orangelodgeradio.com.
5387880	5390840	So sorry to our live listeners, but it is kind of a holiday weekend.
5390840	5392280	Some of us are going out of town.
5392280	5393840	And rejects false icons.
5393840	5394840	Thank you.
5394840	5398880	And yeah, have a great turkey day for those of you guys in the U.S. that celebrate that.
5398880	5404700	And certainly, we here at OLR are thankful for just you guys that support us and have
5404700	5407140	been spreading the word about our little program.
5407140	5410700	Like we said at the top of the show, we don't get paid for this yet.
5410700	5415040	We don't really get a whole lot of reward except for the fact that we get to meet other
5415040	5419800	geeks in the process, and it's pretty rad to know that we're not alone in our hardcoreness
5419800	5421040	for games.
5421040	5422040	So that being said, hmm.
5422040	5423040	Nothing.
5423040	5424040	Oh, okay.
5424040	5425040	That being said, have a great week.
5425040	5426040	We'll see you next time on OLR.
5426040	5427040	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
