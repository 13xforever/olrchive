WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.680
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.960
This is episode number 207 and letís get right back into it.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.360
We got more gaming news for you guys.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.360
Iím going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.

00:31.360 --> 00:37.720
The much anticipated fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st just like it was speculated

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
last week.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.280
We talked about that on this program.

00:40.280 --> 00:46.560
And whatís interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.520
And when we say bricked the console that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three

00:50.520 --> 00:55.200
red lights of doom to appear and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that

00:55.200 --> 00:56.200
cannot play games.

00:56.200 --> 01:01.160
It was said though that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
But I know we had a listener.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.520
I want to say it was Alex who was in our chat earlier saying he was one of the lucky less

01:05.520 --> 01:10.600
than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
to fix it.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.240
And Iím thinking that is messed up.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.240
Thatís not what I read.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.880
I read people were actually being able to send them back, but thatís pretty fucked

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
up that they wanted money.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.760
I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.620
The official quote from Microsoft did come from this, ìWe are hearing from a small number

01:25.620 --> 01:28.880
of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with a fall console update.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.000
Iíve been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.400
Weíll let you know when the issue is resolved.

01:33.400 --> 01:37.120
If youíre having problems with the update for any reason, please call XBox Support.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.200
Weíre working with those affected to get them back up and running and weíre committed

01:40.200 --> 01:46.040
to making sure the update doesnít cause problems for anyone else.î So donít take that $140

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
for an answer.

01:47.040 --> 01:51.520
No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing

01:51.520 --> 01:52.520
for you.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.480
They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.200
Especially since theyíre aware of the problem.

01:57.200 --> 02:01.080
Thereís no excuse for that.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.640
Black Boy in our chat room did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
got bricked.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.640
Good job.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.240
Thatís still a big number.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.520
Wow, thatís something else.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.880
They need to figure out how to un-brick them and fast.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.960
I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.

02:15.960 --> 02:16.960
I donít know.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.280
Thatís kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that, but I donít

02:20.280 --> 02:22.280
know the technical end of it.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.980
Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was, Eragon, the demo

02:27.980 --> 02:36.200
for that is available on Xbox Live, itís a 415 megabyte download, so you can check

02:36.200 --> 02:37.200
it out.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.400
My problem with the book is that the book, as far as Iíve gotten through it, is so very

02:40.400 --> 02:45.440
poorly written, it reads like it was written by a 12-year-old, so hopefully the game is

02:45.440 --> 02:49.180
better than how poorly written the book is.

02:49.180 --> 02:50.720
The demoís not better at all.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.280
Itís absolutely crap.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.640
The demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?

02:54.640 --> 02:58.840
Yeah, and Iím not sure if youíve played it, but if youíve played Konamiís King Arthur,

02:58.840 --> 03:02.040
itís about the same level of crap, and thatís really bad.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.000
Itís boring hack and slash.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
That sounds pathetic.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.200
I donít even know what this game is about.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.560
I know thereís a movie, but Ö

03:08.560 --> 03:14.740
Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that heís a dragon rider and gets pulled

03:14.740 --> 03:21.520
into all the dragon-riding nonsense and everything, but to defend the writer of the book, I did

03:21.520 --> 03:28.860
hear that he did start it in his teens, but thatís what beta readers are for, use them,

03:28.860 --> 03:35.320
which the entirety of the fan fiction writing community should also know that, too.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.160
But I donít see why the book got all this attention and why theyíre making a movie

03:40.160 --> 03:41.160
of it.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.520
I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
Yeah.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
I saw them recently, also.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
Itís sad.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.160
So the game is just hack and slash?

03:48.160 --> 03:53.240
Thatís as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted, and it wasnít

03:53.240 --> 03:54.240
fun.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.840
It looked like a PS2 game, and not even like a current generation of PS2 games.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.080
It looks like a step back.

04:00.080 --> 04:04.080
Well, itís developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they

04:04.080 --> 04:05.640
were all hack and slashy, too.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.640
I donít know.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.480
It didnít look that bad.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.000
The screenshots Iíve seen look pretty good, but having played the demo Ö

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
The screenshots arenít playing.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh, snap.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Oh, no.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.960
But, anyways, thatís actually Nvidiaís big game for Ö well, actually, no, I guess Fear

04:21.960 --> 04:24.240
would be the big game for Novemver.

04:24.240 --> 04:32.720
Anywho, so that fall update for the 360, it did some good, and what that would be is actually Ö

04:32.720 --> 04:40.200
Well, itís helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives

04:40.200 --> 04:43.120
modded to play backed-up games.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.240
And so, actually, theyíve started banning some of these people that supposedly have

04:47.240 --> 04:48.720
modded systems.

04:48.720 --> 04:52.480
The funny part about it, though, is theyíre also banning some people that donít have

04:52.480 --> 04:55.560
modded systems, but are saying that they are modded.

04:55.560 --> 05:02.200
So they donít really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try

05:02.200 --> 05:09.360
to stop some of those people from pirating stuff, because pirating is bad, totally.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.360
I feel so weird saying that.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.880
Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably

05:15.880 --> 05:21.680
be downloading any time soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.

05:21.680 --> 05:26.200
Some brand new maps came out for free if youíre an Xbox Live Gold member.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
Hmm, interesting.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.200
Another perk about being a Gold member.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.680
You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this, they are an updated version

05:33.680 --> 05:37.860
of GoldenEye 64 maps, Facility and Temple.

05:37.860 --> 05:40.040
Those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.200
Thatís kind of cool, if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.400
I sold my Perfect Dark Zero, because I didnít like it.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
I just couldnít get into it.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
It felt weird.

05:48.600 --> 05:53.120
No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.080
Thatís my opinion.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.960
But, but, but, there, GoldenEye was a good game.

05:58.960 --> 06:02.600
I donít know, I still play Doom, and GoldenEye was good.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.400
I just didnít, Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.400
At all.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.960
I donít know, Iím sorry, it just wasnít good for me.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
Dark Tetsuyaís happy.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.720
He says Facility was awesome.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.160
So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.160
You know what they need?

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
What?

06:20.160 --> 06:22.720
They need to put out a goddamn time splitters game.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.720
That was awesome.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.720
Weíll see.

06:24.720 --> 06:25.720
Make your own maps.

06:25.720 --> 06:34.280
Well, at any rate, thereís been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.

06:34.280 --> 06:41.560
Basically there is Ninja Ball, which is, you know, basically carrying a ball around.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.080
Tank Flag, where a tank carries a flag.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.640
And Elimination, on that one, youíre supposed to kill off five opposing team members.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.980
With a 16 player limit.

06:52.980 --> 07:01.160
They also mentioned more about the Spartan Laser, itís saying that the weapons application

07:01.160 --> 07:07.280
will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.640
So itís sort of like, you know, lock targeting computer fire.

07:11.640 --> 07:19.880
The Man Cannon, funny, it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles and looping

07:19.880 --> 07:23.420
arcs over the battlefield.

07:23.420 --> 07:30.320
And thereís also saying that theyíll be able to fire or you can be shot down while

07:30.320 --> 07:31.640
youíre in air.

07:31.640 --> 07:37.320
Thereís also, with the Warthog and Ghost vehicles, theyíre going to control similarly

07:37.320 --> 07:45.040
to how they do in Halo 2, but theyíre not saying what the X button is going to be used

07:45.040 --> 07:46.040
for.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.280
Itís going to be ready when itís ready.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.720
The rumor for the X button was steal weapons, because apparently youíre going to be carrying

07:53.720 --> 07:59.440
your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.

07:59.440 --> 08:04.920
So to stop people who whore certain weapons, like during the whole game, thatíll be interesting.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.760
Yeah, Iíve heard that youíre going to be able to see the weapons on people, so interesting.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.040
That is kind of cool.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.160
By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in the first

08:16.160 --> 08:19.440
person shooter, Jeremy Todd 1 says in Gears of War you canít jump and thatís one of

08:19.440 --> 08:20.960
the best games coming out.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.960
Itís a little stupid.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.680
I donít care.

08:26.680 --> 08:31.680
Even if it has high production values, itís still retarded that you cannot jump.

08:31.680 --> 08:41.160
Come on now, weíre in next gen, we need to have jumping technology, thatís what we need.

08:41.160 --> 08:46.160
Some things that are also ridiculous out there, and we talk about this every week, itís not

08:46.160 --> 08:51.480
a huge surprise, another EA game comes out and more microtransactions.

08:51.480 --> 08:57.640
Well, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.

08:57.640 --> 09:05.200
One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours

09:05.200 --> 09:12.080
the collectorís edition, so you can get the extra cars and whatnot, extra tracks.

09:12.080 --> 09:17.720
And of course, theyíre going to have some unlockables that you can buy, pretty much

09:17.720 --> 09:23.720
the same deal as all the other EA games that theyíve been charging microtransactions for.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.140
So this is just going to be something that weíre going to see going forward, Iím thinking.

09:28.140 --> 09:30.840
So if you donít like them, donít buy them, thatís what I say.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.080
Thatís exactly what it boils down to.

09:32.080 --> 09:36.240
If you donít like this, donít buy it, and donít encourage other people to buy it either.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.040
So itís time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.760
I donít know, they can be cool sometimes.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.600
I mean new maps, new songs, I mean thatís kind of neat, but I donít know about this

09:45.600 --> 09:48.520
whole buying something that youíre going to get in the game later.

09:48.520 --> 09:52.160
And doesnít that just seem, I still canít get over the whole thing that we talked about,

09:52.160 --> 09:56.140
I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the

09:56.140 --> 09:59.200
other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.880
That just seems, I donít know, just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes

10:02.880 --> 10:05.240
to get through their games, and thatís how they want to do it, and thatís how they have

10:05.240 --> 10:06.240
fun doing it.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.920
Especially in a sandbox game, maybe they donít want the challenge, they just want to have

10:08.920 --> 10:10.240
fun going around and blowing people up.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.080
Like I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans, just put in all the cheat codes

10:14.080 --> 10:15.520
and just ran around and blew things up.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
Hey, thatís fun!

10:16.520 --> 10:18.960
No, Iím not talking about you actually, although you probably did this too.

10:18.960 --> 10:19.960
Yes I did.

10:19.960 --> 10:25.520
So, I donít know, it just kind of seems like itís taking advantage of those people, taking

10:25.520 --> 10:26.760
candy from a baby.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.060
Well, itís just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row

10:31.060 --> 10:34.960
at lunch, because weíre not actually saving the game or doing any progress, weíre just

10:34.960 --> 10:40.600
running around blowing shit up, and thatís how we spend our lunches, because Saints Row

10:40.600 --> 10:42.880
is very much like Grand Theft Auto.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.480
Well, this type of news makes me angry.

10:45.480 --> 10:49.280
I donít know about you, DarkSakura, but I get angry when I feel like Iím being taken

10:49.280 --> 10:54.880
advantage of, and my poor casual gaming friends are going to have to pay more money to have

10:54.880 --> 11:00.280
the gaming experience they want, so this makes me angsty, and that means itís time for the

11:00.280 --> 11:01.280
FUs of the Week.

11:01.280 --> 11:17.160
The FU of the Week goes towards the Jehovahís Witness that knocked on the door to Kristenís

11:17.160 --> 11:19.760
house before I left today.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.840
Iím hiding behind the corner because I know Iím going to have choice awards for this

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
woman.

11:25.840 --> 11:31.600
But sheís like, sheís coming to the door, and Kristenís like, ìHi, can I help you?î

11:31.600 --> 11:37.200
and sheís like, ìOh, I have very important information for you, hereís your own personal

11:37.200 --> 11:41.960
copy of things to help you understand whatís going on in the world!î And she goes, ìIs

11:41.960 --> 11:48.720
this religious?î ìNo, itís from the Bible!î ìExcuse me!î And then she proceeds to go

11:48.720 --> 11:56.600
on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian

11:56.600 --> 12:02.840
or believes in God or anything like that, itís, first of all, the woman tries to lie

12:02.840 --> 12:08.600
about her purpose for being there, which is very un-Christian-like, then again, weíve

12:08.600 --> 12:14.520
had this for centuries, ìOh, the Crusades, the witch hunts, how about that?î But anyway,

12:14.520 --> 12:21.280
she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference, and the thing is,

12:21.280 --> 12:28.840
you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
that you do.

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
It doesnít work.

12:30.840 --> 12:36.840
And finally, Iím like, and Kristenís like, ìOh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!î

12:36.840 --> 12:41.960
Iím like, so, I said, ìOkay, hereís my take on this.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.640
The Bible was written by human beings.

12:44.640 --> 12:45.760
God did not write it.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.280
God told them what to put in it.

12:47.280 --> 12:52.000
Therefore, when God comes to earth and says, ìHereís a book that I wrote by myself.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.360
I hope you like it, then I will take the Bible literally.î And then I said, ìThank you

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
very much.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.360
Goodbye,î and shut the door.

12:59.360 --> 13:03.360
She gave me this look like, itís utter disbelief, like, ìOh, my God, nobodyís ever pointed

13:03.360 --> 13:10.360
that out to me before,î and turned around and left, and spent silence.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.320
And all I could see was, ìOh, my God, Iím so hardcore.î

13:13.320 --> 13:18.040
This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico, and I remember Prop 22 here in California,

13:18.040 --> 13:21.160
which is the one that said they were going to write, ìMarriage is only between a man

13:21.160 --> 13:27.600
and a womanî in the State Constitution, and this woman came to my door and was like, ìYes,

13:27.600 --> 13:32.580
I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.800
How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?î

13:35.800 --> 13:40.280
And Iím like, ìHoney, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.î And she did.

13:40.280 --> 13:48.360
But she was embarrassed, she was like, ìOh, oh, I see.î Iím like, ìYouíre not going

13:48.360 --> 13:52.080
to catch it, but run.î Iím a very open-minded person.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.320
I grew up Southern Baptist, I mean, jeez.

13:55.320 --> 14:01.040
If I could escape that with an open mind, if I could escape growing up Southern Baptist

14:01.040 --> 14:09.080
in Alabama with an open mind, then Iím fairly tolerant of peopleís religious preferences.

14:09.080 --> 14:17.600
But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that

14:17.600 --> 14:24.720
you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you

14:24.720 --> 14:29.320
ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.

14:29.320 --> 14:45.080
We have to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.

14:45.080 --> 14:50.960
I think we can end on the note saying, ìIf you are totally religious, then thatís cool.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.800
We totally respect that.î One of my best friends is a very religious person and I totally

14:54.800 --> 15:00.200
respect that because he respects my right to choose my own religion and the fact that

15:00.200 --> 15:05.200
we have freedom of religion in this country, so I think diversity is great.

15:05.200 --> 15:10.200
Thatís why I think youíre welcome to see how you feel, youíre welcome to believe what

15:10.200 --> 15:11.200
you do, but youíre right.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.320
You can share with me, but your right to share that with me ends when you force it on me.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, and I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, actually, no, anyway, weíve got

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
to move on.

15:20.000 --> 15:25.200
Anyways, I have to read this in chat, RPGKing7 says, ìNo, whatís better is these two fairly

15:25.200 --> 15:29.480
hot Jehovahís Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, ìIf God loves me, then

15:29.480 --> 15:34.080
youíll show me your tits.îî Thatís disgusting, come on, letís keep it moving.

15:34.080 --> 15:43.000
Anyways, FU2 Comcast, because I upgraded to Comcastís HD service, and first off, there

15:43.000 --> 15:48.400
arenít that many channels anyways, but second off, our new cable box keeps randomly shutting

15:48.400 --> 15:54.680
off, like once every hour to once every five minutes, and itís very annoying, and in fact

15:54.680 --> 15:59.800
now itís starting to make static noise out of our right speaker, and I checked everything

15:59.800 --> 16:04.280
and well, theyíre just retarded, so finally the Leafs are coming to fix it on Tuesday,

16:04.280 --> 16:10.000
but I shouldnít have to put up with that crap.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.960
My FU goes to my taste buds because Iím constantly craving junk food all week, like right now

16:15.960 --> 16:19.480
Iím craving pie.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
Thatís it.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
Meagletop, do you have anything?

16:21.480 --> 16:29.600
I have two short ones, Iím doing a preemptive FU to Endemero for not including Lasenka in

16:29.600 --> 16:34.640
the new Pump It Up mix thatís going to be announced this month, because I know it wonít

16:34.640 --> 16:39.960
be there, because they donít like me enough, and then FU to myself for not trying to jump

16:39.960 --> 16:43.960
on Taco Bell Boy today, because heís still really hot.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.960
Hey Rob, I have one more.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
What?

16:47.960 --> 16:56.160
This is on behalf of several friends of mine, when, okay men, remember this, if you try

16:56.160 --> 17:01.000
to hit on somebody while theyíre working to say Iím sorry Iím a lesbian, donít say

17:01.000 --> 17:06.320
oh thatís okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.

17:06.320 --> 17:09.400
They donít want your cock pissed off.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.120
They want pussy.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.640
Thank you for that blunt explanation.

17:14.640 --> 17:20.360
Well, you have to be blunt, because the majority of straight men out there only think, Iím

17:20.360 --> 17:24.800
saying majority, most that Iíve encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy

17:24.800 --> 17:25.800
and itís not their brain.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.040
Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because theyíre

17:29.040 --> 17:30.040
so fabulously hot.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
Theyíre so fabulously hot.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
That is very true.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.960
Thatís true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.

17:35.960 --> 17:36.960
Men just want to watch.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.520
You know what, yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.960
Iím like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesnít really work that way, Iím not programmed

17:42.960 --> 17:43.960
for that.

17:43.960 --> 17:48.120
Anyway, weíre getting into TMI, so letís get into some game releases.

17:48.120 --> 17:52.040
Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.920
In Japan, Iíve got the Japanese release dates for you guys.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.760
Gears of War is making its way to the Xbox 360 in certain Asian regions this week, so

17:59.760 --> 18:01.880
be on the lookout for that.

We also have coming out on the Playstation 2 this week in Japan, Area 51 is coming out.

18:08.140 --> 18:14.880
My Kinoto Hime is coming out as well on the Playstation 2 in Japan, which is another typical

18:14.880 --> 18:20.200
adventure game that is being put out by Sunrise, which has a limited edition entertainment

18:20.200 --> 18:21.200

18:26.820 --> 18:30.720

Going over to the Nintendo DS, Blackjack Hainotori-hen is coming out from Sega this week, and then

18:37.680 --> 18:43.440
another Sudoku game is coming out as well from Milestone, and we have this interesting

18:43.440 --> 18:44.440
title.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.680
Letís see how bad I can butcher this.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.580
Was that Hainotori?

18:47.580 --> 18:48.580
Which one?

18:48.580 --> 18:50.000
The one you said before Hainotori?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.800
Oh God, on whichÖ

18:51.800 --> 18:52.800
Sorry.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.800
Oh no, itís separated.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
Itís Hainotori-hen.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.800
Ok, that means firebird.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.240
Oh, thatís what it is.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.280
And then we have this one as well, this should be interesting on the DS.

19:02.280 --> 19:08.120
Itís Nisas Shoujo Manga Ka, Chao Manga School.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.760
So this is how to be a shoujo manga artist?

19:10.760 --> 19:13.920
Pretty much, it looks likeÖ no, it looks like it actually takes place like in a school.

19:13.920 --> 19:14.920
Iím looking at some of the screenshots.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.920
Manga Ka is aÖ

19:15.920 --> 19:16.920
Oh no, it does teach you how to draw.

19:16.920 --> 19:17.920
A manga writer.

19:17.920 --> 19:18.920
Oh yeah, look, seeÖ

19:18.920 --> 19:19.920
Shoujo is girl.

19:19.920 --> 19:20.920
See, look, it teaches you how to draw.

19:20.920 --> 19:23.120
Basically, itís going to teach you how to draw Sailor Moon.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.120
Yeah, see, look, there it is.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.320
Coming out from TDK Mediactive.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.800
I actually think Iíll get that game.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.560
That might be kind of fun.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.120
The importers are wanting $48.90 for it.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.680
Dude, Iíll get it.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.800
Gotta love those import games and their high, high prices.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.840
Well, hey, if you do Dil Jinshi or an artist, thatís a good game for you.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.480
I need to give PSP a little love real quick as well.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.200
Theyíre also getting some games.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.800
Mostly Koei Entertainmentís bringing out some stuff into their best series.

19:48.800 --> 19:54.520
Nobunaga no Yabu is going into the best series, as well as La Corda de Oro.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.480
Looks like this oneís a new game thatís comingÖ no, itís just going into Koei selection.

19:59.480 --> 20:04.880
Marukanaro Jiku no Uchi Day 2.

20:04.880 --> 20:09.320
Enjoy if youíre in Japan and have access to those games.

20:09.320 --> 20:16.360
Well, speaking of games that arenít in Japan, how about our friends over in Europe?

20:16.360 --> 20:21.520
So letís see what is coming out in the upcoming week, shall we?

20:21.520 --> 20:27.960
Coming out on the 6th, we have Football Manager 2007 on 360 and PSP.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.680
Thatís an interesting combination.

20:29.680 --> 20:34.360
Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe, which I recommend everybody get because itís

20:34.360 --> 20:35.360
fun.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.960
Sega Genesis Collection.

20:36.960 --> 20:42.880
Also on the 10th, we have Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Team

20:42.880 --> 20:49.200
Saber, Mario Slam Basketball, Point Blank for the DS, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue and

20:49.200 --> 20:56.960
Red, Scooby-Doo, Whoís Watching Who?, Warhammer, Mark of Chaos, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007,

20:56.960 --> 21:00.640
which I actually do have to say is pretty damn fun just from the demo.

21:00.640 --> 21:05.920
You can download the demo on Xbox Live right now if you want to give it a go, but I recommend

21:05.920 --> 21:11.880
that if you want to win, use Kane.

21:11.880 --> 21:16.440
Of course, the U.S. is going to be seeing one hell of a week for releases.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.560
Starting off, of course, with the portable stuff, weíve got Elite Beat Agents coming

21:19.560 --> 21:26.480
out on the DS, Digimon World DS, My Frogger Toy TrialsÖ crap!

21:26.480 --> 21:33.440
And letís see hereÖ Winx Club, The Quest for CodexÖ also crap!

21:33.440 --> 21:37.000
And letís seeÖ Wait, wait, I thought Megalotov was a fan

21:37.000 --> 21:39.560
of the Winx games.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.880
I just work on him.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.760
Iím not really a fan.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.760
Never mind.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.200
I better not grill you further or you might get in trouble.

21:45.200 --> 21:52.440
Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy V Advance is coming out and Polarium Advance as well.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.640
Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers Iíve ever played.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.880
I would not be interested in it on the Advance.

21:56.880 --> 22:03.920
On the PC, weíve got Final Fantasy XI Vanadial Collection 2007, in case youíre not a member

22:03.920 --> 22:06.000
of Final Fantasy XI yet.

22:06.000 --> 22:13.280
Left Behind, Eternal Forces, the godly Grand Theft Auto game, the Sims 2 Happy Holiday

22:13.280 --> 22:20.040
stuff, and of course, if you have a Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Aircraft Power Pack

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
will be coming out.

22:21.040 --> 22:26.160
Then on a lot of systems, Call of Duty 3 is going to be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox,

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
and the 360.

22:27.160 --> 22:33.320
Weíve got Tony Hawkís Project 8 coming out on Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Xbox, and

22:33.320 --> 22:35.680
Xbox 360.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.480
Luminous 2 on the PSP.

22:39.480 --> 22:45.580
Of course, weíve also got Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Guitar Hero 2 is coming

22:45.580 --> 22:46.580
out.

22:46.580 --> 22:51.400
Weíve got Sopranos and the Sopranos Collectorís Edition, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined Assault

22:51.400 --> 23:00.040
for the Playstation 2, Sega Genesis Collection on the Playstation 2, and PSP.

23:00.040 --> 23:07.460
On the 360, the HD DVD player is coming out this week actually, Gears of War, and then

23:07.460 --> 23:14.840
Viva Pinata, and of course, one of my favorites to sell at least, the History Channel, American

23:14.840 --> 23:22.200
Civil War, Nation Divided on PS2 and the 360, another budget Activision game for you, and

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
Blitz Elite.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.200
Thatís it.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.200
Lots of stuff.

23:25.200 --> 23:31.400
Alright, it should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, thatís for sure.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.240
Oh my God, yeah, seriously.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.040
Itís like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.

23:37.040 --> 23:41.760
Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.

23:41.760 --> 23:46.520
Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split screen.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.840
Changing topics completely to something thatís already out but maybe we didnít know about

23:49.840 --> 23:53.880
thatís in stores, one of our listeners actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent

23:53.880 --> 23:58.520
post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted at a local store.

23:58.520 --> 24:02.320
He spotted Dance Dance Revolution, the DVD game.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.080
He saw this at Best Buy, and you might be thinking, ìOh, thatís interesting, a DDR

24:06.080 --> 24:09.760
game that you can play in your DVD player.î Well, hereís the deal.

24:09.760 --> 24:17.480
You have a dance pad, but since itís a DVD game, it doesnít plug into anything.

24:17.480 --> 24:21.560
You just have a dance pad that you can mimic the on-screen stuff to with the dance pad.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
Basically, this is what it is.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.180
Itís an interactive DDR game that can be played on a DVD player.

24:26.180 --> 24:31.120
It has a dancer named Roxy that teaches you how to play the game in over 30 dance sessions,

24:31.120 --> 24:34.260
and this will train you to play with the DDR console games.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.800
The DDR mats are strictly just for show.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.920
Itís put out by imagination, and it retails for 30 bucks.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.840
Why donít they just put it as a training mode for some of these console games?

24:43.840 --> 24:48.680
A lot of people are going, ìOMG, lame!î Thatís basically the response.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.720
But whatís interesting about this is that some folks have also been bringing up, ìWell,

24:51.720 --> 24:56.980
this is a way for folks who canít really afford the whole system and the more expensive

24:56.980 --> 25:01.320
game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of

25:01.320 --> 25:03.640
the game telling them they suck.î I donít know.

25:03.640 --> 25:09.600
Also, if you donít have a dance mat and you donít have the game, dropping $70 or $49.99

25:09.600 --> 25:16.600
or whatever for the game, the dance mat is a little much, so maybe $20 for a DVD is not

25:16.600 --> 25:17.600
so bad.

25:17.600 --> 25:22.480
Iím kind of surprised itís not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry

25:22.480 --> 25:30.160
Shortcake DDR or what have you.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.960
This guy, El Mullet, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with

25:33.960 --> 25:34.960
the Internet.

25:34.960 --> 25:39.480
DarkSakra serves the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with

25:39.480 --> 25:40.480
all of you guys.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.640
Itís called the Website of the Week, and DarkSakra is going to tell you what her browser

25:44.640 --> 25:51.080
is looking at right now.

25:51.080 --> 25:57.600
The website of the week, after lots of looking, is the Catsite.com.

25:57.600 --> 26:03.040
Yes, itís a site all about cats and how to take care of them.

26:03.040 --> 26:14.640
It has things about kittens, it has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior,

26:14.640 --> 26:15.640
hairball care.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.120
I recommend going to the Catsite.com.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.440
Yes, I have a cat.

26:20.440 --> 26:26.600
There is Shermy, and Shermy has benefited from this site.

26:26.600 --> 26:31.600
I have to admit, I prefer DailyKitten.com for my cat needs.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.600
My cat-loving needs.

26:32.600 --> 26:36.240
Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.240
Or StuffOnMyCat.com.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.680
Iíve already done StuffOnMyCat, remember?

26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
Thatís right, you did.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.680
A long time ago.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.680
They need StuffOnMyBaby.com.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
Wow.

26:43.680 --> 26:49.080
I think that would be funny because people put weird things on their babies.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.760
I donít know if you should encourage that.

26:52.760 --> 26:53.760
Is there one already?

26:53.760 --> 26:55.520
Oh, Iím worried Iím going to get porn or something.

26:55.520 --> 26:56.520
Letís try this.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.520
www.stuffonmybaby.com.

26:57.520 --> 27:10.800
Oh, this page is parked free courtesy of GoDaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.800
How nice.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.840
So I guess thereís no Stuff On My Baby yet, but Go Daddy says thereís one coming soon,

27:17.840 --> 27:19.600
as soon as someone buys the domain from them.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.600
Iím telling you, the Stuff On My Cat, they needed the Stuff On My Baby because people

27:22.600 --> 27:24.800
dress up their kids really stupidly.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.120
I have a Stuff On My Cat calendar now.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.080
How about Stuff On My Politician?

27:30.080 --> 27:33.320
I donít know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.

27:33.320 --> 27:39.080
Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign

27:39.080 --> 27:44.700
commercial going on, and basically heís this ultra-conservative guy, and heís bragging

27:44.700 --> 27:51.880
about his support of video game violence initiatives, taking a stand against video game violence.

27:51.880 --> 27:56.840
But what should be noted about this commercial, that Game Politics points out, is that in

27:56.840 --> 28:00.840
the commercial, Santorium delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers, towards the

28:00.840 --> 28:03.400
end of the commercial, an elbow.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.800
He elbows this wrestler in the face.

28:05.800 --> 28:11.240
So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence, and then he is violent against

28:11.240 --> 28:19.280
a wrestler in the commercial, and pretty much anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

28:19.280 --> 28:24.120
Thatís this guyís platform, anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.760
Why is it simulated when you can go do it?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.360
You know what the conservatives want?

28:28.360 --> 28:32.680
They want you to put down the video games, and they want you to go fight in the real

28:32.680 --> 28:33.680
war.

28:33.680 --> 28:40.960
Well, you know, itís kind of not just conservatives in my mind, because it was Hillary Clintonís

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
thing too.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
Itís kind of all across the board.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.900
I think thereís just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what

28:46.900 --> 28:48.900
party theyíre with.

28:48.900 --> 28:52.400
We need to re-educate them by voting them out of office, because if youíre over the

28:52.400 --> 28:58.200
age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator

28:58.200 --> 29:01.800
is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation thatís not going

29:01.800 --> 29:03.920
to go through or anything.

29:03.920 --> 29:05.280
So do your research.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.280
Election Day is coming up.

29:06.280 --> 29:11.520
You know, thereís actually, I want to change my website, because this one, and Iím just

29:11.520 --> 29:12.520
trying to verify that.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.520
Wait, wait, do we need theÖ

29:13.520 --> 29:14.520
We donít need the music again.

29:14.520 --> 29:15.520
Are you sure?

29:15.520 --> 29:16.520
Iím sure.

29:16.520 --> 29:17.520
Are you sure youíre sure?

29:17.520 --> 29:27.400
Iím trying to verify the name of the site, because Iíve been there before.

29:27.400 --> 29:32.800
I think itís like VoteSmart.com or SmartVote or something like that.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.360
I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.660
You know whatís funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays, Election

29:38.660 --> 29:44.060
Day will have already passed, so maybe itís kind of a move point now.

29:44.060 --> 29:47.880
Maybe we should have done this story in Part A. Oops, oh well.

29:47.880 --> 29:48.880
No.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.640
Well, anyway, people should be going there anyway.

29:51.640 --> 29:55.760
Alex in our chat room says, ìI nominate Rob for the Gamersí Party ticket with Jamie as

29:55.760 --> 30:00.080
his Vice President.î Thatís nice, except Iím not 35.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
Almost, but not quite.

30:01.080 --> 30:07.280
Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.

30:07.280 --> 30:13.120
Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded

30:13.120 --> 30:17.240
consoles, but itís also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.

30:17.240 --> 30:23.360
Thatís right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going

30:23.360 --> 30:29.640
to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on

30:29.640 --> 30:36.000
locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent

30:36.000 --> 30:42.600
players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.

30:42.600 --> 30:48.720
Basically there are three ways to hack your G-scores, and basically there are three different

30:48.720 --> 30:49.720
methods.

30:49.720 --> 30:55.760
Save games dating from the launch to March and April that were unlocked and you can be

30:55.760 --> 30:57.800
traded with other users.

30:57.800 --> 31:03.000
Games after that have been locked to specific consoles, but people are hex editing them

31:03.000 --> 31:05.380
to change the console ID.

31:05.380 --> 31:11.320
And then, of course, certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile

31:11.320 --> 31:16.400
locked and only on those profiles can you play them, so people are cheating that as

31:16.400 --> 31:17.960
well.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.140
Very interesting, but Iím sure people are going to find a way around it, because they

31:21.140 --> 31:25.600
always do.

31:25.600 --> 31:28.720
Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to

31:28.720 --> 31:34.000
you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places, because we talked about the

31:34.000 --> 31:36.840
Game Pro thing earlier in the show, weíve talked about E3, but these are all things

31:36.840 --> 31:37.840
that happen in America.

31:37.840 --> 31:42.280
Of course, you know the other big shows that happen, thereís the one in Germany, thereís

31:42.280 --> 31:45.400
Tokyo Game Show, thereís other game shows in other parts of the world where we have

31:45.400 --> 31:46.400
listeners.

31:46.400 --> 31:50.920
I know we have listeners in Canada and the Arcadia Gaming Festival is going to be taking

31:50.920 --> 31:56.800
place November 10th through the 12th at the Stade Unipree in Montreal in Canada.

31:56.800 --> 32:03.360
Itís going to be a very big event, theyíre saying, and theyíve got sponsors including

32:03.360 --> 32:05.920
Nintendo, Microsoft, and Ubisoft.

32:05.920 --> 32:10.600
The website says, ìArcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and

32:10.600 --> 32:15.680
emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.î Does that mean everyoneís

32:15.680 --> 32:16.680
getting high?

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
I donít know.

32:17.680 --> 32:23.080
Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days, and there is a service fee with that

32:23.080 --> 32:28.280
though, so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian, thatís about $22 US by the way.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.580
Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who

32:32.580 --> 32:37.440
might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.

32:37.440 --> 32:41.080
Have fun.

32:41.080 --> 32:48.920
Also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.820
Basically theyíre bringing in virtual taxation.

32:52.820 --> 33:00.360
If you earn money, you have to pay taxes, so for anyone doing profits online or playing

33:00.360 --> 33:09.560
games like Second Life or World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says,

33:09.560 --> 33:13.920
ìIf youíre getting a monetary benefit, then itís not treated any differently.

33:13.920 --> 33:14.920
Normal rules apply.

33:14.920 --> 33:18.800
Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working nine to five

33:18.800 --> 33:27.640
in an office.î So basically for anyone who earns money via their internet addictions,

33:27.640 --> 33:29.560
then youíre going to get taxed.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.120
Hereís where I have a problem with this.

33:32.120 --> 33:37.840
If theyíre going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses

33:37.840 --> 33:40.760
and I want restitution for that.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.040
Thatís why I think it would be fair.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.200
If you want to go one way, youíve got to do both.

33:44.200 --> 33:48.160
You canít have the cake without paying the money.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
I donít know.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
Thatís a bad analogy.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.160
Whatever.

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
I had nothing.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.960
But I want damn money for losing tons of money in an online game.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.960
I think thatís only fair.

33:58.960 --> 34:06.480
So, the big trend with Japan and actually the United States and portable consoles is

34:06.480 --> 34:08.280
releasing them in multiple colors.

34:08.280 --> 34:12.440
Well, youíre going to get three brand new colors in Japan for the PSP.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.440
Thatís right.

34:13.440 --> 34:19.360
Theyíre going to be getting pink, silver, and metallic blue and unfortunately none of

34:19.360 --> 34:25.040
those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except

34:25.040 --> 34:29.760
for me, the pink one, which looks stupid.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.520
Should you spend your money on this?

34:31.520 --> 34:33.560
Probably not if you already have one.

34:33.560 --> 34:40.760
But if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP, then nowís the time.

34:40.760 --> 34:41.760
I donít know.

34:41.760 --> 34:42.760
Hooray.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.760
I want a pink PSP.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
Not.

34:46.760 --> 34:47.760
Wait.

34:47.760 --> 34:53.160
Miklotov is the one thatís the color whore when it comes to systems.

34:53.160 --> 34:58.400
Youíve totally taken systems back and traded it just to get a blue DS and stuff.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.400
Yep.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.440
So do any of these new color PSPs interest you?

35:01.440 --> 35:02.440
The blue one.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.440
Of course.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.440
I honestly really want it.

35:05.440 --> 35:09.920
I saw the picture and I was like, ìWow, itís a blue PSP.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.640
I need it back.î

35:11.640 --> 35:17.200
When I was at Yalicon, there were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing

35:17.200 --> 35:19.640
a different color DS.

35:19.640 --> 35:20.640
Thatís cute.

35:20.640 --> 35:23.240
I have a pink GBA.

35:23.240 --> 35:27.200
For like $20, you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.

35:27.200 --> 35:30.480
In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.

35:30.480 --> 35:34.800
You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.

35:34.800 --> 35:38.640
Theyíre available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.

35:38.640 --> 35:41.440
Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.260
You know what I thought was interesting is I was at the mall today and I didnít notice

35:44.260 --> 35:48.520
how many freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to PIP my iPod.

35:48.520 --> 35:53.840
They had all these places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever little encasings they

35:53.840 --> 35:58.240
have that you can put SpongeBob on your iPod and stuff and you can pretty much do the same

35:58.240 --> 35:59.240
thing with the PSP.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.240
You know what I havenít seen this year?

36:00.240 --> 36:01.240
What?

36:01.240 --> 36:02.240
The knockoff Nintendos.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.240
Maybe they finally got pulled.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.240
Didnít they get sued years ago or something?

36:05.240 --> 36:06.240
I donít know.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.240
That doesnít stop people.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.240
Maybe they didnít sell well.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.240
I donít know.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.240
Oh yeah, laws.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.600
Theyíre going to put laws in place to stop the black market.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.920
Oh, thatís going to work.

36:12.920 --> 36:17.520
Well, Microsoft is hoping that this will sell well, if it is true anyway.

36:17.520 --> 36:21.520
This is in rumor status right now, but it certainly seems plausible.

36:21.520 --> 36:28.320
The rumor is that Microsoft will begin offering downloadable HD movies later this month.

36:28.320 --> 36:33.320
Supposedly itís going to launch around November 22nd and 1,100 hours of video would be available

36:33.320 --> 36:37.640
to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.

36:37.640 --> 36:42.840
Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period and purchases would be from $10 to

36:42.840 --> 36:47.420
$15, very similar to pay-per-view and iTunes.

36:47.420 --> 36:52.060
I donít know if Iíd buy this though, because to me this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player

36:52.060 --> 36:54.000
if theyíre going to move this direction, right?

36:54.000 --> 36:59.480
Not necessarily, because youíre only going to have so much room on your hard drive to

36:59.480 --> 37:00.480
fit movies.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.480
Yeah, thatís the other thing.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.600
Thereís no room.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.880
How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20-gigabyte drive?

37:05.880 --> 37:08.320
Well, I donít know, but hereís the other thing too.

37:08.320 --> 37:13.960
The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it, so they

37:13.960 --> 37:16.000
could do this if they wanted to.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.320
Thatís one of the things that they just added.

37:18.320 --> 37:24.720
So it kind of seems a little coincidental if theyíre going to be implementing this

37:24.720 --> 37:30.160
pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.680
I donít know.

37:33.680 --> 37:35.840
It just seems a little soon for this.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.840
I still think youíre kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.880
Well, theyíve got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution

37:42.880 --> 37:43.880
stuff.

37:43.880 --> 37:44.880
Weíll see.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.240
Justin in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late

37:48.240 --> 37:49.240
ë90s.

37:49.240 --> 37:50.240
I donít know, because you can buy them.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.840
Theyíre going to have to announce a bigger hard drive is what theyíre going to have

37:51.840 --> 37:52.840
to do.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.640
What are you going to do when youíre done with a movie?

37:54.640 --> 37:57.440
You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and itís still

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
yours?

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
Iím thinking the drives are not big enough.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.440
Possibly.

38:00.440 --> 38:04.800
I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that thereís a 60-gig

38:04.800 --> 38:09.200
thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.200
You know?

38:10.200 --> 38:11.200
I donít know.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.200
It doesnít make sense.

38:12.200 --> 38:15.680
Justin thinks they can stream the movies.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.680
They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
I donít know.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.560
That wouldnít necessarily work, depending on how bad your service is.

38:21.560 --> 38:25.120
It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.480
Weíll see.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.600
And of course, Bandit wants to know, ìWhen does the Wizard get released for the 360?î

38:30.600 --> 38:36.260
I donít think it would, because it was a Nintendo commercial, so they donít want it.

38:36.260 --> 38:37.260
But I donít know.

38:37.260 --> 38:38.260
I could be wrong.

38:38.260 --> 38:40.040
One thing that we want is your e-mails.

38:40.040 --> 38:43.480
Every week we invite you guys to e-mail us at MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we

38:43.480 --> 38:49.840
pick a few of our favorite letters that hopefully youíd like them too, and we read them here

38:49.840 --> 38:50.840
on air.

38:50.840 --> 38:54.600
So please, why donít you drop us an e-mail, MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and the

38:54.600 --> 38:59.600
Dark Sakura is going to read some of her favorite e-mails right now.

38:59.600 --> 39:09.840
Well, weíve got quite a number of e-mails now, all going to be read by the ferret, so

39:09.840 --> 39:11.720
hereís the first one.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.040
Okay, never mind.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.920
First e-mail comes from Wolf.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.460
I actually have two e-mails, so Iím just going to read them together, because actually

39:20.460 --> 39:22.160
I sort of am happy about one.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
ìSo this goes out to Jamie.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.120
I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game

39:26.120 --> 39:31.280
system for two to three times the value when someone who canít enjoy it has to pay that

39:31.280 --> 39:32.280
much.î

39:32.280 --> 39:42.960
Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe morals are becoming slowly corroded

39:42.960 --> 39:47.800
over time, and I think somebodyís got to have them, so thank you.

39:47.800 --> 39:54.400
One for Rob, ìI think youíre the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?

39:54.400 --> 39:58.360
Did you quit before or after the whole chocobo-raising update?î

39:58.360 --> 40:03.600
I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI, right when they did the chocobo,

40:03.600 --> 40:05.240
but it only lasted about a month.

40:05.240 --> 40:09.880
Miklotov was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit.

40:09.880 --> 40:14.280
I think I got Coursera to level 14, if that, and then quit.

40:14.280 --> 40:18.560
I did get a chocobo, and I raised it, but not past baby stage.

40:18.560 --> 40:23.980
ìOh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.î But then I quit, and now

40:23.980 --> 40:24.980
Iímó

40:24.980 --> 40:26.660
I remember you had a little Kim back in the day.

40:26.660 --> 40:31.240
That was actually my mule, so it was a secondary character I had named Little Kim.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.760
Maybe someday Iíll go back to Final Fantasy XI, but right now itís all about Final Fantasy

40:35.760 --> 40:37.800
Star Universe, as far as MMOs go.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.840
And Final Fantasy XII, hello!

40:40.840 --> 40:41.840
Lots of stuff to be playing.

40:41.840 --> 40:47.240
Well, as far as other e-mails are concerned, we have one from AZHP again.

40:47.240 --> 40:55.960
Okay, it says, ìHey guys, AZHP again, reporting back from Stonetowns, Karaoke Revolution presents

40:55.960 --> 40:58.000
American Idol dealie.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.160
Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.840
But anyway, my thoughts on the game.

41:04.840 --> 41:08.160
Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that Iíve played, but the whole

41:08.160 --> 41:14.160
American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.720
I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person,

41:17.720 --> 41:20.680
cause there were only a few sound bites for each judge.

41:20.680 --> 41:24.760
Also since itís on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate, and not in

41:24.760 --> 41:25.880
a good way.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.000
And when they talk, the lips donít sync up.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.560
Also, the pitch recognition still needs work, judges a little too harshly, just like all

41:32.560 --> 41:33.560
the previous games.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.560
A decent party game, but not great.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.480
Yeah, thatís not surprising.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.440
Well, I think itís not done yet either.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.440
No.

41:40.440 --> 41:43.440
Well, no, isnít it?

41:43.440 --> 41:47.800
Were they talking about the little tour theyíre doing?

41:47.800 --> 41:48.800
Yeah.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.440
I donít think thatís a final build.

41:50.440 --> 41:55.840
No, so I wouldnít totally base your opinions on that build.

41:55.840 --> 42:00.400
But, you know, itís going to give you the general feel of the game, at least.

42:00.400 --> 42:06.640
Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.

42:06.640 --> 42:11.280
Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kudaragi, here is a reason for the

42:11.280 --> 42:13.520
Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.220
People say heís bad to the customers, eh?

42:16.220 --> 42:20.720
He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.600
When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the

42:24.600 --> 42:27.680
technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.

42:27.680 --> 42:29.080
So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.080
Thought it might interest you all.

42:31.080 --> 42:37.800
Yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah,

42:37.800 --> 42:40.240
there was a bunch of big fallout over that.

42:40.240 --> 42:44.760
I think there were evenóI remember back in the dayódidnít they have image prototypes?

42:44.760 --> 42:49.160
Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?

42:49.160 --> 42:53.160
I seem to remember in Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture,

42:53.160 --> 42:55.240
but you know, this is so long ago.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.240
Yeah.

42:56.240 --> 43:01.400
But thatís still an interesting point, one that not everyone is aware of.

43:01.400 --> 43:06.960
Got an email from Alex, it says, ìHey, O.L.R., Alex from chat here.

43:06.960 --> 43:13.320
I suspect Iím too late for mailbag 207.î And or that the story Iím going to touch on

43:13.320 --> 43:16.360
hasnít come up on the show yet, but oh well, Iím going to talk anyway.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.440
ìIím pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween,

43:20.440 --> 43:21.440
which it was.

43:21.440 --> 43:23.320
However, nobody knew how bad this update was.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.920
A lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing.

43:25.920 --> 43:27.920
This is now fixed, but thereís another problem.

43:27.920 --> 43:32.120
The update effectively bricked consoles.î Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part

43:32.120 --> 43:35.520
A, but I thought it wasó

43:35.520 --> 43:37.240
This is right at the top of this part, but thatís alright.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.200
Actually, our listener, that listenerís in chat tonight.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.200
Yeah.

43:40.200 --> 43:43.040
So heís the same guy who said he had a bricked console, so.

43:43.040 --> 43:46.720
But I still think it was interesting that, you know, weíve got people who do have more

43:46.720 --> 43:49.800
thoughts on that one.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.840
It was the final comment on here that made me really think about it.

43:52.840 --> 43:57.400
Itís way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.400
Good point.

43:58.400 --> 43:59.400
Another email comesó

43:59.400 --> 44:05.280
But wait a minute, though, at the same time, you know, partóat least the rumor or whatever

44:05.280 --> 44:10.440
is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so

44:10.440 --> 44:14.720
Sony couldnít say any longer that theyíre the only console that can do the true HD.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.720
So at the sameó

44:15.720 --> 44:16.720
But how well did they test it?

44:16.720 --> 44:19.920
Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasnít the time to be rushing things, so Iíll buy

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
into that.

44:20.920 --> 44:24.680
We have an email from Warrior Bob.

44:24.680 --> 44:25.680
Warrior Bob is cool.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.680
Hey, guys.

44:26.680 --> 44:30.360
I heard the discussion this last week about Konamiís acquisition of the In the Groove

44:30.360 --> 44:31.360
franchise.

44:31.360 --> 44:35.020
I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so Iíll leave

44:35.020 --> 44:38.680
my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.

44:38.680 --> 44:41.960
I did feel, however, that the situation wasnít portrayed entirely accurately.

44:41.960 --> 44:46.000
Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking

44:46.000 --> 44:50.720
of was StepMania, the open-source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.

44:50.720 --> 44:54.720
In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort,

44:54.720 --> 44:58.960
although some resources are shared between the projects, some code, and I believe some

44:58.960 --> 45:01.460
staff were involved in both In the Groove and StepMania.

45:01.460 --> 45:07.000
The settlement implies that marketing and sales of a game of such similarity does constitute

45:07.000 --> 45:11.880
infringement that is on Rockstar Red Octaneís and not StepManiaís, as they have never sold

45:11.880 --> 45:12.880
anything.

45:12.880 --> 45:17.120
The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.480
Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.

45:19.480 --> 45:23.640
At one point I worked with the StepMania team on a very small level, helped write a manual,

45:23.640 --> 45:28.940
check out the In the Groove 1 Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have

45:28.940 --> 45:32.200
an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.

45:32.200 --> 45:35.360
So while corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the

45:35.360 --> 45:36.360
next one.

45:36.360 --> 45:43.200
With all due respect, no, I meant Fan Tribute and I still feel thatís how I feel the game

45:43.200 --> 45:48.960
is because if you look at the folks that developed In the Groove, half of them were posters on

45:48.960 --> 45:54.320
DDR Seattle before In the Groove ever came out, so maybe it wasnít called a fan tribute

45:54.320 --> 46:00.120
like StepMania was, but in my mind it was that fandom of DDR and they probably all met

46:00.120 --> 46:03.800
each other on this forum and stuff that caused them to make the game.

46:03.800 --> 46:08.240
I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end itís all about the dollar

46:08.240 --> 46:11.120
and they did steal the idea.

46:11.120 --> 46:14.640
And that was kind of part of what I was saying last week is that I kind of felt a little

46:14.640 --> 46:19.880
bit bad because I feel like it was an innocent thing and they really did just want to make

46:19.880 --> 46:25.740
the concept of dance games better until the dollar came into play and I think Rock Store

46:25.740 --> 46:29.320
stepped in and all this stuff, but then again we had Renee here last week who says sheís

46:29.320 --> 46:32.520
had interaction with these folks and theyíre a little bit uppity.

46:32.520 --> 46:35.280
I donít know, Iím not going to speak because I donít really know these folks, but I will

46:35.280 --> 46:36.280
say this.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.760
I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.240
Folks used to ask, ìWhat is your legal angle on this?

46:42.240 --> 46:45.560
How is this game legal?î and they would just say, ìDonít talk about it.

46:45.560 --> 46:50.080
Weíve got it covered.î And now itís kind of like, ìYou know what?

46:50.080 --> 46:52.880
You got served.

46:52.880 --> 46:57.200
Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?î Thatís kind of the one part

46:57.200 --> 46:59.360
I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.

46:59.360 --> 47:03.040
They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.

47:03.040 --> 47:06.140
I still think that the product was well-deserved.

47:06.140 --> 47:08.480
You donít take somebody elseís idea and try to make money on it.

47:08.480 --> 47:13.440
Itís like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any

47:13.440 --> 47:14.440
picture.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.840
Itís like, ìOh, but we love your style.î That doesnít matter to me.

47:17.840 --> 47:18.840
You stole my art.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.880
Thatís how I would feel.

47:20.880 --> 47:32.120
Anyway, my font is very strange on the e-mail, so I apologize.

47:32.120 --> 47:33.680
I think itís Schwal 22.

47:33.680 --> 47:34.680
Yeah.

47:34.680 --> 47:35.680
You know what?

47:35.680 --> 47:36.680
This is funny.

47:36.680 --> 47:37.680
This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.

47:37.680 --> 47:44.600
I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?, I think was the game, and now he listens to

47:44.600 --> 47:45.600
the show.

47:45.600 --> 47:46.600
Itís kind of cool.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
Thatís pretty cool.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.000
Just to explain, my Lís and my 1ís look the same in this font.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Hey, folks.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Love the show and the info.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.840
I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.

47:55.840 --> 48:00.280
I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ìcoî and ends with ìtakuî lol.

48:00.280 --> 48:05.880
Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but

48:05.880 --> 48:13.640
IGNís Matt Casamassina stated earlier this week that that would be possible.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.760
Any sort of clarity would be good because I donít own a GameCube and may need to buy

48:17.760 --> 48:18.760
the controller.

48:18.760 --> 48:23.440
Lastly, the SD memory cards will not be able to play downloaded games at a friendís house

48:23.440 --> 48:24.480
on his or her Wii.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.480
How is that possible?

48:25.480 --> 48:29.280
I understand the region coding of a system, but how can a system justify where the ROM

48:29.280 --> 48:32.960
ñ thatís basically what it is, the emulators are already on the system ñ came from in

48:32.960 --> 48:34.040
the first place?

48:34.040 --> 48:36.840
How will they expect to sell virtual games when they canít travel?

48:36.840 --> 48:39.400
Oh well, sorry for the long e-mail, just info.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.800
I think everyone should be aware of and keep up the good work.

48:41.800 --> 48:45.120
Itís a very informative show, and sometimes questionable.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.000
Man Cannon and Love HamÖsterÖ

48:47.000 --> 48:54.680
Dude, it really is called the Man Cannon.

48:54.680 --> 48:56.360
Thatís what they said on the sites this week.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.680
It really is the Man Cannon.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.080
What were you going to say, Logie?

48:59.080 --> 49:06.680
I was going to say that the Xbox Live Arcade does not have ñ you canít trade the games

49:06.680 --> 49:08.080
with other people and bring them over.

49:08.080 --> 49:12.200
You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you canít actually bring your full

49:12.200 --> 49:13.960
game with them.

49:13.960 --> 49:18.600
Thatís why your profile is linked to basically your console, so youíre only going to be

49:18.600 --> 49:20.600
able to download them there.

49:20.600 --> 49:21.600
You know whatís interesting?

49:21.600 --> 49:25.000
I was listening to Bobbyís show earlier tonight, and he was talking about ñ because he just

49:25.000 --> 49:29.600
got a replacement console and it screwed up his arcade games because it was tied to the

49:29.600 --> 49:30.600
old console.

49:30.600 --> 49:34.080
But apparently if youíre signed in, if youíre the one signed in on the console and you bought

49:34.080 --> 49:36.160
the game, it will work.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.680
So thatís how you can take it, like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to

49:38.680 --> 49:39.680
somebody elseís house.

49:39.680 --> 49:42.240
Sign in, but itís still linked to your account.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.240
Right.

49:43.240 --> 49:44.240
So you have to sign in.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.040
If you copy the game over, it wonít work for them.

49:46.040 --> 49:47.040
Is that what Iím hearing?

49:47.040 --> 49:48.040
It sounds like itís going to have a little ñ

49:48.040 --> 49:51.640
But Iím thinking what you might be able to do though with that is you might be able to

49:51.640 --> 49:58.520
sign in your account, maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work, but right

49:58.520 --> 50:00.680
now theyíre saying you canít just bring your memory card over.

50:00.680 --> 50:03.640
You have to bring the whole console with you, which I donít know about that.

50:03.640 --> 50:05.560
I think you can probably bring your profile.

50:05.560 --> 50:09.280
I think that Wii-Con is going to have ñ yeah, I think the Wii-Con has ñ because they say

50:09.280 --> 50:13.760
that has internal storage in it, so it certainly could have your Nintendo version of gamer

50:13.760 --> 50:14.760
card in it.

50:14.760 --> 50:15.760
Thereís that.

50:15.760 --> 50:19.880
And then, of course, what was the other thing real quick?

50:19.880 --> 50:23.160
Vandalus in our chat room says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.

50:23.160 --> 50:28.080
Yeah, so I donít think thatís really going to be an issue at all.

50:28.080 --> 50:33.480
As far as the classic controller though, you will probably ñ youíre not going to be able

50:33.480 --> 50:36.280
to play GameCube games with that, not at all.

50:36.280 --> 50:40.120
And personally, Iíd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.

50:40.120 --> 50:45.600
Youíd probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper

50:45.600 --> 50:50.140
than buying the classic controller, I would think.

50:50.140 --> 50:51.680
Especially third-party ones.

50:51.680 --> 50:52.680
Exactly.

50:52.680 --> 50:58.620
Well, if weíre ready to move on to the next email, we have two left.

50:58.620 --> 50:59.920
This one comes from Chris.

50:59.920 --> 51:04.400
ìHi, O.L.R., when my family and I were taking care of my sisterís little terrier puppy,

51:04.400 --> 51:07.680
Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.

51:07.680 --> 51:11.360
She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it

51:11.360 --> 51:12.360
was.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.800
Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.

51:16.800 --> 51:19.800
This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your

51:19.800 --> 51:21.000
show helped cheer me up.

51:21.000 --> 51:25.180
Iíd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me

51:25.180 --> 51:30.920
feel when you do the show and how you have made my life a little happier.

51:30.920 --> 51:34.720
God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.î

51:34.720 --> 52:03.360
Thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.520
Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.

52:05.520 --> 52:10.920
First off, I know that thereís all the news swirling around about next-gen systems and

52:10.920 --> 52:15.120
all that, and Iím still desperately hunting down a Wii order, but there seems to be a

52:15.120 --> 52:18.120
real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.

52:18.120 --> 52:21.320
I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.

52:21.320 --> 52:25.280
I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, The Import, and Contact last week, and Iím

52:25.280 --> 52:26.280
really loving both of them.

52:26.280 --> 52:30.940
Contactís got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay, and the instruction

52:30.940 --> 52:35.760
book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars, and a surprising

52:35.760 --> 52:37.640
lack of emo.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.320
Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldnít have it any other way.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.760
I saw what the new attorney looks like.

52:41.760 --> 52:54.640
You know, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.

52:54.640 --> 52:58.640
The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Starsign, Final Fantasy

52:58.640 --> 53:05.000
3, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52, Scourge the Hive, and Touch

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
Detective.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.640
Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?

53:07.640 --> 53:10.080
I mean, really, Iím teasing.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.400
Iím sure the gameís great.

53:11.400 --> 53:14.960
Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?

53:14.960 --> 53:19.280
Weíll go ahead and answer this part before we move on to the second part of the email.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.280
So what games would you guys recommend?

53:21.280 --> 53:23.480
Iíve heard really good things about Contact.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.880
I actually want to check out this game myself, but itís just too busy of a season for me

53:26.880 --> 53:29.520
to pick up games I donít know much about.

53:29.520 --> 53:34.120
Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love

53:34.120 --> 53:36.960
Owen Dawn, so Iím sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.

53:36.960 --> 53:40.800
Final Fantasy 3 looks very promising, but of course, as Iíve admitted in part A, Iím

53:40.800 --> 53:42.640
a whore for all things Final Fantasy.

53:42.640 --> 53:43.640
Yes, it is.

53:43.640 --> 53:47.400
Final Fantasy 5, too, because, you know, the game will advance, and do it in the Advance

53:47.400 --> 53:48.400
port as well.

53:48.400 --> 53:51.840
Miklotov, anything you can think of there for the DS?

53:51.840 --> 53:52.840
Or PSP?

53:52.840 --> 53:57.920
Well, Luminous 2 for PSP, and then youíre done.

53:57.920 --> 53:59.560
What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?

53:59.560 --> 54:01.560
I never played any of those, so I play Luminous 2.

54:01.560 --> 54:03.880
I almost bought Work Time Fun today, but...

54:03.880 --> 54:10.840
Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good, especially if youíre a fan of Luminous.

54:10.840 --> 54:15.200
For PSP, Tony Hawkís Project 8, thatís going to be coming out.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.400
Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.

54:17.400 --> 54:19.600
Iím trying to think what else.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
Really good stuff.

54:20.600 --> 54:24.000
Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP, SOCOM, if youíre into the first person shooter

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
stuff.

54:25.000 --> 54:31.000
Justice League is coming out, Marvel already came out, Ultimate Alliance.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Need for Speed, Carbon.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.160
Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP and DS.

54:35.160 --> 54:40.200
DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Starsign, Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery

54:40.200 --> 54:44.720
Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS, and Zappy says ìI heard WTF is horrible.î I donít

54:44.720 --> 54:47.240
know, I liked the demo at E3, it was kind of cute.

54:47.240 --> 54:52.920
Well honestly, graphically, itís a crap game, but play-wise, the things that were in there

54:52.920 --> 54:57.720
were just so crazy and out there, I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed

54:57.720 --> 55:00.720
in their spare time, but it is so funny.

55:00.720 --> 55:04.000
Also Pokemon Ranger is coming out, or actually came out.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Right.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.360
Plenty of suggestions for you, my friend.

55:08.360 --> 55:14.440
Well, thereís not too much, given the upcoming busy schedule Iím going to have when I start

55:14.440 --> 55:19.760
school in January, Iíve been trying not to get into too many handheld games because Iím

55:19.760 --> 55:25.480
not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them, but I am

55:25.480 --> 55:30.240
getting Final Fantasy III, Iíve planned on that, I do want Children of Mana, but Iím

55:30.240 --> 55:33.120
thinking about borrowing it with my friends when sheís done with it, and Iím definitely

55:33.120 --> 55:35.400
getting Elite Beat Agents.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.760
That Iím definitely getting.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.400
Oh yeah, am I getting it.

55:38.400 --> 55:43.560
But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores, so if you like

55:43.560 --> 55:45.800
your music games, Iím sure youíll like it.

55:45.800 --> 55:53.000
Right now, though, I did just pick up the, I forgot the name of it again, the Surgery

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
Game.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Oh, Trauma Center.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Trauma Center, yeah.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.600
I remembered Under the Knife and I was like, oh yeah, Trauma Center, and Iím going to

55:59.600 --> 56:05.960
be starting that coming up, so Iím looking forward to that.

56:05.960 --> 56:11.280
I have to eventually steal our copy of Phoenix right from Danís DS so I can play it.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.280
Was that the end of the mailbag?

56:12.280 --> 56:13.840
No, thereís more to this letter.

56:13.840 --> 56:14.840
Oh, Iím sorry.

56:14.840 --> 56:19.000
Iím also going to be playing, Iíve also got Loco Rocco on PSP, which I actually love.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.400
To finish up with the emails, also I just wanted to rant briefly about the PS3.

56:23.400 --> 56:29.200
Iím trying to want this system, but weíve got a Devil May Cry with no Dante and no Devil

56:29.200 --> 56:32.000
Trigger and Metal Gear Game with Snake committing suicide.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.440
Whatís next, a Street Fighter where Ryu gets tired of fighting?

56:36.440 --> 56:39.520
To end things on a happy note, what are your guysí favorite alcoholic drinks?

56:39.520 --> 56:45.520
I really enjoy a nice glass of Dewarís 12-year Scotch and Pale Ales, Oktoberfest, and other

56:45.520 --> 56:47.160
tasty specialty beers.

56:47.160 --> 56:49.640
Keep on rocking, Mr. Wonderful.

56:49.640 --> 56:54.040
Iíve been getting into wine lately.

56:54.040 --> 56:57.220
I know, arenít I weird, Iím getting snooty.

56:57.220 --> 57:02.040
If I feel like drinking something a little fufu, Iíll have a lemon drop, but if Iím

57:02.040 --> 57:07.680
going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.

57:07.680 --> 57:14.800
If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios Motherfucker, thatís what itís called.

57:14.800 --> 57:19.600
I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass Well tequila or I will be throwing up all

57:19.600 --> 57:20.600
over everybody.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.520
Thatís the one problem I have with an Adios is I donít like tequila, but otherwise itís

57:23.520 --> 57:24.520
a good drink.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.520
I like good tequila.

57:25.520 --> 57:32.640
Olive Garden has this, if you like fufu drinks, Olive Garden has the tastiest mixed berry

57:32.640 --> 57:33.640
daiquiri.

57:33.640 --> 57:34.640
Oh, sangria!

57:34.640 --> 57:35.640
Thatís the other thing Iíve been hooked on lately.

57:35.640 --> 57:39.280
Oh God, yeah, thatís my ultimate fufu drink.

57:39.280 --> 57:45.640
I would say for wines, Iím a very big fan of sweet wines, so I like Umeshu, which is

57:45.640 --> 57:50.480
a plum wine, actually real plum wine with the plums on the bottom of it, oh so good.

57:50.480 --> 57:59.560
And I like Honey Runís, itís elderberry honey wine, itís basically a fruit mead.

57:59.560 --> 58:04.600
I actually drink mead at Ren Faire, thatís the only time I actually have mead, because

58:04.600 --> 58:07.560
when itís hot and youíre having this honey drink, it goes right to your head, and youíre

58:07.560 --> 58:14.080
like, ìWow, Iím drunk.î My beer of choice is Shemay, the premier in the blue label,

58:14.080 --> 58:19.560
and I also like Fat Tire, Bass, Guinness.

58:19.560 --> 58:22.680
Rama in our chat room is pointing out, ìHey guys, you know we have underage people listening.î

58:22.680 --> 58:23.680
Iím answering the email.

58:23.680 --> 58:27.440
Donít drink until youíre 21, or 19 in Canada, or whatever it is.

58:27.440 --> 58:30.920
Or whatever country youíre in, legal limit.

58:30.920 --> 58:34.720
But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.

58:34.720 --> 58:39.440
Hereís our moral thing, and we do believe this, we never drive when we drink, always

58:39.440 --> 58:42.440
have a responsible driver, and just drink responsibly.

58:42.440 --> 58:49.680
And donít get drunk every night at home by yourself, because thatís a sign of depression,

58:49.680 --> 58:50.680
I think.

58:50.680 --> 58:55.720
Iím not going to say anything.

58:55.720 --> 58:58.640
I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.

58:58.640 --> 59:02.840
As long as youíre not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, thatís

59:02.840 --> 59:03.840
all.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.840
Or an NBC Monday night movie.

59:05.840 --> 59:09.560
We got a last minute email.

59:09.560 --> 59:15.320
Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay, Jamieís evil, and Lokiís stupid for hating

59:15.320 --> 59:16.320
Max.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.320
Love DMN.

59:17.320 --> 59:18.320
Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.600
Wait, we didnít get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Mikol Tov.

59:20.600 --> 59:24.160
Mikol Tov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?

59:24.160 --> 59:25.160
I donít drink anymore.

59:25.160 --> 59:26.160
Why not?

59:26.160 --> 59:31.640
Because I think, well, I wonít say why, but it has to do with some time I shouldnít have

59:31.640 --> 59:36.000
drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.360
I see, I see, yes.

59:38.360 --> 59:44.520
But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave

59:44.520 --> 59:45.520
and Busterís.

59:45.520 --> 59:47.640
I donít even remember what they were called, but they were so good.

59:47.640 --> 59:48.640
Ooh, chocolate martini.

59:48.640 --> 59:49.640
Oh, the grasshopper.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.640
The grasshopper.

59:50.640 --> 59:51.640
The frozen grasshopperís so good.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.000
Actually, Dave and Busterís has a really good lemon drop.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.120
All right, Loki, make it quick, we gotta get back to games.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.120
Screwdriver.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.120
All right.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.320
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send your emails, and maybe weíll get

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.680
off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:09.000
Letís get back into some news.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Excellent.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:16.520
Anyways, so, weíve got, you know, we mentioned a lot of games coming out recently, and of

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.160
course thereís going to be some more games coming out from EA, and during their last

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:25.680
earnings announcement, they announced a bunch of new titles, some not a big surprise, some

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:31.480
pretty cool, including Sims 3, which is a big duh, which is also going to be on the

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:38.320
Wii and Playstation 3, next gen version of Black, a brand new SimCity game and Lord of

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:49.640
the Rings, Crysis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring, and of course

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:57.640
some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs, a brand new Road Rash game for next gen,

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.080
and of course Burnout 5, itís been announced for a while now.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.720
Dude, new Road Rash?

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720
Yeah.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:11.120
Funny, I remember talking about Ghost Rider, part A, but whatever.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.920
You know, you want to know, ever since part A now, Iíve had Henry Rollins Ghost Rider

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920
running through my head.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.200
I have to go watch The Crow now.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:25.280
Okay, but anyway, things that, well, not surprising, Sony is warning of Playstation 3 pre-order

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280
scams.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:32.960
Theyíve issued a statement saying that websites offering discounted or book shipments have

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:39.600
not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:45.600
The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.840
its parent company, SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.500
their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.840
We recommend consumers purchase Playstation products only from authorized SCEA retailers

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.120
and resellers, which is a big duh anyway.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.160
You know, especially if youíre dealing with something thatís got a limited shipment,

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.960
donít order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.960
Common sense people.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:11.960
All right.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:12.960
So thatís it.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.120
All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last minute story because weíre about to

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.480
move into the Skype line and the other last minute stories.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.880
Tiger Claw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.680
about pre-ordering the Playstation 3.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.120
Apparently at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:37.420
out pre-order forms on bestbuy.com and it looked legit and everything.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.480
What happened I guess is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:44.000
using different accounts.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Very interesting.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.320
This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:55.520
public number and weíre assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:02.000
Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait and everybody that tried

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.360
to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.400
So if you want one from Best Buy, youíve got to camp out for it.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.400
We have a new 800 number here, actually I should say 877 or a toll free number here

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.240
at Orange Launch Radio and because of that reason weíve opened up our voicemails of

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.240
the week again.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.000
I guess word hasnít gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.760
but it was pretty good so we want to play it for you guys right now.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.920
So here it is, a voicemail of the week.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.840
Hey, OLR, itís Paradox Vincent.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:35.720
Yeah, now on In the Guru versus DDR and how fair Konami is, I agree with Dark Sakura on

01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:41.960
it, they just totally stole it and on that note, I just think that Session, Delaunay,

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:50.160
Rock from both and also I wanted to know if thereís any reason that the Xbox 360 version

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.440
of Phantasy Star Universe canít play with its PC and PS2 buddies because I bought it

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.800
and my friend bought it as well and we were all excited about it for months and months

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.240
and we finally get in there and we try lots of different channels and we canít find each

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:12.400
other so we finally end up on Segaís official site and it says ìOh goody, we can play with

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.240
Japanese playersî but some of them canít speak English so I donít really see the point

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:25.640
in this and theyíre just kind of losing a bigger server base and I really just donít

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:30.720
see the point in this so yeah, just keep it up with the show guys and Iíll be listening

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720
for a while.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.120
Alright, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week, we appreciate it.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.640
Mikl Tov, youíre a PSU whore, what did you think of the voicemail?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.200
So, because Iíve been playing Phoenix, right?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.200
Objection!

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.640
Because youíre doing false testimony, if youíve been following PSU for months and

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:52.140
months, youíd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:58.520
were separate so you are wrong and you should not lie on the road.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:02.400
But why, why canít they be on the same server?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:05.800
Because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything, and Final

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.360
Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:11.600
I always thought it was voice chat, it came down to the fact that 360 supported voice

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.600
chat within parties.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:19.400
That could be it too, but you know what, who cares, have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.400
Problem solved!

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.400
Everyone play on PC!

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400
Yeah, play on PC.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.400
Iím going to be playing both.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.400
Youíre going to play both?

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Iím playing both.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Thatís crazy hard to do.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:28.400
Youíre crazy.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:29.400
You are crazy.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.320
How you donít get in the set in that game, I couldnít support more than one character

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320
on one system.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:39.520
Well, no, a friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:45.440
So I was like, well okay, itís $10 a month, itís like, what, two burritos?

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:51.160
So I said, well okay, Iíll play on the PC, and itís something I can do while Iím doing

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.720
my live journal or doing other stuff.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.320
Thatís how I did PSO.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.960
And I can carry it around on my laptop.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.760
Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:02.360
Iím actually looking for, because if I get my iMac, Iím planning on dual formatting

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:05.720
it, so I can run Windows on my iMac.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.280
Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:19.240
The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657, thatís toll free in the US and Canada.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.620
Hey, weíll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:28.160
only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this, we want to know if you

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.400
are going to be camping out for a Playstation 3 or a Wii.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:36.120
And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.720
camping out for and why.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.960
And what are your plans for camping out?

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.380
What story are you going to go to?

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.640
Are you going with a big group of friends?

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.880
We want to know what your camp out plans are for.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.160
Even if youíre not camping out, we want to know why youíre not camping out and sitting

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160
this one out.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.160
So we welcome your voicemails.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:57.800
Weíll play some of our favorites next week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.720
Now weíre going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:07.660
Radio, and itís that same number, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name is Orange Lounge Radio on

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:08.660

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.360
Letís go to the phones.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.600
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600
Who is this?

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:18.600
Itís Ronma.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:19.600
No, Iím just kidding.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.600
Itís DMN.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:21.600
Hey, DMN.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:23.600
DMN.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.600
Not much.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.760
I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the week here, and Iíd like

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.000
to share my opinion of them.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.840
Heís a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early on.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
I know.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840
You get it early on.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840
Whatís your opinion on?

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.940
Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.160
of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:52.600
The gameplay is exactly like Oh and Don, it has the same comic book feel to it, itís

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:58.360
freaking hilarious, and surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.400
The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.360
songs, and it doesnít really adjust well into the next difficulty, because those last

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.400
three or four songs on medium are so incredibly hard, and then the first four or five on the

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.400
next hardest difficulty are easy.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:23.680
What Iím curious about, are songs like the Avril Lavigne song and stuff, are they grossly

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.320
out of place, or do they somehow work?

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.440
A lot of them are grossly out of place, Iíll be honest.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:38.720
Avril Lavigneís skater boy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.940
lady is about to have a baby.

01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:45.560
What about Canned Heat, whatís that stage like?

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:52.580
The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy of a Japanese motor company, his son goes through

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:57.720
the rival motor company whoís stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.860
That makes a lot of sense.

01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:00.860
It does.

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:04.280
Okay, what about the other game you picked up, quickly?

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.520
Magical Star Sign is a very very good RPG, I would recommend it as more so of a beginning

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:17.840
RPG, I enjoyed it, my only beef with it was that it felt very linear, basically it said

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.960
go here, go here, it didnít really make it fun, I havenít had a chance to try the multiplayer

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:28.480
mode on it, unfortunately, so I canít give any information on that, but Iíd recommend

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:35.760
it, itís a fun RPG, itís got a lot of fun little words of text in it, it keeps up with

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:40.080
the times, I would highly recommend it.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.000
Alright, sounds good, well that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.840
for good DS and portable games.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.960
Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Umm, no.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.480
Alright, then weíre going to another call, hey weíll see you pretty soon, okay?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.480
Alright, take care.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.480
Later.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:06.840
Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on the Skype line, itís 1-877-GAME-OLR,

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:15.760
thatís 1-877, what the hell are the numbers there, 426-3657, so letís go to another call

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.960
here on the Skype line.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.640
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio, whoís this?

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.680
Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:25.960
Hey, Jeremy Todd 1, whatís on your mind?

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:30.600
I got luminous for cell phones a couple of days ago.

01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.600
Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week, how was it?

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.200
Itís pretty good so far, I think they did a pretty good job on it.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.560
I have not heard what to say about it.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560
Okay.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.160
Iím doing a good job on this.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.160
Isnít it really surprising?

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160
What?

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.160
Isnít it really surprising just how well it turned out?

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:59.760
Yeah, Iím glad I bought it, itís $25 and itís pretty good, Jeremy, Iíve got to play

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760
you sometime.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:05.280
Can you play that one to Cell Network?

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.280
I donít know, can you?

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
I can actually.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280
Really?

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:10.280
Thatís kind of cool.

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.280
Like with Joolz, you could do that.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.280
Oh, thatís cool.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:23.840
Yeah, Iíve played a few matches with online and thereís no lag either.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.960
Do I hear somebody playing that in the background?

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.640
Turn down the damn music in the studio.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.640
Alright, well cool, then I guess maybe this is a mobile game Iíll have to seek out and

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.800
find, I donít know, weíll see.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.040
Any other mobile games youíve been playing lately?

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.400
No, Luminous is the only cell phone game I bought.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.240
Iím not into cell phone gaming much.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:49.200
Alright, Jeremy, tell one any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.880
Gears of War Tuesday.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.480
I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480
Alright, take care, buddy.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480
Have a good one.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480
Bye.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.480
Yep, you too.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.480
Thanks.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.480
Bye.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:03.120
Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.160
Hello, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.160
Whoís this?

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.520
Well, hello, how are you guys?

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520
Iím good.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520
Who is this?

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.760
You know who the fuck this is, Rob.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:19.000
If Iím not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.320
we announced in part A, is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon,

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320
yes?

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.880
Yes, Iíve crossed over to the dark side.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:26.880
Thatís right.

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.960
I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said youíll never do anything

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.800
with us, and yet, hell has apparently frozen over.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:41.000
And to go back to something way back in the USO times, I tried to get over the rainbow,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
and I couldnít.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.960
Thatís an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.920
Thatís all right, folks who maybe have been following the Understation Live for years

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:50.920
might follow.

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.920
You know we do have some folks here.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.280
Itís still every other year, right?

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.280
What was that?

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280
Still every other year.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.840
What, did we do a USO?

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.840
No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.840
Oh, thatís all right, itís an even year.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840
Yeah.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840
What does that mean?

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.600
That means Iíll be gay next year.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.240
Oh, looking forward to that.

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.080
All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience,

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.840
what do they have to look forward to?

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.480
You mean you couldnít tell by the promo?

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.600
Well, yeah, it was a little geeky.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.960
Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didnít get it.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960
Iím out there.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960
Itís the trailer.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:29.960
Itís fantastic.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.960
It is.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.360
It is from the season one teaser that they used for the Ninth Doctor, yeah, the Ninth

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360
Doctor.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.440
Which I think is fantastic.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:42.880
Iím big, Iím, you know, out there.

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.360
Now, youíre going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:50.200
everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us, right?

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Yeah.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.240
So, if youíre a Doctor Who fan, a Battlestar fan, a sci-fi fan, youíve got to tune in

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.120
to the Travis Donovan experience.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.400
Travis Donovan Live, otherwise known as TDL.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.120
TDL, sounds like fun.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.000
What time on Saturday are you going to be?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:15.280
Starting right now for about 9 oíclock Central Standards, which is 7 Pacific, 10 on the East.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.560
Alright, sounds good.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.240
Do you talk games on your program too?

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.640
Are you going to talk any games?

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.000
I will be.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.440
Games that Iím currently playing, which is not a lot, but there are games that Iím out

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.620
there playing, but we will be talking sci-fi and geek, like I will be going on a tirade

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:34.400
of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400
Excellent.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.240
And stuff like that, current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.520
twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:50.300
Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast

01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.880
version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.360
I am looking into that.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.640
Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.640
Alright.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.900
Well, everybody tune in on Saturday, come and chat, support Travis and then heíll see

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.640
he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.280
Yes, definitely show up and let me know whatís going on.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.320
Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, youíll

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.360
see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:24.160
Also, Iím going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Robís greater

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.880
moments in USL history.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.520
Jesus, alright.

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.680
I guess just encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680
Get Rob blackmail.

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.680
Thatís nice.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:41.200
Yeah, and Iíll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie who has

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.640
a sense of decency and politeness, itís all so small, itís a small percentage of her

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640
being.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.920
I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:55.880
No, I was actually going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.000
emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.880
I think I stole my post-it though because it was pretty funny.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.880
Alright.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
It should be fun.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.840
Alright, well good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.840
You have been assimilated.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:17.600
No, in all seriousness, weíre very excited to have you on board and look forward to what

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.640
youíre going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:20.800
Well, thank you.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:21.800
Thank you for having me.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:27.680
Iím glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show and guarantee

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.800
controversy for geeks out there on the first show.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.200
My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be cancelled and pull off the air.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.200
Ooh, sounds good.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:45.920
Actually given what Iíve heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly, I love Stargate, but yeah.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:46.920
What was I going to say?

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:47.920
Something about, oh, forget it.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920
I wonít.

01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920
No, say it.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:52.120
No, I canít remember because Iím old.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.120
Tune in Saturday.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120
Yes.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.120
Thatís all.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
Thatís Rob.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:57.120
Gay Alzheimerís.

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:00.960
Rob, Iím hanging up on you now because I can do that now.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.960
Yes.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960
All right.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960
Have a good one, Travis.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960
You too.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960
Bye.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.960
Oh, God.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.960
Did we make a mistake inviting him on?

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960
I donít know.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.560
No, but sadly, Iím not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.560
I donít know.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.360
I might call in and debate some sci-fi, but for right now, we got to go to another call

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360
that maybe we can debate with.

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.360
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360
Whoís this?

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.360
Hey, guys.

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360
This is Foodie Monster.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.360
Hi, Foodie Monster.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.360
Whatís on your mind?

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:25.360
Itís pretty lame, man.

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.080
Iíll tell you that this whole East Coast, West Coast thing is high me up the roof, seriously.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.920
You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.600
even that stay up very late.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.600
You guys are hardcore.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.880
Youíve earned your OLR badge of honor.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:41.480
Just every other night.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.320
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.760
I just wanted to share something that popped up in my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.120
to write about it, but Iím just sure I will call.

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:54.420
I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you got

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.420
to think about it.

01:17:55.420 --> 01:18:00.360
Games arenít going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped, and

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.960
thatís not just United States, Europe and Japan.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:09.000
Thatís South America, thatís Central America, thatís Africa.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:14.840
Those places also need to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.280
really mainstream.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.280
Movies are everywhere.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.040
You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you wonít find too much gaming

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.040
in Africa.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.360
Thatís an interesting perspective.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.800
Iíve never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:33.440
ìOh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesnít include

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.960
Europe when that whole thing went down.î A lot of people sometimes donít consider

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.200
any launch thatís been claimed to be worldwide.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.160
I donít think theyíve ever truly worldwide launched a system.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:50.320
I think, and correct me if Iím wrong, I think the Wii is the closest weíre getting.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.020
They are launching the Wii in a ton of countries, but still, we are missing out on places like

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:59.880
Africa, like you said, certain African countries, and certain South American countries as well.

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.280
It goes beyond that.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:06.240
Thereís no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance,

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.960
like not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any countries of America that has official

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.960
distribution of games.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:18.480
Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distribution of licensing here

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.600
in Argentina, but then they pulled out.

01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:26.840
Now, everything you buy is like grey market stuff, itís like click-sync, but only people

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:32.680
import it here, and you pay like, seriously, today a PS2 here is $300.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.800
You mentioned that, wait, you said the PS2 is $300?

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:37.800
Yeah.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800
Thatís double the price.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.480
I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, ìWait a minute.î

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.660
So gaming is more expensive generally in the other countries.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:51.200
Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up like a Nintendo of Argentina

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:52.200
or whatever?

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:58.360
Well, I mean, they should at least have like a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:02.040
to make things cheaper for all the markets.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.440
Is there enough of a demand?

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:08.680
I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:09.680
million people.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680
I would say yes.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680
Interesting.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.680
Interesting.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680
I mean, sure.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.880
I mean, itís not as much, probably thatís why they didnít do it, because thereís not

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.760
much market, you know.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.760
Interesting.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.560
I mean, if you consider it with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.400
general, itís not enough market, I guess.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400
Hmm.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:32.640
Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640
We appreciate that.

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.120
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.080
No, but I have a quick a few of my mocha dice, and now I canít play my backups, which has

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.360
to be very sad.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.360
Sorry to hear it.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:45.360
All right.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.360
Have a good one, buddy.

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360
Thanks for calling.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:48.360
Okay.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:49.360
You too, guys.

01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:50.360
Later.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:51.360
Okay.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360
Thanks.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.360
Thank you.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.360
Muah.

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:55.360
One more call.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.360
What, Miklotov?

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.360
Okay.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.360
Letís go to one more call here.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.360
Hi.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.360
Youíre on Orange Laundry Radio.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.360
Whoís this?

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.360
Hey.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.360
This is Paradox Vincent.

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360
Hi, Paradox Vincent.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.360
Hey.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360
You left us the voicemail.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.360
Yes.

01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:08.360
Ah.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360
Whatís on your mind?

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360
Oh.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360
Did it get played?

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360
Yeah.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.360
We actually played your voicemail, and Miklotovó

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.360
Called you a liar.

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:15.360
Yeah.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.580
Miklotov called you a liar, because he said if youíve been following the Phantasy Star

01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:19.920
Universe thing, like he said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:20.920
were separate?

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:21.920
Yeah, I win.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.920
Good job.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:23.920
You won the case, Miklotov.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:24.920
Good job.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.920
Yes.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.920
I'm the best finisher.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:34.360
In all seriousness, paradox Vincent, what's on your mind tonight?

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:40.200
Well I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.880
Yeah, what's on your mind?

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:52.400
Well I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because, I don't know, it was just

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.680
kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.760
So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?

01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760
Yes.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.160
And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:08.400
You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.400
crap aside?

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:18.040
Yeah, kind of, because I didn't really see it being so overblown, kind of like the Gran

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.360
Turismo HD.

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.120
Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120
I guess that's true.

01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:28.280
Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and the Gran Turismo certainly

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.160
kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.440
I suppose that's true.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.840
So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.920
What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:44.360
Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.320
that kind of gets you into it?

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:54.880
Yeah, it's kind of that because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.600
just like a giant leap in the resolution.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.600
You know what though?

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:04.180
Miklotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.600
was sometimes a problem in Luminous?

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:13.600
Yeah, I think that it gets too bright and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:16.840
at it over and over for hours on hours.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:20.400
I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those Luminous stages make

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.600
me want to have a seizure.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:26.960
Yeah, that one in the basic pack, I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.360
and neon pink.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.160
That hurts my eyes.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.200
It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.200
I hate that one.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.840
I hate that one from the stupid first game.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.840
What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.960
Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:47.440
What else do you think you're going to buy?

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:54.560
It kind of depends on the artist pack because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shih, then

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.480
I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard from, I think it was maybe Luminous

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:03.480
2 for the PSP that had them.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.380
I'm a giant fan of those.

01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:10.440
But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:15.240
Yeah, kind of.

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:16.840
Do you like that?

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.020
The folks that are supporting the microtransactions in Luminous say, I kind of like being able

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.960
to build the game the way I want it.

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.360
If I don't want missions, I take them out.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360
Do you like that?

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.120
Is that appealing to you?

01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:34.380
I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.

01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:41.720
I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions but made

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:47.320
them very small and very typecasted.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.040
Do you think they added charge per skin?

01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040
Charge per skin?

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040
In Luminous?

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.040
It's different.

01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:57.940
That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't

01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:00.000
like, like that bird one that's green and white.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I hate that stage so much.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.600
Paradox Vinson, thanks so much for calling in.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.600
We've got to move on.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:12.080
Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.800
Not really kind of a final thought, but yeah, all right.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:17.800
Okay.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.520
Have a good one, buddy.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:21.520
Thanks for calling in.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.520
All right.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520
You too, guys.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.520
Keep it up.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.520
Bye.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:27.240
Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.240
Think of something clever to say.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.200
Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have come up with something better.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.360
He admitted you pwned him.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:33.360
I know because I'm awesome.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.680
What a nice guy.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.680
I would have tried to fight you.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:36.680
I would have taken you out.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.880
I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.120
Do you want to do one more call?

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120
One more call?

01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120
We're running a little long.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:44.120
We have time for one more call?

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.120
One more?

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120
What do you guys think?

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120
One more?

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120
All right.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.120
One more.

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:50.120
Sure.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.120
Let's do it.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:52.120
Hi.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.120
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.120
Who's this?

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120
It's Zappy from the chat room.

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.120
It's who?

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120
Zappy from the chat room.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:58.120
Hi, Zappy.

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:03.720
I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for the past week and a half, and it's actually

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.720
pretty decent.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:09.160
I don't find this missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160
Wait.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160
Which game was this again?

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.160
Because you're cutting out a little bit.

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.160
Oh, sorry.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.400
Medal of Honor for the PSP.

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:20.640
You're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying or what?

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640
Yes.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:28.080
You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually be controlling

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:29.080
pretty well.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:36.640
I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:39.160
PCT, first person shooters.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.160
Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.760
Knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:49.760
person shooters.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:55.280
I kind of like Prey and I really like my old school Doom and Quake 3 and stuff.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.680
Try to sell me on this game.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.000
What's in this game that I might enjoy?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.840
Well, probably the best part of it is the 3D player multiplayer.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:08.720
It has all the modes and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.440
a pretty good selling point.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.160
You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.

01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.160
That's kind of cool.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:15.160
Okay.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.160
I like.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.160
I think Capcom only has 16 players in it.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.600
Well, thank you for the review of the game.

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.200
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.200
Well, I'll probably go to the Arcadia convention next week and I'll give you some hands-on

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:29.560
how it is.

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.680
Are you not far from Montreal?

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.680
I'm in Montreal.

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.280
Oh, right on.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.280
What other kinds of stuff?

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:38.520
Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.480
Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystiq, although I haven't seen

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.040
any real advertisements on Billboards, no, not Billboards, but the pamphlets or anything.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.720
I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:54.840
That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:58.880
or maybe flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.440
Well, if this is the second you're doing it, I didn't go last year, but they're going to

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:08.880
have the Wii and a bit change early, so I just want to try it out.

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.440
Yeah, that's true because Nintendo is one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.440
going to see the Wii.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.440
That's pretty cool.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:15.040
You can only go to Arcadia.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:21.200
We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.280
We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.760
Great to hear.

01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:25.760
All right.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.760
Have a good one, Zappi.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.120
We got to let you go and get the show over with, but have a good one.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120
Thanks for calling in.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:31.120
All right.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.120
Have fun at Arcadia.

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.120
Later.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:34.120
All right.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
Oh, that was a hang-up noise.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.120
All right.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.240
Well, thank you guys so much for calling in.

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:40.160
We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.880
It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.000
through every week are getting frustrated, but surely you guys can understand we want

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.780
to get as many different perspectives as we can, but we're just running a little long

01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:56.160
and about out of time, but I will ask really quickly in studio, are there any last-minute

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160
questions?

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.160
Those of you guys that didn't get through could always leave a voicemail.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.160
Exactly.

01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.680
You could always leave a voicemail of the week, so try that.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.680
Please leave a voicemail.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:02.680
Yeah, please do.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:05.160
Any last-minute stories here in studio?

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.400
Yes, of course.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:08.400
You first.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.400
Okay.

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.120
The last one I have is the one you pointed out to me.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:13.120
Oh.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.120
Okay.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:18.160
Well, anyways, I was going to say if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.120
a couple of websites you might want to check out.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:23.120
First ps3seeker.com.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.120
You can check it out.

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:29.120
They actually are tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:35.960
locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii or PS3, and then

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.280
of course the Wii would be ps3seeker.com slash Wii.

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.640
So check that out as well for the Wii.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.260
And then some other things.

01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:52.200
Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:58.840
happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:04.840
That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:09.240
You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon, because apparently Gears of War

01:30:09.240 --> 01:30:12.960
is in their store right now, or at least it's some Best Buys.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.360
Uh oh, broken street date.

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.360
Oopsie.

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:17.360
Oh well.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.440
So you might want to check and see if you can score a copy early, because that would

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440
be pretty cool.

01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.800
And of course there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.560
Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:33.640
I'm not sure how well that would play, and then PSP is getting Pump It Up in Korea, so

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.360
that's kind of interesting.

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:43.320
And also something that I thought was very strange, the Blu-Ray, since the Blu-Ray drives

01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.600
are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:51.960
of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive,

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:54.440
which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.720
For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install five gigs of the game onto your

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:02.320
hard drive, and imagine all these other games doing the same thing.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:06.760
That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:14.360
And finally, with the fall update for the 360, adding 1080p support, unfortunately some

01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:22.320
of the Sony 1080p LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.960
Isn't that ironic, isn't it?

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.580
Don't you think?

01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:27.580
It's like Ray Yang.

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:28.580
Hey, hey, no Alanis.

01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.580
All right.

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:37.480
There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier, it was on Dick.com, but I found actually

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:40.080
a bit more about it on magazine.com.

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:44.240
You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:53.320
A working Lego Pinball Machine, yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.020
So that's so freaking cool.

01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.400
I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:04.960
There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two player.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:09.200
And the rumor is coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.480
both state that Zelda is one of the two players.

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:17.560
So that's kind of interesting, I guess we'll have to find out.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:18.560
Hmm.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.760
Sure, it's not just a misprint or something?

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:25.320
It could be, but it's two different places, so I don't know, what else?

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:30.480
All right, well, gosh, we're kind of running long tonight, so we had a long bonus segment,

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.280
of course, though, that unfortunately those of you guys that listen to us on the audio

01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.280
blog feed won't be able to hear it.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.280
Sorry, that's just incentive to listen live to us on OrangeLaundryDay.com or on AllGames.com.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.840
Hey, we've got to do something special for the live folks, surely you guys will understand.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.640
DMN has informed me of something.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:50.640
What's that?

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.920
It's DJ Tyrant's birthday.

01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Is it really?

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:53.920
That's what he said.

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.800
Well, happy birthday, that's right, I remember seeing something in the LJ about it, and I

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.560
believe he is of the legal age of 21 now.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.560
Oh.

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.400
So strippers and booze for you, my friend.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.680
It's also my mother's birthday.

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.040
Oh, how nice.

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:06.040
Yes.

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.960
My mommy is 48 today.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:11.960
She told me she was 29, and I said, pardon my French mom, bullshit.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:16.200
All right, well, happy birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200
this period.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:20.040
Maybe we should have a birthday list, and then right at the end of every show we'll

01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.000
say happy birthday to these listeners, we'll see.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.160
Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:30.000
Miklotov, thank you for your rare input, as always, but thanks for being the moral support

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.320
you are for this program.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.460
Actually, you hate this show, don't you, so I'm not sure why you come on it, but what's

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:36.460
your final thought anyway?

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.960
I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:38.960
And don't.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.960
Okay.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.800
Loki, what's your final thought?

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:46.320
Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at U3.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320
All right.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:50.000
Dark Sakura.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.120
Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.400
And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now, like pumpkin pie would

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.400
be awesome.

01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:08.680
Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week, and so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.800
Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.160
You guys are awesome.

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.200
We couldn't do this without you.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:15.200
Have a great week.

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.200
We'll see you next time.

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:21.280
