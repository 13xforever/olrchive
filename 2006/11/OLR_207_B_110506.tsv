487	1368	Orange Lounge Radio
15436	19119	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19499	21540	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
21580	23181	This is episode number 207.
24482	25863	And let's get right back into it.
25903	27404	We've got more gaming news for you guys.
27444	30926	I'm going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.
31307	38311	The much-anticipated Fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st, just like it was speculated last week.
38351	39532	We talked about that on this program.
40112	40213	And...
41234	45064	What's interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.
46471	55916	And when we say brick the console, that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three red lights of Doom to appear, and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that cannot play games.
56336	60838	It was said, though, that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.
61098	71163	But I know we had a listener, I want to say it was Alex, who was in our chat room earlier, saying he was one of the lucky less than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money to fix it.
71914	73095	And I'm thinking, that is messed up.
73115	74135	That's not what I read.
74175	78678	I read people were actually being able to send them back, but that's pretty fucked up if they wanted money.
78818	81099	I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.
81860	84201	The official quote from Microsoft did come from this.
84501	88823	We are hearing from a small number of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with the fall console update.
89104	92125	I've been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.
92145	93406	We'll let you know when the issue is resolved.
93706	97008	If you're having problems with the update for any reason, please call Xbox Support.
97386	102449	We're working with those affected to get them back up and running and we're committed to making sure the update doesn't cause problems for anyone else.
102949	106591	So don't take that $140 for an answer.
106731	111854	No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing for you.
111894	114056	They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.
115056	116477	Especially since they're aware of the problem.
118518	120799	That's just, there's no excuse for that.
120920	125162	Blackboy in our chatroom did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that got bricked.
126311	126491	Good job.
126511	127751	That's still a big number.
128131	130432	Wow, that's something else.
130472	132733	They need to figure out how to unbrick them and fast.
133053	136013	And I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.
136053	136334	I don't know.
136354	138734	That's kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that.
138794	141135	But I don't know the technical end of it.
142015	145536	Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was.
146496	150437	Eragon, the demo for that is available on Xbox Live.
150477	151557	It's a 415 megabyte download.
154745	156565	So you can check it out.
156765	161226	My problem with the book is that the book, as far as I've gotten through it, is so very poorly written.
161246	163747	It reads like it was written by a 12-year-old.
164147	168468	So hopefully the game is better than how poorly written the book is.
169128	170528	The demo's not better at all.
170608	172129	It's absolutely crap.
172149	174149	So the demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?
174589	181851	Yeah, and I'm not sure if you've played it, but if you've played Konami's King Arthur, it's about the same level of crap, and that's really bad.
182311	183731	It's boring hack and slash.
184895	185896	That sounds pathetic.
185976	187196	I don't even know what this game is about.
187236	206728	I know there's a movie, but... Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that he's a dragon rider and gets pulled into all the dragon riding nonsense and everything, but... Well, to defend the writer of the book, I did hear that he did start it in his teens, but that's what beta readers are for.
207109	207429	Use them.
208830	212912	Which the entirety of the fanfiction writing community should also know that, too.
213453	213893	But, um...
215442	220544	I don't see why the book got all this attention and why they're making a movie of it.
220764	223365	I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.
223645	225465	Yeah, I saw them recently also.
225605	226306	It's sad.
226906	228446	So the game is just hack and slash?
228786	231667	That's as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted.
232888	233528	It wasn't fun.
233568	236809	It looked like a PS2 game and not even like a current...
237369	238750	Generation of PS2 games.
238810	240070	It looks like a step back.
240130	245553	Well, it's developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they were all hack-and-slashy, too.
246774	247094	I don't know.
247314	248394	It didn't look that bad.
248475	250976	The screenshots I've seen look pretty good, but I haven't played the demo yet.
250996	251796	Screenshots aren't playing.
253477	253977	Oh, snap.
254498	254878	Oh, no.
254898	256298	Um, anyways.
257599	263462	That's actually NVIDIA's big game for, um... Well, actually, no, I guess Fury would be the big game for November.
264202	265323	Anywho, um...
265942	269884	So that fall update for the 360, it did some good.
270644	282089	And what that would be is actually, well, it's helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives modded to play backed up games.
282929	288031	And so actually they've started banning some of these people that supposedly have modded systems.
288691	295014	The funny part about it, though, is they're also banning some people that don't have modded systems but are saying that they are modded.
295504	304293	So they don't really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try to stop some of those people from pirating stuff.
305314	306715	Because pirating is bad.
307896	308457	Totally.
309398	310499	I feel so weird saying that.
312053	320840	Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably be downloading anytime soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.
321580	325904	Some brand new maps came out for free if you're an Xbox Live Gold member.
326204	326844	Hmm, interesting.
326884	328746	Another perk about being a Gold member.
329166	332048	You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this.
332369	335731	They are updated version of GoldenEye 64 maps.
336452	340074	Facility and Temple, those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.
340094	340755	That's kind of cool.
341321	342521	if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.
343321	345462	I sold my Perfect Dark Zero because I didn't like it.
345482	346582	I just couldn't get into it.
346662	348282	It felt weird.
348662	352483	No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.
354003	354983	That's my opinion.
355984	358964	But GoldenEye was a good game.
359024	359304	I don't know.
359324	360224	I still play Doom.
360764	361825	And GoldenEye was good.
364045	366105	Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.
366365	366605	At all.
367105	367405	I don't know.
367626	368046	I'm sorry.
368066	370326	It just wasn't good for me.
371860	372761	DarkTetsuya is happy.
372801	374221	He says Facility was awesome.
374661	377963	So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.
377983	378544	You know what they need?
378944	379124	What?
379684	381825	They need to put out a goddamn TimeSplitters game.
382666	383286	That was awesome.
383546	384166	Make your own maps.
385207	393211	Well, at any rate, there's been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.
393852	400315	Basically, there is Ninja Ball, which is basically carrying a ball around.
401364	404006	Tank Flag, where a tank carries the flag.
404967	410211	And Elimination, on that one you're supposed to kill off five opposing team members.
410571	412232	With a 16 player limit.
412952	416495	They also mention more about the Spartan Laser.
417936	426622	It's saying that the weapons application will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.
427263	430505	So it's sort of like lock targeting computer fire.
431637	459019	the man cannon funny it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles in looping arcs over the battlefield and there's also saying that they'll be able to fire or you can be shot down while you're in air there's also with the warthog and ghost vehicles they are going to control similarly to how they do in Halo 2 um
461414	465316	But they're not saying what the X button is going to be used for.
467457	468858	It's a secret.
469238	471460	The rumor for the X button was steel weapons.
472220	478904	Because apparently you're going to be carrying your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.
479524	483486	Oh, to stop people who whore certain weapons during the whole game?
483546	484447	That would be interesting.
485227	488289	Yeah, I've heard that you're going to be able to see the weapons on people.
488309	489530	That's kind of cool.
489750	490190	Interesting.
490888	491508	That is kind of cool.
493009	500312	By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in a first-person shooter, JeremyTodd1 says, In Gears of War, you can't jump, and that's one of the best games coming out.
502472	503133	It's a little stupid.
505053	505434	I don't care.
506574	510836	Even if it has high production values, it's still retarded that you cannot jump.
511276	512236	I mean, come on now.
512316	513216	We're in the next gen.
513256	515978	We need to have jumping technology.
516418	517178	That's what we need.
519102	527063	Anywho, so some things that are also ridiculous out there is, and we talk about this every week, it's not a huge surprise.
527123	531564	Another EA game comes out and, you know, more microtransactions.
532004	536825	Well, you know, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.
537605	546487	One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours the collector's edition.
546667	548347	So you can get the extra cars.
549399	550740	and whatnot, extra tracks.
552001	556444	And of course, they're going to have some unlockables that you can buy.
557445	563069	Pretty much the same deal as all the other EA games that they've been charging microtransactions for.
563669	567572	So this is just going to be something that we're going to see going forward, I'm thinking.
568092	569633	So if you don't like them, don't buy them.
569853	570414	That's what I say.
570714	572055	That's exactly what it boils down to.
572075	573476	If you don't like this, don't buy it.
573896	575537	Don't encourage other people to buy it either.
576198	576398	So...
576977	580059	It's time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.
580079	580379	I don't know.
580419	581500	They can be cool sometimes.
581820	583281	I mean, new maps, new songs.
583381	584362	I mean, that's kind of neat, but...
584972	587895	I don't know about this whole buying something that you're going to get in the game later.
588435	592179	And doesn't that just seem... I still can't get over the whole thing that we talked about.
592219	599045	I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.
599325	600406	That just seems... I don't know.
600726	604490	Just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes to get through their games, and that's how they want to do it.
604750	605891	And that's how they have fun doing it.
605931	608533	Especially in a sandbox game, you know, maybe they don't want the challenge.
608553	610155	They just want to have fun going around and blowing people up.
610195	610415	Like I...
610894	612615	I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans.
612815	615236	Just put in all the cheat codes and just ran around and blew things up.
615596	616117	And that's fun.
616657	618738	No, I'm not talking about you, actually, although you probably did this, too.
619878	620339	Yes, I did.
620699	621559	So, I don't know.
621579	624701	It just kind of seems like it's taking advantage of those people.
625081	626562	It's taking candy from a baby.
627222	634646	Well, it's just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row at lunch because we're not actually saving the game or doing any progress.
634666	636266	We're just running around blowing shit up.
636967	638267	And that's how we spend our lunches.
639048	639468	Because, you know,
640267	642049	Saints Row is very much like Grand Theft Auto.
672034	679058	The week goes towards the Jehovah's Witness that knocked on the door to Kristen's house before I left today.
681099	686142	I'm hiding behind the corner because I know I'm going to have choice words for this one.
686202	691145	But she's like, she's coming to the door and Kristen's like, Hi, can I help you?
691485	695627	And she's like, Oh, I have very important information for you.
695907	700810	Here's your own personal copy of things to help you understand what's going on in the world.
701765	702465	Is this religious?
702766	703906	No, it's from the Bible!
705967	706748	Excuse me!
707468	718813	And then she proceeds to go on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian or believes in God or anything like that.
719654	726617	It's, first of all, the woman tries to lie about her purpose for being there, which is very unchristian-like.
727546	729467	Then again, we've had this for centuries.
729607	731728	Oh, the Crusades, the Witch Hunts, how about that?
733129	739831	But anyway, she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference.
739871	749376	And the thing is, is that you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing that you do.
750056	751076	It doesn't work.
751557	755919	And finally, I'm like, and Kristen's like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!
756479	756859	I'm like, shh.
757799	760960	So, I said, okay, here's my take on this.
761900	764061	The Bible was written by human beings.
764441	765501	God did not write it.
765581	766822	God told them what to put in it.
767162	771363	Therefore, when God comes to Earth and says, here's a book that I wrote by myself.
772043	772963	I hope you like it.
773943	775484	Then I will take the Bible literally.
776484	779145	And then I said, thank you very much, goodbye, and shut the door.
780105	786447	She gave me this look like, utter disbelief, like, oh my God, nobody's ever pointed that out to me before.
787327	789208	and turned around and left in stunned silence.
790249	792650	And all I could say was, oh my god, I'm so hardcore.
793210	803696	This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico and remember Prop 22 here in California, which was the one that said they were going to write marriage is only between a man and a woman in the state constitution or whatever, right?
804036	811240	And this woman came to my door and was like, yes, I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.
811280	815683	How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?
815743	816123	And I'm like,
816978	819139	Honey, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.
819579	819959	And she did.
823260	824281	But she was embarrassed.
824301	826241	She was like, oh, oh, I see.
826261	829002	I'm like, you're not going to catch it.
829663	830743	But run.
830863	832123	I'm a very open-minded person.
832163	833824	I grew up Southern Baptist.
833884	834604	I mean, jeez.
835285	836885	If I could escape that with an open mind.
836905	837265	Me too.
838126	838426	Me too.
838826	844948	If I could escape growing up Southern Baptist in Alabama with an open mind, then I'm fairly tolerant.
845467	848108	of people's religious, you know, preferences.
848889	867758	But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.
869060	871562	We've got to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.
871722	884211	I know, but I really, I really, I especially dislike, with any argument, anyone coming into something with a, oh, well, I just think it's because, you know, you should.
885132	890856	I think we can kind of end on the note and say, you know, if you are totally religious, then, like, that's cool.
890916	891937	We totally respect that.
891957	896120	Like, you know, one of my best friends is a very religious person, and I totally respect that because, you know,
896653	897273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
918755	919876	We gotta move on.
919996	921717	Anyways, I have to read this in chat.
921797	930442	RPGKing7 says, No, what's better is these two fairly hot Jehovah's Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, If God loves me, then you'll show me your tits.
931443	932244	That's disgusting.
932684	933665	Come on, let's keep it moving.
933905	936586	Anyways, F you to Comcast.
937027	945452	Because I upgraded to Comcast's HD service, and first off, there aren't that many channels anyways, but second off, this
945996	946477	and DarkSakura.
969955	970916	My F.U.
970996	975419	goes to my taste buds because I'm constantly craving junk food all week.
975459	976720	Like right now, I'm craving pie.
979282	979622	That's it.
979882	980723	Miggletop, do you have anything?
980743	983885	I have two short ones.
984246	985987	I'm doing a preemptive F.U.
986587	995914	to Endemiro for not including Lizanka and the new Pump It Up mix that's going to be announced this month because I know it won't be there because they don't like me enough.
996835	997615	And then F.U.
997655	998256	to myself.
998939	1001420	for not trying to jump on Taco Bell Boy today.
1002360	1003480	He's still really hot.
1004641	1006401	Hey, Rob, I have one more.
1007041	1007261	What?
1007821	1011182	This is on behalf of several friends of mine.
1012203	1015103	When... Okay, men, remember this.
1015744	1025406	If you try to hit on somebody while they're at work and say, I'm sorry, I'm a lesbian, don't say, oh, that's okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.
1026226	1028327	They don't want your cock pissed off.
1029315	1030256	They want pussy.
1032877	1035058	Thank you for that blunt explanation.
1035138	1045344	Well, you have to be blunt because the majority of straight men out there only think, I say majority, most that I've encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy and it's not their brain.
1045445	1051888	Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because that is very true.
1051928	1054550	That's true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.
1055819	1056680	Men just want to watch.
1056720	1057000	You know what?
1057060	1059402	Yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.
1059443	1061985	I'm like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesn't really work that way.
1062305	1063206	I'm not programmed for that.
1063787	1063987	Anyway.
1064693	1068034	Anyway, we're getting into TMI, so let's get into some game releases.
1068094	1071094	Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.

1088117	1092098	My Kinoto Hime is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2 in Japan, which...

1121315	1123756	and we have this interesting title.
1124116	1125436	Let's see how bad I can butcher this.
1125456	1126217	Was that Hinotori?
1127497	1127877	Which one?
1128157	1129498	The one you said before, Hinotori?
1130978	1131498	Oh, God.
1131618	1131979	Sorry.
1132239	1132439	Oh, no.
1132899	1134079	It's separated.
1134159	1135340	It's Hinotori-hen.
1135640	1136940	Okay, that means firebird.
1137400	1138381	Oh, that's what it is.
1139181	1140401	And then we have this one as well.
1140421	1141762	This should be interesting on the DS.
1142182	1142282	It's...
1143451	1150435	Mizas, Shoujo Manga Ka, Chao Manga School So this is how to be a shoujo manga artist?
1150575	1169604	Pretty much, it looks like, no, it looks like it actually takes place like in a school I'm looking at some of the screenshots Manga Ka is a manga writer Oh yeah, look, see Shoujo is girl See, look, it teaches you how to draw Basically it's going to teach you how to draw Sailor Moon Yeah, see, look, there it is Yeah Coming out from TDK Mediactive I actually think I'll get that game That might be kind of fun
1171523	1173084	The Importers are winning $48.90 for it.
1173124	1175366	Dude, I'll get it.
1175526	1177927	Gotta love those import games and their high, high prices.
1178087	1180789	Well, hey, if you do doujinshi or you're an artist, that's a good game for you.
1180889	1183671	I need to give PSP a little love real quick as well.
1183691	1188715	They're also getting some games, mostly Koei Entertainment's bringing out some stuff into their Best series.
1188795	1194398	Nobunaga no Yabu is going into the Best series as well as La Corte d'Oro.
1194438	1196019	Looks like this one's a new game that's coming.
1196159	1198441	No, it's just going into Koei Selection.
1199400	1208167	Harukanaru Jikunouchi Day 2 Enjoy if you're in Japan and have access to those games.
1210288	1215172	Well, speaking of games that aren't in Japan, how about our friends over in Europe?
1216293	1220256	So let's see what is coming out in the upcoming week, shall we?
1221317	1224519	Coming out on the 6th, we have Football Manager 2007 on 360 and PSP.
1229329	1246657	Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe Sega Genesis Collection Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Team Saber Mario Slam Basketball, Point Blank for the DS
1247313	1247553	Anywho.
1271868	1272689	Of course, the U.S.
1272729	1275291	is going to be seeing one hell of a week for releases.
1276212	1295525	Starting off, of course, with the portable stuff, we've got Elite Beat Agents coming out on the DS, Digimon World DS, My Frogger Toy Trials, crap, and let's see here, Winx Club, The Quest for Codex, also crap, and let's see.
1295545	1297787	Wait, wait, I thought Miklatov was a fan of the Winx games.
1299705	1300666	I just work on them.
1300886	1302167	I'm not really a fan.
1302628	1303048	Never mind.
1303088	1304810	I better not grill you further or you might get in trouble.
1305110	1305730	Game Boy Advance.
1305790	1310454	Final Fantasy V Advance is coming out and Polarium Advance as well.
1312316	1314578	Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers I've ever played.
1314678	1316299	I would not be interested in it on the Advance.
1316820	1325347	On the PC we've got Final Fantasy XI Vanadil Collection 2007 in case you're not a member of Final Fantasy XI yet.
1325848	1327169	Left Behind Eternal Forces.
1327887	1357288	The Godly Grand Theft Auto Game The Sims 2 Happy Holiday Stuff And of course if you have a Microsoft Flight Simulator The Aircraft Power Pack will be coming out Then on a lot of systems Call of Duty 3 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360 We've got Tony Hawk's Project 8 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox, and Xbox 360 Luminous 2 on the PSP
1360878	1380804	Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Guitar Hero 2, The Sopranos and The Sopranos Collector's Edition, SOCOM US Navy Seals Combined Assault for the PlayStation 2, Sega Genesis Collection on PlayStation 2 and PSP, Gears of War, Viva Piñata,
1389404	1397929	and of course, one of my favorites to sell at least, the History Channel, American Civil War, Nation Divided on PS2 and 360.
1397989	1401091	Another budget Activision game for you.
1402111	1402692	And Blitz Elite.
1403752	1404072	That's it.
1404533	1405053	Lots of stuff.
1407834	1410956	Alright, should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, that's for sure.
1411476	1412537	Oh my god, yeah, seriously.
1413630	1417232	It's like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.
1417372	1420854	Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.
1421634	1424256	Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split-screen.
1425136	1430499	Alright, changing topics completely to something that's already out, but maybe we didn't know about that's in stores.
1430819	1436962	One of our listeners, actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted.
1437401	1438882	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1461664	1462204	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1488564	1502731	But what's interesting about this is that, you know, some folks have also been bringing up, well, this is a way for maybe folks who can't really afford the whole system and the more expensive game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of the game telling them they suck.
1502831	1503232	I don't know.
1503612	1512437	And also, if you don't have a dance mat and you don't have the game, dropping $70 or, you know, $49.99 or whatever for the game and dance mats a little much.
1512917	1515958	So, I don't know, maybe $20 for a DVD.
1516299	1517099	It's not so bad.
1518920	1523921	I'm kind of surprised it's not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry Shortcake DDR or what have you.
1525302	1528162	So, well, we'll see.
1528382	1534504	Anyway, this guy, El Mullitz, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with the Internet.
1534704	1540306	DarkSakura surfs the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with all of you guys.
1540346	1542406	And it's called the Website of the Week.
1542726	1545867	And DarkSakura is going to tell you what her browser is looking at right now.
1550256	1558119	Well, the website of the week after lots of looking is thecatsite.com.
1558520	1562001	Yes, it's a site all about cats and how to take care of them.
1563002	1565703	It has things about kittens.
1567023	1575367	It has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior, hairball care.
1575987	1578168	I recommend going to thecatsite.com.
1578548	1579889	Yes, I have a cat.
1580276	1583979	There is Shermie, and Shermie has benefited from this site.
1584980	1592507	So go to thecatsite.com I have to admit, I prefer dailykitten.com for my cat needs, my cat-loving needs.
1592567	1595809	Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.
1596190	1599513	Or stuffonmycat.com I've already done stuff on my cat, remember?
1599553	1600854	That's right, you did, a long time ago.
1601554	1603016	They need stuffonmybaby.com
1604903	1608366	I think that'd be funny, because people put weird things on their babies.
1609126	1610787	I don't know if you should encourage that.
1612688	1613589	Is there one already?
1613689	1615590	Oh, I'm worried I'm going to get porn or something.
1615610	1616051	Let's try this.
1616511	1629319	www.stuffonmybaby.com Oh, this page is parked free, courtesy of godaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.
1630760	1631181	How nice.
1633122	1633382	All right.
1633757	1639499	So I guess there's no stuff on my baby yet, but GoDaddy says there's one coming soon, as soon as someone buys the domain from him.
1639519	1644742	I'm telling you, the stuff on my cat, you know, the new stuff on my baby, because people dress up their kids really stupidly.
1644762	1646542	They have a stuff on my cat calendar now.
1647383	1650144	All right, how about stuff on my politician?
1650724	1653165	I don't know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.
1653205	1662929	Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign commercial going on, and it's basically, he's this ultra-conservative guy,
1663385	1669149	and he's bragging about his support of video game violence initiatives.
1669669	1671471	Taking a stand against video game violence.
1671811	1682778	But what should be noted about this commercial that Game Politics points out is that in the commercial Santorum delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers towards the end of the commercial an elbow.
1683379	1684980	He elbows this wrestler in the face.
1685760	1689863	So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence and then he
1690450	1692270	is violent against a wrestler in the commercial.
1692291	1693811	Hypocrite much?
1694911	1699072	Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
1699752	1700893	I'm liking this guy.
1700913	1702253	Yeah, that's this guy's platform.
1702373	1704114	Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
1704134	1705894	So why simulate it when you can go do it?
1706694	1708255	You know what the conservatives want?
1708595	1713236	They want you to put down the video games and they want you to go fight in the real war.
1714144	1719145	Well, you know, it's hard to... It's kind of not just conservatives in my mind.
1719186	1721246	It's kind of, you know, because it was Hillary Clinton's thing, too.
1721286	1722506	It's kind of all across the board.
1722907	1727688	I think there's just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what party they're with.
1728168	1731629	So, we need to re-educate them by voting them out of office.
1731709	1737171	Because if you're over the age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator...
1738151	1743837	is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation that's not going to go through or anything.
1743897	1744738	So do your research.
1745018	1746019	Election Day is coming up.
1746419	1748181	Yeah, there's actually... I want to change my website.
1749062	1749402	Okay.
1749883	1752305	Because this one... Wait, wait.
1752505	1754327	Do we need the... We don't need the music again.
1754707	1755148	Are you sure?
1755688	1756249	I'm sure.
1756349	1757190	Are you sure you're sure?
1757210	1761754	Alright, fine.
1762113	1767097	I'm trying to verify the name of the site because I've been there before.
1767537	1771200	I think it's like votesmart.com or smartvote or something like that.
1772901	1775243	I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.
1775303	1778285	You know what's funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays.
1778385	1782388	Election Day will have already passed, so maybe it's kind of a move point now.
1783890	1786672	Maybe we should have done this story in part A. Oops.
1786852	1787112	Oh, well.
1788433	1789974	Well, at any rate, people should be going there anyway.
1790755	1790835	Okay.
1791807	1796648	Alex in our chatroom says, I nominate Rob for the Gamers Party ticket with Jamie as his vice president.
1797308	1798848	That's nice, except I'm not 35.
1800069	1801129	Almost, but not quite.
1801289	1805390	Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.
1806550	1817232	Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded consoles, but it's also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.
1817833	1840821	That's right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.
1841621	1842442	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1865285	1876748	and then of course certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile locked and only on those profiles can you play them so people are cheating that as well.
1877808	1885069	Very interesting but I'm sure people are going to find a way around it because they always do.
1885409	1891371	Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places.
1892912	1893572	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1921465	1925346	and they've got sponsors including Nintendo, Microsoft and Ubisoft.
1925926	1934328	The website says Arcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.
1934888	1936088	Does that mean everyone's getting high?
1936228	1936529	I don't know.
1937069	1945111	Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days and there is a service fee with that though so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian.
1945131	1946251	That's about $22 US by the way.
1947543	1956205	and Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.
1957325	1957705	Have fun.
1959765	1968367	Well, also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.
1968507	1971507	Basically, they're bringing in virtual taxation.
1972207	1975748	You know, if you've earned money, you have to pay taxes, so they are...
1976636	1993927	For anyone doing profits online or playing games like Second Life and World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says, if you're getting a monetary benefit, then it's not treated any differently.
1993987	1994787	Normal rules apply.
1994807	1999530	Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working 9 to 5 in an office.
2000871	2005414	So basically for anyone who earns money via their...
2006542	2009224	Internet Addictions, then you're going to get taxed.
2009584	2011245	Okay, here's where I have a problem with this.
2012085	2016308	If they're going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses.
2017769	2020230	And I want, you know, restitution for that.
2020591	2021651	That's what I think would be fair.
2022011	2024133	If you want to go one way, you got to do both.
2024193	2027875	You can't have, you know, the cake without paying the money.
2028235	2028535	I don't know.
2028775	2029516	That's a bad analogy.
2030276	2030597	Whatever.
2030857	2031317	I had nothing.
2032344	2033445	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2057646	2070751	and unfortunately none of those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except for maybe the pink one which looks stupid and yeah should you spend your money on this?
2071191	2086157	probably not if you already have one but if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP then now's the time I don't know hooray I want a pink PSP not
2087129	2092992	Um, would you buy a... Wait, you're the... Miklatov's the one that's the color whore when it comes to systems.
2093012	2098194	Like, you've totally, like, taken systems back and traded it just to get, like, a blue DS and stuff.
2098474	2098695	Yep.
2099135	2101076	So, any of these new color PSPs interest you?
2101396	2101996	The blue one.
2102476	2102877	Of course.
2102897	2105058	I honestly really want it.
2105558	2109219	I saw the picture and I was like, wow, it's a blue PSP.
2110040	2110820	I need it back.
2111561	2114042	When I was at YaliCon, there was...
2115174	2118115	There were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing a different color DS.
2119436	2120036	That's cute.
2120296	2123037	I have a pink GBA.
2124038	2127239	For like $20 you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.
2127339	2130040	In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.
2130421	2134442	You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.
2134662	2137003	They're available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.
2138584	2140625	Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.
2141400	2148549	You know what I thought was interesting is that I was at the mall today and I didn't notice how many, like, freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to, like, pip my iPod.
2148929	2158641	Like, they had all these, you know, places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever the little encasings they have that, you know, you can put Spongebob on your iPod and stuff and, you know, you can pretty much do the same thing with a PSP.
2158661	2159482	You know what I haven't seen this year?
2159702	2159902	What?
2160082	2161324	The knockoff Nintendos.
2162239	2162679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2187654	2197117	Supposedly, it's going to launch around November 22nd, and 1,100 hours of video would be available to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.
2197517	2206100	Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period, and purchases would be from $10 to $15, very similar to Pay-Per-View and iTunes.
2207521	2213283	I don't know if I'd buy this, though, because to me, this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player if they're going to move this direction.
2213583	2216564	Not necessarily, because you can still get
2217473	2220135	You're only going to have so much room on your hard drive to fit movies.
2220495	2221236	Yeah, that's the other thing.
2221256	2222237	There's no room.
2222557	2225999	How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20 gigabyte drive?
2226039	2226640	Well, I don't know.
2226700	2227861	But here's the other thing, too.
2228321	2232944	The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it.
2233084	2235706	So they could do this if they wanted to.
2236787	2238168	That's one of the things that they just added.
2238228	2239809	So it kind of seems a little...
2241363	2249009	Look, coincidental if they're going to be implementing this pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.
2251931	2252291	I don't know.
2253612	2255593	It just seems a little soon for this.
2256054	2258756	I still think you're kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.
2258876	2263219	Well, they've got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and the PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution stuff.
2263880	2264320	We'll see.
2264480	2268243	DMN in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late 90s.
2269076	2270177	I don't know, because you can buy them.
2270217	2272099	Now it's a bigger hard drive is what they're going to have to do.
2272119	2274561	What are you going to do when you're done with a movie?
2274601	2277663	You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and it's still yours?
2277683	2279425	Because I'm thinking the drives are not big enough.
2279865	2280185	Possibly.
2280646	2288612	I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that there's a 60 gig thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.
2289173	2289413	You know?
2289573	2289893	I don't know.
2290494	2291114	It doesn't make sense.
2292035	2293776	Justin thinks they can stream the movies.
2295658	2298080	They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.
2298752	2299072	I don't know.
2299253	2301456	That wouldn't necessarily work depending on how bad your service is.
2301536	2304620	It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.
2305501	2305822	We'll see.
2306403	2309206	And of course, Bandit wants to know, when does the Wizard get released for the 360?
2309567	2312391	I don't think it would because it was a Nintendo commercial.
2312791	2313793	So they don't want it.
2316392	2319234	DarkSakura is going to read some of her favorite emails right now.
2319254	2319494	Well, um...
2346175	2350456	We've got quite a number of emails, and they're all going to be read by the ferret, so here's the first one.
2352257	2352897	Okay, never mind.
2353817	2355497	First email comes from Wolf.
2357618	2361919	Actually, it's two emails, so I'm just going to read them together, because actually I sort of am happy about one.
2362239	2363200	So this goes out to Jamie.
2363220	2371502	I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game system for two to three times the value when someone who can't enjoy it has to pay that much.
2371522	2372482	Okay.
2374471	2387641	Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe that morals are becoming slowly corroded over time, and I think somebody's gotta have them, so thank you.
2387721	2390023	One for Rob.
2390664	2393846	I think you were the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?
2394307	2397409	Did you quit before or after the whole Chocobo raising update?
2398596	2405100	I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI right when they did the Chocobo, but it only lasted about a month.
2405220	2409923	Miklatovka was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit really late.
2409983	2414246	I think I got Corsair to like level 14, if that, and then quit.
2414366	2418449	I did get a Chocobo, and I raised it, but like not past baby stage.
2418729	2419169	What was it called?
2419209	2421871	Oh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my Chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.
2422772	2425854	But then I quit, and now I'm... I remember you had a little Ken back in the day.
2426594	2427775	That was actually my mule.
2428390	2429210	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2451623	2457169	Hey guys, AZHP again reporting back from Stonetown's Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol dealie.
2457689	2461674	Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.
2462955	2464417	But anyway, my thoughts on the game.
2464677	2469302	Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that I've played, but the whole American Idol thing is...
2470515	2473896	The whole American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.
2474256	2480037	I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person because there were only a few sound bites for each judge.
2480497	2485418	Also, since it's on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate and not in a good way.
2485818	2487699	And when they talk, the lips don't sync up.
2488159	2490119	Also, the pitch recognition still needs work.
2490239	2493380	Judges a little too harshly, just like all the previous games.
2493460	2495500	A decent party game, but not great.
2496680	2497421	Yeah, it's not surprising.
2497681	2499141	Well, I think it's not done yet either.
2499631	2501012	No, well, no, isn't it?
2505493	2508114	Were they talking about the little tour they're doing?
2508414	2509915	I don't think that's a final build.
2511255	2519518	No, so I wouldn't totally base your opinions on that build, but it's going to give you the general feel of the game at least.
2520938	2525480	Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.
2526562	2532946	Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kutaragi, here is a reason for the Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.
2533306	2535667	People say he's bad to the customers, eh?
2536187	2540209	He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.
2540630	2547313	When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.
2547613	2549174	So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.
2549354	2550255	Thought it might interest you all.
2550875	2559799	Um, yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah, there was a bunch of big fallout over that.
2560360	2564562	I think there were even, I remember back in the day, didn't they have image prototypes?
2564862	2568944	Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?
2569324	2574846	I seem to remember in, like, Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture, but, you know, this is so long ago.
2574866	2575967	Yeah.
2578061	2605400	but that's still an interesting point one not everyone is aware of got an email from Alex it says hey OLR Alex from chat here I suspect I'm too late for mailbag 207 and or that the story I'm going to touch on hasn't come up on the show yet but oh well I'm going to talk anyway I'm pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween which it was however nobody knew how bad this update was a lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing
2605834	2607355	This is now fixed, but there's another problem.
2607855	2609875	The update effectively bricked consoles.
2609916	2617218	Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part A. But I thought it was... This is right at the top of this part, but that's all right.
2617278	2619039	Actually, that listener's in chat tonight.
2619319	2619479	Yeah.
2619599	2621860	So he's the same guy who said he had a bricked console.
2622840	2627602	But I still think it was interesting that we've got people who do have more thoughts on that one.
2629749	2656401	it was the final comment on here that made me really think about it it's way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening good point another email comes but wait a minute though, at the same time at least the rumor or whatever is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so Sony couldn't say any longer that they're the only console that can do the true HD how well did they test it?
2657063	2660424	Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasn't the time to be rushing things, so I'll buy into that.
2662224	2663404	We have an email from Warrior Bob.
2664565	2665325	Warrior Bob is cool.
2666205	2670966	Hey guys, I heard the discussion this last week about Konami's acquisition of the In The Groove franchise.
2671346	2678567	I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so I'll leave my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.
2678807	2682008	I did feel, however, that the situation wasn't portrayed entirely accurately.
2682418	2690120	Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking of was Step Mania, the open source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.
2690681	2700864	In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort, although some resources are shared between the project, some code, and I believe some staff were involved in both In the Groove and Step Mania.
2701431	2705215	The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.
2705235	2707477	Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.
2707497	2710981	At one point, I worked with the Stepmania team on a very small level, helped write a manual, check out the
2725098	2732262	in the Groove One Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.
2732582	2735764	Small corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the next one.
2736965	2744089	With all due respect, no, I meant fan tribute, and I still feel that that's how I feel the game is, is because...
2744648	2751393	If you look at the folks that developed In The Groove, half of them were posters on DDR Seattle before In The Groove ever came out.
2751473	2763421	So, you know, maybe it wasn't called a fan tribute like Step Mania was, but in my mind, it was that fandom of DDR and, you know, they probably all met each other on this forum, you know, and stuff that caused them to make the game.
2763862	2768345	I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end, it's all about the dollar.
2769185	2769806	They did...
2770404	2771285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
2783308	2786870	Until the dollar came into play and I think Groxor stepped in and all this stuff.
2787130	2792492	But then again, we had Renee here last week who says she's had interaction with these folks and they're a little bit uppity.
2792632	2792913	I don't know.
2792953	2794633	I'm not going to speak because I don't really know these folks.
2794913	2795814	But I will say this.
2796074	2799436	I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.
2799516	2802137	Folks used to ask, what is your legal angle on this?
2802197	2803277	How is this game legal?
2803558	2805498	And they would just say, don't talk about it.
2805518	2806359	We've got it covered.
2806819	2808400	And now it's kind of like, you know what?
2809640	2810181	You got served.
2812452	2815595	Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?
2815875	2819298	I mean, that's kind of the one part I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.
2819338	2822661	They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.
2822841	2825483	I still think that the project was well-deserved.
2826083	2828546	You don't take somebody else's idea and try to make money on it.
2828646	2833009	It's like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any picture.
2833710	2836452	I would feel, oh, but we love your style.
2836933	2837733	That doesn't matter to me.
2837813	2838534	You stole my art.
2838894	2839635	That's how I would feel.
2840804	2845922	Um, anyway, we have an email from, uh, Schwalt, uh, 120- I'm sorry, is that-
2847620	2848680	Okay, I'm trying to look at this.
2848740	2852121	I think this... My font is very strange on the email, so I apologize.
2852281	2853361	I think it's Schwall22.
2853701	2854882	Yeah, I think that's not... You know what?
2854922	2855442	This is funny.
2855522	2857642	This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.
2857722	2862843	I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?
2862863	2863543	I think was the game.
2863964	2864924	And now he listens to the show.
2865404	2866024	So it's kind of cool.
2866324	2866964	That's pretty cool.
2867064	2867224	Yeah.
2867324	2872925	No, just to explain, my L's and my 1's look the same in this font, so... Hey folks, love the show and the info.
2873105	2875486	I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.
2875905	2880007	I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ko and ends with taku, lol.
2880687	2889911	Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but IGN's Matt Kasamasina... Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.
2890529	2891070	Thank you for watching!
2912349	2913009	I was going to say that...
2941694	2948000	The Xbox Live Arcade does not have... You can't trade the games with other people and bring them over.
2948060	2953865	You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you can't actually bring your full game with them.
2954105	2959349	That's why your profile is linked to basically your console, so you're only going to be able to download them there.
2959369	2961151	You know what's interesting?
2961171	2968537	I was listening to Bobby's show earlier tonight, and he was talking about... Because he just got a replacement console, and it screwed up his arcade games because...
2968942	2970403	It was tied to the old console.
2970683	2975124	But apparently if you're signed in, if you're the one signed in on the console and you bought the game, it will work.
2975685	2975945	Yeah.
2976085	2977025	So that's how you can take it.
2977065	2979346	Like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to somebody else's house.
2980366	2982127	Sign in, but it's still linked to your account.
2982227	2982447	Right.
2982827	2983728	So you have to sign in.
2983748	2985548	If you copy the game over, it won't work for them.
2986509	2987229	Is that what I'm hearing?
2987269	2988509	It sounds like it's going to happen over the Wii.
2988650	2992671	I'm thinking what you might be able to do, though, with that is you might be able to sign in your account.
2993491	2997713	Maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work.
2998140	3000601	But right now they're saying you can't just bring your memory card over.
3000641	3002201	You have to bring the whole console with you.
3002541	3003621	Which I don't know about that.
3003661	3005562	I think you can probably bring your profile.
3005682	3010563	I think that WiiCon is going to have... Yeah, I think the WiiCon has... Because they say that has internal storage in it.
3010963	3014284	So it certainly could have your Nintendo version of game or card in it.
3014544	3016364	So... There's that.
3016445	3019165	And then, of course, what was the other thing?
3019825	3022706	Vandalist in our chatroom says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.
3024006	3026547	Yeah, so I don't think that's really going to be an issue at all.
3028032	3034435	As far as the classic controller, though, you're not going to be able to play GameCube games with that.
3035335	3036235	Not at all.
3037116	3039177	Personally, I'd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.
3040037	3048320	You'll probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper than buying the classic controller, I would think.
3049721	3050901	Especially third-party ones.
3051481	3051922	Exactly.
3054103	3057804	Well, if we're ready to move on to the next email, we have two left
3058510	3059670	This one comes from Chris.
3060271	3066713	Hi OLR, when my family and I were taking care of my sister's little terrier puppy Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.
3067593	3071215	She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it was.
3071775	3075476	Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.
3076677	3080618	This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your show helped cheer me up.
3081158	3085380	I'd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me feel.
3086908	3090509	and how you've made my life a little happier.
3090910	3093850	God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.
3094791	3096611	Wow, that's amazing.
3098112	3098432	Thank you.
3099612	3107414	I'm sorry about the puppy, but I don't know what to say really.
3107454	3108355	I mean, thank you.
3109595	3110135	We do our best.
3110155	3110535	Difficult.
3111196	3111776	Sorry to hear it.
3111936	3112696	We are crazy people.
3113995	3116177	Last email comes from Mr. Wonderful.
3117338	3123162	Hey guys and gal, thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.
3123222	3125224	Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.
3125324	3133330	First off, I know that there's all the new swirling around about next gen systems and all that, and I'm still desperately hunting down a Wii order.
3133979	3138061	But there seems to be a real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.
3138181	3140962	I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.
3141382	3146204	I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, the import, and Contact last week, and I'm really loving both of them.
3146264	3149946	Contact's got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay.
3150346	3154148	And the instruction book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars.
3155148	3156469	And a surprising lack of emo.
3157623	3160305	Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
3160385	3161666	I saw what the new attorney looks like.
3161706	3165149	You know, you actually, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.
3165169	3169152	We're talking about Phoenix Wright?
3169272	3169412	Yeah.
3169752	3171473	Mikhail Dov asked if we were talking about Phoenix Wright.
3171553	3171734	Yeah.
3172014	3173175	Okay.
3174616	3181861	The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Star Sign, Final Fantasy III, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52.
3183062	3183963	Scourge the Hive.
3184343	3186825	Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?
3187694	3190638	Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?
3190658	3192581	So what games would you guys recommend?
3201888	3203569	I've heard really good things about Contact.
3203589	3208632	I actually want to check out this game myself, but it's just too busy of a season for me to pick up games I don't know much about.
3209333	3215956	Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love Owen Don, so I'm sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.
3216777	3222600	Final Fantasy III looks very promising, but of course, as I've admitted in part A, I'm a whore for all things Final Fantasy.
3222620	3223061	Yes, it is.
3224181	3226643	Final Fantasy V, too, because, you know, Game Boy Advance.
3226703	3228063	And do it in the Advance port as well.
3228644	3230765	Miglatov, anything you can think of there for the DS?
3231809	3232329	or PSP.
3233190	3235430	Well, Luminous 2 for PSP and then you're done.
3237851	3239552	What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?
3239592	3241473	I never played any of those, so I'll play Luminous 2.
3241673	3243073	I almost bought Work Time Fun today.
3243754	3246695	Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good.
3248495	3249716	Especially if you're a fan of Luminous.
3250796	3253517	For PSP, Tony Hawk's Project 8.
3253858	3254558	That's going to be coming out.
3255198	3256839	Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.
3258382	3260143	DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Star Sign
3278509	3306359	Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS and Zappy says I heard WTF is horrible I don't know I like the demo D3 it was kind of cute well honestly graphically it's a crap game but play wise the things that were in there were just so crazy and out there I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed in their spare time but it is so funny also Pokemon Ranger is coming out or actually came out right plenty of suggestions for you my friend
3308177	3310559	Well, there's not too much.
3311479	3324069	Given the upcoming busy schedule I'm going to have when I start school in January, I've been trying not to get into too many handheld games because I'm not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them.
3325029	3326651	But I am getting Final Fantasy III.
3327131	3328092	I've planned on that.
3328532	3332155	I do want Children of Mana, but I'm thinking about borrowing it from my friends when she's done with it.
3332415	3334236	And I'm definitely getting Elite Beat Agents.
3335237	3336518	That I'm definitely getting.
3337526	3338346	Oh yeah, am I getting it?
3338366	3342807	But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores.
3342947	3345088	So if you like your music games, I'm sure you'll like it.
3345688	3351509	Right now though, I did just pick up the... God, I forgot the name of it again.
3352769	3353329	Surgery game.
3353609	3354229	Oh, Trauma Center.
3354249	3355030	Trauma Center, yeah.
3355310	3358590	I remembered Under the Knife and I was like... Oh yeah, Trauma Center.
3359110	3361851	And I'm going to be starting that coming up.
3362511	3363871	So I'm looking forward to that.
3365832	3367072	And I have to eventually steal...
3367742	3368722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3396400	3399242	To end things on a happy note, what are your guys' favorite alcoholic drinks?
3399722	3406706	I really enjoy a nice glass of divorce, 12-year scotch, and pale ales, Oktoberfest, and other tasty specialty beers.
3407046	3408887	Keep on rockin', Mr. Wonderful.
3410788	3412669	I've been getting into wine lately.
3414150	3414890	I know, aren't I weird?
3414910	3415650	I'm getting snooty.
3417211	3421033	If I feel like drinking something a little foo-foo, I'll have a lemon drop.
3421494	3425736	But if I'm going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.
3427665	3431430	If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios, motherfucker.
3432211	3432952	That's what it's called.
3433112	3433953	No, no, I, yeah.
3434917	3440201	I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass well tequila or I will be throwing up all over everybody.
3440221	3443784	That's the one problem I have with an adios is I don't like tequila, but otherwise it's a good drink.
3443824	3444925	I like good tequila.
3445906	3452911	I had actually, okay, Olive Garden has this, if you like foo-foo drinks, Olive Garden has like the tastiest mixed berry daiquiri.
3453031	3455573	Oh, Sangria, that's the other thing I've been hooked on lately.
3455913	3458415	Oh, God, yeah, that's my ultimate foo-foo drink.
3459375	3462237	I would say for wines, I'm a very big fan of sweet wines.
3462297	3466459	So I like Umeshu, which is a plum wine.
3466479	3468941	It's actually real plum wine with the plums in the bottom of it.
3469141	3469801	Oh, so good.
3470402	3473283	And I like Honey Runs.
3474424	3476205	It's elderberry honey wine.
3476505	3479307	It's basically a fruit mead.
3479967	3482168	I actually drink mead at Ren Faire.
3482308	3483649	That's the only time I actually have mead.
3484429	3485430	Don't drink until you're 21.
3505943	3507385	or 19 in Canada or whatever it is.
3507405	3509887	Or whatever country you're in.
3510788	3514451	But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.
3514972	3515992	Here's our moral thing.
3516253	3517394	And we do believe this.
3517494	3518995	We never drive when we drink.
3519195	3520597	Always have a responsible driver.
3520637	3521718	And just drink responsibly.
3522378	3527263	And don't get drunk every night at home by yourself because that's
3528663	3530084	That's a sign of depression, I think.
3530504	3533466	I'm not going to say anything.
3533566	3533887	All right.
3535848	3538349	I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.
3538449	3542172	Look, as long as you're not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, that's all.
3543913	3545514	Or an NBC Monday Night movie.
3547115	3548115	We got a last minute email.
3548135	3549496	All right.
3549556	3553058	Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay.
3553518	3554199	Jamie's evil.
3554239	3555600	Loki is stupid for hating Max.
3555660	3556140	Love DMN.
3556431	3557452	Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.
3557472	3560614	Wait, we didn't get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Miklatov.
3561174	3562815	Miklatov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?
3564236	3565197	I don't drink anymore.
3565377	3565697	Why not?
3565817	3575264	Because I think, well, I won't say why it has to do with some time I shouldn't have drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.
3576486	3577607	I see, I see, yes.
3578188	3585073	But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave & Buster's.
3585113	3587635	I don't even remember what they were called, but they were so good.
3587696	3588516	Ooh, chocolate martini.
3589397	3590338	No, the grasshopper.
3590538	3591138	The grasshopper.
3591178	3592399	The frozen grasshopper's so good.
3592419	3593861	Actually, Dave & Buster's has a really good lemon drop.
3594021	3595022	All right, Loki, make it quick.
3595042	3595802	We've got to get back to games.
3595822	3596803	Screwdriver.
3597083	3597924	All right.
3598264	3602167	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
3602748	3605090	And maybe we'll get off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.
3606778	3607779	Let's get back into some news!
3636147	3663362	A brand new SimCity game and Lord of the Rings Crisis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring And of course, some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs A brand new Road Rash game for next gen And of course, Burnout 5, it's been announced for a while now Dude, new Road Rash?
3663622	3663822	Yeah
3665194	3666154	Ghost Rider Ghost Rider
3692867	3697497	have not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.
3699577	3706578	The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or its parent company.
3707099	3712980	SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.
3713460	3718761	We recommend consumers purchase PlayStation products only from authorized SCEA retailers and resellers.
3719141	3720541	Which is a big duh anyway.
3721041	3724762	You know, especially if you're dealing with something that's got a limited shipment.
3725442	3728563	Don't order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.
3729807	3732776	All right.
3732796	3733057	That's it.
3733971	3740616	All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last-minute story because we're about to move into the Skype line and the other last-minute stories.
3741437	3746640	TigerClaw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking about pre-ordering the PlayStation 3.
3747181	3755907	Apparently, at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill out pre-order forms on BestBuy.com, and it looked legit and everything.
3757148	3762973	And what happened, I guess, is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders using different accounts.
3763855	3764576	Very interesting.
3765357	3774665	This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the public number and were assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.
3775306	3780190	Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait.
3780811	3783914	And everybody that tried to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.
3784314	3786576	So if you want one from Best Buy, you've got to camp out for it.
3788349	3793132	We have a new 800 number here, or actually I should say 877, or a toll-free number here at Orange Lawn Radio.
3793152	3795853	And because of that reason, we've opened up our voicemails of the week again.
3796174	3800016	I guess word hasn't gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week.
3800616	3802657	But it was pretty good, so we want to play it for you guys right now.
3802697	3804658	So here it is, a voicemail of the week.
3805699	3807660	Hey, LLR, it's Paradox Benson.
3807880	3809041	Yeah, now on...
3809565	3813049	IndieGuru versus DDR and how fair Konami is.
3813269	3815512	I agree with DarkSakura.
3815832	3816893	They just totally stole it.
3817254	3822760	And on that note, I just think that Session, Damani, rocked them both.
3823100	3826845	And also, I wanted to know if there's any reason...
3827547	3827928	and so on.
3850410	3855392	It says, oh goody, we can play with Japanese players, but some of them can't speak English.
3855672	3857573	So I don't really see the point in this.
3858213	3866376	And they're just kind of losing a bigger server base, and I really just don't see the point in this.
3866696	3871058	So yeah, just keep it up with the show, guys, and I'll be listening for a while.
3871647	3873087	All right, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week.
3873107	3873808	We appreciate it.
3874068	3875468	Mikotov, you're a PSU whore.
3875508	3876548	What did you think of the voicemail?
3876568	3878229	So, because I've been playing Phoenix, right?
3878669	3879449	Objection!
3879569	3882430	Because you're doing false testimony.
3882610	3892893	If you've been following PSU for months and months, you'd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers were separate.
3893414	3897875	So, you are wrong, and you should not lie on both.
3898375	3899695	But why?
3899836	3901296	Why can't they be on the same server?
3902023	3905364	because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything.
3905604	3908125	Final Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.
3908645	3909666	I always thought it was voice chat.
3909926	3912367	It came down to the fact that 360 supported voice chat within parties.
3913927	3914808	But you know what?
3915688	3916168	Who cares?
3916548	3918109	Have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.
3919089	3919949	Problem solved.
3920470	3921250	Everyone play on PC.
3921829	3923010	Yeah, play on PC.
3923430	3924411	I'm going to be playing both.
3924531	3925272	You're going to play both?
3925352	3925912	I'm playing both.
3925932	3926973	That's crazy hard to do.
3927654	3928234	You're crazy.
3928414	3928875	You are crazy.
3929055	3930536	Hey, you don't get misset in that game.
3930576	3933498	I couldn't support more than one character on one system.
3933598	3934019	Well, no.
3935440	3938602	A friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.
3939123	3939243	Oh.
3939463	3942025	So I was like, well, okay.
3942045	3942886	It's $10 a month.
3942966	3944247	It's like, what, two burritos?
3944267	3945147	Yeah.
3946770	3947991	I said, okay, I'll play on the PC.
3948011	3952754	And it's something I can do while I'm doing my live journal or doing other stuff.
3952774	3954115	That's how I did PSO.
3955256	3956757	And I can carry it around on my laptop.
3956857	3958738	Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.
3958818	3965042	I'm actually looking for it because if I get my iMac, I'm planning on dual formatting it so I can run Windows on my iMac.
3967034	3969955	Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.
3970255	3976017	The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.
3976237	3979178	That's toll free in the US and Canada.
3979258	3986580	Hey, we'll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this.
3986920	3991864	We want to know if you are going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3 or a Wii.
3992305	3997950	And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you camping out for and why?
3998610	4000712	And what are your plans for camping out?
4000872	4002213	What store are you going to go to?
4002393	4003714	Are you going with a big group of friends?
4003755	4005456	We want to know what your campout plans are for.
4005796	4009660	Even if you're not camping out, we want to know why you're not camping out and sitting this one out.
4009700	4011301	So we welcome your voicemails.
4011341	4012882	We'll play some of our favorites next week.
4012902	4013203	1-877-GAME-OLR
4016157	4017337	1-877-426-3657.
4017778	4022278	Now we're going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4022879	4028120	And it's that same number, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
4028160	4032961	If you'd like more information on how to interact with our program, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4033001	4034321	Click on Interact With Us.
4034381	4035161	Let's go to the phones.
4035221	4036501	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4036581	4037161	Who is this?
4037942	4038542	It's Ranma.
4039002	4039622	No, I'm just kidding.
4039642	4039962	It's DMN.
4040521	4041703	Hi DMN, what's on your mind, buddy?
4041723	4042384	DMN!
4043065	4043566	Not much.
4044547	4051918	I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the weekend here, and I'd like to share my opinion of them.
4052018	4054461	He's a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early.
4054481	4055242	I know, you get it.
4055303	4056104	I really want it.
4056204	4057005	What's your opinion on them?
4058312	4067035	Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.
4067135	4068936	The gameplay is exactly like Owen Don.
4068976	4070716	It has the same comic book feel to it.
4072077	4073477	It's freaking hilarious.
4074938	4077639	And surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.
4078319	4083981	The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four songs.
4084921	4085221	Avril Lavigne
4113361	4120206	The Skaterboy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some lady's about to have a baby.
4121867	4123028	What about Canned Heat?
4123588	4124629	What's that stage like?
4125550	4131194	The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy at the Japanese motor company.
4131574	4136618	His son goes through the rival motor company who's stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.
4137559	4138840	That makes a lot of sense.
4139600	4139761	It does.
4139861	4140221	It does.
4141278	4142839	What about the other game you picked up quickly?
4142999	4147080	Magical Star Sign is a very, very good RPG.
4147520	4149941	I would recommend it as more so of a beginning RPG.
4150541	4151182	I enjoyed it.
4152002	4154543	My only beef with it was it felt very linear.
4157184	4158824	Basically, it said, go here, go here.
4158944	4160765	It didn't really make it fun.
4161285	4166547	I haven't had a chance to try the multiplayer mode on it, unfortunately, so I can't give any information on that.
4167945	4168605	I'd recommend it.
4169126	4170326	It's a fun RPG.
4170487	4174130	It's got a lot of fun little blurbs of text in it.
4174450	4176311	It keeps up with the times.
4177672	4179074	I would highly recommend it.
4181435	4182496	Alright, sounds good.
4182716	4188941	Well, that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking for good DS and portable games.
4189802	4191363	Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4194246	4194506	No.
4194846	4195947	Alright, then we're going to another call.
4195987	4197048	Hey, we'll see you pretty soon, okay?
4197540	4198240	All right, take care.
4198340	4198640	Later.
4200361	4202622	All right, we're going to go to another call here on the Skype line.
4202702	4203722	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4203742	4204202	That's 1-877-426-3657.
4204222	4209024	So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
4209044	4210904	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4210944	4211184	Who's this?
4211204	4211625	Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.
4211725	4212225	Hey, Jeremy Todd 1.
4212265	4212865	What's on your mind?
4212885	4212925	Um...
4226127	4229370	I got Luminous for cell phone a couple days ago.
4230791	4232752	Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week.
4232792	4233173	How was it?
4234694	4235494	It's pretty good so far.
4235514	4237036	I think they did a pretty good job on it.
4237616	4242960	I'm not sure what to say about it.
4244221	4244722	Okay.
4244742	4246823	I'm doing a good job on this.
4247724	4248645	Isn't it really surprising?
4250546	4250766	What?
4251087	4253108	Isn't it really surprising just how well it turned out?
4254489	4254709	Yeah, I...
4255754	4256494	I'm glad I bought it.
4256534	4258095	It's only five bucks and it's pretty good.
4259156	4260316	Jamie, I've got to play you sometime.
4263177	4265358	Can you play that one to Cell Network?
4266599	4267059	I don't know, Jamie.
4267079	4267619	I can, actually.
4268260	4268580	Really?
4269060	4269700	That's kind of cool.
4269880	4270941	Like with Jules, you could do that.
4272001	4272482	Oh, that's cool.
4273922	4280125	Yeah, I've played a few matches with online and there's no lag either.
4283601	4284322	Gears of War Tuesday, Boop
4313905	4315346	I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.
4315406	4316347	All right, take care, buddy.
4316387	4316847	Have a good one.
4317728	4318008	Bye.
4318128	4318448	Yep, you too.
4318468	4318649	Thanks.
4318689	4318909	Bye.
4320310	4322752	All right, we're going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4323472	4325013	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4325053	4325494	Who's this?
4326695	4327375	Well, hello.
4327515	4328316	How are you guys?
4328496	4329176	I'm good.
4329517	4330177	Who is this?
4331658	4333159	You know who the fuck this is, Rob.
4334720	4343347	If I'm not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who we announced in Part A is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon, yes?
4343979	4345700	Yes, I've crossed over to the dark side.
4345860	4346500	That's right.
4346720	4353463	I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said you'll never do anything with us, and yet hell has apparently frozen over.
4354663	4357184	And to go back to something way back in the U.S.
4357224	4361726	old times, I tried to get over the rainbow, and I couldn't.
4363586	4366448	That's an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I. That's all right.
4366508	4370469	Folks who may have been following the Understation Live for years might follow it.
4370489	4371469	You know, we do have some folks here.
4371630	4372810	Still every other year, right?
4374079	4374639	What was that?
4374820	4375840	Still every other year?
4376601	4377642	What, did we do a USL?
4380424	4383566	No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.
4384207	4385348	Oh, that's right.
4385428	4386388	It's an even year.
4386889	4387269	Yeah.
4387709	4388350	What does that mean?
4389010	4390291	That means I'll be gay next year.
4390752	4391953	Oh, looking forward to that.
4392333	4398097	All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience, what do they have to look forward to?
4398778	4400099	You mean you couldn't tell by the promo?
4401727	4402727	Yeah, it was a little geeky.
4403388	4406348	Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didn't get it.
4408009	4408309	I'm out there.
4408349	4408929	It's the trailer.
4409709	4410469	It's fantastic.
4411150	4415771	It is from the season one teaser that they used for the ninth Doctor.
4416011	4416711	Yeah, the ninth Doctor.
4418152	4419772	Which I think is fantastic.
4420372	4421292	I'm big.
4421472	4422813	I'm, you know, out there.
4423213	4428994	Now, you're going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us.
4429335	4429735	So, right?
4429795	4430895	Yeah, definitely.
4431593	4432854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4459767	4474169	I will be games that I'm currently playing which is not a lot but there are games that I'm out there playing but we will be talking sci-fi and geek like I will be going on a tirade of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television excellent
4475798	4477019	and stuff like that.
4477500	4484346	Current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.
4484786	4493274	Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?
4494035	4495856	I am looking into that.
4497037	4499159	Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.
4499520	4500000	Alright, well,
4500955	4502697	Everybody tune in on Saturday.
4502797	4503457	Come and chat.
4503518	4504358	Support Travis.
4504458	4508201	And then he'll see he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.
4509282	4510323	Yes, definitely show up.
4510363	4511224	Let me know what's going on.
4511264	4519271	Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, you'll see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.
4520311	4526436	Also, I'm going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Rob's greater moments in USL history.
4526637	4527137	Jesus.
4527277	4527637	All right.
4528678	4529239	I guess just...
4529989	4532571	Encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.
4532591	4533472	Get Rob Blackmail.
4533552	4534252	That's nice.
4534773	4544280	Yeah, and I'll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie, who has a sense of decency and politeness, it's oh so small.
4544320	4546101	It's a small percentage of her being.
4546882	4549484	I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.
4550570	4559357	No, no, I was actually, I actually was going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.
4559637	4561879	But I think I still might post it, though, because it was pretty funny.
4564061	4565542	All right, should be fun.
4565602	4569885	All right, well, good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.
4570786	4571867	You have been assimilated.
4571987	4579593	No, in all seriousness, we're very excited to have you on board and look forward to what you're going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.
4580097	4580577	Well, thank you.
4580617	4581637	Thank you for having me.
4581778	4585939	I'm glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show.
4586179	4586519	No problem.
4586679	4590260	And I guarantee controversy for geeks out there on the first show.
4590760	4595802	My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be canceled and pull off the air.
4596222	4597102	Ooh, sounds good.
4597983	4602764	Actually, given what I've heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly.
4602864	4605005	I love Stargate, but yeah.
4605825	4606666	What was I going to say?
4606746	4608066	Something about, oh, forget it.
4609782	4611723	I can't remember because I'm old.
4612063	4612783	Tune in Saturday.
4613443	4613683	Yes.
4613803	4614143	That's all.
4614344	4614904	That's Rob.
4615644	4616784	Gay Alzheimer's.
4616824	4617184	Shut up.
4617584	4619865	I'm hanging up on you now because I can do that now.
4620845	4621025	Yes.
4621285	4621525	All right.
4621625	4622305	Have a good one, Travis.
4622586	4622986	You too.
4623346	4623666	Bye.
4625426	4625906	Oh, God.
4626226	4627907	Did we make a mistake inviting him on?
4627947	4628287	I don't know.
4628903	4633524	No, but sadly, I'm not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.
4633544	4633965	I don't know.
4634025	4635485	I might call in and debate some sci-fi.
4635505	4638186	But for right now, we've got to go to another call that maybe we can debate with.
4638206	4639166	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4639186	4639546	Who's this?
4640526	4641067	Hey, guys.
4641087	4641867	This is Foodie Monster.
4642247	4643327	Hi, Foodie Monster.
4643347	4643927	What's on your mind?
4643947	4645668	It's pretty late, man.
4645708	4646248	I'll tell you that.
4646268	4650089	This whole East Coast, West Coast thing is hiring me up the roof, seriously.
4651009	4656291	You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries even that stay up very late.
4656564	4657704	You guys are hardcore.
4657744	4660005	You've earned your OLR badge of honor.
4660085	4661245	Just every other night.
4661866	4662646	What's on your mind, buddy?
4663406	4668647	I just wanted to share something that popped out of my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted to write about, but I just figured I would call.
4669188	4669488	What's that?
4670168	4674809	I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you've got to think about it.
4676030	4679551	Games are not going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped.
4680091	4682551	And that's not just United States, Europe, and Japan.
4682952	4684132	That's South America.
4684744	4695893	That's Central America, that's Africa, those places also needed to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be really mainstream.
4696813	4697834	I mean, movies are everywhere.
4697874	4703599	You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you won't find too much gaming in Africa.
4704119	4705560	That's an interesting perspective.
4705580	4713907	I've kind of never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how, oh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesn't include Europe.
4714247	4714948	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4737530	4739571	and certain South American countries as well.
4740012	4741032	It goes beyond that.
4741933	4745695	There's no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance.
4746636	4750978	Not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any country in South America has official distributions of games.
4753039	4759283	Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distributor or licensing here in Argentina, but
4759941	4760361	and so on.
4777481	4778882	Yeah, but it's double the price.
4778962	4780964	I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, wait a minute.
4782185	4785367	So gaming is more expensive, generally, in the other countries.
4785587	4791611	Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up a Nintendo of Argentina or whatever?
4792472	4800698	Well, I mean, they should at least have a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent to make things cheaper for all the markets.
4800938	4801719	Is there enough of a demand?
4804375	4809000	I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35 million people.
4809480	4810181	I would say yes.
4810782	4811222	Interesting.
4812564	4819311	I mean, sure, I mean, it's not as much, probably that's why they don't do it, because there's not much market, you know.
4821013	4826598	I mean, if you consider with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in general, it's not enough market, I guess.
4826959	4827079	Hmm.
4827659	4832041	Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.
4832601	4833122	We appreciate that.
4833182	4835203	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4836663	4842386	No, but I have a quick review of my magic die, so now I can't play my backups, which has me very sad.
4843126	4843847	Sorry to hear it.
4845207	4846088	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4846148	4846688	Thanks for calling.
4846708	4847468	Okay, you too, guys.
4847548	4847768	Later.
4847808	4848069	See ya.
4848229	4849529	See ya.
4849589	4852210	Let's go to one more call.
4852351	4852911	What, Miklatov?
4853831	4855432	Okay, let's go to one more call here.
4856653	4857694	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4857714	4858114	Who's this?
4859976	4861297	Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
4861497	4862498	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
4862538	4863879	Hey, you left us the voicemail.
4865261	4865461	Yes.
4866121	4867042	Ah, what's on your mind?
4868383	4869144	Oh, did it get played?
4869544	4880554	Yeah, we actually played your voicemail and Miklatov called you a liar because he said if you've been following the Phantasy Star Universe thing like you said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers were separate.
4882321	4886023	Well, I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.
4886223	4887243	Yeah, what's on your mind?
4887283	4890125	Well, I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because of
4911727	4914169	I don't know, it was just kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.
4915629	4917911	So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?
4919132	4919312	Yes.
4919652	4923935	And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?
4924075	4928998	You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction crap aside?
4931659	4932540	Yeah, kind of.
4932800	4937003	Because I didn't really see it being so overblown.
4937043	4939004	Kind of like the Gran Turismo HD game.
4940552	4942813	Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.
4943173	4943754	I guess that's true.
4943774	4950077	Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo certainly kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.
4950177	4950757	I suppose that's true.
4951377	4953898	So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?
4953918	4956820	What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?
4956920	4965344	Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you that kind of gets you into it?
4966952	4979262	Yeah, it's kind of that, because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see just like a giant leap in the resolution.
4980543	4981163	You know what, though?
4981243	4985526	Now, Mikotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution was sometimes a problem in Lumis?
4985546	4993873	Yeah, I think that it gets too bright, and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring at it,
4994315	4995396	Over and over and over.
4995876	4996697	Hours on hours.
4996937	5001179	I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those luminous stages make me want to have a seizure.
5001559	5003701	Yeah, that one in the basic pack, that's...
5004865	5007848	I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue and neon pink.
5008229	5009250	That hurts my eyes.
5009690	5014214	It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.
5014274	5014955	I hate that one.
5015035	5017157	The one from the stupid first game.
5017758	5020961	What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?
5021241	5024524	Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?
5024905	5027387	What else do you think you're going to buy?
5027407	5029169	It kind of depends on the artist pack.
5030143	5036805	because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shee, then I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard.
5038165	5044888	I think it was maybe Luminous 2 for the PSP that had them because I'm a giant fan of those.
5045408	5045668	Right on.
5046308	5049469	But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?
5051190	5052170	Yeah, kind of.
5052190	5052510	Yeah.
5053922	5056262	I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.
5056282	5059243	But I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions
5081363	5084866	but made them very small and very kind of typecasted.
5085827	5087148	Okay.
5087328	5088849	Do you think they had a charge per skin?
5090851	5091872	Charge per skin?
5091952	5094073	In Luminous?
5094854	5099978	That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't like, like that bird one that's green and white.
5100138	5101539	I hate that stage so much.
5103541	5103801	All right.
5103821	5105643	Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for calling in.
5105663	5106343	We've got to move on.
5106363	5108205	Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?
5111162	5113625	Um, not really kind of a final thought.
5114626	5116248	But, uh, yeah, alright.
5117569	5117790	Okay.
5118531	5119432	Have a good one, buddy.
5120353	5121113	Thanks for calling in.
5121173	5122195	Alright, you too, guys.
5122215	5122335	Bye.
5123962	5127123	Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.
5127143	5128063	Think of something clever to say.
5128103	5132364	Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have... Oh, he admitted you pwned him.
5132424	5133524	I know, because I'm awesome.
5133564	5134684	What a nice guy.
5134744	5135624	I would have tried to fight you.
5135684	5139845	And I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.
5139865	5141106	Do you want to do one more call?
5141786	5142066	One more call.
5142086	5142786	We're running a little long.
5142826	5143746	We have time for one more call?
5144906	5145186	One more?
5145366	5145847	What do you guys think?
5145927	5146147	One more?
5146247	5146727	All right, one more.
5146767	5147407	Sure, let's do it.
5147807	5149027	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5149047	5149387	Who's this?
5150267	5151648	It's Zach from the chat room.
5152248	5152508	It's who?
5153490	5154931	and Zappy from the chat room.
5155872	5156352	Zappy!
5156592	5157533	Hi, what's on your mind, Zappy?
5158474	5164518	I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for like a week, past week and a half, and it's actually pretty decent.
5165238	5168641	Like, I don't find the missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.
5169221	5170102	Wait, which game was this again?
5170122	5171043	Because you're cutting out a little bit.
5171783	5173204	Oh, sorry.
5173284	5174825	Medal of Honor for the PSP.
5175626	5175806	Ah.
5176346	5180049	So, and you're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying, or what?
5181350	5181550	Yes.
5183016	5188559	You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually controlling pretty well.
5189419	5198583	I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing PC first person shooters.
5199324	5202225	Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.
5202365	5209468	So, you know, knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first-person shooters.
5209508	5213850	Like, you know, I kind of like Prey, and I really like my old-school Doom and, you know, Quake 3 and stuff.
5215190	5216311	Try to sell me on this game.
5216571	5217871	What's in this game that I might enjoy?
5218792	5221953	Well, probably the best part of it is the three-player multiplayer.
5222595	5230140	It has all the modes, and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's a pretty good selling point.
5231440	5233041	You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.
5233061	5233602	That's kind of cool.
5233762	5234082	Okay.
5234282	5234582	I like.
5235663	5237664	Even SOCOM only has 16 players in it.
5239185	5239445	All right.
5240045	5241366	Well, thank you for the review of the game.
5241546	5243027	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?
5243768	5249251	Well, I'm probably going to go to the Arcadia convention next week, and I'll give you some hands-on on how it is.
5249571	5250972	Are you not far from Montreal?
5250992	5251032	No.
5251798	5252478	I'm in Montreal.
5252758	5253439	Oh, right on.
5254399	5255019	What other kinds of stuff?
5255039	5258101	Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?
5259061	5262062	Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystick.
5262803	5265964	Although I haven't seen any real advertisements like on Billboard.
5266204	5268845	No, not Billboard, but like the pamphlets or anything.
5268865	5271386	I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.
5271546	5278569	That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign or maybe, you know, flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.
5279520	5281281	Well, this is the second year doing it.
5281361	5288445	I didn't go last year, but they're going to have the Wii, like, an update change early, so I just want to try it out.
5288805	5291986	Yeah, that's true, because Nintendo's one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're going to see the Wii.
5292046	5292627	That's pretty cool.
5292947	5294548	Well, yeah, definitely go to Arcadia.
5294628	5298890	We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.
5301151	5302792	We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.
5303766	5304246	Great to hear.
5304626	5304907	All right.
5305607	5306407	Have a good one, Zappy.
5306427	5308468	We've got to let you go and get the show over with.
5308488	5308989	But have a good one.
5309009	5309589	Thanks for calling in.
5310489	5310769	All right.
5310789	5311470	Have fun at Arcadia.
5311670	5311870	Later.
5313011	5313351	All right.
5313571	5314351	Oh, that was a hang-up noise.
5314471	5314731	All right.
5316152	5317273	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
5317313	5319534	We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.
5320074	5325657	It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get through every week are getting frustrated.
5326077	5327718	But surely you guys can understand.
5327778	5330059	We want to get as many different perspectives as we can.
5330538	5331378	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5352045	5359687	Okay, well anyways, I was going to say, if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's a couple websites you might want to check out.
5359827	5362408	First, ps3seeker.com.
5363068	5363628	You can check it out.
5363648	5375651	They actually are kind of tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii, or PS3.
5375751	5378791	And then, of course, the Wii would be ps3seeker.com.
5379232	5380712	So check that out as well for...
5381633	5384934	The Wii, and then some other things.
5386254	5398256	Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.
5398576	5403518	That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.
5403638	5410559	You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon because apparently Gears of War is in their store right now.
5411331	5412631	or at least at some Best Buys.
5413091	5415072	Uh-oh, broken street date.
5415412	5415972	Oopsie.
5416092	5416432	Oh, well.
5417012	5420713	So you might want to check and see if you can score or copy early because that would be pretty cool.
5421513	5424694	And, of course, there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.
5424874	5427535	Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.
5427555	5428795	I'm not sure how well that would play.
5429295	5434696	And then PSP is getting pumped up in Korea, so that's kind of interesting.
5436296	5438657	And also something that I thought was interesting,
5439648	5440729	Very strange.
5441189	5453955	The Blu-ray, since the Blu-ray drives are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive, which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.
5454415	5459297	For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install 5 gigs of the game onto your hard drive.
5459597	5461498	Imagine all these other games doing the same thing.
5462179	5465140	That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.
5466641	5467181	And, um,
5467938	5480882	Finally, with the fall update for the 360 adding 1080p support, unfortunately some of the Sony LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.
5482163	5482983	Isn't that ironic?
5483383	5483683	Isn't it?
5484864	5485364	Don't you think?
5486464	5487545	It's like Ray Yane.
5488105	5489525	Hey, hey, no Alanis.
5490086	5490366	Alright.
5491726	5494867	There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier.
5494887	5496748	It was on Dick.com, but I found actually...
5497563	5500045	A bit more about it on magazine.com.
5500065	5503488	You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.
5504109	5506711	It's a working Lego pinball machine.
5507292	5512496	Yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.
5513277	5516720	So that's so freaking cool.
5516820	5519622	I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.
5520283	5523606	There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two-player.
5524797	5532624	and the rumors coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that both state that Zelda is one of the two players.
5534386	5536067	So, that's kind of interesting.
5536087	5537128	I guess we'll have to find out.
5538049	5538349	Hmm.
5539410	5540751	Sure enough, it's just not a misprint or something?
5540771	5543714	It could be, but it's two different places, so... Who knows?
5545295	5546276	Alright, well, um...
5546889	5547870	DJ Tyrant's Birthday
5573151	5575773	Happy Birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around this period.
5597435	5598716	Maybe we should have a birthday list.
5599236	5601358	Right at the end of every show we'll say, happy birthday to these listeners.
5601398	5601698	We'll see.
5602519	5604881	Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5604921	5611125	Miklatov, thank you for your rare input as always, but thanks for being the moral support you are for this program.
5611886	5613127	Actually, you hate this show, don't you?
5613207	5614408	So I'm not sure why you come on it.
5615168	5616349	But what's your final thought anyway?
5616489	5617871	I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
5618471	5618791	And don't.
5619232	5619712	Okay.
5619892	5621133	Loki, what's your final thought?
5621774	5625016	Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at E3.
5625997	5626277	All right.
5627115	5627875	DarkSakura.
5629976	5636218	Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.
5637058	5640979	And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now.
5641279	5642920	Like, pumpkin pie would be awesome.
5644280	5645980	Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week.
5646220	5648521	And so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.
5648541	5651402	Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio.
