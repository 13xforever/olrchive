0	21680	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
21680	25960	This is episode number 207 and letís get right back into it.
25960	27360	We got more gaming news for you guys.
27360	31360	Iím going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.
31360	37720	The much anticipated fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st just like it was speculated
37720	38720	last week.
38720	40280	We talked about that on this program.
40280	46560	And whatís interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.
46560	50520	And when we say bricked the console that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three
50520	55200	red lights of doom to appear and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that
55200	56200	cannot play games.
56200	61160	It was said though that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.
61160	62160	But I know we had a listener.
62160	65520	I want to say it was Alex who was in our chat earlier saying he was one of the lucky less
65520	70600	than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money
70600	71600	to fix it.
71600	73240	And Iím thinking that is messed up.
73240	74240	Thatís not what I read.
74240	77880	I read people were actually being able to send them back, but thatís pretty fucked
77880	78880	up that they wanted money.
78880	81760	I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.
81760	85620	The official quote from Microsoft did come from this, ìWe are hearing from a small number
85620	88880	of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with a fall console update.
88880	92000	Iíve been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.
92000	93400	Weíll let you know when the issue is resolved.
93400	97120	If youíre having problems with the update for any reason, please call XBox Support.
97120	100200	Weíre working with those affected to get them back up and running and weíre committed
100200	106040	to making sure the update doesnít cause problems for anyone else.î So donít take that $140
106040	107040	for an answer.
107040	111520	No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing
111520	112520	for you.
112520	114480	They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.
114480	117200	Especially since theyíre aware of the problem.
117200	121080	Thereís no excuse for that.
121080	124640	Black Boy in our chat room did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that
124640	125640	got bricked.
125640	126640	Good job.
126640	128240	Thatís still a big number.
128240	130520	Wow, thatís something else.
130520	133880	They need to figure out how to un-brick them and fast.
133880	135960	I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.
135960	136960	I donít know.
136960	140280	Thatís kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that, but I donít
140280	142280	know the technical end of it.
142280	147980	Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was, Eragon, the demo
147980	156200	for that is available on Xbox Live, itís a 415 megabyte download, so you can check
156200	157200	it out.
157200	160400	My problem with the book is that the book, as far as Iíve gotten through it, is so very
160400	165440	poorly written, it reads like it was written by a 12-year-old, so hopefully the game is
165440	169180	better than how poorly written the book is.
169180	170720	The demoís not better at all.
170720	172280	Itís absolutely crap.
172280	174640	The demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?
174640	178840	Yeah, and Iím not sure if youíve played it, but if youíve played Konamiís King Arthur,
178840	182040	itís about the same level of crap, and thatís really bad.
182040	185000	Itís boring hack and slash.
185000	186000	That sounds pathetic.
186000	187200	I donít even know what this game is about.
187200	188560	I know thereís a movie, but Ö
188560	194740	Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that heís a dragon rider and gets pulled
194740	201520	into all the dragon-riding nonsense and everything, but to defend the writer of the book, I did
201520	208860	hear that he did start it in his teens, but thatís what beta readers are for, use them,
208860	215320	which the entirety of the fan fiction writing community should also know that, too.
215320	220160	But I donít see why the book got all this attention and why theyíre making a movie
220160	221160	of it.
221160	223520	I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.
223520	224520	Yeah.
224520	225520	I saw them recently, also.
225520	226520	Itís sad.
226520	228160	So the game is just hack and slash?
228160	233240	Thatís as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted, and it wasnít
233240	234240	fun.
234240	238840	It looked like a PS2 game, and not even like a current generation of PS2 games.
238840	240080	It looks like a step back.
240080	244080	Well, itís developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they
244080	245640	were all hack and slashy, too.
245640	246640	I donít know.
246640	248480	It didnít look that bad.
248480	251000	The screenshots Iíve seen look pretty good, but having played the demo Ö
251000	253000	The screenshots arenít playing.
253000	254000	Oh, snap.
254000	255000	Oh, no.
255000	261960	But, anyways, thatís actually Nvidiaís big game for Ö well, actually, no, I guess Fear
261960	264240	would be the big game for Novemver.
264240	272720	Anywho, so that fall update for the 360, it did some good, and what that would be is actually Ö
272720	280200	Well, itís helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives
280200	283120	modded to play backed-up games.
283120	287240	And so, actually, theyíve started banning some of these people that supposedly have
287240	288720	modded systems.
288720	292480	The funny part about it, though, is theyíre also banning some people that donít have
292480	295560	modded systems, but are saying that they are modded.
295560	302200	So they donít really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try
302200	309360	to stop some of those people from pirating stuff, because pirating is bad, totally.
309360	311360	I feel so weird saying that.
311360	315880	Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably
315880	321680	be downloading any time soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.
321680	326200	Some brand new maps came out for free if youíre an Xbox Live Gold member.
326200	327200	Hmm, interesting.
327200	329200	Another perk about being a Gold member.
329200	333680	You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this, they are an updated version
333680	337860	of GoldenEye 64 maps, Facility and Temple.
337860	340040	Those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.
340040	343200	Thatís kind of cool, if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.
343200	345400	I sold my Perfect Dark Zero, because I didnít like it.
345400	347600	I just couldnít get into it.
347600	348600	It felt weird.
348600	353120	No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.
353120	355080	Thatís my opinion.
355080	358960	But, but, but, there, GoldenEye was a good game.
358960	362600	I donít know, I still play Doom, and GoldenEye was good.
362600	366400	I just didnít, Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.
366400	367400	At all.
367400	371960	I donít know, Iím sorry, it just wasnít good for me.
371960	372960	Dark Tetsuyaís happy.
372960	374720	He says Facility was awesome.
374720	378160	So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.
378160	379160	You know what they need?
379160	380160	What?
380160	382720	They need to put out a goddamn time splitters game.
382720	383720	That was awesome.
383720	384720	Weíll see.
384720	385720	Make your own maps.
385720	394280	Well, at any rate, thereís been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.
394280	401560	Basically there is Ninja Ball, which is, you know, basically carrying a ball around.
401560	405080	Tank Flag, where a tank carries a flag.
405080	410640	And Elimination, on that one, youíre supposed to kill off five opposing team members.
410640	412980	With a 16 player limit.
412980	421160	They also mentioned more about the Spartan Laser, itís saying that the weapons application
421160	427280	will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.
427280	431640	So itís sort of like, you know, lock targeting computer fire.
431640	439880	The Man Cannon, funny, it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles and looping
439880	443420	arcs over the battlefield.
443420	450320	And thereís also saying that theyíll be able to fire or you can be shot down while
450320	451640	youíre in air.
451640	457320	Thereís also, with the Warthog and Ghost vehicles, theyíre going to control similarly
457320	465040	to how they do in Halo 2, but theyíre not saying what the X button is going to be used
465040	466040	for.
466040	469280	Itís going to be ready when itís ready.
469280	473720	The rumor for the X button was steal weapons, because apparently youíre going to be carrying
473720	479440	your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.
479440	484920	So to stop people who whore certain weapons, like during the whole game, thatíll be interesting.
484920	489760	Yeah, Iíve heard that youíre going to be able to see the weapons on people, so interesting.
489760	493040	That is kind of cool.
493040	496160	By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in the first
496160	499440	person shooter, Jeremy Todd 1 says in Gears of War you canít jump and thatís one of
499440	500960	the best games coming out.
500960	504960	Itís a little stupid.
504960	506680	I donít care.
506680	511680	Even if it has high production values, itís still retarded that you cannot jump.
511680	521160	Come on now, weíre in next gen, we need to have jumping technology, thatís what we need.
521160	526160	Some things that are also ridiculous out there, and we talk about this every week, itís not
526160	531480	a huge surprise, another EA game comes out and more microtransactions.
531480	537640	Well, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.
537640	545200	One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours
545200	552080	the collectorís edition, so you can get the extra cars and whatnot, extra tracks.
552080	557720	And of course, theyíre going to have some unlockables that you can buy, pretty much
557720	563720	the same deal as all the other EA games that theyíve been charging microtransactions for.
563720	568140	So this is just going to be something that weíre going to see going forward, Iím thinking.
568140	570840	So if you donít like them, donít buy them, thatís what I say.
570840	572080	Thatís exactly what it boils down to.
572080	576240	If you donít like this, donít buy it, and donít encourage other people to buy it either.
576240	580040	So itís time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.
580040	581760	I donít know, they can be cool sometimes.
581760	585600	I mean new maps, new songs, I mean thatís kind of neat, but I donít know about this
585600	588520	whole buying something that youíre going to get in the game later.
588520	592160	And doesnít that just seem, I still canít get over the whole thing that we talked about,
592160	596140	I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the
596140	599200	other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.
599200	602880	That just seems, I donít know, just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes
602880	605240	to get through their games, and thatís how they want to do it, and thatís how they have
605240	606240	fun doing it.
606240	608920	Especially in a sandbox game, maybe they donít want the challenge, they just want to have
608920	610240	fun going around and blowing people up.
610240	614080	Like I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans, just put in all the cheat codes
614080	615520	and just ran around and blew things up.
615520	616520	Hey, thatís fun!
616520	618960	No, Iím not talking about you actually, although you probably did this too.
618960	619960	Yes I did.
619960	625520	So, I donít know, it just kind of seems like itís taking advantage of those people, taking
625520	626760	candy from a baby.
626760	631060	Well, itís just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row
631060	634960	at lunch, because weíre not actually saving the game or doing any progress, weíre just
634960	640600	running around blowing shit up, and thatís how we spend our lunches, because Saints Row
640600	642880	is very much like Grand Theft Auto.
642880	645480	Well, this type of news makes me angry.
645480	649280	I donít know about you, DarkSakura, but I get angry when I feel like Iím being taken
649280	654880	advantage of, and my poor casual gaming friends are going to have to pay more money to have
654880	660280	the gaming experience they want, so this makes me angsty, and that means itís time for the
660280	661280	FUs of the Week.
661280	677160	The FU of the Week goes towards the Jehovahís Witness that knocked on the door to Kristenís
677160	679760	house before I left today.
679760	684840	Iím hiding behind the corner because I know Iím going to have choice awards for this
684840	685840	woman.
685840	691600	But sheís like, sheís coming to the door, and Kristenís like, ìHi, can I help you?î
691600	697200	and sheís like, ìOh, I have very important information for you, hereís your own personal
697200	701960	copy of things to help you understand whatís going on in the world!î And she goes, ìIs
701960	708720	this religious?î ìNo, itís from the Bible!î ìExcuse me!î And then she proceeds to go
708720	716600	on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian
716600	722840	or believes in God or anything like that, itís, first of all, the woman tries to lie
722840	728600	about her purpose for being there, which is very un-Christian-like, then again, weíve
728600	734520	had this for centuries, ìOh, the Crusades, the witch hunts, how about that?î But anyway,
734520	741280	she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference, and the thing is,
741280	748840	you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing
748840	749840	that you do.
749840	750840	It doesnít work.
750840	756840	And finally, Iím like, and Kristenís like, ìOh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!î
756840	761960	Iím like, so, I said, ìOkay, hereís my take on this.
761960	764640	The Bible was written by human beings.
764640	765760	God did not write it.
765760	767280	God told them what to put in it.
767280	772000	Therefore, when God comes to earth and says, ìHereís a book that I wrote by myself.
772000	777360	I hope you like it, then I will take the Bible literally.î And then I said, ìThank you
777360	778360	very much.
778360	779360	Goodbye,î and shut the door.
779360	783360	She gave me this look like, itís utter disbelief, like, ìOh, my God, nobodyís ever pointed
783360	790360	that out to me before,î and turned around and left, and spent silence.
790360	793320	And all I could see was, ìOh, my God, Iím so hardcore.î
793320	798040	This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico, and I remember Prop 22 here in California,
798040	801160	which is the one that said they were going to write, ìMarriage is only between a man
801160	807600	and a womanî in the State Constitution, and this woman came to my door and was like, ìYes,
807600	812580	I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.
812580	815800	How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?î
815800	820280	And Iím like, ìHoney, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.î And she did.
820280	828360	But she was embarrassed, she was like, ìOh, oh, I see.î Iím like, ìYouíre not going
828360	832080	to catch it, but run.î Iím a very open-minded person.
832080	835320	I grew up Southern Baptist, I mean, jeez.
835320	841040	If I could escape that with an open mind, if I could escape growing up Southern Baptist
841040	849080	in Alabama with an open mind, then Iím fairly tolerant of peopleís religious preferences.
849080	857600	But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that
857600	864720	you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you
864720	869320	ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.
869320	885080	We have to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.
885080	890960	I think we can end on the note saying, ìIf you are totally religious, then thatís cool.
890960	894800	We totally respect that.î One of my best friends is a very religious person and I totally
894800	900200	respect that because he respects my right to choose my own religion and the fact that
900200	905200	we have freedom of religion in this country, so I think diversity is great.
905200	910200	Thatís why I think youíre welcome to see how you feel, youíre welcome to believe what
910200	911200	you do, but youíre right.
911200	915320	You can share with me, but your right to share that with me ends when you force it on me.
915320	919000	Yeah, and I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, actually, no, anyway, weíve got
919000	920000	to move on.
920000	925200	Anyways, I have to read this in chat, RPGKing7 says, ìNo, whatís better is these two fairly
925200	929480	hot Jehovahís Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, ìIf God loves me, then
929480	934080	youíll show me your tits.îî Thatís disgusting, come on, letís keep it moving.
934080	943000	Anyways, FU2 Comcast, because I upgraded to Comcastís HD service, and first off, there
943000	948400	arenít that many channels anyways, but second off, our new cable box keeps randomly shutting
948400	954680	off, like once every hour to once every five minutes, and itís very annoying, and in fact
954680	959800	now itís starting to make static noise out of our right speaker, and I checked everything
959800	964280	and well, theyíre just retarded, so finally the Leafs are coming to fix it on Tuesday,
964280	970000	but I shouldnít have to put up with that crap.
970000	975960	My FU goes to my taste buds because Iím constantly craving junk food all week, like right now
975960	979480	Iím craving pie.
979480	980480	Thatís it.
980480	981480	Meagletop, do you have anything?
981480	989600	I have two short ones, Iím doing a preemptive FU to Endemero for not including Lasenka in
989600	994640	the new Pump It Up mix thatís going to be announced this month, because I know it wonít
994640	999960	be there, because they donít like me enough, and then FU to myself for not trying to jump
999960	1003960	on Taco Bell Boy today, because heís still really hot.
1003960	1006960	Hey Rob, I have one more.
1006960	1007960	What?
1007960	1016160	This is on behalf of several friends of mine, when, okay men, remember this, if you try
1016160	1021000	to hit on somebody while theyíre working to say Iím sorry Iím a lesbian, donít say
1021000	1026320	oh thatís okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.
1026320	1029400	They donít want your cock pissed off.
1029400	1033120	They want pussy.
1033120	1034640	Thank you for that blunt explanation.
1034640	1040360	Well, you have to be blunt, because the majority of straight men out there only think, Iím
1040360	1044800	saying majority, most that Iíve encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy
1044800	1045800	and itís not their brain.
1045800	1049040	Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because theyíre
1049040	1050040	so fabulously hot.
1050040	1051040	Theyíre so fabulously hot.
1051040	1052040	That is very true.
1052040	1055960	Thatís true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.
1055960	1056960	Men just want to watch.
1056960	1059520	You know what, yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.
1059520	1062960	Iím like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesnít really work that way, Iím not programmed
1062960	1063960	for that.
1063960	1068120	Anyway, weíre getting into TMI, so letís get into some game releases.
1068120	1072040	Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.
1072040	1074920	In Japan, Iíve got the Japanese release dates for you guys.

1100200	1101200	as well.
1101200	1106820	Okami is making its way to Japan, as well as SSX On Tour is going into the best hits

1117680	1123440	another Sudoku game is coming out as well from Milestone, and we have this interesting
1123440	1124440	title.
1124440	1125680	Letís see how bad I can butcher this.
1125680	1127580	Was that Hainotori?
1127580	1128580	Which one?
1128580	1130000	The one you said before Hainotori?
1130000	1131800	Oh God, on whichÖ
1131800	1132800	Sorry.
1132800	1133800	Oh no, itís separated.
1133800	1134800	Itís Hainotori-hen.
1134800	1136800	Ok, that means firebird.
1136800	1139240	Oh, thatís what it is.
1139240	1142280	And then we have this one as well, this should be interesting on the DS.
1142280	1148120	Itís Nisas Shoujo Manga Ka, Chao Manga School.
1148120	1150760	So this is how to be a shoujo manga artist?
1150760	1153920	Pretty much, it looks likeÖ no, it looks like it actually takes place like in a school.
1153920	1154920	Iím looking at some of the screenshots.
1154920	1155920	Manga Ka is aÖ
1155920	1156920	Oh no, it does teach you how to draw.
1156920	1157920	A manga writer.
1157920	1158920	Oh yeah, look, seeÖ
1158920	1159920	Shoujo is girl.
1159920	1160920	See, look, it teaches you how to draw.
1160920	1163120	Basically, itís going to teach you how to draw Sailor Moon.
1163120	1165120	Yeah, see, look, there it is.
1165120	1167320	Coming out from TDK Mediactive.
1167320	1168800	I actually think Iíll get that game.
1168800	1171560	That might be kind of fun.
1171560	1174120	The importers are wanting $48.90 for it.
1174120	1175680	Dude, Iíll get it.
1175680	1177800	Gotta love those import games and their high, high prices.
1177800	1180840	Well, hey, if you do Dil Jinshi or an artist, thatís a good game for you.
1180840	1183480	I need to give PSP a little love real quick as well.
1183480	1185200	Theyíre also getting some games.
1185200	1188800	Mostly Koei Entertainmentís bringing out some stuff into their best series.
1188800	1194520	Nobunaga no Yabu is going into the best series, as well as La Corda de Oro.
1194520	1199480	Looks like this oneís a new game thatís comingÖ no, itís just going into Koei selection.
1199480	1204880	Marukanaro Jiku no Uchi Day 2.
1204880	1209320	Enjoy if youíre in Japan and have access to those games.
1209320	1216360	Well, speaking of games that arenít in Japan, how about our friends over in Europe?
1216360	1221520	So letís see what is coming out in the upcoming week, shall we?
1221520	1227960	Coming out on the 6th, we have Football Manager 2007 on 360 and PSP.
1227960	1229680	Thatís an interesting combination.
1229680	1234360	Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe, which I recommend everybody get because itís
1234360	1235360	fun.
1235360	1236960	Sega Genesis Collection.
1236960	1242880	Also on the 10th, we have Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Team

1256960	1260640	which I actually do have to say is pretty damn fun just from the demo.
1260640	1265920	You can download the demo on Xbox Live right now if you want to give it a go, but I recommend
1265920	1271880	that if you want to win, use Kane.
1271880	1276440	Of course, the U.S. is going to be seeing one hell of a week for releases.
1276440	1279560	Starting off, of course, with the portable stuff, weíve got Elite Beat Agents coming
1279560	1286480	out on the DS, Digimon World DS, My Frogger Toy TrialsÖ crap!
1286480	1293440	And letís see hereÖ Winx Club, The Quest for CodexÖ also crap!
1293440	1297000	And letís seeÖ Wait, wait, I thought Megalotov was a fan
1297000	1299560	of the Winx games.
1299560	1300880	I just work on him.
1300880	1302760	Iím not really a fan.
1302760	1303760	Never mind.
1303760	1305200	I better not grill you further or you might get in trouble.
1305200	1312440	Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy V Advance is coming out and Polarium Advance as well.
1312440	1314640	Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers Iíve ever played.
1314640	1316880	I would not be interested in it on the Advance.
1316880	1323920	On the PC, weíve got Final Fantasy XI Vanadial Collection 2007, in case youíre not a member
1323920	1326000	of Final Fantasy XI yet.
1326000	1333280	Left Behind, Eternal Forces, the godly Grand Theft Auto game, the Sims 2 Happy Holiday
1333280	1340040	stuff, and of course, if you have a Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Aircraft Power Pack
1340040	1341040	will be coming out.
1341040	1346160	Then on a lot of systems, Call of Duty 3 is going to be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox,
1346160	1347160	and the 360.
1347160	1353320	Weíve got Tony Hawkís Project 8 coming out on Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Xbox, and
1353320	1355680	Xbox 360.
1355680	1359480	Luminous 2 on the PSP.
1359480	1365580	Of course, weíve also got Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Guitar Hero 2 is coming
1365580	1366580	out.
1366580	1371400	Weíve got Sopranos and the Sopranos Collectorís Edition, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined Assault
1371400	1380040	for the Playstation 2, Sega Genesis Collection on the Playstation 2, and PSP.
1380040	1387460	On the 360, the HD DVD player is coming out this week actually, Gears of War, and then
1387460	1394840	Viva Pinata, and of course, one of my favorites to sell at least, the History Channel, American
1394840	1402200	Civil War, Nation Divided on PS2 and the 360, another budget Activision game for you, and
1402200	1403200	Blitz Elite.
1403200	1404200	Thatís it.
1404200	1405200	Lots of stuff.
1405200	1411400	Alright, it should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, thatís for sure.
1411400	1413240	Oh my God, yeah, seriously.
1413240	1417040	Itís like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.
1417040	1421760	Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.
1421760	1426520	Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split screen.
1426520	1429840	Changing topics completely to something thatís already out but maybe we didnít know about
1429840	1433880	thatís in stores, one of our listeners actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent
1433880	1438520	post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted at a local store.
1438520	1442320	He spotted Dance Dance Revolution, the DVD game.
1442320	1446080	He saw this at Best Buy, and you might be thinking, ìOh, thatís interesting, a DDR
1446080	1449760	game that you can play in your DVD player.î Well, hereís the deal.
1449760	1457480	You have a dance pad, but since itís a DVD game, it doesnít plug into anything.
1457480	1461560	You just have a dance pad that you can mimic the on-screen stuff to with the dance pad.
1461560	1462560	Basically, this is what it is.
1462560	1466180	Itís an interactive DDR game that can be played on a DVD player.
1466180	1471120	It has a dancer named Roxy that teaches you how to play the game in over 30 dance sessions,
1471120	1474260	and this will train you to play with the DDR console games.
1474260	1476800	The DDR mats are strictly just for show.
1476800	1479920	Itís put out by imagination, and it retails for 30 bucks.
1479920	1483840	Why donít they just put it as a training mode for some of these console games?
1483840	1488680	A lot of people are going, ìOMG, lame!î Thatís basically the response.
1488680	1491720	But whatís interesting about this is that some folks have also been bringing up, ìWell,
1491720	1496980	this is a way for folks who canít really afford the whole system and the more expensive
1496980	1501320	game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of
1501320	1503640	the game telling them they suck.î I donít know.
1503640	1509600	Also, if you donít have a dance mat and you donít have the game, dropping $70 or $49.99
1509600	1516600	or whatever for the game, the dance mat is a little much, so maybe $20 for a DVD is not
1516600	1517600	so bad.
1517600	1522480	Iím kind of surprised itís not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry
1522480	1530160	Shortcake DDR or what have you.
1530160	1533960	This guy, El Mullet, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with
1533960	1534960	the Internet.
1534960	1539480	DarkSakra serves the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with
1539480	1540480	all of you guys.
1540480	1544640	Itís called the Website of the Week, and DarkSakra is going to tell you what her browser
1544640	1551080	is looking at right now.
1551080	1557600	The website of the week, after lots of looking, is the Catsite.com.
1557600	1563040	Yes, itís a site all about cats and how to take care of them.
1563040	1574640	It has things about kittens, it has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior,
1574640	1575640	hairball care.
1575640	1578120	I recommend going to the Catsite.com.
1578120	1580440	Yes, I have a cat.
1580440	1586600	There is Shermy, and Shermy has benefited from this site.
1586600	1591600	I have to admit, I prefer DailyKitten.com for my cat needs.
1591600	1592600	My cat-loving needs.
1592600	1596240	Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.
1596240	1597240	Or StuffOnMyCat.com.
1597240	1599680	Iíve already done StuffOnMyCat, remember?
1599680	1600680	Thatís right, you did.
1600680	1601680	A long time ago.
1601680	1602680	They need StuffOnMyBaby.com.
1602680	1603680	Wow.
1603680	1609080	I think that would be funny because people put weird things on their babies.
1609080	1612760	I donít know if you should encourage that.
1612760	1613760	Is there one already?
1613760	1615520	Oh, Iím worried Iím going to get porn or something.
1615520	1616520	Letís try this.
1616520	1617520	www.stuffonmybaby.com.
1617520	1630800	Oh, this page is parked free courtesy of GoDaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.
1630800	1633800	How nice.
1633800	1637840	So I guess thereís no Stuff On My Baby yet, but Go Daddy says thereís one coming soon,
1637840	1639600	as soon as someone buys the domain from them.
1639600	1642600	Iím telling you, the Stuff On My Cat, they needed the Stuff On My Baby because people
1642600	1644800	dress up their kids really stupidly.
1644800	1648120	I have a Stuff On My Cat calendar now.
1648120	1650080	How about Stuff On My Politician?
1650080	1653320	I donít know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.
1653320	1659080	Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign
1659080	1664700	commercial going on, and basically heís this ultra-conservative guy, and heís bragging
1664700	1671880	about his support of video game violence initiatives, taking a stand against video game violence.
1671880	1676840	But what should be noted about this commercial, that Game Politics points out, is that in
1676840	1680840	the commercial, Santorium delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers, towards the
1680840	1683400	end of the commercial, an elbow.
1683400	1685800	He elbows this wrestler in the face.
1685800	1691240	So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence, and then he is violent against
1691240	1699280	a wrestler in the commercial, and pretty much anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
1699280	1704120	Thatís this guyís platform, anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
1704120	1706760	Why is it simulated when you can go do it?
1706760	1708360	You know what the conservatives want?
1708360	1712680	They want you to put down the video games, and they want you to go fight in the real
1712680	1713680	war.
1713680	1720960	Well, you know, itís kind of not just conservatives in my mind, because it was Hillary Clintonís
1720960	1721960	thing too.
1721960	1722960	Itís kind of all across the board.
1722960	1726900	I think thereís just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what
1726900	1728900	party theyíre with.
1728900	1732400	We need to re-educate them by voting them out of office, because if youíre over the
1732400	1738200	age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator
1738200	1741800	is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation thatís not going
1741800	1743920	to go through or anything.
1743920	1745280	So do your research.
1745280	1746280	Election Day is coming up.
1746280	1751520	You know, thereís actually, I want to change my website, because this one, and Iím just
1751520	1752520	trying to verify that.
1752520	1753520	Wait, wait, do we need theÖ
1753520	1754520	We donít need the music again.
1754520	1755520	Are you sure?
1755520	1756520	Iím sure.
1756520	1757520	Are you sure youíre sure?
1757520	1767400	Iím trying to verify the name of the site, because Iíve been there before.
1767400	1772800	I think itís like VoteSmart.com or SmartVote or something like that.
1772800	1775360	I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.
1775360	1778660	You know whatís funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays, Election
1778660	1784060	Day will have already passed, so maybe itís kind of a move point now.
1784060	1787880	Maybe we should have done this story in Part A. Oops, oh well.
1787880	1788880	No.
1788880	1791640	Well, anyway, people should be going there anyway.
1791640	1795760	Alex in our chat room says, ìI nominate Rob for the Gamersí Party ticket with Jamie as
1795760	1800080	his Vice President.î Thatís nice, except Iím not 35.
1800080	1801080	Almost, but not quite.
1801080	1807280	Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.
1807280	1813120	Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded
1813120	1817240	consoles, but itís also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.
1817240	1823360	Thatís right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going
1823360	1829640	to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on
1829640	1836000	locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent
1836000	1842600	players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.
1842600	1848720	Basically there are three ways to hack your G-scores, and basically there are three different
1848720	1849720	methods.
1849720	1855760	Save games dating from the launch to March and April that were unlocked and you can be
1855760	1857800	traded with other users.
1857800	1863000	Games after that have been locked to specific consoles, but people are hex editing them
1863000	1865380	to change the console ID.
1865380	1871320	And then, of course, certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile
1871320	1876400	locked and only on those profiles can you play them, so people are cheating that as
1876400	1877960	well.
1877960	1881140	Very interesting, but Iím sure people are going to find a way around it, because they
1881140	1885600	always do.
1885600	1888720	Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to
1888720	1894000	you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places, because we talked about the
1894000	1896840	Game Pro thing earlier in the show, weíve talked about E3, but these are all things
1896840	1897840	that happen in America.
1897840	1902280	Of course, you know the other big shows that happen, thereís the one in Germany, thereís
1902280	1905400	Tokyo Game Show, thereís other game shows in other parts of the world where we have
1905400	1906400	listeners.
1906400	1910920	I know we have listeners in Canada and the Arcadia Gaming Festival is going to be taking
1910920	1916800	place November 10th through the 12th at the Stade Unipree in Montreal in Canada.
1916800	1923360	Itís going to be a very big event, theyíre saying, and theyíve got sponsors including
1923360	1925920	Nintendo, Microsoft, and Ubisoft.
1925920	1930600	The website says, ìArcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and
1930600	1935680	emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.î Does that mean everyoneís
1935680	1936680	getting high?
1936680	1937680	I donít know.
1937680	1943080	Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days, and there is a service fee with that
1943080	1948280	though, so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian, thatís about $22 US by the way.
1948280	1952580	Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who
1952580	1957440	might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.
1957440	1961080	Have fun.
1961080	1968920	Also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.
1968920	1972820	Basically theyíre bringing in virtual taxation.
1972820	1980360	If you earn money, you have to pay taxes, so for anyone doing profits online or playing
1980360	1989560	games like Second Life or World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says,
1989560	1993920	ìIf youíre getting a monetary benefit, then itís not treated any differently.
1993920	1994920	Normal rules apply.
1994920	1998800	Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working nine to five
1998800	2007640	in an office.î So basically for anyone who earns money via their internet addictions,
2007640	2009560	then youíre going to get taxed.
2009560	2012120	Hereís where I have a problem with this.
2012120	2017840	If theyíre going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses
2017840	2020760	and I want restitution for that.
2020760	2022040	Thatís why I think it would be fair.
2022040	2024200	If you want to go one way, youíve got to do both.
2024200	2028160	You canít have the cake without paying the money.
2028160	2029160	I donít know.
2029160	2030160	Thatís a bad analogy.
2030160	2031160	Whatever.
2031160	2032160	I had nothing.
2032160	2035960	But I want damn money for losing tons of money in an online game.
2035960	2038960	I think thatís only fair.
2038960	2046480	So, the big trend with Japan and actually the United States and portable consoles is
2046480	2048280	releasing them in multiple colors.
2048280	2052440	Well, youíre going to get three brand new colors in Japan for the PSP.
2052440	2053440	Thatís right.
2053440	2059360	Theyíre going to be getting pink, silver, and metallic blue and unfortunately none of
2059360	2065040	those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except
2065040	2069760	for me, the pink one, which looks stupid.
2069760	2071520	Should you spend your money on this?
2071520	2073560	Probably not if you already have one.
2073560	2080760	But if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP, then nowís the time.
2080760	2081760	I donít know.
2081760	2082760	Hooray.
2082760	2085760	I want a pink PSP.
2085760	2086760	Not.
2086760	2087760	Wait.
2087760	2093160	Miklotov is the one thatís the color whore when it comes to systems.
2093160	2098400	Youíve totally taken systems back and traded it just to get a blue DS and stuff.
2098400	2099400	Yep.
2099400	2101440	So do any of these new color PSPs interest you?
2101440	2102440	The blue one.
2102440	2103440	Of course.
2103440	2105440	I honestly really want it.
2105440	2109920	I saw the picture and I was like, ìWow, itís a blue PSP.
2109920	2111640	I need it back.î
2111640	2117200	When I was at Yalicon, there were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing
2117200	2119640	a different color DS.
2119640	2120640	Thatís cute.
2120640	2123240	I have a pink GBA.
2123240	2127200	For like $20, you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.
2127200	2130480	In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.
2130480	2134800	You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.
2134800	2138640	Theyíre available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.
2138640	2141440	Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.
2141440	2144260	You know what I thought was interesting is I was at the mall today and I didnít notice
2144260	2148520	how many freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to PIP my iPod.
2148520	2153840	They had all these places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever little encasings they
2153840	2158240	have that you can put SpongeBob on your iPod and stuff and you can pretty much do the same
2158240	2159240	thing with the PSP.
2159240	2160240	You know what I havenít seen this year?
2160240	2161240	What?
2161240	2162240	The knockoff Nintendos.
2162240	2163240	Maybe they finally got pulled.
2163240	2165240	Didnít they get sued years ago or something?
2165240	2166240	I donít know.
2166240	2167240	That doesnít stop people.
2167240	2168240	Maybe they didnít sell well.
2168240	2169240	I donít know.
2169240	2170240	Oh yeah, laws.
2170240	2171600	Theyíre going to put laws in place to stop the black market.
2171600	2172920	Oh, thatís going to work.
2172920	2177520	Well, Microsoft is hoping that this will sell well, if it is true anyway.
2177520	2181520	This is in rumor status right now, but it certainly seems plausible.
2181520	2188320	The rumor is that Microsoft will begin offering downloadable HD movies later this month.
2188320	2193320	Supposedly itís going to launch around November 22nd and 1,100 hours of video would be available
2193320	2197640	to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.
2197640	2202840	Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period and purchases would be from $10 to
2202840	2207420	$15, very similar to pay-per-view and iTunes.
2207420	2212060	I donít know if Iíd buy this though, because to me this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player
2212060	2214000	if theyíre going to move this direction, right?
2214000	2219480	Not necessarily, because youíre only going to have so much room on your hard drive to
2219480	2220480	fit movies.
2220480	2221480	Yeah, thatís the other thing.
2221480	2222600	Thereís no room.
2222600	2225880	How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20-gigabyte drive?
2225880	2228320	Well, I donít know, but hereís the other thing too.
2228320	2233960	The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it, so they
2233960	2236000	could do this if they wanted to.
2236000	2238320	Thatís one of the things that they just added.
2238320	2244720	So it kind of seems a little coincidental if theyíre going to be implementing this
2244720	2250160	pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.
2250160	2253680	I donít know.
2253680	2255840	It just seems a little soon for this.
2255840	2258840	I still think youíre kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.
2258840	2262880	Well, theyíve got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution
2262880	2263880	stuff.
2263880	2264880	Weíll see.
2264880	2268240	Justin in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late
2268240	2269240	ë90s.
2269240	2270240	I donít know, because you can buy them.
2270240	2271840	Theyíre going to have to announce a bigger hard drive is what theyíre going to have
2271840	2272840	to do.
2272840	2274640	What are you going to do when youíre done with a movie?
2274640	2277440	You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and itís still
2277440	2278440	yours?
2278440	2279440	Iím thinking the drives are not big enough.
2279440	2280440	Possibly.
2280440	2284800	I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that thereís a 60-gig
2284800	2289200	thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.
2289200	2290200	You know?
2290200	2291200	I donít know.
2291200	2292200	It doesnít make sense.
2292200	2295680	Justin thinks they can stream the movies.
2295680	2298680	They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.
2298680	2299680	I donít know.
2299680	2301560	That wouldnít necessarily work, depending on how bad your service is.
2301560	2305120	It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.
2305120	2306480	Weíll see.
2306480	2310600	And of course, Bandit wants to know, ìWhen does the Wizard get released for the 360?î
2310600	2316260	I donít think it would, because it was a Nintendo commercial, so they donít want it.
2316260	2317260	But I donít know.
2317260	2318260	I could be wrong.
2318260	2320040	One thing that we want is your e-mails.
2320040	2323480	Every week we invite you guys to e-mail us at MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we
2323480	2329840	pick a few of our favorite letters that hopefully youíd like them too, and we read them here
2329840	2330840	on air.
2330840	2334600	So please, why donít you drop us an e-mail, MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and the
2334600	2339600	Dark Sakura is going to read some of her favorite e-mails right now.
2339600	2349840	Well, weíve got quite a number of e-mails now, all going to be read by the ferret, so
2349840	2351720	hereís the first one.
2351720	2354040	Okay, never mind.
2354040	2356920	First e-mail comes from Wolf.
2356920	2360460	I actually have two e-mails, so Iím just going to read them together, because actually
2360460	2362160	I sort of am happy about one.
2362160	2363160	ìSo this goes out to Jamie.
2363160	2366120	I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game
2366120	2371280	system for two to three times the value when someone who canít enjoy it has to pay that
2371280	2372280	much.î
2372280	2382960	Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe morals are becoming slowly corroded
2382960	2387800	over time, and I think somebodyís got to have them, so thank you.
2387800	2394400	One for Rob, ìI think youíre the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?
2394400	2398360	Did you quit before or after the whole chocobo-raising update?î
2398360	2403600	I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI, right when they did the chocobo,
2403600	2405240	but it only lasted about a month.
2405240	2409880	Miklotov was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit.
2409880	2414280	I think I got Coursera to level 14, if that, and then quit.
2414280	2418560	I did get a chocobo, and I raised it, but not past baby stage.
2418560	2423980	ìOh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.î But then I quit, and now
2423980	2424980	Iímó
2424980	2426660	I remember you had a little Kim back in the day.
2426660	2431240	That was actually my mule, so it was a secondary character I had named Little Kim.
2431240	2435760	Maybe someday Iíll go back to Final Fantasy XI, but right now itís all about Final Fantasy
2435760	2437800	Star Universe, as far as MMOs go.
2437800	2440840	And Final Fantasy XII, hello!
2440840	2441840	Lots of stuff to be playing.
2441840	2447240	Well, as far as other e-mails are concerned, we have one from AZHP again.
2447240	2455960	Okay, it says, ìHey guys, AZHP again, reporting back from Stonetowns, Karaoke Revolution presents
2455960	2458000	American Idol dealie.
2458000	2462160	Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.
2462160	2464840	But anyway, my thoughts on the game.
2464840	2468160	Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that Iíve played, but the whole
2468160	2474160	American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.
2474160	2477720	I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person,
2477720	2480680	cause there were only a few sound bites for each judge.
2480680	2484760	Also since itís on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate, and not in
2484760	2485880	a good way.
2485880	2488000	And when they talk, the lips donít sync up.
2488000	2492560	Also, the pitch recognition still needs work, judges a little too harshly, just like all
2492560	2493560	the previous games.
2493560	2495560	A decent party game, but not great.
2495560	2497480	Yeah, thatís not surprising.
2497480	2499440	Well, I think itís not done yet either.
2499440	2500440	No.
2500440	2503440	Well, no, isnít it?
2503440	2507800	Were they talking about the little tour theyíre doing?
2507800	2508800	Yeah.
2508800	2510440	I donít think thatís a final build.
2510440	2515840	No, so I wouldnít totally base your opinions on that build.
2515840	2520400	But, you know, itís going to give you the general feel of the game, at least.
2520400	2526640	Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.
2526640	2531280	Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kudaragi, here is a reason for the
2531280	2533520	Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.
2533520	2536220	People say heís bad to the customers, eh?
2536220	2540720	He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.
2540720	2544600	When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the
2544600	2547680	technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.
2547680	2549080	So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.
2549080	2551080	Thought it might interest you all.
2551080	2557800	Yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah,
2557800	2560240	there was a bunch of big fallout over that.
2560240	2564760	I think there were evenóI remember back in the dayódidnít they have image prototypes?
2564760	2569160	Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?
2569160	2573160	I seem to remember in Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture,
2573160	2575240	but you know, this is so long ago.
2575240	2576240	Yeah.
2576240	2581400	But thatís still an interesting point, one that not everyone is aware of.
2581400	2586960	Got an email from Alex, it says, ìHey, O.L.R., Alex from chat here.
2586960	2593320	I suspect Iím too late for mailbag 207.î And or that the story Iím going to touch on
2593320	2596360	hasnít come up on the show yet, but oh well, Iím going to talk anyway.
2596360	2600440	ìIím pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween,
2600440	2601440	which it was.
2601440	2603320	However, nobody knew how bad this update was.
2603320	2605920	A lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing.
2605920	2607920	This is now fixed, but thereís another problem.
2607920	2612120	The update effectively bricked consoles.î Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part
2612120	2615520	A, but I thought it wasó
2615520	2617240	This is right at the top of this part, but thatís alright.
2617240	2619200	Actually, our listener, that listenerís in chat tonight.
2619200	2620200	Yeah.
2620200	2623040	So heís the same guy who said he had a bricked console, so.
2623040	2626720	But I still think it was interesting that, you know, weíve got people who do have more
2626720	2629800	thoughts on that one.
2629800	2632840	It was the final comment on here that made me really think about it.
2632840	2637400	Itís way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening.
2637400	2638400	Good point.
2638400	2639400	Another email comesó
2639400	2645280	But wait a minute, though, at the same time, you know, partóat least the rumor or whatever
2645280	2650440	is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so
2650440	2654720	Sony couldnít say any longer that theyíre the only console that can do the true HD.
2654720	2655720	So at the sameó
2655720	2656720	But how well did they test it?
2656720	2659920	Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasnít the time to be rushing things, so Iíll buy
2659920	2660920	into that.
2660920	2664680	We have an email from Warrior Bob.
2664680	2665680	Warrior Bob is cool.
2665680	2666680	Hey, guys.
2666680	2670360	I heard the discussion this last week about Konamiís acquisition of the In the Groove
2670360	2671360	franchise.
2671360	2675020	I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so Iíll leave
2675020	2678680	my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.
2678680	2681960	I did feel, however, that the situation wasnít portrayed entirely accurately.
2681960	2686000	Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking
2686000	2690720	of was StepMania, the open-source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.
2690720	2694720	In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort,
2694720	2698960	although some resources are shared between the projects, some code, and I believe some
2698960	2701460	staff were involved in both In the Groove and StepMania.
2701460	2707000	The settlement implies that marketing and sales of a game of such similarity does constitute
2707000	2711880	infringement that is on Rockstar Red Octaneís and not StepManiaís, as they have never sold
2711880	2712880	anything.
2712880	2717120	The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.
2717120	2719480	Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.
2719480	2723640	At one point I worked with the StepMania team on a very small level, helped write a manual,
2723640	2728940	check out the In the Groove 1 Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have
2728940	2732200	an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.
2732200	2735360	So while corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the
2735360	2736360	next one.
2736360	2743200	With all due respect, no, I meant Fan Tribute and I still feel thatís how I feel the game
2743200	2748960	is because if you look at the folks that developed In the Groove, half of them were posters on
2748960	2754320	DDR Seattle before In the Groove ever came out, so maybe it wasnít called a fan tribute
2754320	2760120	like StepMania was, but in my mind it was that fandom of DDR and they probably all met
2760120	2763800	each other on this forum and stuff that caused them to make the game.
2763800	2768240	I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end itís all about the dollar
2768240	2771120	and they did steal the idea.
2771120	2774640	And that was kind of part of what I was saying last week is that I kind of felt a little
2774640	2779880	bit bad because I feel like it was an innocent thing and they really did just want to make
2779880	2785740	the concept of dance games better until the dollar came into play and I think Rock Store
2785740	2789320	stepped in and all this stuff, but then again we had Renee here last week who says sheís
2789320	2792520	had interaction with these folks and theyíre a little bit uppity.
2792520	2795280	I donít know, Iím not going to speak because I donít really know these folks, but I will
2795280	2796280	say this.
2796280	2799760	I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.
2799760	2802240	Folks used to ask, ìWhat is your legal angle on this?
2802240	2805560	How is this game legal?î and they would just say, ìDonít talk about it.
2805560	2810080	Weíve got it covered.î And now itís kind of like, ìYou know what?
2810080	2812880	You got served.
2812880	2817200	Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?î Thatís kind of the one part
2817200	2819360	I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.
2819360	2823040	They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.
2823040	2826140	I still think that the product was well-deserved.
2826140	2828480	You donít take somebody elseís idea and try to make money on it.
2828480	2833440	Itís like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any
2833440	2834440	picture.
2834440	2837840	Itís like, ìOh, but we love your style.î That doesnít matter to me.
2837840	2838840	You stole my art.
2838840	2840880	Thatís how I would feel.
2840880	2852120	Anyway, my font is very strange on the e-mail, so I apologize.
2852120	2853680	I think itís Schwal 22.
2853680	2854680	Yeah.
2854680	2855680	You know what?
2855680	2856680	This is funny.
2856680	2857680	This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.
2857680	2864600	I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?, I think was the game, and now he listens to
2864600	2865600	the show.
2865600	2866600	Itís kind of cool.
2866600	2867600	Thatís pretty cool.
2867600	2871000	Just to explain, my Lís and my 1ís look the same in this font.
2871000	2872000	Hey, folks.
2872000	2873000	Love the show and the info.
2873000	2875840	I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.
2875840	2880280	I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ìcoî and ends with ìtakuî lol.
2880280	2885880	Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but
2885880	2893640	IGNís Matt Casamassina stated earlier this week that that would be possible.
2893640	2897760	Any sort of clarity would be good because I donít own a GameCube and may need to buy
2897760	2898760	the controller.
2898760	2903440	Lastly, the SD memory cards will not be able to play downloaded games at a friendís house
2903440	2904480	on his or her Wii.
2904480	2905480	How is that possible?
2905480	2909280	I understand the region coding of a system, but how can a system justify where the ROM
2909280	2912960	ñ thatís basically what it is, the emulators are already on the system ñ came from in
2912960	2914040	the first place?
2914040	2916840	How will they expect to sell virtual games when they canít travel?
2916840	2919400	Oh well, sorry for the long e-mail, just info.
2919400	2921800	I think everyone should be aware of and keep up the good work.
2921800	2925120	Itís a very informative show, and sometimes questionable.
2925120	2927000	Man Cannon and Love HamÖsterÖ
2927000	2934680	Dude, it really is called the Man Cannon.
2934680	2936360	Thatís what they said on the sites this week.
2936360	2937680	It really is the Man Cannon.
2937680	2939080	What were you going to say, Logie?
2939080	2946680	I was going to say that the Xbox Live Arcade does not have ñ you canít trade the games
2946680	2948080	with other people and bring them over.
2948080	2952200	You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you canít actually bring your full
2952200	2953960	game with them.
2953960	2958600	Thatís why your profile is linked to basically your console, so youíre only going to be
2958600	2960600	able to download them there.
2960600	2961600	You know whatís interesting?
2961600	2965000	I was listening to Bobbyís show earlier tonight, and he was talking about ñ because he just
2965000	2969600	got a replacement console and it screwed up his arcade games because it was tied to the
2969600	2970600	old console.
2970600	2974080	But apparently if youíre signed in, if youíre the one signed in on the console and you bought
2974080	2976160	the game, it will work.
2976160	2978680	So thatís how you can take it, like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to
2978680	2979680	somebody elseís house.
2979680	2982240	Sign in, but itís still linked to your account.
2982240	2983240	Right.
2983240	2984240	So you have to sign in.
2984240	2986040	If you copy the game over, it wonít work for them.
2986040	2987040	Is that what Iím hearing?
2987040	2988040	It sounds like itís going to have a little ñ
2988040	2991640	But Iím thinking what you might be able to do though with that is you might be able to
2991640	2998520	sign in your account, maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work, but right
2998520	3000680	now theyíre saying you canít just bring your memory card over.
3000680	3003640	You have to bring the whole console with you, which I donít know about that.
3003640	3005560	I think you can probably bring your profile.
3005560	3009280	I think that Wii-Con is going to have ñ yeah, I think the Wii-Con has ñ because they say
3009280	3013760	that has internal storage in it, so it certainly could have your Nintendo version of gamer
3013760	3014760	card in it.
3014760	3015760	Thereís that.
3015760	3019880	And then, of course, what was the other thing real quick?
3019880	3023160	Vandalus in our chat room says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.
3023160	3028080	Yeah, so I donít think thatís really going to be an issue at all.
3028080	3033480	As far as the classic controller though, you will probably ñ youíre not going to be able
3033480	3036280	to play GameCube games with that, not at all.
3036280	3040120	And personally, Iíd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.
3040120	3045600	Youíd probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper
3045600	3050140	than buying the classic controller, I would think.
3050140	3051680	Especially third-party ones.
3051680	3052680	Exactly.
3052680	3058620	Well, if weíre ready to move on to the next email, we have two left.
3058620	3059920	This one comes from Chris.
3059920	3064400	ìHi, O.L.R., when my family and I were taking care of my sisterís little terrier puppy,
3064400	3067680	Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.
3067680	3071360	She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it
3071360	3072360	was.
3072360	3076800	Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.
3076800	3079800	This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your
3079800	3081000	show helped cheer me up.
3081000	3085180	Iíd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me
3085180	3090920	feel when you do the show and how you have made my life a little happier.
3090920	3094720	God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.î
3094720	3123360	Thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.
3123360	3125520	Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.
3125520	3130920	First off, I know that thereís all the news swirling around about next-gen systems and
3130920	3135120	all that, and Iím still desperately hunting down a Wii order, but there seems to be a
3135120	3138120	real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.
3138120	3141320	I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.
3141320	3145280	I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, The Import, and Contact last week, and Iím
3145280	3146280	really loving both of them.
3146280	3150940	Contactís got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay, and the instruction
3150940	3155760	book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars, and a surprising
3155760	3157640	lack of emo.
3157640	3160320	Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldnít have it any other way.
3160320	3161760	I saw what the new attorney looks like.
3161760	3174640	You know, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.
3174640	3178640	The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Starsign, Final Fantasy
3178640	3185000	3, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52, Scourge the Hive, and Touch
3185000	3186000	Detective.
3186000	3187640	Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?
3187640	3190080	I mean, really, Iím teasing.
3190080	3191400	Iím sure the gameís great.
3191400	3194960	Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?
3194960	3199280	Weíll go ahead and answer this part before we move on to the second part of the email.
3199280	3201280	So what games would you guys recommend?
3201280	3203480	Iíve heard really good things about Contact.
3203480	3206880	I actually want to check out this game myself, but itís just too busy of a season for me
3206880	3209520	to pick up games I donít know much about.
3209520	3214120	Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love
3214120	3216960	Owen Dawn, so Iím sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.
3216960	3220800	Final Fantasy 3 looks very promising, but of course, as Iíve admitted in part A, Iím
3220800	3222640	a whore for all things Final Fantasy.
3222640	3223640	Yes, it is.
3223640	3227400	Final Fantasy 5, too, because, you know, the game will advance, and do it in the Advance
3227400	3228400	port as well.
3228400	3231840	Miklotov, anything you can think of there for the DS?
3231840	3232840	Or PSP?
3232840	3237920	Well, Luminous 2 for PSP, and then youíre done.
3237920	3239560	What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?
3239560	3241560	I never played any of those, so I play Luminous 2.
3241560	3243880	I almost bought Work Time Fun today, but...
3243880	3250840	Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good, especially if youíre a fan of Luminous.
3250840	3255200	For PSP, Tony Hawkís Project 8, thatís going to be coming out.
3255200	3257400	Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.
3257400	3259600	Iím trying to think what else.
3259600	3260600	Really good stuff.
3260600	3264000	Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP, SOCOM, if youíre into the first person shooter
3264000	3265000	stuff.
3265000	3271000	Justice League is coming out, Marvel already came out, Ultimate Alliance.
3271000	3272000	Need for Speed, Carbon.
3272000	3275160	Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP and DS.
3275160	3280200	DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Starsign, Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery
3280200	3284720	Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS, and Zappy says ìI heard WTF is horrible.î I donít
3284720	3287240	know, I liked the demo at E3, it was kind of cute.
3287240	3292920	Well honestly, graphically, itís a crap game, but play-wise, the things that were in there
3292920	3297720	were just so crazy and out there, I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed
3297720	3300720	in their spare time, but it is so funny.
3300720	3304000	Also Pokemon Ranger is coming out, or actually came out.
3304000	3305000	Right.
3305000	3308360	Plenty of suggestions for you, my friend.
3308360	3314440	Well, thereís not too much, given the upcoming busy schedule Iím going to have when I start
3314440	3319760	school in January, Iíve been trying not to get into too many handheld games because Iím
3319760	3325480	not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them, but I am
3325480	3330240	getting Final Fantasy III, Iíve planned on that, I do want Children of Mana, but Iím
3330240	3333120	thinking about borrowing it with my friends when sheís done with it, and Iím definitely
3333120	3335400	getting Elite Beat Agents.
3335400	3336760	That Iím definitely getting.
3336760	3338400	Oh yeah, am I getting it.
3338400	3343560	But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores, so if you like
3343560	3345800	your music games, Iím sure youíll like it.
3345800	3353000	Right now, though, I did just pick up the, I forgot the name of it again, the Surgery
3353000	3354000	Game.
3354000	3355000	Oh, Trauma Center.
3355000	3356000	Trauma Center, yeah.
3356000	3359600	I remembered Under the Knife and I was like, oh yeah, Trauma Center, and Iím going to
3359600	3365960	be starting that coming up, so Iím looking forward to that.
3365960	3371280	I have to eventually steal our copy of Phoenix right from Danís DS so I can play it.
3371280	3372280	Was that the end of the mailbag?
3372280	3373840	No, thereís more to this letter.
3373840	3374840	Oh, Iím sorry.
3374840	3379000	Iím also going to be playing, Iíve also got Loco Rocco on PSP, which I actually love.
3379000	3383400	To finish up with the emails, also I just wanted to rant briefly about the PS3.
3383400	3389200	Iím trying to want this system, but weíve got a Devil May Cry with no Dante and no Devil
3389200	3392000	Trigger and Metal Gear Game with Snake committing suicide.
3392000	3396440	Whatís next, a Street Fighter where Ryu gets tired of fighting?
3396440	3399520	To end things on a happy note, what are your guysí favorite alcoholic drinks?
3399520	3405520	I really enjoy a nice glass of Dewarís 12-year Scotch and Pale Ales, Oktoberfest, and other
3405520	3407160	tasty specialty beers.
3407160	3409640	Keep on rocking, Mr. Wonderful.
3409640	3414040	Iíve been getting into wine lately.
3414040	3417220	I know, arenít I weird, Iím getting snooty.
3417220	3422040	If I feel like drinking something a little fufu, Iíll have a lemon drop, but if Iím
3422040	3427680	going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.
3427680	3434800	If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios Motherfucker, thatís what itís called.
3434800	3439600	I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass Well tequila or I will be throwing up all
3439600	3440600	over everybody.
3440600	3443520	Thatís the one problem I have with an Adios is I donít like tequila, but otherwise itís
3443520	3444520	a good drink.
3444520	3445520	I like good tequila.
3445520	3452640	Olive Garden has this, if you like fufu drinks, Olive Garden has the tastiest mixed berry
3452640	3453640	daiquiri.
3453640	3454640	Oh, sangria!
3454640	3455640	Thatís the other thing Iíve been hooked on lately.
3455640	3459280	Oh God, yeah, thatís my ultimate fufu drink.
3459280	3465640	I would say for wines, Iím a very big fan of sweet wines, so I like Umeshu, which is
3465640	3470480	a plum wine, actually real plum wine with the plums on the bottom of it, oh so good.
3470480	3479560	And I like Honey Runís, itís elderberry honey wine, itís basically a fruit mead.
3479560	3484600	I actually drink mead at Ren Faire, thatís the only time I actually have mead, because
3484600	3487560	when itís hot and youíre having this honey drink, it goes right to your head, and youíre
3487560	3494080	like, ìWow, Iím drunk.î My beer of choice is Shemay, the premier in the blue label,
3494080	3499560	and I also like Fat Tire, Bass, Guinness.
3499560	3502680	Rama in our chat room is pointing out, ìHey guys, you know we have underage people listening.î
3502680	3503680	Iím answering the email.
3503680	3507440	Donít drink until youíre 21, or 19 in Canada, or whatever it is.
3507440	3510920	Or whatever country youíre in, legal limit.
3510920	3514720	But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.
3514720	3519440	Hereís our moral thing, and we do believe this, we never drive when we drink, always
3519440	3522440	have a responsible driver, and just drink responsibly.
3522440	3529680	And donít get drunk every night at home by yourself, because thatís a sign of depression,
3529680	3530680	I think.
3530680	3535720	Iím not going to say anything.
3535720	3538640	I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.
3538640	3542840	As long as youíre not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, thatís
3542840	3543840	all.
3543840	3545840	Or an NBC Monday night movie.
3545840	3549560	We got a last minute email.
3549560	3555320	Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay, Jamieís evil, and Lokiís stupid for hating
3555320	3556320	Max.
3556320	3557320	Love DMN.
3557320	3558320	Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.
3558320	3560600	Wait, we didnít get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Mikol Tov.
3560600	3564160	Mikol Tov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?
3564160	3565160	I donít drink anymore.
3565160	3566160	Why not?
3566160	3571640	Because I think, well, I wonít say why, but it has to do with some time I shouldnít have
3571640	3576000	drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.
3576000	3578360	I see, I see, yes.
3578360	3584520	But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave
3584520	3585520	and Busterís.
3585520	3587640	I donít even remember what they were called, but they were so good.
3587640	3588640	Ooh, chocolate martini.
3588640	3589640	Oh, the grasshopper.
3589640	3590640	The grasshopper.
3590640	3591640	The frozen grasshopperís so good.
3591640	3594000	Actually, Dave and Busterís has a really good lemon drop.
3594000	3597120	All right, Loki, make it quick, we gotta get back to games.
3597120	3598120	Screwdriver.
3598120	3599120	All right.
3599120	3603320	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send your emails, and maybe weíll get
3603320	3605680	off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.
3605680	3609000	Letís get back into some news.
3609000	3610000	Excellent.
3610000	3616520	Anyways, so, weíve got, you know, we mentioned a lot of games coming out recently, and of
3616520	3621160	course thereís going to be some more games coming out from EA, and during their last
3621160	3625680	earnings announcement, they announced a bunch of new titles, some not a big surprise, some
3625680	3631480	pretty cool, including Sims 3, which is a big duh, which is also going to be on the
3631480	3638320	Wii and Playstation 3, next gen version of Black, a brand new SimCity game and Lord of
3638320	3649640	the Rings, Crysis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring, and of course
3649640	3657640	some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs, a brand new Road Rash game for next gen,
3657640	3662080	and of course Burnout 5, itís been announced for a while now.
3662080	3663720	Dude, new Road Rash?
3663720	3664720	Yeah.
3664720	3671120	Funny, I remember talking about Ghost Rider, part A, but whatever.
3671120	3674920	You know, you want to know, ever since part A now, Iíve had Henry Rollins Ghost Rider
3674920	3675920	running through my head.
3675920	3678200	I have to go watch The Crow now.
3678200	3685280	Okay, but anyway, things that, well, not surprising, Sony is warning of Playstation 3 pre-order
3685280	3686280	scams.
3686280	3692960	Theyíve issued a statement saying that websites offering discounted or book shipments have
3692960	3699600	not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.
3699600	3705600	The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or
3705600	3710840	its parent company, SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as
3710840	3713500	their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.
3713500	3717840	We recommend consumers purchase Playstation products only from authorized SCEA retailers
3717840	3721120	and resellers, which is a big duh anyway.
3721120	3725160	You know, especially if youíre dealing with something thatís got a limited shipment,
3725160	3729960	donít order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.
3729960	3730960	Common sense people.
3730960	3731960	All right.
3731960	3732960	So thatís it.
3732960	3737120	All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last minute story because weíre about to
3737120	3741480	move into the Skype line and the other last minute stories.
3741480	3744880	Tiger Claw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking
3744880	3747680	about pre-ordering the Playstation 3.
3747680	3751120	Apparently at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill
3751120	3757420	out pre-order forms on bestbuy.com and it looked legit and everything.
3757420	3761480	What happened I guess is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders
3761480	3764000	using different accounts.
3764000	3765000	Very interesting.
3765000	3770320	This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the
3770320	3775520	public number and weíre assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.
3775520	3782000	Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait and everybody that tried
3782000	3784360	to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.
3784360	3788400	So if you want one from Best Buy, youíve got to camp out for it.
3788400	3792400	We have a new 800 number here, actually I should say 877 or a toll free number here
3792400	3795240	at Orange Launch Radio and because of that reason weíve opened up our voicemails of
3795240	3796240	the week again.
3796240	3800000	I guess word hasnít gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week
3800000	3802760	but it was pretty good so we want to play it for you guys right now.
3802760	3804920	So here it is, a voicemail of the week.
3804920	3807840	Hey, OLR, itís Paradox Vincent.
3807840	3815720	Yeah, now on In the Guru versus DDR and how fair Konami is, I agree with Dark Sakura on
3815720	3821960	it, they just totally stole it and on that note, I just think that Session, Delaunay,
3821960	3830160	Rock from both and also I wanted to know if thereís any reason that the Xbox 360 version
3830160	3836440	of Phantasy Star Universe canít play with its PC and PS2 buddies because I bought it
3836440	3841800	and my friend bought it as well and we were all excited about it for months and months
3841800	3846240	and we finally get in there and we try lots of different channels and we canít find each
3846240	3852400	other so we finally end up on Segaís official site and it says ìOh goody, we can play with
3852400	3857240	Japanese playersî but some of them canít speak English so I donít really see the point
3857240	3865640	in this and theyíre just kind of losing a bigger server base and I really just donít
3865640	3870720	see the point in this so yeah, just keep it up with the show guys and Iíll be listening
3870720	3871720	for a while.
3871720	3874120	Alright, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week, we appreciate it.
3874120	3876640	Mikl Tov, youíre a PSU whore, what did you think of the voicemail?
3876640	3879200	So, because Iíve been playing Phoenix, right?
3879200	3880200	Objection!
3880200	3884640	Because youíre doing false testimony, if youíve been following PSU for months and
3884640	3892140	months, youíd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers
3892140	3898520	were separate so you are wrong and you should not lie on the road.
3898520	3902400	But why, why canít they be on the same server?
3902400	3905800	Because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything, and Final
3905800	3908360	Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.
3908360	3911600	I always thought it was voice chat, it came down to the fact that 360 supported voice
3911600	3912600	chat within parties.
3912600	3919400	That could be it too, but you know what, who cares, have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.
3919400	3920400	Problem solved!
3920400	3921400	Everyone play on PC!
3921400	3922400	Yeah, play on PC.
3922400	3923400	Iím going to be playing both.
3923400	3924400	Youíre going to play both?
3924400	3925400	Iím playing both.
3925400	3927400	Thatís crazy hard to do.
3927400	3928400	Youíre crazy.
3928400	3929400	You are crazy.
3929400	3932320	How you donít get in the set in that game, I couldnít support more than one character
3932320	3933320	on one system.
3933320	3939520	Well, no, a friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.
3939520	3945440	So I was like, well okay, itís $10 a month, itís like, what, two burritos?
3945440	3951160	So I said, well okay, Iíll play on the PC, and itís something I can do while Iím doing
3951160	3952720	my live journal or doing other stuff.
3952720	3955320	Thatís how I did PSO.
3955320	3956960	And I can carry it around on my laptop.
3956960	3958760	Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.
3958760	3962360	Iím actually looking for, because if I get my iMac, Iím planning on dual formatting
3962360	3965720	it, so I can run Windows on my iMac.
3965720	3970280	Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.
3970280	3979240	The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657, thatís toll free in the US and Canada.
3979240	3983620	Hey, weíll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we
3983620	3988160	only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this, we want to know if you
3988160	3992400	are going to be camping out for a Playstation 3 or a Wii.
3992400	3996120	And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you
3996120	3998720	camping out for and why.
3998720	4000960	And what are your plans for camping out?
4000960	4002380	What story are you going to go to?
4002380	4003640	Are you going with a big group of friends?
4003640	4005880	We want to know what your camp out plans are for.
4005880	4009160	Even if youíre not camping out, we want to know why youíre not camping out and sitting
4009160	4010160	this one out.
4010160	4011160	So we welcome your voicemails.
4011160	4017800	Weíll play some of our favorites next week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.
4017800	4021720	Now weíre going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge
4021720	4027660	Radio, and itís that same number, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name is Orange Lounge Radio on
4027660	4028660	Skype.
4028660	4033040	If youíd like more information on how to interact with our program, www.orangeloungeradio.com,
4033040	4034360	click on interact with us.
4034360	4035360	Letís go to the phones.
4035360	4036600	Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.
4036600	4037600	Who is this?
4037600	4038600	Itís Ronma.
4038600	4039600	No, Iím just kidding.
4039600	4040600	Itís DMN.
4040600	4041600	Hey, DMN.
4041600	4042600	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
4042600	4043600	DMN.
4043600	4044600	Not much.
4044600	4050760	I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the week here, and Iíd like
4050760	4052000	to share my opinion of them.
4052000	4054840	Heís a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early on.
4054840	4055840	I know.
4055840	4056840	You get it early on.
4056840	4057840	Whatís your opinion on?
4057840	4062940	Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding
4062940	4067160	of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.
4067160	4072600	The gameplay is exactly like Oh and Don, it has the same comic book feel to it, itís
4072600	4078360	freaking hilarious, and surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.
4078360	4083400	The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four
4083400	4088360	songs, and it doesnít really adjust well into the next difficulty, because those last
4088360	4093400	three or four songs on medium are so incredibly hard, and then the first four or five on the
4093400	4097400	next hardest difficulty are easy.
4097400	4103680	What Iím curious about, are songs like the Avril Lavigne song and stuff, are they grossly
4103680	4107320	out of place, or do they somehow work?
4107320	4111440	A lot of them are grossly out of place, Iíll be honest.
4111440	4118720	Avril Lavigneís skater boy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some
4118720	4121940	lady is about to have a baby.
4121940	4125560	What about Canned Heat, whatís that stage like?
4125560	4132580	The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy of a Japanese motor company, his son goes through
4132580	4137720	the rival motor company whoís stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.
4137720	4139860	That makes a lot of sense.
4139860	4140860	It does.
4140860	4144280	Okay, what about the other game you picked up, quickly?
4144280	4149520	Magical Star Sign is a very very good RPG, I would recommend it as more so of a beginning
4149520	4157840	RPG, I enjoyed it, my only beef with it was that it felt very linear, basically it said
4157840	4162960	go here, go here, it didnít really make it fun, I havenít had a chance to try the multiplayer
4162960	4168480	mode on it, unfortunately, so I canít give any information on that, but Iíd recommend
4168480	4175760	it, itís a fun RPG, itís got a lot of fun little words of text in it, it keeps up with
4175760	4180080	the times, I would highly recommend it.
4180080	4186000	Alright, sounds good, well that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking
4186000	4189840	for good DS and portable games.
4189840	4191960	Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?
4191960	4192960	Umm, no.
4192960	4197480	Alright, then weíre going to another call, hey weíll see you pretty soon, okay?
4197480	4199480	Alright, take care.
4199480	4200480	Later.
4200480	4206840	Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on the Skype line, itís 1-877-GAME-OLR,
4206840	4215760	thatís 1-877, what the hell are the numbers there, 426-3657, so letís go to another call
4215760	4216960	here on the Skype line.
4216960	4219640	Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio, whoís this?
4219640	4221680	Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.
4221680	4225960	Hey, Jeremy Todd 1, whatís on your mind?
4225960	4230600	I got luminous for cell phones a couple of days ago.
4230600	4233600	Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week, how was it?
4233600	4239200	Itís pretty good so far, I think they did a pretty good job on it.
4239200	4243560	I have not heard what to say about it.
4243560	4244560	Okay.
4244560	4247160	Iím doing a good job on this.
4247160	4249160	Isnít it really surprising?
4249160	4250160	What?
4250160	4254160	Isnít it really surprising just how well it turned out?
4254160	4259760	Yeah, Iím glad I bought it, itís $25 and itís pretty good, Jeremy, Iíve got to play
4259760	4260760	you sometime.
4260760	4265280	Can you play that one to Cell Network?
4265280	4267280	I donít know, can you?
4267280	4268280	I can actually.
4268280	4269280	Really?
4269280	4270280	Thatís kind of cool.
4270280	4271280	Like with Joolz, you could do that.
4271280	4272280	Oh, thatís cool.
4272280	4283840	Yeah, Iíve played a few matches with online and thereís no lag either.
4283840	4285960	Do I hear somebody playing that in the background?
4285960	4288640	Turn down the damn music in the studio.
4288640	4294640	Alright, well cool, then I guess maybe this is a mobile game Iíll have to seek out and
4294640	4296800	find, I donít know, weíll see.
4296800	4299040	Any other mobile games youíve been playing lately?
4299040	4302400	No, Luminous is the only cell phone game I bought.
4302400	4305240	Iím not into cell phone gaming much.
4305240	4309200	Alright, Jeremy, tell one any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4309200	4313880	Gears of War Tuesday.
4313880	4315480	I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.
4315480	4316480	Alright, take care, buddy.
4316480	4317480	Have a good one.
4317480	4318480	Bye.
4318480	4319480	Yep, you too.
4319480	4320480	Thanks.
4320480	4321480	Bye.
4321480	4323120	Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4323120	4325160	Hello, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.
4325160	4326160	Whoís this?
4326160	4328520	Well, hello, how are you guys?
4328520	4329520	Iím good.
4329520	4330520	Who is this?
4330520	4334760	You know who the fuck this is, Rob.
4334760	4339000	If Iím not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who
4339000	4343320	we announced in part A, is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon,
4343320	4344320	yes?
4344320	4345880	Yes, Iíve crossed over to the dark side.
4345880	4346880	Thatís right.
4346880	4350960	I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said youíll never do anything
4350960	4354800	with us, and yet, hell has apparently frozen over.
4354800	4361000	And to go back to something way back in the USO times, I tried to get over the rainbow,
4361000	4362000	and I couldnít.
4362000	4365960	Thatís an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I.
4365960	4369920	Thatís all right, folks who maybe have been following the Understation Live for years
4369920	4370920	might follow.
4370920	4371920	You know we do have some folks here.
4371920	4374280	Itís still every other year, right?
4374280	4375280	What was that?
4375280	4376280	Still every other year.
4376280	4378840	What, did we do a USO?
4378840	4383840	No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.
4383840	4386840	Oh, thatís all right, itís an even year.
4386840	4387840	Yeah.
4387840	4388840	What does that mean?
4388840	4390600	That means Iíll be gay next year.
4390600	4392240	Oh, looking forward to that.
4392240	4397080	All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience,
4397080	4398840	what do they have to look forward to?
4398840	4400480	You mean you couldnít tell by the promo?
4400480	4403600	Well, yeah, it was a little geeky.
4403600	4406960	Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didnít get it.
4406960	4407960	Iím out there.
4407960	4408960	Itís the trailer.
4408960	4409960	Itís fantastic.
4409960	4410960	It is.
4410960	4416360	It is from the season one teaser that they used for the Ninth Doctor, yeah, the Ninth
4416360	4417360	Doctor.
4417360	4419440	Which I think is fantastic.
4419440	4422880	Iím big, Iím, you know, out there.
4422880	4426360	Now, youíre going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and
4426360	4430200	everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us, right?
4430200	4431200	Yeah.
4431200	4436240	So, if youíre a Doctor Who fan, a Battlestar fan, a sci-fi fan, youíve got to tune in
4436240	4439120	to the Travis Donovan experience.
4439120	4442400	Travis Donovan Live, otherwise known as TDL.
4442400	4445120	TDL, sounds like fun.
4445120	4448000	What time on Saturday are you going to be?
4448000	4455280	Starting right now for about 9 oíclock Central Standards, which is 7 Pacific, 10 on the East.
4455280	4456560	Alright, sounds good.
4456560	4458240	Do you talk games on your program too?
4458240	4459640	Are you going to talk any games?
4459640	4461000	I will be.
4461000	4465440	Games that Iím currently playing, which is not a lot, but there are games that Iím out
4465440	4469620	there playing, but we will be talking sci-fi and geek, like I will be going on a tirade
4469620	4474400	of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television.
4474400	4476400	Excellent.
4476400	4481240	And stuff like that, current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my
4481240	4484520	twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.
4484520	4490300	Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast
4490300	4493880	version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?
4493880	4496360	I am looking into that.
4496360	4499640	Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.
4499640	4500640	Alright.
4500640	4504900	Well, everybody tune in on Saturday, come and chat, support Travis and then heíll see
4504900	4508640	he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.
4508640	4511280	Yes, definitely show up and let me know whatís going on.
4511280	4516320	Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, youíll
4516320	4519360	see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.
4519360	4524160	Also, Iím going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Robís greater
4524160	4526880	moments in USL history.
4526880	4528520	Jesus, alright.
4528520	4532680	I guess just encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.
4532680	4533680	Get Rob blackmail.
4533680	4534680	Thatís nice.
4534680	4541200	Yeah, and Iíll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie who has
4541200	4545640	a sense of decency and politeness, itís all so small, itís a small percentage of her
4545640	4546640	being.
4546640	4549920	I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.
4549920	4555880	No, I was actually going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only
4555880	4560000	emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.
4560000	4563880	I think I stole my post-it though because it was pretty funny.
4563880	4564880	Alright.
4564880	4565880	It should be fun.
4565880	4570840	Alright, well good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.
4570840	4571840	You have been assimilated.
4571840	4577600	No, in all seriousness, weíre very excited to have you on board and look forward to what
4577600	4579640	youíre going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.
4579640	4580800	Well, thank you.
4580800	4581800	Thank you for having me.
4581800	4587680	Iím glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show and guarantee
4587680	4590800	controversy for geeks out there on the first show.
4590800	4596200	My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be cancelled and pull off the air.
4596200	4598200	Ooh, sounds good.
4598200	4605920	Actually given what Iíve heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly, I love Stargate, but yeah.
4605920	4606920	What was I going to say?
4606920	4607920	Something about, oh, forget it.
4607920	4608920	I wonít.
4608920	4609920	No, say it.
4609920	4612120	No, I canít remember because Iím old.
4612120	4613120	Tune in Saturday.
4613120	4614120	Yes.
4614120	4615120	Thatís all.
4615120	4616120	Thatís Rob.
4616120	4617120	Gay Alzheimerís.
4617120	4620960	Rob, Iím hanging up on you now because I can do that now.
4620960	4621960	Yes.
4621960	4622960	All right.
4622960	4623960	Have a good one, Travis.
4623960	4624960	You too.
4624960	4625960	Bye.
4625960	4626960	Oh, God.
4626960	4627960	Did we make a mistake inviting him on?
4627960	4628960	I donít know.
4628960	4633560	No, but sadly, Iím not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.
4633560	4634560	I donít know.
4634560	4637360	I might call in and debate some sci-fi, but for right now, we got to go to another call
4637360	4638360	that maybe we can debate with.
4638360	4639360	Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.
4639360	4640360	Whoís this?
4640360	4641360	Hey, guys.
4641360	4642360	This is Foodie Monster.
4642360	4643360	Hi, Foodie Monster.
4643360	4644360	Whatís on your mind?
4644360	4645360	Itís pretty lame, man.
4645360	4651080	Iíll tell you that this whole East Coast, West Coast thing is high me up the roof, seriously.
4651080	4654920	You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries
4654920	4656600	even that stay up very late.
4656600	4657600	You guys are hardcore.
4657600	4659880	Youíve earned your OLR badge of honor.
4659880	4661480	Just every other night.
4661480	4663320	Whatís on your mind, buddy?
4663320	4666760	I just wanted to share something that popped up in my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted
4666760	4670120	to write about it, but Iím just sure I will call.
4670120	4674420	I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you got
4674420	4675420	to think about it.
4675420	4680360	Games arenít going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped, and
4680360	4682960	thatís not just United States, Europe and Japan.
4682960	4689000	Thatís South America, thatís Central America, thatís Africa.
4689000	4694840	Those places also need to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be
4694840	4697280	really mainstream.
4697280	4698280	Movies are everywhere.
4698280	4703040	You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you wonít find too much gaming
4703040	4704040	in Africa.
4704040	4705360	Thatís an interesting perspective.
4705360	4708800	Iíve never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how
4708800	4713440	ìOh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesnít include
4713440	4719960	Europe when that whole thing went down.î A lot of people sometimes donít consider
4719960	4722200	any launch thatís been claimed to be worldwide.
4722200	4726160	I donít think theyíve ever truly worldwide launched a system.
4726160	4730320	I think, and correct me if Iím wrong, I think the Wii is the closest weíre getting.
4730320	4734020	They are launching the Wii in a ton of countries, but still, we are missing out on places like
4734020	4739880	Africa, like you said, certain African countries, and certain South American countries as well.
4739880	4741280	It goes beyond that.
4741280	4746240	Thereís no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance,
4746240	4749960	like not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any countries of America that has official
4749960	4751960	distribution of games.
4751960	4758480	Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distribution of licensing here
4758480	4761600	in Argentina, but then they pulled out.
4761600	4766840	Now, everything you buy is like grey market stuff, itís like click-sync, but only people
4766840	4772680	import it here, and you pay like, seriously, today a PS2 here is $300.
4772680	4776800	You mentioned that, wait, you said the PS2 is $300?
4776800	4777800	Yeah.
4777800	4778800	Thatís double the price.
4778800	4782480	I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, ìWait a minute.î
4782480	4785660	So gaming is more expensive generally in the other countries.
4785660	4791200	Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up like a Nintendo of Argentina
4791200	4792200	or whatever?
4792200	4798360	Well, I mean, they should at least have like a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent
4798360	4802040	to make things cheaper for all the markets.
4802040	4803440	Is there enough of a demand?
4803440	4808680	I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35
4808680	4809680	million people.
4809680	4810680	I would say yes.
4810680	4811680	Interesting.
4811680	4812680	Interesting.
4812680	4813680	I mean, sure.
4813680	4817880	I mean, itís not as much, probably thatís why they didnít do it, because thereís not
4817880	4819760	much market, you know.
4819760	4820760	Interesting.
4820760	4824560	I mean, if you consider it with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in
4824560	4827400	general, itís not enough market, I guess.
4827400	4828400	Hmm.
4828400	4832640	Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.
4832640	4833640	We appreciate that.
4833640	4836120	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
4836120	4841080	No, but I have a quick a few of my mocha dice, and now I canít play my backups, which has
4841080	4843360	to be very sad.
4843360	4844360	Sorry to hear it.
4844360	4845360	All right.
4845360	4846360	Have a good one, buddy.
4846360	4847360	Thanks for calling.
4847360	4848360	Okay.
4848360	4849360	You too, guys.
4849360	4850360	Later.
4850360	4851360	Okay.
4851360	4852360	Thanks.
4852360	4853360	Thank you.
4853360	4854360	Muah.
4854360	4855360	One more call.
4855360	4856360	What, Miklotov?
4856360	4857360	Okay.
4857360	4858360	Letís go to one more call here.
4858360	4859360	Hi.
4859360	4860360	Youíre on Orange Laundry Radio.
4860360	4861360	Whoís this?
4861360	4862360	Hey.
4862360	4863360	This is Paradox Vincent.
4863360	4864360	Hi, Paradox Vincent.
4864360	4865360	Hey.
4865360	4866360	You left us the voicemail.
4866360	4867360	Yes.
4867360	4868360	Ah.
4868360	4869360	Whatís on your mind?
4869360	4870360	Oh.
4870360	4871360	Did it get played?
4871360	4872360	Yeah.
4872360	4873360	We actually played your voicemail, and Miklotovó
4873360	4874360	Called you a liar.
4874360	4875360	Yeah.
4875360	4876580	Miklotov called you a liar, because he said if youíve been following the Phantasy Star
4876580	4879920	Universe thing, like he said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers
4879920	4880920	were separate?
4880920	4881920	Yeah, I win.
4881920	4882920	Good job.
4882920	4883920	You won the case, Miklotov.
4883920	4884920	Good job.
4884920	4885920	Yes.
4885920	4886920	I'm the best finisher.
4886920	4894360	In all seriousness, paradox Vincent, what's on your mind tonight?
4894360	4900200	Well I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.
4900200	4903880	Yeah, what's on your mind?
4903880	4912400	Well I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because, I don't know, it was just
4912400	4915680	kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.
4915680	4918760	So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?
4918760	4919760	Yes.
4919760	4924160	And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?
4924160	4928400	You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction
4928400	4929400	crap aside?
4929400	4938040	Yeah, kind of, because I didn't really see it being so overblown, kind of like the Gran
4938040	4939360	Turismo HD.
4939360	4943120	Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.
4943120	4944120	I guess that's true.
4944120	4948280	Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and the Gran Turismo certainly
4948280	4950160	kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.
4950160	4951440	I suppose that's true.
4951440	4953840	So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?
4953840	4956920	What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?
4956920	4964360	Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you
4964360	4966320	that kind of gets you into it?
4966320	4974880	Yeah, it's kind of that because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see
4974880	4980600	just like a giant leap in the resolution.
4980600	4981600	You know what though?
4981600	4984180	Miklotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution
4984180	4985600	was sometimes a problem in Luminous?
4985600	4993600	Yeah, I think that it gets too bright and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring
4993600	4996840	at it over and over for hours on hours.
4996840	5000400	I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those Luminous stages make
5000400	5001600	me want to have a seizure.
5001600	5006960	Yeah, that one in the basic pack, I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue
5006960	5008360	and neon pink.
5008360	5010160	That hurts my eyes.
5010160	5014200	It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.
5014200	5015200	I hate that one.
5015200	5017840	I hate that one from the stupid first game.
5017840	5020840	What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?
5020840	5024960	Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?
5024960	5027440	What else do you think you're going to buy?
5027440	5034560	It kind of depends on the artist pack because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shih, then
5034560	5039480	I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard from, I think it was maybe Luminous
5039480	5043480	2 for the PSP that had them.
5043480	5046380	I'm a giant fan of those.
5046380	5050440	But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?
5050440	5055240	Yeah, kind of.
5055240	5056840	Do you like that?
5056840	5061020	The folks that are supporting the microtransactions in Luminous say, I kind of like being able
5061020	5062960	to build the game the way I want it.
5062960	5064360	If I don't want missions, I take them out.
5064360	5065360	Do you like that?
5065360	5068120	Is that appealing to you?
5068120	5074380	I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.
5074380	5081720	I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions but made
5081720	5087320	them very small and very typecasted.
5087320	5091040	Do you think they added charge per skin?
5091040	5092040	Charge per skin?
5092040	5093040	In Luminous?
5093040	5094040	It's different.
5094040	5097940	That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't
5097940	5100000	like, like that bird one that's green and white.
5100000	5104000	I hate that stage so much.
5104000	5105600	Paradox Vinson, thanks so much for calling in.
5105600	5106600	We've got to move on.
5106600	5112080	Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?
5112080	5116800	Not really kind of a final thought, but yeah, all right.
5116800	5117800	Okay.
5117800	5120520	Have a good one, buddy.
5120520	5121520	Thanks for calling in.
5121520	5122520	All right.
5122520	5123520	You too, guys.
5123520	5124520	Keep it up.
5124520	5125520	Bye.
5125520	5127240	Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.
5127240	5128240	Think of something clever to say.
5128240	5131200	Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have come up with something better.
5131200	5132360	He admitted you pwned him.
5132360	5133360	I know because I'm awesome.
5133360	5134680	What a nice guy.
5134680	5135680	I would have tried to fight you.
5135680	5136680	I would have taken you out.
5136680	5139880	I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.
5139880	5141120	Do you want to do one more call?
5141120	5142120	One more call?
5142120	5143120	We're running a little long.
5143120	5144120	We have time for one more call?
5144120	5145120	One more?
5145120	5146120	What do you guys think?
5146120	5147120	One more?
5147120	5148120	All right.
5148120	5149120	One more.
5149120	5150120	Sure.
5150120	5151120	Let's do it.
5151120	5152120	Hi.
5152120	5153120	You're on Orange Lawns Radio.
5153120	5154120	Who's this?
5154120	5155120	It's Zappy from the chat room.
5155120	5156120	It's who?
5156120	5157120	Zappy from the chat room.
5157120	5158120	Hi, Zappy.
5158120	5163720	I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for the past week and a half, and it's actually
5163720	5164720	pretty decent.
5164720	5169160	I don't find this missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.
5169160	5170160	Wait.
5170160	5171160	Which game was this again?
5171160	5172160	Because you're cutting out a little bit.
5172160	5173160	Oh, sorry.
5173160	5177400	Medal of Honor for the PSP.
5177400	5180640	You're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying or what?
5180640	5181640	Yes.
5181640	5188080	You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually be controlling
5188080	5189080	pretty well.
5189080	5196640	I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing
5196640	5199160	PCT, first person shooters.
5199160	5203160	Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.
5203160	5208760	Knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first
5208760	5209760	person shooters.
5209760	5215280	I kind of like Prey and I really like my old school Doom and Quake 3 and stuff.
5215280	5216680	Try to sell me on this game.
5216680	5218000	What's in this game that I might enjoy?
5218000	5222840	Well, probably the best part of it is the 3D player multiplayer.
5222840	5228720	It has all the modes and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's
5228720	5231440	a pretty good selling point.
5231440	5233160	You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.
5233160	5234160	That's kind of cool.
5234160	5235160	Okay.
5235160	5236160	I like.
5236160	5240160	I think Capcom only has 16 players in it.
5240160	5241600	Well, thank you for the review of the game.
5241600	5243200	Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?
5243200	5248200	Well, I'll probably go to the Arcadia convention next week and I'll give you some hands-on
5248200	5249560	how it is.
5249560	5251680	Are you not far from Montreal?
5251680	5252680	I'm in Montreal.
5252680	5254280	Oh, right on.
5254280	5255280	What other kinds of stuff?
5255280	5258520	Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?
5258520	5263480	Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystiq, although I haven't seen
5263480	5269040	any real advertisements on Billboards, no, not Billboards, but the pamphlets or anything.
5269040	5271720	I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.
5271720	5274840	That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign
5274840	5278880	or maybe flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.
5278880	5283440	Well, if this is the second you're doing it, I didn't go last year, but they're going to
5283440	5288880	have the Wii and a bit change early, so I just want to try it out.
5288880	5291440	Yeah, that's true because Nintendo is one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're
5291440	5292440	going to see the Wii.
5292440	5293440	That's pretty cool.
5293440	5295040	You can only go to Arcadia.
5295040	5301200	We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.
5301200	5303280	We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.
5303280	5304760	Great to hear.
5304760	5305760	All right.
5305760	5306760	Have a good one, Zappi.
5306760	5309120	We got to let you go and get the show over with, but have a good one.
5309120	5310120	Thanks for calling in.
5310120	5311120	All right.
5311120	5312120	Have fun at Arcadia.
5312120	5313120	Later.
5313120	5314120	All right.
5314120	5315120	Oh, that was a hang-up noise.
5315120	5316120	All right.
5316120	5317240	Well, thank you guys so much for calling in.
5317240	5320160	We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.
5320160	5323880	It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get
5323880	5328000	through every week are getting frustrated, but surely you guys can understand we want
5328000	5331780	to get as many different perspectives as we can, but we're just running a little long
5331780	5336160	and about out of time, but I will ask really quickly in studio, are there any last-minute
5336160	5337160	questions?
5337160	5338160	Those of you guys that didn't get through could always leave a voicemail.
5338160	5339160	Exactly.
5339160	5340680	You could always leave a voicemail of the week, so try that.
5340680	5341680	Please leave a voicemail.
5341680	5342680	Yeah, please do.
5342680	5345160	Any last-minute stories here in studio?
5345160	5347400	Yes, of course.
5347400	5348400	You first.
5348400	5349400	Okay.
5349400	5352120	The last one I have is the one you pointed out to me.
5352120	5353120	Oh.
5353120	5354120	Okay.
5354120	5358160	Well, anyways, I was going to say if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's
5358160	5360120	a couple of websites you might want to check out.
5360120	5363120	First ps3seeker.com.
5363120	5364120	You can check it out.
5364120	5369120	They actually are tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target
5369120	5375960	locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii or PS3, and then
5375960	5379280	of course the Wii would be ps3seeker.com slash Wii.
5379280	5382640	So check that out as well for the Wii.
5382640	5386260	And then some other things.
5386260	5392200	Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too
5392200	5398840	happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.
5398840	5404840	That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.
5404840	5409240	You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon, because apparently Gears of War
5409240	5412960	is in their store right now, or at least it's some Best Buys.
5412960	5415360	Uh oh, broken street date.
5415360	5416360	Oopsie.
5416360	5417360	Oh well.
5417360	5420440	So you might want to check and see if you can score a copy early, because that would
5420440	5421440	be pretty cool.
5421440	5424800	And of course there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.
5424800	5427560	Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.
5427560	5433640	I'm not sure how well that would play, and then PSP is getting Pump It Up in Korea, so
5433640	5436360	that's kind of interesting.
5436360	5443320	And also something that I thought was very strange, the Blu-Ray, since the Blu-Ray drives
5443320	5447600	are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot
5447600	5451960	of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive,
5451960	5454440	which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.
5454440	5458720	For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install five gigs of the game onto your
5458720	5462320	hard drive, and imagine all these other games doing the same thing.
5462320	5466760	That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.
5466760	5474360	And finally, with the fall update for the 360, adding 1080p support, unfortunately some
5474360	5482320	of the Sony 1080p LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.
5482320	5484960	Isn't that ironic, isn't it?
5484960	5486580	Don't you think?
5486580	5487580	It's like Ray Yang.
5487580	5488580	Hey, hey, no Alanis.
5488580	5489580	All right.
5489580	5497480	There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier, it was on Dick.com, but I found actually
5497480	5500080	a bit more about it on magazine.com.
5500080	5504240	You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.
5504240	5513320	A working Lego Pinball Machine, yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.
5513320	5516020	So that's so freaking cool.
5516020	5520400	I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.
5520400	5524960	There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two player.
5524960	5529200	And the rumor is coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that
5529200	5534480	both state that Zelda is one of the two players.
5534480	5537560	So that's kind of interesting, I guess we'll have to find out.
5537560	5538560	Hmm.
5538560	5540760	Sure, it's not just a misprint or something?
5540760	5545320	It could be, but it's two different places, so I don't know, what else?
5545320	5550480	All right, well, gosh, we're kind of running long tonight, so we had a long bonus segment,
5550480	5555280	of course, though, that unfortunately those of you guys that listen to us on the audio
5555280	5557280	blog feed won't be able to hear it.
5557280	5561280	Sorry, that's just incentive to listen live to us on OrangeLaundryDay.com or on AllGames.com.
5561280	5565840	Hey, we've got to do something special for the live folks, surely you guys will understand.
5565840	5569640	DMN has informed me of something.
5569640	5570640	What's that?
5570640	5571920	It's DJ Tyrant's birthday.
5571920	5572920	Is it really?
5572920	5573920	That's what he said.
5573920	5576800	Well, happy birthday, that's right, I remember seeing something in the LJ about it, and I
5576800	5579560	believe he is of the legal age of 21 now.
5579560	5580560	Oh.
5580560	5582400	So strippers and booze for you, my friend.
5582400	5583680	It's also my mother's birthday.
5583680	5585040	Oh, how nice.
5585040	5586040	Yes.
5586040	5587960	My mommy is 48 today.
5587960	5591960	She told me she was 29, and I said, pardon my French mom, bullshit.
5591960	5596200	All right, well, happy birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around
5596200	5597200	this period.
5597200	5600040	Maybe we should have a birthday list, and then right at the end of every show we'll
5600040	5602000	say happy birthday to these listeners, we'll see.
5602000	5605160	Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5605160	5610000	Miklotov, thank you for your rare input, as always, but thanks for being the moral support
5610000	5611320	you are for this program.
5611320	5615460	Actually, you hate this show, don't you, so I'm not sure why you come on it, but what's
5615460	5616460	your final thought anyway?
5616460	5617960	I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
5617960	5618960	And don't.
5618960	5619960	Okay.
5619960	5621800	Loki, what's your final thought?
5621800	5626320	Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at U3.
5626320	5627320	All right.
5627320	5630000	Dark Sakura.
5630000	5637120	Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.
5637120	5642400	And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now, like pumpkin pie would
5642400	5643400	be awesome.
5643400	5648680	Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week, and so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.
5648680	5651800	Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.
5651800	5653160	You guys are awesome.
5653160	5654200	We couldn't do this without you.
