0	4760	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream
4760	5760	twice weekly.
5760	12240	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links
12240	15480	to websites with listings of past episodes.
15480	20000	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
20000	25520	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th
25520	27520	of 2006.
27520	31320	And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air, because
31320	35340	it's getting kind of cold now, so I'm a little bit more calmed down, I'm not quite as hyper
35340	37160	as I was during the first segment.
37160	41160	I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.
41160	43980	But then again at the same time I don't apologize, because that's me.
43980	44980	Take it or leave it.
44980	48600	If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe
48600	49600	to.
49600	52920	And if you don't like what Dark Sakura has to say, mute your podcast now, because here
52920	55360	she goes with another story.
55360	58040	I'm just teasing.
58040	61760	Well we do have a little bit more news regarding the Playstation 3.
61760	65840	They're going to have a universal login.
65840	70160	You'll basically be using the same online ID for every of the online games that you're
70160	73680	going to play.
73680	80360	It's actually going to be not just for the titles that use your, the central buddy list
80360	87560	and the messaging system, it's going to go for all titles.
87560	95240	Basically it's, I suppose to make it easier, more user friendly, so that you don't have
95240	100920	login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.
100920	101920	It's all on there.
101920	107400	But they were basically saying that, they were actually saying that specific to resistance
107400	111280	game coming out that is going to be using the same login.
111280	116040	I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot
116040	121040	about Playstation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind, I don't want
121040	126000	to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, but, because I'm a fanboy of all three, but
126000	130120	I don't, Microsoft seriously has online down.
130120	134480	They're doing it the best and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne
134480	136680	from them this time around.
136680	140800	So I don't know, it gets very little that we know about Sony's Playstation 3 and the
140800	142200	online stuff.
142200	146080	What I've seen so far though still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior
146080	147720	online.
147720	151880	As it was last generation, but I would have thought that this generation, the other two
151880	155620	would have been, but Nintendo's really had to play catch up and I think their friend
155620	158560	code thing kind of hurts them a little bit, I don't know.
158560	161860	The friend code thing in that respect though I think sort of protects.
161860	166440	I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer it doesn't make it any easier, you know.
166440	171440	But then again on Live you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know
171440	172440	are your friends.
172440	173440	Right.
173440	176240	And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although
176240	180760	I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's
180760	185080	probably like Super Smash Brothers Trophy Room or like a lot of Nintendo games do is
185080	190160	that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.
190160	191160	Yay, crap!
191160	193160	I love crap!
193160	199680	Anyway, here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my Playstation 3 when I
199680	201400	finally get one.
201400	205820	There's going to be, oh I'm sorry, well we heard about the converter, right?
205820	211640	You have to convert your old school memory card into what, the USB so that you can save
211640	213960	things on the hard drive itself.
213960	219000	Well, when you're actually playing the Playstation 2 or PS1 games on the Playstation 3, you actually
219000	222560	create an internal memory card on the system.
222560	226480	There's something you create in the cross media bar and there's a memory card utility
226480	231480	and then you can actually create a Playstation 1 card and a Playstation 2 card, name them
231480	234280	and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.
234280	238160	So it's like you're doing like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.
238160	241000	So that's how it's going to work on the Playstation 3 if you were curious.
241000	245280	And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.
245280	246280	Makes sense.
246280	247280	That's pretty cool.
247280	252840	I didn't load my virtual hack to run games on the hard drive.
252840	255920	I don't know, but the internal memory card, well they'll just do some firmware update
255920	257440	if you try that crap.
257440	262000	The internal memory cards will have the same storage space as your typical memory cards,
262000	265160	15 blocks on the PS1, 8 megs on the PS2.
265160	268280	You can create as many of these cards as you want though until you run out of hard drive
268280	269280	space.
269280	271280	You can just swap them in and out.
271280	272280	Hmm.
272280	273280	Interesting.
273280	276580	Well, some other interesting things of course are going to be the next big games coming
276580	278240	out for the Playstation 3.
278240	280160	The ones I'm like, you know, waiting for.
280160	283720	For example, Motorstorm, Lair, and Heavenly Sword.
283720	289180	Well, for example, Motorstorm, which is supposed to be a launch title, is now actually February
289180	290760	2007.
290760	295440	Lair, which is also supposed to be a launch title and delayed.
295440	299800	I believe that one ended up for March 2007 release.
299800	306240	And then of course Heavenly Sword, which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways,
306240	311880	is slated for a 2007 release also in March.
311880	317880	And of course their flagship title, Warhawk, is in the summer now, so that's kind of interesting.
317880	324000	But basically another reason why maybe waiting for Playstation 3 is a good idea because some
324000	328060	of the bigger games are coming out later on.
328060	332360	I'm reading our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.
332360	335720	Well over 50 people there tonight, thank you guys so much for joining us.
335720	342800	Let's see, I'm looking at, who said this here, ShadowNextGen said ExciteTruck does have achievements.
342800	347040	It may or may not, I mean, yes we've heard it does, I'm not disputing that part, but
347040	349040	we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.
349040	352920	Like you know, the cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements
352920	357580	my friends have and I can see what their score is, and then these other like fan-created
357580	362560	things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like mygamercard.net, which is a very
362560	368300	cool site, which by the way, we have the OL Army, what do we call it, the OL Army E-Penis
368300	371600	Leaderboard or something like that, where it's tracking all our gamer scores and you're
371600	374900	on there and you're on there and I'm on there, and if you want to join, check out our forums
374900	380640	and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer
380640	385520	Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund, but will the Wii have
385520	386520	anything like that?
386520	390000	I don't think so because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.
390000	394680	Now that's not going to break the system, it's just kind of surprising that they didn't
394680	399560	embrace the online in that way, because I think not being online kind of killed them
399560	406160	last round, but that's just my opinion I suppose, what do I know, I'm just some guy on the internet.
406160	414160	Well back to different PS3 news, and actually a few people have already told me their experiences
414160	420320	with this, you can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk, the game's available
420320	427200	on Motorstorm and NBA 07, but according to one of our listeners, it crashed I think every
427200	434280	what, five minutes, I believe that it was JV Mon mentioned it.
434280	438600	What was it overheating or what was it doing?
438600	446120	Oh, at Best Buy, sorry, it was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes,
446120	447920	but there's the playable kiosks.
447920	453640	Well that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show too, but I guess it was a different environment.
453640	454640	I'm not surprised.
454640	458040	Interesting, well as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care
458040	459040	about.
459040	461480	Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently
461480	463520	the only way it was staying on.
463520	469520	Anyways, of course like most anything else that's being released nowadays, right as it
469520	474400	comes out, it's going to be upgraded, and of course that's the same with the PlayStation
474400	481640	3, you will be getting a firmware update on launch day, and it will basically allow you
481640	491480	to utilize the PlayStation Network functions, so not a big surprise, but they're doing the
491480	496280	same thing with the Wii when that comes out there, you have to do a firmware update as
496280	499200	well for that.
499200	505260	But I don't know, I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early
505260	510180	and be able to get them manufactured, and if that means adding a firmware update later
510180	515720	on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so
515720	516720	be it.
516720	527040	If they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting 2 PS3s instead of 400,000.
527040	530460	What I think is interesting, something I was talking about during the break, is that one
530460	536240	game I wanted was NBA Live 07 for the PlayStation 3, yes there was a sports title I actually
536240	542180	wanted, well guess what, I'm not going to be able to get it, because EA cancelled it.
542180	546920	They're saying in a statement, quote, we are concentrating our efforts on creating a spectacular
546920	553880	NBA Street home court instead of porting NBA Live 07, and home court will be coming to
553880	556840	the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.
556840	563240	All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live
563240	564240	08.
564240	574520	Home court, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February,
574520	581640	so it shouldn't be too bad.
581640	591520	There was also a lot of other PlayStation 3 delays coming out, pretty much with everything,
591520	595760	as we mentioned earlier we were talking about Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that, so
595760	604520	it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff is being delayed.
604520	612160	But anyways, I gotta note, was it home court January or February for next year I believe,
612160	615400	so that's when we can look forward to that.
615400	623240	Well as for other PS3 related news, and this makes me very, very, very sad.
623240	632840	Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3, in fact in a quote released by IGN, they said
632840	637560	they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3,
637560	641440	unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case when you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're
641440	644860	prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.
644860	650600	They're basically saying that since the controller doesn't have the button, you can't actually
650600	657040	activate it, and you can't swap out the controller to change it in, because you'll need to turn
657040	661300	on the analog, and of course the SG doesn't have analog.
661300	664720	So in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will
664720	666600	not be working on the PlayStation 3.
666600	669480	There is no physical way to make it work.
669480	675880	So would that go the same with say, DDR, BeatMania, anything that uses an additional controller?
675880	679880	Well it's interesting because I have a last minute update here, Bamani Style just posted
679880	683380	a story this evening, because you know the PS3 is out in Japan now, and they're trying
683380	689400	some backwards compatibility there, and they're saying Pop'n Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody
689400	694000	have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds, Pop'n Music Disney has timing issues with
694000	700860	the background music, Pop'n Music 2 is missing some images, and let's see, BeatMania Best
700860	706000	Hits has timing issues, 6Mix and Core has background music, as well as BeatMania The
706000	709880	Sounds of Tokyo, the timings off in Gotta Mix, some of the graphics don't appear in
709880	716700	Gotta Mix 2, and DDR Max 6Mix, the background doesn't always play correctly, which of course
716700	720920	is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time incorrectly, so it pretty
720920	721920	much makes the game unplayable.
721920	724280	Are you talking about the background videos though?
724280	729200	No, background music doesn't always play correctly, which is kind of something you need.
729200	733560	Now in BeatMania 2DX 3rd Style and 6th Style, some of the graphics are altered, they're
733560	738200	just not showing up correctly, but I guess the games are still playable, so that's interesting
738200	742660	though because we're just looking at one genre of games, and that's already, that's a huge
742660	748560	list of issues for one very narrow genre of games, so now granted a lot of these, especially
748560	752760	the pop and music titles, a lot of those are PS1 and very old, the BeatMania titles as
752760	756000	well, but still, is that 100% compatibility?
756000	762240	No, and I believe they're talking about 99.9% compatible games, and that's a pretty huge
762240	767120	chunk out of the games right there, and they're saying that those are not compatible, oops,
767120	772160	I guess we forgot to play all the music games, darn, I guess those aren't big name stuff.
772160	776720	This is going to sound really random, but in Phantasy Star Universe, I was laughing
776720	783720	tonight because a character joined my party, and his name was Kootaragi, and I don't think
783720	788960	it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kootaragi, so it's funny because
788960	793120	somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kootaragi's on fire, Kootaragi's on fire,
793120	799680	it was funny to me in that moment.
799680	804280	He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons, but he was on fire, running around
804280	805320	on fire.
805320	809600	So now we have him eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym,
809600	810600	and on fire.
810600	815840	Well, someone who thinks Kootaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell, you
815840	820680	might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari, he's the
820680	826120	granddaddy of Pong, he said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in
826120	827120	the foot.
827120	829000	There is a high probability they will fail.
829000	831080	The price point is probably unsustainable.
831080	835200	For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer
835200	836200	standpoint.
836200	840320	They could get away with their arrogance and capriciousness because they had an installed
840320	841320	base.
841320	843360	They have also historically had horrible software tools.
843360	848000	You can compare that to the Xbox 360 with really great authoring tools and additional
848000	849680	revenue streams from Xbox Live.
849680	854640	A first party developer would be an idiot to develop for Sony first and not the 360.
854640	856680	People don't buy hardware, they buy software.
856680	857680	P.S.
857680	859800	I'm a big Microsoft fanboy.
859800	863640	Just kidding about the P.S. part, but that's almost what it sounds like there in that little
863640	864640	statement.
864640	869200	Some interesting comments there from one of the granddaddies of gaming.
869200	873520	You know, I saw an interesting comparison on one of the blogs today that talked about
873520	879540	how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast, and everybody said Dreamcast
879540	887120	has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than P.S. 2 can, Dreamcast can
887120	892280	do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed, so people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got
892280	897880	the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online, will history repeat itself?
897880	900160	We have to listen to him because he bought us Pizza Time Theater.
900160	904160	I have to say there's a big difference here, though, something that wasn't considered in
904160	905160	the article.
905160	911120	Dreamcast didn't play DVDs, and at that time DVDs were just breaking, and I think, you
911120	916040	know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray, and
916040	918200	Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.
918200	920760	I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.
920760	925800	I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD, DVD was already somewhat established
925800	927540	and everybody knew it was the next.
927540	929240	This time you have a split.
929240	932640	People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going
932640	933640	to be the winner.
933640	937240	You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you're going to get a Blu-ray?
937240	938240	They go, what's that?
938240	940040	You're going to get an HD DVD?
940040	941040	What?
941040	942040	I have a DVD player.
942040	943040	What?
943040	944040	I have an HDTV.
944040	946760	No, you're going to get an HD DVD.
946760	947760	What?
947760	950920	Well, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.
950920	951920	Exactly.
951920	955320	If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.
955320	960680	Anyways, other interesting things about, also we were talking about the backwards compatibility
960680	963000	on games and how it's not working.
963000	968580	Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not very, you know, a huge surprise, but Japanese
968580	972880	PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.
972880	979320	Because the games are region coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation
979320	987440	1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions, but that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.
987440	993280	I just want to jump in real quick here and notice that, or note that Travis, who hosts
993280	996600	our show here Saturday Nights on Orange Launch Radio, Travis Donovan Live, just sent me a
996600	1001640	link to a story over on IGN where they've been logging all these backward compatibility
1001640	1006480	issues with PlayStation 3, Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background
1006480	1012680	music correctly, Xenosaga Episode 2, the opening movie, sometimes stops, Mega Man X7, background

1022440	1031280	going from title to demo, the screen may freeze, issues, that sounds like a lot of games, maybe
1031280	1033800	that's what the day one firmware update's all about, who knows.
1033800	1037680	Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there,
1037680	1038680	so oopsie.
1038680	1041680	Good point, good point.
1041680	1046040	All right, well anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners
1046040	1049840	think of all this console mania going on this week.
1049840	1054120	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and DarkSakura puts
1054120	1058000	on the rubber gloves and dives in head first into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite
1058000	1059840	emails to read for you folks.
1059840	1060840	Don't you DarkSakura?
1060840	1068720	When I'm ready.
1068720	1080520	The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.
1080520	1083280	This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.
1083280	1084280	I love that name.
1084280	1088560	You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game
1088560	1091640	by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.
1091640	1095760	A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing and asked about pre-ordering Halo 3.
1095760	1101440	The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game.
1101440	1102500	Here's where the bullshit begins.
1102500	1104920	He said that the regular edition was just the game.
1104920	1108600	The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD.
1108600	1111720	He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons, the assault
1111720	1116480	rifle 2 and the spike shot, have the first two games on the second disc come with the
1116480	1122240	making of DVD, every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc, yeah right, and
1122240	1124620	have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.
1124620	1128880	Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet
1128880	1133280	replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie
1133280	1135520	would include something like that, etc.
1135520	1136520	My classmate leaves.
1136520	1139400	I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, sir, I read the
1139400	1143440	article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.
1143440	1146800	He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie, so you should read it more carefully
1146800	1147800	next time.
1147800	1151000	Needless to say, I now go to the other GameStop in town.
1151000	1154080	You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that, and when
1154080	1156720	I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far, and then I got
1156720	1161800	to the helmet thing, I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, you can't wear the helmet,
1161800	1162800	stupid.
1162800	1167880	Unless his head's really tiny, maybe he has a tiny head.
1167880	1171960	Well okay, this reminds me of something I wanted to talk about tonight.
1171960	1176040	I now have a new favorite game store, and it's because of things like this.
1176040	1181840	I am sick of going into a game store where I feel elitism coming from the people behind
1181840	1183000	the counter.
1183000	1184400	They don't know who I am.
1184400	1188700	I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid
1188700	1194040	video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies, but they assume things about me
1194040	1196960	because I'm older and I play games.
1196960	1199720	They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.
1199720	1201680	I'm kind of sick of that attitude.
1201680	1207800	I'm not going into game stores to get told what games I should be buying the guidebook
1207800	1210160	because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.
1210160	1212400	That only worked when Dan was a manager.
1212400	1213400	No.
1213400	1214400	Well, that's different.
1214400	1217000	Because he actually does know his shit.
1217000	1219280	That's different, that's different.
1219280	1221000	I don't know what it's like in your town.
1221000	1222000	This is one thing I notice.
1222000	1226580	I may say that I'm shopping at this particular store, but town to town I notice it's different.
1226580	1230920	It's totally different, but in this particular town I got fed up with one particular chain,
1230920	1234920	and now I'm shopping at GameCrazy because I went to GameCrazy, I went to look for a
1234920	1239680	particular game, and the guy treated me like I was royalty.
1239680	1243720	I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition
1243720	1244720	stuff.
1244720	1246720	Instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I
1246720	1248000	was like, okay, I can do that for you.
1248000	1251520	He went and got the game, and then I was like, do you have Luminous 2?
1251520	1255600	The guy was like, no, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.
1255600	1256720	Let me make a call.
1256720	1257720	He called another store.
1257720	1260120	He was going to have it shipped ordered, and he was like, I won't even charge you a pre-order
1260120	1261440	because the game already came out.
1261440	1267000	I'm like, oh my gosh, I just got great customer service at a game store as someone who kind
1267000	1270920	of met me on a peer level and just was like, hey, you're a gamer, you seem to know what
1270920	1273560	you want, and didn't try to sell me all this garbage.
1273560	1275400	It was awesome.
1275400	1279560	That's funny you mention that because my hubby is starting at GameCrazy.
1279560	1281080	And again, I don't know your town, people.
1281080	1282320	I'm just talking about my town.
1282320	1286920	Maybe in your local town the folks at GameCrazy are dicks and you have to go to Best Buy.
1286920	1287920	I don't know what.
1287920	1293360	I'm talking about right here, right now, I'm totally having it for GameCrazy.
1293360	1297080	That's where I'm going to be doing my shopping right now because of good customer service
1297080	1298360	goes so far.
1298360	1301240	So if you work in a game store, because I know we have folks that work in game stores
1301240	1305200	that listen to this program, don't treat your customers like dirt because you never know
1305200	1310840	who you're pissing off, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.
1310840	1312480	Can I ask which store you went to?
1312480	1314320	Which one in particular?
1314320	1326080	It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's the one that your hubby used
1326080	1328360	to work at years ago.
1328360	1330240	I think I know who the manager of that store is.
1330240	1331240	I don't care anymore.
1331240	1332240	It doesn't matter.
1332240	1333240	It's a lost cause now.
1333240	1334240	No, I mean the GameCrazy.
1334240	1339280	Oh, oh, oh, no, the GameCrazy I went to was in the...
1339280	1340280	Okay.
1340280	1341280	Sorry.
1341280	1342280	Sorry.
1342280	1347760	It's because I actually know about four managers of GameCrazies too.
1347760	1349760	Well, that's a nice guy.
1349760	1351960	Well, my experience with...
1351960	1353840	SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.
1353840	1355840	He was not hitting on me, you jackass.
1355840	1362880	My experience with the GameStops, usually it's retardation, talking to people, or they'll
1362880	1365000	try to carry on small talk.
1365000	1366560	So what games are you playing right now?
1366560	1369400	I'm like, I don't want to talk to you, I just want to buy this game.
1369400	1375840	Or they're trying to sell me Splinter Cell Double Agent on the Wii, I'm like, no, I don't
1375840	1377960	want that game at all.
1377960	1378960	I always used to hate...
1378960	1381960	I would go in there and I'd buy something like Prey, and then they go, do you want to
1381960	1382960	pre-order Halo 3?
1382960	1385720	I'm like, if I want to pre-order Halo 3, I would have asked.
1385720	1388480	Okay, Jamie's pointing at the mailbag going, more emails.
1388480	1389480	Okay, sorry.
1389480	1390480	All right.
1390480	1394680	Well, the next one comes from Jason says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying
1394680	1397840	to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.
1397840	1402360	A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI
1402360	1405800	connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against
1405800	1407240	the Xbox in general.
1407240	1410140	So can you tell me if this is true?
1410140	1414160	Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?
1414160	1417760	Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show, I never miss it.
1417760	1418760	Doesn't matter.
1418760	1423000	You can do 1080p either with component or with the VGA cable.
1423000	1429440	The only thing the HDMI is for is because later on when they digitally sign everything,
1429440	1434640	way later on once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital
1434640	1443120	broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.
1443120	1446700	Doesn't HDMI though give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your
1446700	1447700	regular eyes?
1447700	1459760	HDMI is basically based on DVI, which is enhanced more over DVI because DVI is just video.
1459760	1465960	HDMI actually carries a digital video and audio signal on it, but you can get DVI to
1465960	1470040	HDMI adapters and stuff like that.
1470040	1474160	In a way you can be able to do it and maybe later on down the line that might be an issue,
1474160	1477280	but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line they're going to release
1477280	1481040	some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.
1481040	1482600	Who is the emailer that just sent that in?
1482600	1483600	What was their name?
1483600	1484600	Jason.
1484600	1485600	Jason.
1485600	1491280	Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here
1491280	1495240	and bring your friend into the room and we're going to give a special message to your friend
1495240	1496240	right here.
1496240	1497240	Okay, so stop right here.
1497240	1498240	All right.
1498240	1499240	Hi, Jason's friend.
1499240	1503040	This is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you you're wrong.
1503040	1504320	Hugs and kisses.
1504320	1506880	We love you.
1506880	1510080	I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments and I wanted
1510080	1513320	to read them.
1513320	1518280	Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.
1518280	1520960	Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their
1520960	1521960	jobs.
1521960	1523400	No, I just don't want to carry out a stupid conversation with them.
1523400	1525000	I hate talking to people.
1525000	1526000	That's a whole different story.
1526000	1527640	I will pretend to be better than them.
1527640	1528640	That's true.
1528640	1529640	Loki's just an asshole is what it is.
1529640	1530640	No, I'm not.
1530640	1531640	He thinks he's better than you.
1531640	1532640	He's just a dick.
1532640	1535280	I'm not an asshole and I do get annoyed when they're giving them wrong information, but
1535280	1539240	I don't try to correct them because that is annoying.
1539240	1543200	All I do is I don't want Splinter Cell and they understand that.
1543200	1545640	They're just trying to upsell and that's fine.
1545640	1550240	That's what they're supposed to do, but obviously I don't like that and I have to do that at
1550240	1551800	my work, so I understand.
1551800	1555640	One more comment, I promise, Jamie, but this is from Brad from Pod Culture and he's cool.
1555640	1556640	I like Brad.
1556640	1557640	We got a comment from him.
1557640	1562200	He was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Fantasy Star Universe.
1562200	1565800	They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.
1565800	1567520	He's 36, he admits.
1567520	1570760	Their first comment was, this is for your kid?
1570760	1574400	Dot, dot, dot.
1574400	1577800	They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee
1577800	1578800	content in it.
1578800	1583080	Apparently, you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I got to sell it on eBay.
1583080	1584320	You know what happens when you assume.
1584320	1586560	You make an ass out of you and me.
1586560	1589320	This next email comes from The Afro Guy.
1589320	1590320	Hey, O.L.R.
1590320	1594200	I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled
1594200	1597480	to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.
1597480	1600760	My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully.
1600760	1604640	Canis Canim ate it because I think he's emailing from overseas.
1604640	1609280	He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really
1609280	1611460	does feel like a living, breathing school.
1611460	1615440	Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for
1615440	1617320	hours on Grand Theft Auto.
1617320	1621400	The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried
1621400	1624200	that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.
1624200	1627440	I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw
1627440	1629080	him on the ground, and spit on him.
1629080	1631200	His reaction was, oh, never done that before.
1631200	1636320	However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.
1636320	1641160	What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.
1641160	1642960	And that was in quotes, by the way.
1642960	1647720	Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly
1647720	1649040	a shock to our parents.
1649040	1652840	My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of
1652840	1654800	harmless teasing.
1654800	1656200	And there's a footnote on here.
1656200	1657480	I love emails with footnotes.
1657480	1661200	So if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap
1661200	1666240	him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.
1666240	1672340	To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame and soon it will be on its way
1672340	1674400	to a pre-owned rack in-game.
1674400	1678020	Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously
1678020	1681940	played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place
1681940	1685720	in his school and those acting violently are around his age.
1685720	1691360	Therefore Rockstar should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't
1691360	1693200	interest young teenagers.
1693200	1696380	I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play Bully, but
1696380	1700120	perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.
1700120	1704320	Thanks for the showing, keep up the good work, The Afro Guy.
1704320	1708200	I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework,
1708200	1711520	my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know
1711520	1712520	what she was doing.
1712520	1715720	She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games, so I had
1715720	1717060	to do my homework.
1717060	1719800	I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.
1719800	1724200	If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting, and it sounds a little bit vague,
1724200	1729280	sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something
1729280	1732440	a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.
1732440	1733760	He needs to be punished.
1733760	1742740	I do have to say that if it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's
1742740	1746760	very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.
1746760	1753640	I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial
1753640	1760640	evidence that it would be, then removing the game is smart, I think, the agreeable thing
1760640	1761640	to do.
1761640	1767240	I absolutely agree in some aspects with the anti-video game stuff because not all kids
1767240	1770600	should be playing Bully, but that's up to a parent to decide.
1770600	1774280	A parent knows their kid best, or at least a parent should know their kid better than
1774280	1780680	anyone else, and it's up to the parent to decide, is this game appropriate for my child?
1780680	1784760	If the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from
1784760	1788220	non-fiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.
1788220	1791660	Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.
1791660	1795080	For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.
1795080	1796960	It just depends on the child.
1796960	1803760	I can also understand that for at least people of a like age in that game, because it's one
1803760	1808360	thing for a kid, I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference
1808360	1813440	in a kid playing Grand Theft Auto because technically they're not adults.
1813440	1820360	It's something that they know they have no real way of doing, but a kid can go into school
1820360	1823200	and basically be a bully.
1823200	1825880	Flow Walk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking
1825880	1827000	about, but I like this.
1827000	1829720	I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.
1829720	1834080	I made the kid eat grass, but his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high
1834080	1835080	heel.
1835080	1836080	That bitch.
1836080	1842720	I've been in two fights in school, honestly.
1842720	1846000	I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me, but one
1846000	1849040	time there was this guy, he was the school bully.
1849040	1854920	I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other
1854920	1859160	kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.
1859160	1864220	I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks
1864220	1866520	after school once, but I just didn't go.
1866520	1869700	I was like, what are they going to do?
1869700	1870700	Call me names?
1870700	1873440	Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.
1873440	1874440	So I just didn't go.
1874440	1878620	What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the
1878620	1883240	year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.
1883240	1885240	I can't stand that type of thing.
1885240	1888480	The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and
1888480	1889480	punched her in the nose.
1889480	1892940	Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.
1892940	1893940	Make it quick.
1893940	1896480	She was, okay, her name was Myra.
1896480	1899440	If you're listening, you deserved it.
1899440	1903840	She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.
1903840	1907360	I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.
1907360	1910880	Wasn't Myra the chicken tiny toons that was like, I'm going to love him, excuse him.
1910880	1911880	Oh, Myra.
1911880	1912880	Oh, sorry, my bad.
1912880	1917900	But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.
1917900	1921120	It was my journal and a couple other books.
1921120	1924000	She even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her and
1924000	1926800	she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.
1926800	1930000	But did you learn that from River City Ransom?
1930000	1931560	Did I play River City Ransom then?
1931560	1933000	I don't know, did you?
1933000	1935040	I was busy playing Tetris.
1935040	1937640	No, I have my Super Nintendo.
1937640	1939720	I have my Super Nintendo.
1939720	1942200	So did the games make you do it?
1942200	1943840	No.
1943840	1948400	I was just tired of harassing me.
1948400	1951320	It sounds like it was almost like a real-life bully there for a minute.
1951320	1952320	She was.
1952320	1953320	Oh, my God.
1953320	1954320	She was horrible to everybody.
1954320	1955320	All right.
1955320	1959280	If she left me alone, I didn't care what she did to anyone else.
1959280	1962760	Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter because that was on the Super Nintendo.
1962760	1964600	I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.
1964600	1965600	There you go, Shoryuken.
1965600	1966600	All right, next email.
1966600	1967600	No.
1967600	1973080	The last email comes from John D. He says, Hey guys, well, yes, this isn't my first email
1973080	1976120	to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.
1976120	1979680	I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting
1979680	1981760	in that I was actually really good.
1981760	1984760	I was playing the eight-plus star songs, which made me laugh.
1984760	1988440	But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters
1988440	1993480	in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?
1993480	2000900	Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.
2000900	2004280	With all due respect to the listener, we're glad we got a new listener and a first email.
2004280	2007920	I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month, but I'm going
2007920	2010560	to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener.
2010560	2012720	So welcome to the show, and I don't mean to tease you.
2012720	2015360	We do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email.
2015360	2021440	Okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers.
2021440	2025240	The fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it
2025240	2026320	does make a good fit.
2026320	2027320	Don't grr at me.
2027320	2028320	Cloud is already in Air Guys.
2028320	2031940	I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Brothers.
2031940	2032940	Other characters I'd want to see.
2032940	2035040	I definitely want to see Tom Nook.
2035040	2036600	I want to see Tom Nook.
2036600	2039720	Tom Nook is a bastard.
2039720	2040720	He'll take all my money.
2040720	2041800	That'll be a special move.
2041800	2042800	I want...
2042800	2043800	Oh.
2043800	2044800	Do you have somebody?
2044800	2045800	Little Mac.
2045800	2046800	Yeah?
2046800	2048500	That'd be cool.
2048500	2052440	I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rayman.
2052440	2054960	Oh, interesting speculation.
2054960	2058960	Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.
2058960	2067440	Sonic, which Sega and the GameCube were just best buddies, so of course it makes perfect
2067440	2068440	sense.
2068440	2075160	And also to that listener, download some Para Para videos off of YouTube and type Para Para
2075160	2079480	Girls into YouTube, or whatever it is, Para Para Deluxe or VELFER or whatever.
2079480	2084680	Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Para Para Para Eyes.
2084680	2097120	I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it, so that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.
2097120	2098240	That was the last email, yes?
2098240	2099560	That was the last email.
2099560	2102880	Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can
2102880	2104280	do that anytime you want.
2104280	2105280	Just send us an email.
2105280	2107680	It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2107680	2109340	We look forward to hearing from you.
2109340	2114400	We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.
2114400	2121320	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for
2121320	2122920	you guys.
2122920	2127480	Last week we asked, are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3, and are you
2127480	2131160	going to be camping out for any of them, or what are you going to be doing?
2131160	2136520	We got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now, one of our voicemails
2136520	2137520	of the week here.
2137520	2143040	Hey guys, it's DJ Tyron, just calling in about the voicemail of the week.
2143040	2146600	Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.
2146600	2153360	I pre-ordered at the electronics boutique that I work at, and I also got a gift card
2153360	2158320	for Best Buy for my birthday, so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up
2158320	2163960	my system and Zelda, and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points
2163960	2171360	card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.
2171360	2179840	And then for a quick question, I'm wondering what other launch titles I should pick up
2179840	2180840	besides Zelda.
2180840	2185440	I was thinking possibly Metal Slug or Red Steel.
2185440	2190040	Anyways, just want to hear your guys' opinion, and hope to hear from you soon.
2190040	2191040	Keep up the great show, guys.
2191040	2192040	Thanks.
2192040	2193040	Thanks for the voicemail.
2193040	2194040	What do you guys think?
2194040	2195040	Other launch titles?
2195040	2198520	Do not touch Metal Slug with a 10-foot pole, and the reason why I say that is because you're
2198520	2203760	only encouraging SNK to release Metal Slug again and again and again and again.
2203760	2205520	And to be honest, there's a lot of other games out there.
2205520	2209080	Dark Soccer, Rebuttal?
2209080	2211080	I like it.
2211080	2214280	I love Metal Slug.
2214280	2216100	Excite Truck, if you can find it.
2216100	2221320	I would say Excite Truck as well, or Red Steel, or I think the sleeper hit would be Elibits
2221320	2224340	is actually I think a lot better than a lot of people might be getting.
2224340	2227880	If you want something right away, Rayman's Raven Rabbids.
2227880	2229460	It depends what kind of games you're into.
2229460	2233280	If you're into sports, maybe you ought to be checking out Madden 07.
2233280	2235760	I say Red Steel all the way.
2235760	2242280	All right, if you'd like to leave us a voicemail for next week, go ahead and send us a voicemail.
2242280	2246000	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2246000	2249720	And what we want to know from you guys is Gears of War.
2249720	2252720	Today is Emergence Day after all, and I know I'm looking at my friends' list, and I see
2252720	2255160	tons of freaking people playing Gears of War.
2255160	2257760	What are your thoughts on Gears of War if you've been playing the game?
2257760	2263360	Is it the 10 out of 10 game it's being lauded as on blogs and things around the internet?
2263360	2265800	Or is it just kind of okay?
2265800	2267140	Or is it maybe crappy?
2267140	2268140	Maybe you think it's crappy.
2268140	2270000	You're in the minority of folks there.
2270000	2271000	Send us a voicemail.
2271000	2273220	We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.
2273220	2276600	If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.
2276600	2278400	Otherwise, we get confused.
2278400	2280120	Anyway, back to the story.
2280120	2283060	The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?
2283060	2287880	And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.
2287880	2292000	They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line
2292000	2293000	Stand.
2293000	2294360	And some quotes here.
2294360	2300640	Oh, actually, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, originally this came via some other blog, Random Digital
2300640	2301640	Musings.
2301640	2302640	So sorry about that.
2302640	2303720	I want to give credit where credit's due.
2303720	2307000	We just saw it on Kotaku first.
2307000	2308000	Bullet point.
2308000	2310840	There's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight
2310840	2313840	only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.
2313840	2316320	So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting
2316320	2317440	it.
2317440	2321040	You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you,
2321040	2323640	know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.
2323640	2328060	I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.
2328060	2331520	Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.
2331520	2336360	Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a Target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring
2336360	2339200	something to make your $600 less conspicuous?
2339200	2343740	Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags,
2343740	2347120	but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous, so maybe you want to bring something to hide
2347120	2351880	it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000
2351880	2354440	for that, da da da da da da.
2354440	2355440	Have fun camping in the lines.
2355440	2358160	We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.
2358160	2359160	Wear deodorant.
2359160	2360160	Yeah.
2360160	2361160	Drunami says wear deodorant.
2361160	2362720	Good idea.
2362720	2363720	Bring extra.
2363720	2364720	Just bring extras for others.
2364720	2366720	Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.
2366720	2379640	So, other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, better
2379640	2387920	known for ruining E3, no, but he doesn't want video games to be called video games.
2387920	2392120	He wants them to be called something better because he believes that video games are kind
2392120	2395460	of getting this negative stereotype to them.
2395460	2401280	So he would prefer video games to be referred to as interactive entertainment or entertainment
2401280	2403280	software.
2403280	2404280	I don't know.
2404280	2406320	That's kind of vague to me, but who cares?
2406320	2407320	They're video games.
2407320	2411400	That's like saying, let's name the revolution a we.
2411400	2412760	Are they games?
2412760	2413880	Yes.
2413880	2418760	Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?
2418760	2419920	Yes.
2419920	2422200	Are they then video games?
2422200	2424680	I think that's not a bad title.
2424680	2428200	That's there to not understand.
2428200	2434160	He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products
2434160	2438360	were categorized as something more serious than a game.
2438360	2440880	Because entertainment is a serious business.
2440880	2442280	Oh, really?
2442280	2446800	Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying,
2446800	2452720	how about shut the fuck up?
2452720	2457840	So if we called, that's kind of retarded because if you think about it, say we called them
2457840	2460560	interactive entertainment or something like that.
2460560	2465360	So say for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided
2465360	2471000	to call rape candy, would that make rape any better?
2471000	2473280	Oh well, you know, candy's good.
2473280	2474480	I like candy.
2474480	2478160	Oh crap, I mean, I don't like rape.
2478160	2479520	I'm confused.
2479520	2483840	I like candy only when they say yes.
2483840	2487400	Candy is delicious.
2487400	2492520	It's just like interactive entertainment could be masturbation, right?
2492520	2494680	That's something you have to interact with, right?
2494680	2500080	They're basically saying the critics of video games always equate games with toys and thus
2500080	2505800	with children, and so they kind of treat it badly.
2505800	2512200	Here's my thing, the critics of video games a lot of times don't do their research.
2512200	2517000	Just like a lot of people coming out talking about Bully hadn't played the game, didn't
2517000	2521780	know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game, or claimed
2521780	2527760	to have played it online despite the fact that it's impossible, I think that no matter
2527760	2534540	what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people, and it doesn't
2534540	2539880	matter how you dress up a turd, it's still a turd, so that's basically it.
2539880	2540880	Wow.
2540880	2541880	Alright.
2541880	2550880	Well, you know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.
2550880	2553840	Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?
2553840	2557400	Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.
2557400	2564040	A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo- Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?
2564040	2565040	Candy is delicious.
2565040	2566040	Anyway.
2566040	2567040	Wow.
2567040	2569520	We're going to get emails on this, I already know.
2569520	2570880	No, okay, okay, absolutely.
2570880	2577920	There is an in-joke about candy in one of my circles, so.
2577920	2588560	Anyway, a 31-year-old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or
2588560	2595080	Alive was basically sexually harassing her.
2595080	2601080	The compensation she is looking for- Rob.
2601080	2610640	Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million- Rob, what the hell?
2610640	2612520	It's candy, get it?
2612520	2614960	This candy is not so delicious.
2614960	2621760	Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843, so that he
2621760	2629640	started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.
2629640	2635420	She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become- But he's basically saying
2635420	2638720	that she wanted it.
2638720	2646480	But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to
2646480	2652120	it.
2652120	2655560	Tara is sitting over in the corner going, I want candy, dude.
2655560	2659440	Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.
2659440	2660440	Stop laughing.
2660440	2664840	I'm not laughing, it's a serious matter.
2664840	2674640	Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was a sexual harassment related
2674640	2681760	to the man who created DOA, I still like the bounciness, because it's completely against
2681760	2682760	the laws of physics.
2682760	2686080	But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.
2686080	2690320	It's like, hey, babe, you want to model for my next big game?
2690320	2694920	Dark Knight in our chat room says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.
2694920	2696440	That's a political joke.
2696440	2698960	I like that one.
2698960	2699960	Har.
2699960	2702200	Well, this is no joke.
2702200	2705960	Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.
2705960	2709120	It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.
2709120	2711160	Maybe not quite that level.
2711160	2715440	Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.
2715440	2719640	There's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?
2719640	2725560	There's been an ad that ran in Gears of War.
2725560	2731440	There was a little ad in there and it said, check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer
2731440	2737080	demo, which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace
2737080	2738080	soon.
2738080	2739880	Kind of cool.
2739880	2743600	So for those folks that are anticipating that game, and I got to say, I played the first
2743600	2746880	demo and I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?
2746880	2747880	This is boring.
2747880	2750600	I'm going to be honest, I wasn't into it at all.
2750600	2754280	It's a pretty game and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish.
2754280	2758240	No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.
2758240	2761640	Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo goo gaga over that game, but Lost
2761640	2763600	Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.
2763600	2764920	It's exactly Gears of War.
2764920	2771040	It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.
2771040	2773560	A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.
2773560	2779640	Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War, just like Prey is Gears
2779640	2780640	of War.
2780640	2784040	Except, no, that's a first person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.
2784040	2788460	But like, you can't die in Prey.
2788460	2789720	That's the greatest thing about Prey.
2789720	2791000	Yeah, that's kind of ironic.
2791000	2792080	You can't die in Prey?
2792080	2795440	They can't finish Duke Nukem Forever, so it makes sense.
2795440	2803480	Anyways, so on things that aren't Gears of War, Child's Play 2006 has just finally started
2803480	2808600	and, of course, this is going to be the fourth annual gaming charity fundraiser that helps
2808600	2813320	supply children's hospitals around the world with gaming goodness, like Gears of War, and
2813320	2824060	set up basically to respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.
2824060	2829160	Seeing them as almost degenerates or scum of the earth.
2829160	2830600	So yeah, that's pretty cool.
2830600	2834800	And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, who have been behind this for a while
2834800	2835800	now.
2835800	2841800	In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.
2841800	2844520	Pretty cool and definitely a good cause.
2844520	2853400	And if you want to know more information about that, visit pennyarcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org.
2853400	2855600	Do they take systems as well as financial donation?
2855600	2857000	Like actual game games?
2857000	2858840	I know where you're going with this.
2858840	2862680	Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play
2862680	2866960	the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity and maybe some money as
2866960	2869040	well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.
2869040	2872040	I don't know, I'm not so hot right now, but if I have some extra money, I support this
2872040	2873040	charity.
2873040	2874240	You'll have to check out the website.
2874240	2878160	All right, I will do that right now or I'm sure someone in chat will say, oh, I already
2878160	2885960	read it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2885960	2894860	Anyway, DarkSakura surfs the web up and down and back and forth every week and finds a
2894860	2899380	website that she likes and she's going to share that website with you right now in her
2899380	2900380	website of the week.
2900380	2902280	And you know what I just realized?
2902280	2906040	You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDRO Hostile.
2906040	2908040	You know what this song is called?
2908040	2909040	Candy.
2909040	2917080	Candy is delicious.
2917080	2920720	My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do
2920720	2924000	this one last week and I forgot the address.
2924000	2932360	It's Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different
2932360	2938960	basically laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass.
2938960	2946280	People running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships, you can even volunteer
2946280	2954360	to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org, O-R-G, a very, very, very cool site.
2954360	2956480	Book market for next year.
2956480	2957480	Yep.
2957480	2962880	You can still also look at it regularly though for updates.
2962880	2966720	You just have that in one window and game politics in the other, you're set.
2966720	2970640	You're politically of sound mind.
2970640	2974280	If you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your
2974280	2976720	favorite gaming companies.
2976720	2984000	A quote came from the ESA this week, the ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.
2984000	2989220	His organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for
2989220	2991760	generating a list of invitees.
2991760	2996380	The point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings.
2996380	2999520	That is not for the ESA to say or influence.
2999520	3001120	Interesting.
3001120	3004080	If you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can
3004080	3007400	get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.
3007400	3008400	Who knows?
3008400	3011680	Are they still wanting to call them invites or is that a negative connotation towards
3011680	3012680	gamers?
3012680	3013680	Do they want to call them something else?
3013680	3016300	I have no idea.
3016300	3019080	All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.
3019080	3027680	Well, you know a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.
3027680	3028680	Good luck.
3028680	3029680	Good luck.
3029680	3032440	They don't want to talk to us bastards.
3032440	3035420	But when you have that attitude, who would?
3035420	3042580	So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3 that's going to be
3042580	3052560	taking place in October 07 and they want you to name it because they don't have a name.
3052560	3055880	So they have a contest.
3055880	3064420	Basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance
3064420	3070640	to name the expo and if you win, you will win a prize package including a round trip
3070640	3072480	airfare for two.
3072480	3078640	Hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo.
3078640	3082940	Contest ends on Monday, November 20.
3082940	3084080	I got a name.
3084080	3088160	How about Gamer Expo?
3088160	3094040	How about Big LA Game Place?
3094040	3095080	How about Thingy?
3095080	3096760	How about Game Pro Expo?
3096760	3098960	I mean seriously, just give it a name.
3098960	3101120	It doesn't have to be that snazzy.
3101120	3103240	How about, hey, this is an E3.
3103240	3107480	How about Boobs and Games?
3107480	3108480	Anyway.
3108480	3116120	Bitch, what did you say, you're not a bitch, this ain't a cutscene, press A.
3116120	3118680	I should, I should, that's his tiara today.
3118680	3120680	That was great.
3120680	3124080	You don't have time to smoke a bowl.
3124080	3125080	Anyway.
3125080	3128080	Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?
3128080	3129240	Huh?
3129240	3133680	I, I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.
3133680	3137640	We have Miklotov playing with Power Rangers toys.
3137640	3138640	And a Santa hat.
3138640	3141520	Is that Magic Ranger?
3141520	3142520	Can we do the show, please?
3142520	3143520	Can we do the show?
3143520	3144520	Oh, I'm sorry.
3144520	3148040	Hey, Dark Tetsuya says call it G3.
3148040	3152360	Game Pro Gamers Gathering, G3, ha ha ha ha ha ha.
3152360	3153360	Anyway.
3153360	3154360	Failed.
3154360	3156680	Hey, I'm trying to get short here.
3156680	3164960	So Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal, has
3164960	3168720	been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California.
3168720	3172440	He bought four embezzlement and drunken driving.
3172440	3181400	Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.
3181400	3182720	Big expensive car.
3182720	3185560	He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.
3185560	3187520	I liked the Gizmondo.
3187520	3190200	I liked that Johnny whatever game it was.
3190200	3191200	One game.
3191200	3195840	It had one stinkin' game that was kinda neat.
3195840	3198000	Anyway, he, um.
3198000	3201520	I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.
3201520	3209080	Anyway, he, um, basically it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.
3209080	3215120	So he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.
3215120	3219840	So Drunami, the people behind the Engage need to go to the chair.
3219840	3224000	He was trying to basically get out of going to jail, so.
3224000	3226280	However, he's still in jail.
3226280	3228440	He's going to be deported.
3228440	3232560	They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and
3232560	3235980	restitution to the banks involved.
3235980	3240440	And basically, there is no more Gizmondo.
3240440	3243200	Will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?
3243200	3244800	I don't know.
3244800	3245800	I hope not.
3245800	3248240	I just think, I just think he, uh.
3248240	3256200	I'm just like, I think that he deserves it.
3256200	3257200	Engage 2?
3257200	3258200	God.
3258200	3261640	I'm glad that he wasn't miked for that.
3261640	3264720	Engage 2 Electric Boogaloo.
3264720	3265720	That's fucked.
3265720	3267000	I'd buy one just for that name.
3267000	3273040	Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our, uh, geekier fans is
3273040	3278240	that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game that will be out with the next film, uh, June
3278240	3279240	2007.
3279240	3285280	It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes
3285280	3289180	me very happy because I, I, I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.
3289180	3291480	They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?
3291480	3292480	It has Silver Surfer!
3292480	3293480	Yeah, really.
3293480	3294880	Which means it might have Galactus.
3294880	3297080	The search for more losses.
3297080	3300760	The uh, you know, I'll say that the guy that played the torch guy?
3300760	3303520	He's smoking.
3303520	3306840	Hey Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?
3306840	3309600	You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity claws.
3309600	3310720	Okay, okay, okay.
3310720	3314480	Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.
3314480	3316800	Okay, then dye her hair.
3316800	3322880	Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.
3322880	3325680	Just more, more human torch guy, please.
3325680	3327440	Then I'll go see the movie.
3327440	3330280	Thank you, yeah, thank you.
3330280	3335920	And right on cue, the chat room goes, flame on Skye, flame on, ha ha ha ha.
3335920	3341000	Oh my God, SSG100 Matt's winner, Galactus voiced by Penn & Teller.
3341000	3344080	Oh shit.

3353600	3354640	You can call us live.
3354640	3359220	The telephone number is 877-GAME-OLR.
3359220	3363040	That's 877-426-3657.
3363040	3367920	That toll-free number, FYI, only works toll-free in the U.S. and Canada.
3367920	3368920	Let's go to the phones.
3368920	3371400	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3371400	3372400	Who dis?
3372400	3374680	Raven's Dolphin, it's good to hear from you.
3374680	3377280	Hi, Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?
3377280	3378800	Flame on, Raven's Dolphin.
3378800	3380800	Yeah, flame on.
3380800	3385140	There's only one thing I want to talk to you about is the Xbox 360, and you talked about
3385140	3386720	it being a Dreamcast.
3386720	3393160	Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast
3393160	3394640	system previously.
3394640	3398940	I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked
3398940	3401920	all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.
3401920	3405880	All right, that is our podcast listeners, no good.
3405880	3409160	Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?
3409160	3411160	I don't really have it on hand.
3411160	3413960	I'm just going to post it in there.
3413960	3418520	All right, what's in this article?
3418520	3426640	What happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console
3426640	3427640	out there.
3427640	3431420	They didn't want to leave the market with the Saturn stink.
3431420	3435200	They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.
3435200	3436680	The Saturn stink.
3436680	3438640	I like that term.
3438640	3442440	I'm taking great offense to that, because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.
3442440	3445920	It's just they had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well, because
3445920	3451560	Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities
3451560	3455320	for every employee that worked there, and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM
3455320	3457000	card out here or all the good games.
3457000	3459320	We're just going to leave those in Japan.
3459320	3461040	That's what it said in the article.
3461040	3465160	Sega stink.
3465160	3469120	They were losing a lot, a lot of money on everything.
3469120	3472800	The Saturn and the Dreamcast.
3472800	3474680	How does this compare to Xbox 360, though?
3474680	3477080	Because Microsoft's losing on the consoles?
3477080	3478560	Michael Moore.
3478560	3479560	What?
3479560	3482800	You mean Peter Moore?
3482800	3485600	Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.
3485600	3487520	Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.
3487520	3488960	Michael Moore does films.
3488960	3491740	He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?
3491740	3494600	Big guy with a beard, harasses congressmen on the street.
3494600	3495600	Thank you.
3495600	3496600	Peter Moore.
3496600	3502320	Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference, where he
3502320	3507800	came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay,
3507800	3508800	let's get it out of the way.
3508800	3510800	Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.
3510800	3511800	Yay!
3511800	3512800	Okay.
3512800	3513800	Cute.
3513800	3514800	Anyway.
3514800	3515800	There's other comparisons.
3515800	3516800	I see.
3516800	3518000	So, Peter Moore is the comparison here.
3518000	3523800	Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up is
3523800	3529560	Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.
3529560	3531400	Sega did not have a lot of money.
3531400	3535160	The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.
3535160	3540760	Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.
3540760	3544920	I'll call it Gizmondo 2.
3544920	3545920	Electric Boogaloo.
3545920	3549200	All right, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.
3549200	3550200	Have a good night, all right?
3550200	3551200	You too.
3551200	3552200	Bye.
3552200	3553200	Later.
3553200	3554200	Bye.
3554200	3555200	Bye.
3555200	3556200	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3556200	3557200	Who's this?
3557200	3558200	Yes, it's NintendoManiac64.
3558200	3559200	I haven't called in a while.
3559200	3560200	Hi, NintendoManiac64.
3560200	3561200	What's on your mind, buddy?
3561200	3562200	Okay.
3562200	3567800	First off, I've got to know, does my quality suck?
3567800	3568800	You're okay.
3568800	3570720	You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.
3570720	3574200	Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.
3574200	3575200	Okay.
3575200	3576200	First off...
3576200	3581200	I forgot what I was going to say.
3581200	3583320	This is something completely different.
3583320	3587080	I remember last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was
3587080	3590080	kind of odd.
3590080	3592120	There's one that I've been following.
3592120	3593960	It's actually a fan game.
3593960	3600200	It's basically Zelda for a cell phone, and I don't have a cell phone, and they don't
3600200	3601920	try it, even though there's a cell phone emulator.
3601920	3604680	Link, I'm too lazy to go through that.
3604680	3606440	This is a homebrew type game, right?
3606440	3607560	Somebody made this from scratch.
3607560	3610240	I seem to remember we had an article on it a few shows ago.
3610240	3613200	This was a long time ago, so you may have missed it, but yeah, I do remember we talked
3613200	3614200	about it previously.
3614200	3617400	I haven't played it myself, but you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate
3617400	3619040	mobile games, right?
3619040	3620920	I think they all are creepy.
3620920	3625160	I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.
3625160	3629960	Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic
3629960	3631400	formula of Luminous.
3631400	3636720	For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors,
3636720	3638080	and then sometimes the shapes are different.
3638080	3640440	They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.
3640440	3644800	It made it kind of feel a little bit refreshing and different, and for a cell phone, Java
3644800	3646640	type game, it actually wasn't bad.
3646640	3647920	I was kind of impressed.
3647920	3651600	Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.
3651600	3652600	I'm sorry.
3652600	3655720	I'm sure Zelda on the phone will be cool too.
3655720	3656960	Is it out?
3656960	3657960	When can we get it?
3657960	3660760	Well, it's actually a second demo.
3660760	3666280	The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made a forum I hang out at, but
3666280	3670120	oddly enough to call it Zelda Fan Game Central, so just gc.com.
3670120	3676120	I posted the link in chat already if you want to take a look at it.
3676120	3677120	All right.
3677120	3678120	Oh, you posted the link in chat.
3678120	3679120	All right.
3679120	3680120	I'll check it out.
3680120	3681120	We'll see.
3681120	3682560	Hey, tell the guy if he wants to come on the show and plug his product.
3682560	3683560	We'll do that.
3683560	3684560	I'm curious.
3684560	3685560	I would love to...
3685560	3686560	I guess I'll ask him.
3686560	3689320	But you know the first question I'm going to ask is, why cell phone?
3689320	3690320	No, I understand.
3690320	3693980	Zelda's a beloved game, and to be able to take it with you on your phone wherever you
3693980	3696560	go would be pretty cool, I got to admit.
3696560	3697560	Okay.
3697560	3702400	Second off, Halloween was last week, and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.
3702400	3703920	It is gaming related.
3703920	3706840	Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?
3706840	3707840	No.
3707840	3708840	All right.
3708840	3709840	What did you dress up as?
3709840	3710840	Tell us.
3710840	3711840	Okay.
3711840	3713640	I'm putting the links in chat.
3713640	3715960	Okay, there they are.
3715960	3716960	All right.
3716960	3718400	Let me bring it up.
3718400	3721040	This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3721040	3723040	Might I remind you here?
3723040	3724040	Okay.
3724040	3725040	All right.
3725040	3727240	Explain the costume for the podcast, listeners.
3727240	3728240	Okay.
3728240	3735440	My name, Nintendo Maniac 64, kind of shows that I am a big entire lover, and other people
3735440	3738520	might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.
3738520	3740700	You probably already know this guy.
3740700	3742960	I do.
3742960	3747440	And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on
3747440	3748440	PlayStation.
3748440	3749440	I went for the irony factor.
3749440	3753000	I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made.
3753000	3755160	Of masking tape and permanent marker.
3755160	3759240	Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the
3759240	3760240	PlayStation hater.
3760240	3761640	It's a well done logo.
3761640	3764640	Yeah, you did a pretty good job.
3764640	3766720	Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?
3766720	3770360	You went for the old school PS logo.
3770360	3773000	Because it's the PlayStation logo.
3773000	3774000	All right.
3774000	3775000	Oh, sorry.
3775000	3776000	The PlayStation logo.
3776000	3777000	My bad.
3777000	3779560	It has a PS3 on it.
3779560	3782720	Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3782720	3784620	We got to let you go so we can get some more calls though.
3784620	3785620	Have a good one.
3785620	3786620	Thanks for calling.
3786620	3787620	All right?
3787620	3788620	Okay.
3788620	3789620	Later.
3789620	3790620	All right.
3790620	3791620	We're going to get to some more calls.
3791620	3792620	Let's go over to this one.
3792620	3793620	Hi.
3793620	3794620	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3794620	3795620	Who's this?
3795620	3796620	This is Jason.
3796620	3797620	Hi, Jason.
3797620	3798620	Buddy, our webmaster.
3798620	3799620	What's up?
3799620	3800620	Yay.
3800620	3801620	Yay.
3801620	3802620	We love you.
3802620	3803620	Whee!
3803620	3804620	How's the 800 number going?
3804620	3809400	You were the one that was the mastermind behind that whole thing, so we really appreciate that.
3809400	3813640	I know the listeners do, too, and the folks leaving voicemails, so yay, Jason.
3813640	3814640	I have a certain complaint.
3814640	3816680	I'd like to think it's working pretty well.
3816680	3818520	It does seem to be working okay.
3818520	3820520	What's on your mind, buddy?
3820520	3827640	When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole low-word participation
3827640	3833320	numbers and all the fun nonsense, and with the whole Xbox, what's it called, XNA.
3833320	3834320	Hold on a minute.
3834320	3836320	Hold on a minute, buddy.
3836320	3837920	Put the car in park for a minute there, buddy.
3837920	3841440	Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number's doing so great and the quality of his call
3841440	3847160	right now is kind of crappy, like we're hearing a lot of break-up in there?
3847160	3848160	Just the irony factor.
3848160	3849160	Sorry, Jason.
3849160	3851560	I don't know what else to tell you.
3851560	3853560	So E3, yeah?
3853560	3860120	E3 and the whole low-word participation amongst independent developers, no, low-word participation
3860120	3867480	in general and not just in general masses, but XNA, Xbox, Microsoft, XNA, the independent
3867480	3873200	development suite can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible
3873200	3877520	theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.
3877520	3882800	So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work
3882800	3883800	with the XNA?
3883800	3884800	Yeah.
3884800	3888080	I mean, XNA is a launching point.
3888080	3894320	You can go so much further beyond there, and if you bring together independent developers
3894320	3897480	and publishers, I mean, do I really have to go further than that?
3897480	3899800	You know, I will say this.
3899800	3904640	Microsoft seems to be in touch with their underground audience, so to speak, more than
3904640	3909160	a lot of other big gaming companies I've seen, and that, you know, obviously Major Nelson
3909160	3910440	has a lot to do with that.
3910440	3913920	You know, you might remember at Gamers Developers Conference, they had like the bloggers' breakfasts
3913920	3916360	and things, and they had that bus at E3.
3916360	3923080	They definitely seem to be in touch with the underground media a little more than any other
3923080	3924080	company.
3924080	3925080	So thank you for that.
3925080	3926920	If anyone were to do this, it would probably be them.
3926920	3927920	All right.
3927920	3933600	And the fact of how much that that can help them on their place in general in XBL, in
3933600	3936840	the next couple of years, this whole generation is going to be a really big difference.
3936840	3940240	It's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out.
3940240	3943600	It would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof.
3943600	3944600	I definitely agree.
3944600	3947720	Jason, the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality.
3947720	3948800	I'm so sorry.
3948800	3951640	We love you anyway.
3951640	3952640	We love you, Jason.
3952640	3954880	Another one.
3954880	3955880	Good thought.
3955880	3956880	Yeah.
3956880	3957880	Watch them start kicking people from chat.
3957880	3959600	That would be awesome.
3959600	3960600	You what?
3960600	3961600	You're going to talk shit about me?
3961600	3962800	Who's talking shit about him right there?
3962800	3963800	Let's see.
3963800	3964800	We have Jason is awesome.
3964800	3965800	Let's see.
3965800	3966800	Stop.
3966800	3967800	You fail at calling.
3967800	3969760	See, he's going to boot GS68 right there for you fail at calling.
3969760	3971600	Oh, he just gave him the middle finger.
3971600	3972600	All right.
3972600	3973600	Let's go to another call.
3973600	3974600	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
3974600	3975600	Who's this?
3975600	3976600	Hola.
3976600	3977600	Hey, it's DMN.
3977600	3978600	No, really.
3978600	3979600	It's Ron.
3979600	3980600	Hi.
3980600	3981600	Hi, DMN.
3981600	3982600	Hi.
3982600	3983600	Hi, DMN, Ronmo.
3983600	3984600	What's on your mind?
3984600	3985600	Not much.
3985600	3987600	I have a quick question for Lokey.
3987600	3989600	Lokey, I want to ask you...
3989600	3991600	Lokey, are you paying attention?
3991600	3992600	Yes.
3992600	3993600	Lokey, boobs.
3993600	3994600	Boobs, Lokey, boobs.
3994600	3995600	Yeah, what's on your mind?
3995600	3996600	Chose a DNA.
3996600	3997600	What's on your mind?
3997600	3998600	All right, Lokey.
3998600	4000920	Have you heard anything about Halo 3?
4000920	4005480	Because a friend of my orchestra, Gamestop, he just told me last week that Microsoft,
4005480	4009080	the press release has coming out on November 2007.
4009080	4010600	Have you heard anything new since that?
4010600	4012120	No, I haven't heard anything new.
4012120	4014600	We still have the date as March.
4014600	4016920	Has that press release actually come out anywhere?
4016920	4018380	No, it has not.
4018380	4019380	So your friend...
4019380	4020380	I told my friend that.
4020380	4025140	Well, so your friend who works at this random Gamestop happens to know the inner workings
4025140	4027080	at Microsoft and what they're developing.
4027080	4032400	You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the Gamestop employees?
4032400	4037120	I'm thinking we got exhibit A right here.
4037120	4040880	He might be dead fucking wrong and you might be right.
4040880	4042160	Your Gamestop kid might be right.
4042160	4043760	It's November 2007.
4043760	4048000	But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a
4048000	4049640	press release right now.
4049640	4050640	Please.
4050640	4053040	I trust Lokey more than I do Gamestop.
4053040	4058760	Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going
4058760	4060760	to be in the holiday.
4060760	4062160	It's going to be the November title.
4062160	4066800	So that'd be my guess right there because there you got your two Halo games.
4066800	4073640	You've got one that's just in time for when the PlayStation 3 systems might be available.
4073640	4076400	Again, their second big push.
4076400	4080080	More of a reason to not go to the Sony side.
4080080	4085200	And then you have your last Halo game that's probably also going to get like your Fable
4085200	4088280	2 and stuff as well also in the holiday season.
4088280	4091080	So it's perfect timing for that.
4091080	4095720	And plus, the other thing, March being the end of their financial quarter, it makes their
4095720	4096760	numbers look good.
4096760	4098640	So more people invest in their company.
4098640	4103860	That's kind of why they would do it that way because they don't really have a big game
4103860	4105760	coming out in March right now.
4105760	4113520	I think what they have Forza 2 on the line, Crackdown and probably Shadowrun.
4113520	4116120	And I think those were all scheduled before June.
4116120	4119520	So I don't know.
4119520	4123440	I'm still saying March until I hear otherwise.
4123440	4125720	I have a question I think so too.
4125720	4129520	I mean, because I asked him Wait, DarkSaga has a question for you.
4129520	4130520	No, no, no.
4130520	4132520	He go ahead and finish what you're saying.
4132520	4137840	Well, I was saying to him, well, if this is an actual press release, don't you think somebody
4137840	4139200	would have leaked it by now?
4139200	4140200	Because I had access for proof.
4140200	4143760	He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.
4143760	4148960	And I've been checking on the sites, nothing about it.
4148960	4152000	So I think it's just all smoke.
4152000	4153560	He's breaking up now.
4153560	4154560	Yeah.
4154560	4157400	Well, I got to let you go because you're breaking up hella bad.
4157400	4162320	But thanks so much for the call and tell your friend he's full of shit.
4162320	4163320	Sorry DarkSaga.
4163320	4164320	What were you going to ask?
4164320	4165320	Maybe he can answer in chat.
4165320	4166320	I forget.
4166320	4168160	Let me put it this way.
4168160	4170480	They have November 1st as a date right now.
4170480	4179540	Like I know we use, for example, November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system
4179540	4183560	when we don't have a release date, because it's easy to enter in when you're entering
4183560	4186000	items into a database and it's 1111111.
4186000	4188760	Sorry, I picked up another call.
4188760	4191520	Hi, you're on our service.
4191520	4193280	Ah, damn that feedback.
4193280	4194520	Sorry, I finished your thought.
4194520	4196440	I won't pick up another call until you're ready.
4196440	4198320	Anyway, so that would be a default date.
4198320	4204240	So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.
4204240	4206400	And that's what they have on their website right now.
4206400	4208680	It's a default placeholder date.
4208680	4210080	All right.
4210080	4211480	Now let's try another call.
4211480	4212480	Sorry.
4212480	4213480	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4213480	4214480	Who's this?
4214480	4217160	Hey, it's ShadowNextGen in the chat.
4217160	4218360	Hi, ShadowNextGen.
4218360	4219360	What's on your mind, buddy?
4219360	4220360	Hey guys, what's going on?
4220360	4221360	I just had a couple of-
4221360	4224000	No, we're just doing a radio show.
4224000	4228800	How about you?
4228800	4233200	About Halo 3, I actually agree with Loki.
4233200	4234840	And why?
4234840	4239800	Because that would also be when basically the quote unquote real launch of the PlayStation
4239800	4242920	3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.
4242920	4246400	So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.
4246400	4251520	Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said
4251520	4254160	or somebody was rumored that Halo 3-
4254160	4257040	That Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.
4257040	4258040	Yes, exactly.
4258040	4259760	It took the words right out of my mouth.
4259760	4263600	So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be what it is.
4263600	4268420	So in a way, maybe that kind of happens where it's maybe it goes up against the Euro launch
4268420	4272160	or like, as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.
4272160	4276160	That's kind of an interesting perspective.
4276160	4283560	And also at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo and it sucked.
4283560	4285500	Did you play Johnny Whatever?
4285500	4288680	I didn't get to play anything because they were all broken.
4288680	4292640	I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had
4292640	4294200	a bunch on display.
4294200	4295200	And nothing.
4295200	4300920	Did you wash your hands after touching them?
4300920	4302920	Yeah.
4302920	4306240	And I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.
4306240	4312400	I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those
4312400	4313400	controllers.
4313400	4314400	Anyway, sorry.
4314400	4319080	Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii because my GameStop had a kiosk.
4319080	4321160	And what did you think of the Wii?
4321160	4322760	I thought it was very awesome.
4322760	4324360	It was very awesome.
4324360	4326320	What games did you play?
4326320	4331800	I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the photo channel
4331800	4334340	and the Mii channel, things like that.
4334340	4338480	You know, I had some friends get, one of my friends post on LiveJournal about this.
4338480	4342400	They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.
4342400	4344400	I'm like, you stupid.
4344400	4345400	Really?
4345400	4346400	Yeah.
4346400	4349760	Apparently the guy came up behind him and like, you can't do that, you know, that whole
4349760	4350760	thing.
4350760	4351760	Yeah.
4351760	4352760	You guys are hella dumb.
4352760	4353760	Anyway.
4353760	4354760	Yeah.
4354760	4357880	And it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.
4357880	4358880	Hi.
4358880	4360480	Where are you going to go camp out at?
4360480	4361480	Uh, nowhere.
4361480	4362880	I have a pre-order of GameStop.
4362880	4364160	Well, look at you go.
4364160	4365160	Well, congratulations.
4365160	4367360	You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?
4367360	4368360	Yeah.
4368360	4370360	Well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.
4370360	4371360	All right.
4371360	4372360	Well, until then, have a good week.
4372360	4373360	Thanks for your call.
4373360	4374360	All right, buddy?
4374360	4375360	Yeah.
4375360	4376360	Thanks.
4376360	4377360	All right.
4377360	4378360	Good luck with the Wii.
4378360	4379360	Have fun.
4379360	4380360	Wii.
4380360	4381360	Yeah.
4381360	4382360	This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.
4382360	4383360	Hi.
4383360	4384360	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4384360	4385640	Hi.
4385640	4387480	This is Did You Lose A Sock.
4387480	4388480	Hi, Did You Lose A Sock.
4388480	4392500	I, we're getting a little feedback.
4392500	4393500	Get away from the screen.
4393500	4394500	Is that better?
4394500	4395500	A little bit, yes.
4395500	4396500	What's on your mind?
4396500	4397500	What's on your mind?
4397500	4382180	Um, which is a better game, Pen
4396160	4402740	Fears of Wars or Vivapinata?
4403040	4406680	I can't say because I haven't played Vivapinata.
4406680	4413680	Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?
4436680	4440680	I'm going to write to Glaad and tell them to ban Viva Pinata.
4440680	4441680	One more call.
4441680	4444680	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
4444680	4446680	Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.
4446680	4449680	Hi, Paradox Vincent. What's on your mind?
4449680	4458680	I was just thinking. A while ago, I was watching this thing.
4458680	4463680	And it was somebody at Microsoft. I want to say Peter Moore.
4463680	4467680	Ah, yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah.
4467680	4474680	Yeah. And he was talking about how he wanted to take a more unified stance.
4474680	4481680	This is before the Xbox 360 was even kind of. This is back, you know, last generation.
4481680	4486680	I was taking more of a unified stance towards gaming.
4486680	4495680	And how this has been the most competitive cycle yet.
4495680	4502680	Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?
4502680	4512680	Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony. They didn't want to attack Nintendo.
4512680	4522680	Yeah, but this cycle is so competitive. I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.
4522680	4529680	Hasn't Peter Jackson been the source of comments against Sony at some point?
4529680	4533680	Didn't Peter Pan do that?
4533680	4536680	I don't remember that.
4536680	4542680	In all seriousness, it was just recently campaign season.
4542680	4544680	It kind of reminds me of campaign season.
4544680	4549680	Where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight.
4549680	4553680	And we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.
4553680	4556680	And then suddenly a month later,
4556680	4558680	Drew Nami is running for Congress.
4558680	4564680	And did you know, when he was younger, he really liked candy?
4564680	4566680	Do not elect Drew Nami.
4566680	4568680	Paid for by Rob Roberts for President campaign.
4568680	4572680	You see all those negative ads all over.
4572680	4576680	They always start off like, oh yeah, it's going to be a clean fight.
4576680	4578680	Because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.
4578680	4584680	But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.
4584680	4586680	Yeah, I know what you mean.
4586680	4588680	I know what I mean, too.
4588680	4590680	Thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent. We appreciate it.
4590680	4593680	Anything else you want to say to our listeners?
4593680	4595680	No, not really.
4595680	4597680	All right, well have a good one.
4597680	4603680	Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.
4603680	4605680	Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.
4605680	4608680	All right, have fun with your Wii.
4608680	4610680	All right.
4610680	4614680	Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight. We appreciate it.
4614680	4619680	And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.
4619680	4622680	Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?
4622680	4631680	Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool.
4631680	4636680	But it is fan made, just so that nobody freaks out.
4636680	4640680	I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.
4640680	4644680	Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.
4644680	4651680	The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.
4651680	4656680	So you guys won't have to wait for much longer. Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.
4656680	4659680	I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.
4659680	4661680	Your free time's almost up.
4661680	4665680	So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.
4665680	4671680	Start off here with Saints Rogue getting an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.
4671680	4675680	And it's only going to cost you 80 Microsoft points, or $1.
4675680	4678680	So for a couple maps, that's a pretty good price.
4678680	4680680	So I'm glad of that.
4680680	4685680	We mentioned the ESRB leaked some titles for the Virtual Console.
4685680	4687680	There's actually a little bit more than what we mentioned.
4687680	4694680	Including Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Brothers, Ice Hockey, and Soccer.
4694680	4698680	And for the Super Nintendo Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.
4698680	4699680	That's hot.
4699680	4700680	Fuck yeah.
4700680	4704680	Kirby Super Star, Super Metroid, and Kirby's Dream Land 3.
4704680	4709680	For the Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, and Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
4709680	4711680	Sweet, Toad's Highway.
4711680	4713680	So that is pretty sweet right there.
4713680	4720680	Of course, there was some estimates on the Playstation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.
4720680	4724680	Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3.
4724680	4731680	And they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the Playstation 3 launch.
4731680	4733680	That's a lot of money.
4733680	4737680	It's Toad's Turnpike, I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.
4737680	4738680	Sorry.
4738680	4751680	Anyways, you might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entus of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.
4751680	4760680	While he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the Playstation 3.
4760680	4764680	But in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.
4764680	4766680	It's all about physics.
4766680	4769680	Did he see the same trailer I did?
4769680	4772680	He's an idiot.
4772680	4781680	Let's see here, there was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W. S. Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.
4781680	4783680	Yeah, it looked very boring.
4783680	4786680	Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!
4786680	4796680	Anyways, we know that November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Snake King.
4796680	4799680	Most anticipated games of the year.
4799680	4802680	Yes, but that's not where it stops.
4802680	4810680	In fact, Kellogg's, Cereal, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.
4810680	4818680	And apparently you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.
4818680	4821680	Froot Loops the game!
4821680	4823680	So that's kind of interesting.
4823680	4834680	As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well they have PTV for the Playstation download service where you're going to be able to download videos and stuff.
4834680	4842680	Right now they don't currently have any extra content on there, but you can download some free trailers including stuff for like Underworld Evolution and that kind of thing.
4842680	4843680	So that's kind of neat.
4843680	4845680	And then finally...
4845680	4849680	Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!
4849680	4858680	The last bit of information of course comes for the Playstation 3, and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.
4858680	4865680	In fact, you can actually get the binaries now for a Linux version that you can put on your Playstation 3.
4865680	4873680	And that's all available actually on Playstation's website on www.playstation.com slash ps3 dash open platform.
4873680	4875680	So that's kind of neat.
4875680	4877680	That's it.
4877680	4880680	Two scoops of raisins in this Xbox 360 game.
4880680	4890680	Scoop King. Poop Scoop King.
4890680	4892680	What else can we put in the cereal?
4892680	4899680	On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar coated cereal and end the program.
4899680	4903680	This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
4903680	4908680	Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight. What's your final thought?
4908680	4911680	Pie.
4911680	4915680	And Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun.
4915680	4919680	And I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.
4919680	4921680	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
4921680	4924680	War is over, if you want it.
4924680	4926680	Aww, I like that.
4926680	4931680	Loki, my final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.
4931680	4936680	Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.
4936680	4944680	My final thought is reject false icons.
4944680	4947680	I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.
4947680	4957680	My final thought is I heart you, Jamie. Heart, heart, heart, love, love.
4957680	4964680	Your final thought, Dark Sakura?
4964680	4966680	Gwar.
4966680	4967680	Gwar? I love Gwar.
4967680	4969680	Gwar!
4969680	4971680	She's holding a grudge.
4971680	4977680	Shut up, okay? You! No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Drew Nami.
4977680	4980680	You have to go make them in the bathroom.
4980680	4982680	He said I was holding a grudge.
4982680	4986680	I'll show you a grudge. I'll beat you with a ferret.
4986680	4989680	Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
4989680	4993680	Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting as always,
4993680	4995680	even on strange nights like this one.
4995680	4997680	We appreciate you sticking by us.
4997680	4998680	Have a great week.
4998680	5001680	Hey, next week, crazy system launches.
5001680	5007680	John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us
5007680	5010680	and since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other,
5010680	5013680	I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their excite truck on,
5013680	5016680	so it's sure to be a clusterfuck event,
5016680	5021680	which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.
5021680	5023680	Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.
5023680	5025680	We'll talk more about that next week.
5025680	5028680	Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
