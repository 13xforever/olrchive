487	5573	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
5893	14743	To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
15464	19088	Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19935	25677	And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th of 2006.
26278	32220	And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air because it's getting kind of cold now.
32240	34181	So I'm a little bit more calmed down.
34341	36722	I'm not quite as hyper as I was during the first segment.
37262	40783	I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.
41083	43724	But then again, at the same time, I don't apologize because that's me.
43864	44465	Take it or leave it.
44905	47846	If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe to.
49252	52755	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
79196	81517	The Central Buddy List and the Messaging System.
81597	83157	It's going to go for all titles.
87058	99962	Basically, it's... I suppose to make it easier, more user-friendly, so that you don't have login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.
100783	101743	It's all on there.
101963	108405	But they were basically saying that... They were actually saying that specific to Resistance, the game coming out that...
109443	110703	is going to be using the same login.
111403	120706	I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot about PlayStation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind.
120766	124967	I don't want to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, because I'm a fanboy of all three.
125427	129768	But Microsoft seriously has online down.
130028	135869	They're doing it the best, and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne from them this time around.
136630	137351	So, I don't know.
138232	141795	It's very little that we know about Sony's PlayStation 3 and the online stuff.
142115	147520	What I've seen so far, though, still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior online.
147700	149061	As it was last generation.
149561	157408	But I would have thought that this generation, the other two would have been... But Nintendo's really had to play catch-up, and I think their friend code thing kind of hurts them a little bit.
157889	158289	I don't know.
158549	161552	The friend code thing, in that respect, though, I think sort of protects...
162185	166047	I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer, it doesn't make it any easier.
166487	172169	But then again, on live, you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know are your friends.
172369	172549	Right.
173029	182853	And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's probably like Super Smash Bros.
182913	189896	Trophy Room, or like a lot of Nintendo games do, is that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.
190036	190776	Yay, crap!
191437	192158	I love crap!
192738	193039	Alright.
194681	194981	Anyway.
196263	200528	Here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my PlayStation 3 when I finally get one.
201249	202170	There's going to be...
203047	203567	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
222438	234167	It's something you create in the cross-media bar, and there's a memory card utility, and then you can actually create a PlayStation 1 card and a PlayStation 2 card, name them, and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.
234207	237329	So it's like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.
238069	240651	So that's how it's going to work on the PlayStation 3, if you were curious.
240931	244594	And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.
245114	245635	Makes sense.
245755	246515	That's pretty cool.
246796	248317	I wonder if I can load my virtual...
250325	251566	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
272796	273276	Heavenly Sword
302135	325759	which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways is slated for a 2007 release also in March and of course their flagship title Warhawk is in the summer now so that's kind of interesting but basically another reason why maybe waiting for a PlayStation 3 is a good idea because some of the bigger games are coming out later on.
328083	330026	ShadowNextGen said, Excite Truck does have achievements.
342729	343530	It may or may not.
344871	345871	Yes, we've heard it does.
345891	346872	I'm not disputing that part.
346892	349054	But we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.
349394	354758	The cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements my friends have and I can see what their score is.
355078	363064	And then these other fan-created things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like MyGamerCard.net, which is a very cool site.
363084	364945	Which, by the way, we have the OL Army site.
365325	367066	Gamers... What do we call it?
367086	369468	The OL Army E-Penis Leaderboard or something like that?
369768	371349	Where it's tracking all our gamer scores.
371389	373130	And you're on there, and you're on there, and I'm on there.
373450	383997	And if you want to join, check out our forums and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund.
384017	386419	But will the Wii have anything like that?
386499	389821	I don't think so, because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.
389981	391983	Now, that's not going to break the system.
392043	394104	It's just kind of surprising that they didn't
394818	397501	Embrace the online in that way.
397521	400124	Because I think not being online kind of killed them last round.
400184	402567	But that's just my opinion, I suppose.
402627	403068	What do I know?
403088	404009	I'm just some guy on the internet.
405991	409715	Well, back to different PS3 news.
410817	414581	And actually a few people have already told me their experiences with this.
415188	419250	You can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk.
419670	422311	The game's available on MotorStorm and NBA 07.
423091	428353	But according to one of our listeners, it crashed, I think, every, what, five minutes?
429874	432835	I believe that it was JVmon mentioned it.
434156	436817	What, was it overheating or what was it doing?
437277	438597	Probably overheating.
440938	442019	Oh, at Best Buy, sorry.
442599	444840	It was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes.
445953	451237	But, um, but there's the playable kiosks at, uh... Well, that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show, too.
451937	453399	But, I guess it was a different environment.
453419	454039	I'm not surprised!
454259	454800	Interesting.
454840	458282	Well, as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care about.
458362	462665	Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently the only way it was staying on.
463466	464607	No, but, uh, anyways.
465127	470031	Um, of course, like most anything else that's being released nowadays, you know, right as it comes out,
470854	472435	It's going to be upgraded.
472475	474336	And of course, that's the same with the PlayStation 3.
474937	477678	You will be getting a firmware update on launch day.
478439	484483	And it will basically allow you to utilize the PlayStation Network functions.
485603	495049	So, you know, not a big surprise, but they're doing the same thing with the Wii when that comes out there.
495089	497511	You have to do a firmware update as well for that.
497591	497691	But
499807	500127	I don't know.
500167	507033	I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early and be able to get them manufactured.
507493	516240	And if that means adding a firmware update later on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so be it.
517061	522525	Because if they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting two PS3s instead of 400,000.
522585	522845	All right.
522865	522965	Well...
526963	527804	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
547427	551930	NBA Street HomeCourt instead of porting NBA Live 07.
552370	556353	And HomeCourt will be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.
556773	563337	All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live 08.
566279	574304	And HomeCourt, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February.
574464	576826	So it shouldn't be too bad.
579341	586324	Anyways, um... There is also a lot of other, uh, you know, PlayStation 3 delays, you know, coming out.
586644	595188	Um... You know, pretty much, you know, with everything, just, you know, as we mentioned earlier, we're talking about, you know, Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that.
595688	600850	So, um, you know, it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff's being delayed.
604412	606393	But, um... Anyways, um...
608291	608933	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
618328	621769	And this makes me very, very, very sad.
623069	626030	Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3.
627310	636952	In fact, in a quote released by IGN, they said they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3.
637552	639292	Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.
639312	643873	When you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.
644774	646614	They're basically saying that since the
647541	649705	The controller doesn't have the button.
649725	653753	You can't actually activate it and you can't swap out the controller to change it in.
656357	666085	because you'll need to turn on the analog and, of course, the SG doesn't have analog, so... So, in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will not be working on the PlayStation 3.
666465	669127	There is no physical way to make it work.
669447	675672	So, would that go the same with, like, say, DDR, Beatmania, anything that uses an additional controller?
675792	678254	Well, it's interesting because I have a last-minute update here.
678514	685400	BomaniStyle just posted a story this evening because, you know, the PS3's out in Japan now and they're trying some backwards compatibility there and they're saying...
685871	691653	Poppin' Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds.
691973	694833	Poppin' Music Disney has timing issues with the background music.
695134	697554	Poppin' Music 2 is missing some images.
698274	702255	And let's see, Beatmania Best Hits has timing issues.
702275	706977	6 Mix and Core has background music as well as Beatmania The Sounds of Tokyo.
707277	708797	The timing's off in Godamix.
708837	710358	Some of the graphics don't appear in Godamix 2.
711158	711578	And Disney...
711778	713480	DDR Max 6 Mix.
713881	722130	The background doesn't always play correctly, which of course is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time and correctly, so it pretty much makes the game unplayable.
722150	724793	Are you talking about the background videos, though?
724893	726996	No, background music doesn't always play correctly.
727677	728057	Beatmania 2DX
754198	755718	Is that 100% compatibility?
755978	756499	Not quite.
783204	787307	I don't think it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kutaragi.
787667	791971	So it's funny because somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kutaragi's on fire!
792031	792831	Kutaragi's on fire!
793692	794833	It was funny to me in that moment.
799697	801478	He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons.
803059	804681	But he was on fire, running around on fire.
805301	806262	So now we have him...
806860	810242	Eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym, and on fire.
810602	815445	Well, someone who thinks Kutaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell.
815785	819867	You might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari.
819887	821868	You know, he's the granddaddy of Pong.
822608	826510	He said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in the foot.
826910	828631	There is a high probability they will fail.
828972	830913	The price point is probably unsustainable.
831053	835495	For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer standpoint.
836089	836629	Thanks for watching!
859682	860262	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
871804	889529	on one of the blogs today that talked about how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast and everybody said Dreamcast has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than PS2 can, Dreamcast can do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed.
889789	895271	So people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online.
896331	897531	Will history repeat itself?
897851	900092	We have to listen to him because he brought us Pizza Time Theater.
901155	901676	Dreamcast didn't play DVDs.
907711	909873	and at that time, DVDs were just breaking.
910233	918081	And I think, you know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray and Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.
918441	920803	I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.
920843	923866	I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD.
923946	927089	DVD was already somewhat established and everybody knew it was the next.
927449	928630	This time you have a split.
928991	933275	People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going to be the winner.
933835	937197	You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you gonna get a Blu-ray?
937217	937837	They go, what's that?
938518	939958	You gonna get an HD DVD?
940178	940378	What?
940439	941259	I have a DVD player.
941799	941999	What?
942039	942920	I have an HD TV.
944240	945801	No, you're gonna get an HD DVD.
945901	946121	What?
947442	950424	So, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.
951864	952285	Exactly.
952305	954166	If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.
955726	962730	Anyways, other interesting things about, also, we were talking about the backwards compatibility on games and how it's not working.
963154	972280	Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not a huge surprise, but Japanese PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.
972580	980865	Because the games are region-coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions.
981385	984027	But that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.
987486	987887	Thanks for watching!
1003847	1028685	Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background music correctly Xena Saga Episode 2, the opening movie sometimes stops Mega Man X7, background music won't play properly sometimes Devil May Cry, screen sometimes freezes during the title demo Suikoden 3, can't read PlayStation 1 data during the game Silent Hill 2, when going from title to demo, the screen may freeze Issues... That sounds like a lot of games
1030988	1033250	Oh, maybe that's what the day one firmware update's all about.
1033310	1033650	Who knows?
1033690	1038534	Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there, so... Oh, ouch.
1039255	1039875	Oopsie.
1039895	1040836	Good point, good point.
1041627	1048989	All right, well, anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners think of all this console mania going on this week.
1049729	1059591	Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelawnradio.com, and DarkSakura puts on the rubber gloves and dives in headfirst into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails to read for you folks.
1059711	1060671	Don't you, DarkSakura?
1061071	1061751	When I'm ready.
1068672	1076620	The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.
1077741	1080363	Alright.
1080403	1082565	This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.
1083366	1084027	I love that name.
1085068	1091193	You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.
1091694	1093896	A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing...
1094284	1121501	And that's about pre-ordering Halo 3 The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game Here's where the bullshit begins He said that the regular edition was just the game The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons The assault rifle 2 and the spike shot Have the first two games on the second disc come with the making of DVD Every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc Yeah, right
1122102	1124043	and have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.
1124483	1135068	Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie would include something like that, etc.
1135468	1143311	My classmate leaves, I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, Sir, I read the article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.
1143651	1147253	He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie so you should read it more carefully next time.
1147573	1149794	Needless to say, I now go to the other game shop in town.
1150979	1153862	You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that.
1153902	1156425	And when I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far.
1156445	1157386	And then it got to the helmet thing.
1157426	1158167	I'm like, wait a minute.
1159749	1160249	Wait a minute.
1160309	1162011	You can't wear the helmet, stupid.
1162172	1163193	Unless his head's really tiny.
1163593	1164294	He has a tiny head.
1167119	1169401	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1182970	1184091	They don't know who I am.
1184471	1191875	I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies.
1191975	1196897	But they assume things about me because I'm older and I play games.
1196957	1199718	They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.
1199759	1201179	I'm kind of sick of that attitude.
1201760	1209563	I'm not going into game stores to get told what games or that I should be buying the guidebook because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.
1210084	1211524	That only worked when Dan was a manager.
1212325	1212465	Well,
1213338	1214159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1236361	1239564	and, um, they, the guy treated me like I was royalty.
1239845	1243788	I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition stuff.
1244109	1247872	And instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I was like, okay, I can do that for you.
1248152	1250935	And he went and got the game, and I was like, do you have Luminous 2?
1251396	1255219	And the guy was like, um, no, not, you know, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.
1255519	1256400	Let me make a call.
1256640	1261245	And he called another store, he was gonna have it shipped ordered, and he's like, I won't even charge you a pre-order because the game already came out.
1261545	1262706	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1279531	1280151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1302856	1309699	Don't treat your customers like dirt, because you never know who you're pissing off, you know, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.
1310739	1311919	Can I ask which store you went to?
1312400	1313560	Which one in particular?
1314320	1322763	It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's... Oh, that's not the one then.
1323244	1323504	Yeah.
1323864	1324044	Yeah.
1324821	1327445	It's the one that your hubby used to work at years ago.
1327565	1330148	I think I know who the manager of that store is.
1330309	1330989	I don't care anymore.
1331029	1331490	It doesn't matter.
1331791	1332612	It's a lost cause now.
1332952	1334134	No, I mean the GameCrazy.
1335315	1341964	Oh, the GameCrazy I went to was in the... Okay.
1343627	1343847	Sorry.
1344247	1344548	Sorry.
1344608	1345028	Sorry.
1345128	1347672	I actually know about four managers of Game Crazies, too.
1348252	1349073	Well, he's a nice guy.
1349294	1349694	He's a nice guy.
1349854	1353799	Well, my experience with... SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.
1353839	1355642	He was not hitting on me, you jackass.
1355822	1358926	My experience with the Game Stops, you know, usually it's...
1359987	1361228	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1389389	1392030	Alright, well, the next one comes from Jason.
1392050	1397651	It says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.
1398051	1406873	A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against the Xbox in general.
1407213	1408793	So can you tell me if this is true?
1410133	1414034	Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?
1414114	1416615	Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show.
1416695	1417255	I never miss it.
1417568	1417969	and DarkSakura.com
1429402	1442773	Way later on, once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.
1442993	1447897	Doesn't HDMI, though, give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your regular eyes?
1448058	1450179	Unless you have, like, Borg vision or something.
1450199	1452661	HDMI is basically, it's like kind of...
1453562	1455004	Thanks for watching!
1470017	1480381	In a way, you can be able to do it, and maybe later on down the line, that might be an issue, but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line, they're going to release some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.
1481001	1482442	Who was the emailer that just sent that in?
1482522	1483002	What was their name?
1484883	1485243	Jason.
1485563	1485963	Jason.
1486023	1495547	Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here and bring your friend into the room, and we're going to give a special message to your friend right here.
1495587	1496408	Okay, so stop right here.
1497308	1497528	All right.
1498001	1502473	Hi Jason's friend, this is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you, you're wrong.
1502994	1503656	Hugs and kisses.
1504298	1504639	We love ya.
1507123	1510504	I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments, and I wanted to read them.
1511885	1517507	Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.
1517887	1521288	Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their jobs.
1521328	1523349	No, I just don't want to carry on a stupid conversation with them.
1523529	1524689	I hate talking to people.
1524829	1525870	That's a whole different story.
1525990	1527490	I will pretend to be better than them.
1527510	1527811	That's true.
1527851	1529611	Loki's just an asshole, is what it is.
1529631	1531032	It's not that he thinks he's better than you.
1531052	1531632	He's just a dick.
1531852	1532712	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1550225	1551445	at my work, so I understand.
1551746	1553066	One more comment, I promise, Jamie.
1553106	1555527	But this is from Brad from PodCulture, and he's cool.
1555807	1556427	I like Brad.
1556467	1557428	We got a comment from him.
1557668	1561849	But he was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Phantasy Star Universe.
1562149	1565390	They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.
1565710	1566711	He's 36, he admits.
1567391	1569552	Their first comment was, this is for your kid?
1573633	1574213	Dot, dot, dot.
1574334	1578535	They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee content in it.
1579332	1582094	Apparently you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I gotta sell it on eBay.
1583015	1585296	You know what happens when you assume, you make an asset out of you and me.
1586277	1589019	Well, this next email comes from TheAfroGuy.
1590640	1597005	Hey, OLR, I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.
1597465	1603890	My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully, um, Canis Canem ate it, because I think he's emailing from overseas.
1604631	1611012	He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really does feel like a living, breathing school.
1611392	1616873	Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for hours on Grand Theft Auto.
1617253	1624095	The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.
1624255	1628516	I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw him on the ground, and spit on him.
1628976	1630696	His reaction was, oh, never done that before.
1631417	1635339	However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.
1636180	1640722	What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.
1641062	1642103	And that was in quotes, by the way.
1642923	1648886	Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly a shock to our parents.
1648986	1653649	My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of harmless teasing.
1654349	1655870	And there's a footnote on here.
1656270	1657451	I love emails with footnotes.
1657878	1664880	said, if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.
1666180	1673742	To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame, and soon it will be on its way to a pre-owned rack in-game.
1674382	1685225	Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place in a school, and those acting violently are around his age.
1685605	1686765	Therefore, Rockstar should...
1687711	1692693	I'm sorry, should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't interest young teenagers.
1693233	1700035	I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play bully, but perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.
1700375	1701115	Thanks for the showing.
1701155	1702616	Keep up the good work, the Afro guy.
1704336	1712119	I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework, my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know what she was doing.
1712649	1716310	She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games so I had to do my own work.
1717171	1719692	I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.
1719752	1732376	If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting and it sounds a little bit vague, sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.
1732396	1733477	He needs to be punished.
1733837	1735318	I do have to say that if
1737310	1746239	If it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.
1746940	1757751	I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial evidence that it would be, then removing the game, it's smart, I think.
1760026	1760427	DarkSakura.com
1777960	1779521	is this game appropriate for my child?
1779721	1787724	And if the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from nonfiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.
1788024	1791345	Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.
1791625	1794986	For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.
1795066	1796887	It just depends on the child.
1797287	1799188	I can also understand that for at least...
1799847	1817098	People of a like age in that game Because it's one thing for a kid I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference In a kid playing Grand Theft Auto Because technically they're not adults It's something that they know they have no real way of doing
1817817	1822159	But a kid can go into school and basically be a bully.
1823099	1826660	FloWalk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking about, but I like this.
1827180	1829661	I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.
1829821	1831162	I made the kid eat grass.
1831902	1835063	But his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high heel, that bitch.
1836424	1838024	You got your ass kicked by a girl.
1838044	1840085	I've been in two fights in school, honestly.
1841206	1842226	Well, I've had like...
1842782	1845524	I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me.
1845985	1849047	One time there was this guy, he was the school bully.
1849167	1858435	I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.
1859335	1866581	I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks after school once, but I just didn't go.
1866601	1867562	I was like, what are they going to do?
1869537	1870357	CallMeNames.
1870597	1873298	Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.
1873598	1874239	So I just didn't go.
1874459	1881781	What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.
1882622	1885142	Because I just, I can't stand that type of thing.
1885483	1889184	The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and punched her in the nose.
1890864	1892385	Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.
1892845	1893405	Make it quick.
1893445	1894406	We've got to get back to the game.
1894446	1895806	Okay, her name was Myra.
1896346	1898247	And if you're listening, you deserved it.
1899372	1903755	She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.
1903915	1906876	I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.
1907056	1910718	Wasn't Myra the chick in Tiny Toons that was like, I'm gonna love it, it's squeezing?
1911038	1911859	Oh, sorry, my bad.
1912179	1917822	But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.
1917922	1920223	It was my journal and a couple other books.
1920943	1926226	And she even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her, and she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.
1926746	1928307	But did you learn that from River City Ransom?
1930473	1931234	River City Ransom
1959284	1962149	Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter.
1962189	1964774	I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.
1964794	1966036	The last email comes from John D.,
1971252	1975793	Hey guys, well yes, this is my first email to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.
1976313	1981435	I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting in that I was actually really good.
1981815	1984276	I was playing the 8 plus star songs which made me laugh.
1984676	1989537	But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters in Super Smash Bros.
1989577	1993218	Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?
1993318	1997860	Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.
2000851	2017476	with all due respect to the listener we're glad we got a new listener in a first email I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month but I'm going to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener so welcome to the show and I don't mean to tease you we do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers I
2021112	2026053	You know, the fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it does make a good fit.
2026113	2026993	Don't gur at me, Drew Nami.
2027013	2027993	That was already in Air Guys.
2028693	2030994	I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Bros.
2031854	2034274	Other characters I want to see, I definitely want to see Tom Nook.
2035135	2036315	I want to see Tom Nook.
2036375	2037715	Tom Nook is a bastard.
2039675	2040616	He'll take all my money.
2040656	2041576	That'll be a special move.
2041876	2043956	I want... Do you have somebody?
2044416	2044916	Little Mac.
2046657	2048057	Yeah, that'd be cool.
2048587	2051830	I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rain Man.
2052932	2054493	Oh, interesting speculation.
2054513	2058417	Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.
2058918	2065064	Sonic, which, you know, Sega and, you know, the GameCube were just, like, best buddies.
2065164	2067747	So, of course, makes perfect sense.
2068247	2069488	And also to that listener...
2070498	2078743	Download some Parapara videos off of YouTube and type Parapara Girls into YouTube or whatever it is, Parapara Deluxe or Velfair or whatever.
2079384	2083206	Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Parapara Paras.
2084947	2087929	I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it.
2088489	2089510	That's random.
2090291	2094513	So that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.
2095374	2095614	All right.
2097056	2097977	That was the last email, yes?
2098117	2099598	That was the last email.
2099618	2104142	Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can do that anytime you want.
2104182	2104923	Just send us an email.
2104963	2107625	It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
2107665	2108926	We look forward to hearing from you.
2109306	2114270	We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.
2114330	2117393	It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
2117953	2121896	And we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for you guys.
2122397	2123838	And last week we asked...
2124718	2126819	Are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3?
2126879	2128840	Are you going to be camping out for any of them?
2129040	2130001	Or what are you going to be doing?
2130561	2135263	And we got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now.
2135864	2137024	One of our voicemails of the week here.
2138065	2139946	Hey guys, it's DJ Tyrant.
2139986	2142427	Just calling in about the voicemail of the week.
2143067	2146149	Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.
2146829	2150691	I pre-ordered it at the electronics boutique that I work at.
2151685	2169776	and I also got a gift card for Best Buy for my birthday so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up my system and Zelda and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.
2171056	2172797	Calling in for a quick question.
2174658	2180722	Wondering what other launch titles I should pick up besides Zelda.
2181314	2181854	DarkSakura, Rebuttal
2208510	2211632	I say Red Steel all the way.
2237626	2238366	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2265774	2266935	Or is it maybe crappy?
2266995	2267796	Maybe you think it's crappy.
2267836	2269357	You're in the minority of folks there.
2269917	2271018	Send us a voicemail.
2271038	2272780	We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.
2273200	2276462	If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.
2276522	2277523	Otherwise, we get confused.
2278664	2280105	Anyway, back to the story.
2280125	2282827	The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?
2282987	2287831	And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.
2287851	2292055	They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line Stand.
2292635	2293816	And some quotes here.
2294946	2295647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2306806	2313253	Bullet point, there's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.
2313833	2316396	So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting it.
2317437	2323504	You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you, know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.
2323744	2326988	I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.
2327948	2330869	Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.
2331369	2338691	Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring something to make your $600 less conspicuous?
2339071	2345692	Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags, but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous.
2345992	2351694	So maybe you want to bring something to hide it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000 for that, da-da-da-da-da-da.
2354372	2355473	Have fun camping in the lines.
2355493	2357914	We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.
2359254	2361175	Yeah, Drunami says wear deodorant.
2361395	2361815	Good idea.
2362356	2363116	Bring extra.
2363136	2364236	Just bring extras for others.
2364617	2366357	Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.
2367638	2367918	All right.
2370559	2382024	Anyways, so other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, you know, better known for ruining E3.
2382044	2382244	But, um,
2384557	2385238	Are they games?
2385258	2385338	Yes.
2413851	2418132	Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?
2418712	2419052	Yes.
2419912	2421753	Are they then video games?
2422313	2423833	I think that's not a bad title.
2424533	2425934	What's there to not understand?
2428154	2437316	He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products were categorized as something more serious than a game.
2437336	2440517	Because entertainment is a serious business!
2441137	2441917	Oh, really?
2443103	2447846	Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying, how about shut the fuck up?
2452689	2459834	So, if we called, like, that, I mean, that's kind of retarded, because if you think about it, okay, say we called them interactive entertainment or something like that.
2460495	2468680	So, say, for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided to call rape candy, would, I mean, would...
2471140	2473202	Oh, well, you know, candy's good.
2473442	2474363	I like candy.
2474663	2475644	Oh, oh, crap.
2475744	2477646	I mean, I don't like rape.
2478247	2479148	I'm confused.
2479628	2481270	I like candy only when they say yes.
2483572	2484593	Candy is delicious.
2487375	2487795	So we're smoothies.
2515307	2516488	Hadn't played the game.
2516768	2520431	Didn't know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game.
2520671	2524794	Or, like, you know, claim to have played it online, despite the fact that's impossible.
2526956	2532320	I think that no matter what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people.
2533200	2537904	And it doesn't matter how you dress up turd, it's still a turd.
2537944	2539185	You know, that's basically it.
2539605	2540025	Wow.
2540866	2541306	Alright.
2544429	2544709	Well...
2546129	2549111	You know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.
2550593	2552935	Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?
2553835	2555997	Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.
2557658	2561442	A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo... Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?
2563763	2564804	Candy is delicious.
2567006	2569368	Anyway... Wow, we're gonna get emails on this, I already know.
2569448	2573011	No, okay, okay, I have to tell you, there is an in-joke about candy.
2574870	2576351	in one of my circles.
2578813	2593002	Anyway, a 31 year old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or Alive was basically sexually harassing her.
2595063	2600787	The compensation she is looking for Rob
2604497	2608838	Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million... Rob, what the hell?
2610559	2611439	It's candy, get it?
2612400	2614020	This candy is not so delicious.
2615561	2618421	Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843.
2621391	2629033	said that he started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.
2629553	2633714	She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become.
2634295	2637215	But he's basically saying that she wanted it.
2639416	2646558	But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to it.
2652096	2655117	Tiara's sitting over in the corner going, I want candy.
2655858	2659279	Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.
2660500	2661540	Stop laughing!
2661560	2662340	I'm not laughing!
2662400	2663661	It's a serious matter!
2666942	2678227	Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was sexual harassment related to the man who created DOA, I still like the bouncing...
2679062	2682525	The Bounciness, because it's like completely against the laws of physics.
2682926	2685848	But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.
2686009	2689051	It's like, hey baby, you want to model for my next big game?
2690152	2693476	Dark Knight in our chatroom says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.
2695377	2696298	That was a political joke.
2696639	2697199	I like that one.
2697700	2698060	Harr.
2699875	2701156	Well, this is no joke.
2701856	2705799	Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.
2705859	2708941	It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.
2708981	2710082	Maybe not quite that level.
2710963	2714565	Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.
2715065	2718508	And there's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?
2719448	2723091	There's been an ad that ran in... what was this?
2723131	2723751	Gears of War.
2724412	2725453	I'm sorry, it was in Gears of War.
2725493	2727094	There was a little ad in there, and it said...
2727918	2746683	Check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer demo Which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace soon Kind of cool So for those folks that are anticipating that game And I gotta say, I played the first demo And I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?
2746803	2754285	This is boring I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't into it at all It's a pretty game, and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish
2754921	2756582	No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.
2758162	2761444	Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo-goo-ga-ga over that game.
2761484	2763385	Lost Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.
2763565	2764765	It's exactly Gears of War.
2764865	2770828	It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.
2771128	2773209	A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.
2773809	2778371	Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War.
2778751	2780012	Just like Prey is Gears of War.
2780672	2783313	Except, no, that's a first-person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.
2783834	2784414	But, like,
2785225	2786486	You can't die in Prey.
2815888	2822169	Respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.
2823289	2827270	You know, seeing them as almost like degenerates or scum of the earth.
2829110	2830131	So yeah, that's pretty cool.
2830491	2834931	And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, you know, who have been behind this for a while now.
2834971	2840292	In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.
2840392	2843833	So pretty cool and definitely a good cost.
2844460	2855304	And if you want to know more information about that, visit PennyArcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org Did they take systems as well as financial donation?
2855524	2856784	Like actual game games?
2857724	2858625	I know where you're going with this.
2858865	2865167	Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity.
2866247	2869028	And maybe some money as well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.
2869068	2869368	I don't know.
2869388	2870328	I'm not so hot right now.
2870388	2872389	But if I have some extra money, I support this charity.
2873080	2873500	DarkSakura.com
2902242	2905965	You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDR Oha Style.
2905985	2906885	You know what this song's called?
2907806	2908106	Candy.
2913510	2914711	Candy is delicious.
2917073	2923117	My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do this one last week and I forgot the address.
2923897	2924037	It's...
2925109	2944082	Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass, people running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships.
2945283	2954249	You can even volunteer to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org Very, very, very cool site.
2954790	2955750	Bookmark it for next year.
2956191	2956391	Yep.
2957951	2960132	You can still also look at it regularly, though, for updates.
2962793	2965014	You just have that in one window and game politics in the other?
2965054	2965434	You're set.
2966595	2967935	You're politically of sound mind.
2969496	2975998	Well, if you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your favorite gaming companies.
2976779	2979340	A quote came from the ESA this week.
2979720	2982861	The ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.
2983924	2999931	his organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for generating a list of invitees the point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings that is not for the ESA to say or influence interesting
3000396	3007281	So if you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.
3007762	3011965	Are they still wanting to call them invites, or is that a negative connotation towards gamers?
3012105	3013466	Do they want to call them something else?
3013786	3014467	I have no idea.
3016268	3019851	All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.
3022533	3027597	Well, you know, a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.
3027637	3028017	Good luck.
3028177	3028538	Good luck.
3030235	3031816	They don't want to talk to us, bastards.
3032356	3034718	But when you have that attitude, who would?
3035358	3041721	So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3.
3042181	3046343	That's going to be taking place in October 07.
3047284	3052367	And they want you to name it because they don't have a name.
3052507	3054908	So they have a contest.
3055461	3083492	basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance to name the expo and if you win you will win a prize package including a round trip airfare for two hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo contest ends though on Monday November 20th I got a name
3084025	3085605	How about Gamer Expo?
3088086	3093147	How about... How about Big LA Game Place?
3093987	3094688	How about Thingy?
3095008	3096488	How about GamePro Expo?
3096848	3098889	I mean, seriously, just give it a name.
3098949	3100389	It doesn't have to be that snazzy.
3101049	3102789	How about... Hey, this is an E3!
3103190	3106490	How about... Boobs and Games?
3109191	3109451	Anyway...
3112442	3113023	What'd you say, Drew?
3113043	3116726	Don't be a bitch to say in a cutscene, per se.
3116866	3117106	I should.
3117146	3118447	That's his tiara today.
3118627	3119288	That was great.
3120629	3122010	You don't have time to smoke a bowl!
3122590	3122951	Anyway.
3124912	3127374	Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?
3130156	3130357	Huh?
3131177	3133439	I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.
3133459	3136742	We have Miklatov playing with Power Ranger toys.
3137582	3138323	And a Santa hat.
3138783	3139804	Is that Magic Ranger?
3140425	3140725	It's his...
3145135	3150157	DarkTetsuya says call it G3, GamePro Gamers Gathering, G3!
3153038	3155419	Anyway, hey, I'm trying to do a short here.
3156599	3164322	So, Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal,
3164864	3171509	has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California for embezzlement and drunken driving.
3173531	3178815	Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.
3181277	3182478	Big, expensive car.
3182698	3185460	He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.
3185661	3187022	I liked the Gizmondo.
3187742	3189824	I liked that Johnny Whatever game.
3190224	3191305	One game.
3191385	3192206	It had one...
3192839	3195261	Stinkin' game that was kinda neat.
3196862	3200444	Anyway, he, um... I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.
3201505	3208269	Anyway, he, um... Basically, it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.
3209029	3213793	So, he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.
3215113	3217455	No, Drew Nami, the people behind the N-Gage need to go to the chair.
3217475	3220137	Yes, thank you.
3220157	3222158	He was trying to basically get out of going to jail.
3222611	3225773	So... However, he's still in jail.
3226193	3227794	He's going to be deported.
3228415	3234539	They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and restitution to the banks involved.
3235840	3239442	And, uh, basically, there is no more Gizmondo.
3240203	3242964	Uh, will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?
3243665	3244165	I don't know.
3244926	3245426	I hope not.
3245866	3250749	I just think, I just think he, uh, I'm just like, think that he deserves it.
3251290	3251430	So...
3256221	3275438	N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo Fuck, I'd buy one just for that name Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our geekier fans is that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game
3276075	3278657	That will be out with the next film June 2007.
3279178	3289087	It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes me very happy because I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.
3289107	3291410	They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?
3291510	3292471	It has Silver Surfer!
3292491	3293932	Yeah, really.
3293952	3295013	Which means it might have Galactus.
3295033	3296414	The search for more losses.
3297475	3299938	You know, I'll say the guy that played the torch guy?
3300718	3301199	Smokin'.
3303553	3306134	Hey, Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?
3306775	3309416	You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity clause.
3309476	3310377	Okay, okay, okay.
3310777	3313778	Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.
3315199	3316040	Okay, then dye her hair.
3316860	3319662	Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.
3322763	3325104	Just more human torch guy, please.
3325605	3326525	Then I'll go see the movie.
3329086	3330067	Thank you, yeah, thank you.
3330227	3331908	And right on cue, the chat room goes,
3332318	3333421	Flame on, Sky!
3333521	3334142	Flame on!
3334403	3335766	Ha ha ha ha!

3366914	3367555	and Canada.
3367815	3368715	Let's go to the phones.
3369736	3371317	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3371357	3371677	Who dis?
3372387	3373328	Raven's Dolphin!
3373408	3374449	It's good to hear from you.
3374589	3375610	Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
3375630	3376310	What's on your mind?
3377071	3378392	Flame on, Raven's Dolphin.
3379212	3379993	Yeah, flame on.
3380653	3382335	There's only one thing I want to talk to you about.
3382355	3386318	It's the Xbox 360, and you talked about it being a Dreamcast.
3386818	3387098	Uh-huh.
3387478	3394103	Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast system previously.
3394824	3401569	I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.
3403829	3405730	All right, that is our podcast listeners no good.
3405770	3408351	Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?
3409571	3411112	I don't really have it on hand.
3411172	3413213	I'm just going to post it in there.
3414393	3416534	All right, well, what's in this article?
3417575	3427038	All right, what happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console out there.
3427098	3428739	They didn't want to leave the market.
3429452	3430993	with the Saturn Stink.
3431393	3435114	They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.
3435174	3436355	The Saturn Stink.
3436375	3438996	I like that term.
3439016	3442317	I'm taking great offense to that because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.
3442377	3457043	It's just it had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well because Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities for every employee that worked there and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM card out here or all the good games.
3457063	3458144	We're just going to leave those in Japan.
3459330	3461271	Sega Stink Michael Moore He was in Sega
3482757	3485539	Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.
3485559	3485920	Peter Moore.
3486060	3487461	Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.
3487501	3488842	Michael Moore does films.
3488922	3491284	He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?
3491644	3494386	Big guy with the beard harasses congressmen on the street.
3494426	3494787	Thank you.
3494827	3495367	Peter Moore.
3496408	3508577	Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference where he came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay, let's get it out of the way.
3508617	3510159	Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.
3510519	3511460	Yay!
3511620	3511840	Okay.
3514403	3515463	There's other comparisons.
3515643	3517505	I see, so Peter Moore is the comparison here.
3518345	3522508	Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up.
3523969	3529192	Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.
3529532	3531053	Sega did not have a lot of money.
3531393	3534455	The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.
3536316	3540179	Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.
3540908	3543149	I'll call it Gizmondo 2.
3545031	3545951	Electric Boogaloo.
3547712	3549133	Alright, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.
3549153	3549854	Have a good night, alright?
3550154	3550714	You too, bye.
3550774	3550994	Later.
3551735	3553956	Michael Moore, head of Microsoft.
3554737	3555917	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3555937	3556338	Who's this?
3557518	3559580	Yes, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.
3559760	3560680	I haven't called in a while.
3560860	3561701	Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3562161	3562842	What's on your mind, buddy?
3564142	3566584	Okay, first off, I gotta know, does my quality suck?
3567714	3568234	You're okay.
3568274	3570655	You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.
3570715	3572935	Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.
3574095	3575276	Okay.
3575556	3580617	First off... I forgot what I was going to say.
3580837	3582177	Anyway, it's something completely different.
3583378	3588359	I remember, what was it, last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was kind of odd.
3589919	3591959	There's one I've been following.
3592039	3593900	It's actually a fan game.
3593940	3594320	It's actually...
3595117	3595997	Thanks for watching!
3615524	3618585	But you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate mobile games, right?
3618725	3620626	And I think they all are poopy.
3621046	3624488	I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.
3624828	3631071	Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic formula of Luminous.
3631371	3638074	For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors, and then sometimes the shapes are different.
3638094	3640375	They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.
3640435	3640955	It made it kind of...
3641275	3642916	feel a little bit refreshing and different.
3643236	3646618	And for cell phone, Java-type game, it actually wasn't bad.
3646678	3647838	I was kind of impressed.
3649919	3651600	Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.
3651620	3651980	I'm sorry.
3653601	3655302	I'm sure Zelda on the phone would be cool, too.
3655542	3656242	Well, is it out?
3656883	3657483	When can we get it?
3657783	3660364	Well, it's actually a second demo.
3660744	3669989	The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made for him a hangout at, oddly enough, it's called Zelda Fan Game Central, so this, gc.com.
3670751	3671932	I posted a link in chat already.
3673873	3675493	If you want to take a look at it.
3676074	3676874	Okay, second off,
3698837	3702460	Halloween was last week and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.
3702520	3703601	It is gaming related.
3704181	3706403	Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?
3707944	3708224	No.
3708344	3709385	Alright, what did you dress up as?
3709485	3709805	Tell us.
3710346	3711146	Okay.
3711847	3713928	I'm putting the links in chat.
3714869	3715630	Okay, there they are.
3716290	3717311	Alright, let me bring it up.
3718352	3719993	This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3720493	3723215	Might I remind you here.
3724196	3726678	Alright, explain the costume for the podcast listeners.
3727879	3728219	Okay.
3729042	3738288	My name, TimmanX64, kind of shows that I am a big Nintendo lover, and other people might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.
3738488	3739689	You probably already know this guy.
3740830	3741130	I do.
3742831	3747654	And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on PlayStation.
3748035	3749516	I went for the irony factor.
3749536	3752798	I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made up.
3753223	3755124	of masking tape and permanent marker.
3755224	3760226	Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the PlayStation hater.
3760386	3761267	It's a well-done logo.
3761287	3764508	Yeah, you did a pretty good job.
3764608	3766669	Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?
3766709	3768150	You went for the old-school PS logo.
3770011	3772912	Because it's the PlayStation logo.
3773712	3775493	Oh, sorry, the PlayStation logo.
3775513	3775873	My bad.
3777314	3778195	I have a PS3 on it.
3779477	3782158	Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.
3782218	3784439	We've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, though.
3784559	3784979	Have a good one.
3785019	3785779	Thanks for calling, all right?
3786780	3787080	Okay.
3787240	3787540	Later.
3788100	3789681	All right, we're going to get to some more calls.
3789741	3791782	Let's go over to this one.
3792202	3793342	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3793382	3793742	Who's this?
3794923	3795563	This is Jason.
3795863	3798264	Hi, Jason, buddy, our webmaster.
3799386	3799486	Yay!
3799506	3802408	I haven't heard any complaints, but I like to think it's working pretty well.
3802428	3806410	When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole, you know, lowered participation numbers and all this other nonsense.
3829722	3835805	and with the whole Xbox SMA Hold on a minute, buddy.
3835825	3837585	Hold on, put the car apart for a minute there, buddy.
3837886	3842868	Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number is doing so great and the quality of his call right now is kind of crappy?
3843188	3846009	Like we're hearing a lot of breakup in there.
3847049	3847930	Just the irony factor.
3847970	3848630	Sorry, Jason.
3849711	3850731	I don't know what else to tell you.
3851271	3854213	So E3, yeah?
3854393	3857514	E3 and the whole lower participation amongst independent developers
3858856	3863119	No, Lorde participation in general and not just in general masses.
3864240	3875909	But XNA, Xbox, Microsoft's XNA, the development suite, can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.
3877450	3883335	So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work with the XNA?
3885037	3887740	XMA is a launching point.
3888041	3890164	You can go so much further beyond there.
3892367	3895011	If you bring together independent developers and publishers...
3895829	3897250	Do I really have to go further than that?
3920442	3949447	underground media a little more than any other company so I'll give them credit for that if anyone were to do this it would probably be them and the fact of how much that can help them in general in XBL in the next couple of years this whole generation is going to be a really big difference it's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out it would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof I definitely agree Jason the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality I'm so sorry we love you anyway
3951548	3952849	We love you Jason, have a good one.
3978959	3980180	Hey, it's DMN.
3980600	3981881	No, really, it's Ranma.
3982242	3983163	Hi, DMN Ranma.
3983183	3983703	What's on your mind?
3984744	3985284	Not much.
3985464	3987166	I have a quick question for Loki.
3988627	3990248	Let me see if he's paying attention.
3990329	3991510	Loki, are you paying attention?
3991790	3991890	Yes.
3991910	3992891	Loki, boobs.
3993191	3994212	Boobs, Loki, boobs.
3994632	3995573	Yeah, what's on your mind?
3996314	3996794	What's on your mind?
3997534	4000275	All right, Loki, have you heard anything about Halo 3?
4000696	4007900	Because a friend of mine works for GameStop, he just told me last week that Microsoft, the press release that's coming out on November 2007.
4008080	4010321	Have you heard anything new since that?
4011021	4012062	No, I haven't heard anything new.
4012102	4013843	We still have the date as March.
4014463	4016885	Has that press release actually come out anywhere?
4017565	4018265	No, it has not.
4018405	4019826	I have told my friend that.
4020326	4023168	So your friend who works at this random GameStop...
4023644	4026626	It happens to know the inner workings at Microsoft and what they're developing.
4028067	4031809	You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the GameStop employees?
4032610	4034951	I'm thinking we got Exhibit A right here.
4036072	4039854	Look, Loki might be dead fucking wrong, and you might be right.
4040834	4042075	Your GameStop kid might be right.
4042115	4042636	It's November 07.
4043556	4048939	But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft, and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a press release right now.
4049440	4049720	Please.
4050777	4052478	I trust Loki more than I do GameStop.
4052738	4060362	Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going to be in the holiday.
4060702	4062343	It's going to be the November title.
4062923	4064584	That would be my guess right there because...
4065140	4066521	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4091989	4092829	I'm still saying March.
4121300	4122261	Until I hear otherwise.
4123682	4124462	I have a question for you.
4124482	4125083	I think so too.
4125843	4127064	I mean, because I asked him.
4128105	4129346	Wait, DarkSakura has a question for you.
4129366	4129606	No, no, no.
4129626	4130747	Go ahead and finish what you were saying.
4133348	4136951	Well, I was saying to him, well, this is an actual press release.
4136971	4138952	Don't you think somebody would have leaked it by now?
4139032	4140273	Because I had asked him for proof.
4140293	4143435	He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.
4143715	4147978	And I've been checking.
4148379	4148899	Nothing about it.
4148939	4150480	So I think it's just all smoke and
4152023	4155266	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4174600	4186203	November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system when we don't have a release date because it's easy to enter in when you're entering items into a database.
4187764	4188684	Sorry, I picked up another call.
4192685	4193505	Damn that feedback.
4193745	4194525	Alright, finish your thought.
4194545	4195846	I won't pick up another call until you're ready.
4196266	4198226	Anyway, so that would be a default date.
4198266	4201707	So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.
4204298	4205558	Shadow Next Gen Halo 3 I agree with Loki
4234048	4234388	And why?
4234508	4241451	Because that would also be when basically the quote-unquote real launch of the PlayStation 3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.
4242851	4245352	So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.
4247033	4256536	Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said it, or somebody was rumored that Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.
4257377	4258237	Yes, exactly.
4258317	4259418	Took the words right out of my mouth.
4260358	4263199	So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be when it is.
4263559	4271942	So in a way, maybe that kind of happens, where maybe it goes up against the Euro launch, or as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.
4271982	4273923	That's kind of an interesting perspective.
4276084	4281666	And also, at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo, and it sucked.
4283506	4284587	Did you play Johnny Whatever?
4285607	4287988	I didn't get to play anything, because they were all broken.
4289093	4294578	I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had a bunch on display and nothing.
4296259	4296940	What, Drew Nami?
4298021	4299762	Did you wash your hands after touching them?
4300763	4303165	Yeah.
4303365	4306207	I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.
4306247	4312953	I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those controllers.
4313073	4313573	Anyway, sorry.
4314934	4316916	Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii
4317475	4318576	My GameStop had a key off.
4318956	4319876	And what did you think of the Wii?
4320977	4323338	And I thought it was very awesome.
4323378	4324239	It was very awesome.
4324279	4324999	What games did you play?
4326380	4333583	I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the Photo Channel and the Mii Channel, things like that.
4334304	4338146	You know, I had some friends get... One of my friends posted on LiveJournal about this.
4338446	4341507	They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.
4342448	4343588	I'm like, you stupids.
4343628	4343828	Really?
4346698	4349800	Apparently the guy came up behind him and was like, you can't do that, you know, that whole thing.
4349820	4351540	I'm like, you guys are hella dumb.
4352021	4352281	Anyway.
4353641	4358064	Yeah, and it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.
4358484	4359805	Ah, where are you going to go camp out at?
4361125	4361425	Nowhere.
4361485	4362766	I have a pre-order at GameStop.
4363266	4363987	Well, look at you go.
4364127	4365067	Well, congratulations.
4365087	4366828	You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?
4367989	4370270	Yeah, well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.
4370710	4371010	All right.
4371390	4372451	Well, until then, have a good week.
4372471	4373091	Thanks for your call.
4373111	4373571	All right, buddy?
4374452	4374952	Yeah, thanks.
4375192	4375412	All right.
4375452	4376113	Good luck with the Wii.
4376173	4376493	Have fun.
4377625	4380126	Alright, I'm going to try this caller again.
4381266	4382627	This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.
4382707	4383707	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4385488	4386789	This is Did You Lose a Sock.
4387049	4388469	Hi, Did You Lose a Sock.
4389029	4390250	We're getting a little feedback.
4392451	4393431	Is that better?
4393891	4394512	A little bit, yes.
4394532	4397133	What's on your mind?
4397693	4398753	Which is a better game?
4399273	4401814	Fears of Wars or Viva Pinata?
4403135	4405316	I can't say because I haven't played Viva Pinata.
4406584	4410507	Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?
4412208	4417152	I didn't even hear that.
4417172	4421636	Do I think Viva Pinata promotes violence against... Sorry, did you lose the sock?
4421716	4423898	I can't deal with the feedback going on right now.
4426339	4429062	Viva Pinata promotes violence against animals?
4429462	4430883	I think it promotes gay bashing.
4430903	4433545	It promotes violence against flamboyant animals.
4435086	4435827	That's not cool.
4436417	4440199	I'm going to write to GLAAD, tell them to ban Viva Pinata.
4440659	4441239	One more call.
4441959	4443580	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
4445141	4446741	Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.
4446761	4448122	Hi, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?
4450443	4462348	I was just thinking, a while ago I was watching this thing, and it was somebody at Microsoft, I want to say Peter Moore.
4464328	4465909	Ah yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah?
4467686	4470067	This has been the most competitive cycle yet.
4470087	4470927	Did you...
4495791	4499594	Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?
4502416	4507580	It was... Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony.
4507620	4509781	They didn't want to attack Nintendo.
4509921	4512923	I don't know.
4514184	4517467	But it's just this cycle is so...
4519640	4522302	I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.
4522622	4524884	I don't remember that.
4536593	4536953	I don't know.
4537514	4553723	In all seriousness, since this was just recently campaign season, it kind of reminds me of campaign season where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight and we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.
4554004	4558506	And then suddenly a month later, Drew Nami is running for Congress.
4558546	4562609	And did you know when he was younger, he really liked candy.
4564790	4566291	Do not elect Drew Nami.
4566892	4568833	paid for by Rob Roberts for President Campaign.
4568873	4571235	You know, like, you see all those negative ads all over.
4571375	4572876	So, I don't know.
4573817	4578580	They always start off like, oh, hey, yeah, it's going to be a clean fight because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.
4578620	4581862	But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.
4584864	4585764	Yeah, I know what you mean.
4586325	4586585	All right.
4587466	4588206	I know what I mean, too.
4588626	4590548	All right, no, thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent.
4590568	4591008	We appreciate it.
4591028	4592169	Anything else you want to say to our listeners?
4594410	4595611	Um, no, not really.
4596129	4597209	Alright, well have a good one.
4597930	4602611	Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.
4604592	4605992	Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.
4606712	4607793	Alright, have fun with your Wii.
4608733	4608993	Alright.
4610974	4613494	Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight.
4613534	4614215	We appreciate it.
4615275	4619716	And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.
4619776	4621737	Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?
4623522	4635749	Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan-made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool, but it is fan-made, so just so that nobody freaks out.
4636869	4641311	I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.
4641351	4644493	Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.
4645148	4650813	The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.
4650933	4653896	So you guys won't have to wait for much longer.
4653996	4655757	Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.
4656958	4659000	I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.
4660321	4661562	Your free time's almost up.
4662483	4665526	So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.
4666587	4671171	Start off here with Saints of Rokideen, an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.
4671910	4673852	Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Bros., Ice, Hockey, Soccer
4695489	4702531	Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
4715856	4721398	Of course, there was some estimates on the PlayStation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.
4721799	4732063	Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3, and they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the PlayStation 3 launch.
4733004	4733864	That's a lot of money.
4734824	4736545	Oh, it's Toad's Turnpike.
4736585	4738566	I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.
4738766	4739266	Sorry.
4739666	4740167	Anyways...
4741994	4752202	You might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entis of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how that there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.
4752242	4764832	Well, he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the PlayStation 3, but in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.
4764893	4766113	It's all about physics.
4767354	4768836	Did he see the same trailer I did?
4770077	4770617	He's an idiot.
4771498	4771578	Um,
4774014	4778257	There was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W.S.
4778537	4781099	Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.
4781659	4782800	Yeah, it looked very boring.
4783680	4785801	Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!
4787202	4799449	Now, anyways, we know that, of course, November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Sneak King, which I'm sure... Most anticipated games of the year.
4799789	4802411	Yes, but that's not where it stops.
4803318	4811004	In fact, Kellogg's, Serial, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.
4811644	4818829	Apparently, you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.
4818849	4820070	Fruit Loops the game!
4821911	4823312	So that's kind of interesting.
4824153	4830618	As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well, they have PTV for...
4831581	4833222	Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!
4833242	4840665	The last bit of information, of course, comes for the PlayStation 3 and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.
4859545	4860185	Scoop King
4887313	4888314	Poop Scoop King.
4891097	4892318	What else can we put in the cereal?
4893719	4899845	On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar-coated cereal and end the program.
4900525	4903468	This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
4904749	4907191	Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight.
4907211	4907932	What's your final thought?
4909213	4909894	Pie.
4912711	4919917	and Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun and I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.
4920458	4921839	Any final thoughts for our listeners?
4922759	4924281	War is over, if you want it.
4925442	4926242	Aw, I like that.
4926983	4927263	Loki?
4928484	4931306	My final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.
4932688	4935530	Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.
4937492	4938893	My final thought is reject False Icons.
4944671	4947311	I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.
4947531	4948772	And a heart.
4949092	4950972	No, my final thought is I heart you, Jamie.
4951052	4954553	Heart, heart, heart, love, love.
4957694	4958894	Your final thought, DarkSakura.
4964995	4965315	Rawr.
4966316	4966796	Gwar?
4966996	4967576	I love gwar.
4967616	4968036	Rawr!
4971838	4972838	Shut up, okay?
4973319	4973639	You!
4974259	4977800	No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Junami.
4977820	4979341	You have to go make them in the bathroom.
4980481	4981942	He said I was holding a grudge.
4982562	4983782	I'll show you a grudge.
4983842	4985063	I'll beat you with a ferret.
4987084	4989945	Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4998068	4998668	Have a great week.
4998688	4999368	Hey, next week,
4999793	5001714	and Crazy System Launches.
5002595	5007878	John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us.
5007958	5014102	And since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their Excite Truck on.
5014182	5021847	So it's sure to be a clusterfuck event, which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.
5021887	5024068	Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.
5024088	5025249	We'll talk more about that next week.
5025689	5028611	Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
