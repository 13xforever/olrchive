00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:01,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:15,436 --> 00:00:19,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,181
[SPEAKER_12]: This is episode number 207.

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,863
[SPEAKER_12]: And let's get right back into it.

6
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:27,404
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got more gaming news for you guys.

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.

8
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:38,311
[SPEAKER_12]: The much-anticipated Fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st, just like it was speculated last week.

9
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,532
[SPEAKER_12]: We talked about that on this program.

10
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:40,213
[SPEAKER_12]: And...

11
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:45,064
[SPEAKER_12]: What's interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.

12
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:55,916
[SPEAKER_12]: And when we say brick the console, that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three red lights of Doom to appear, and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that cannot play games.

13
00:00:56,336 --> 00:01:00,838
[SPEAKER_12]: It was said, though, that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.

14
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:11,163
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know we had a listener, I want to say it was Alex, who was in our chat room earlier, saying he was one of the lucky less than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money to fix it.

15
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,095
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm thinking, that is messed up.

16
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,135
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not what I read.

17
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:18,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I read people were actually being able to send them back, but that's pretty fucked up if they wanted money.

18
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:21,099
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,201
[SPEAKER_12]: The official quote from Microsoft did come from this.

20
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,823
[SPEAKER_12]: We are hearing from a small number of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with the fall console update.

21
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.

22
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:33,406
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll let you know when the issue is resolved.

23
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:37,008
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're having problems with the update for any reason, please call Xbox Support.

24
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:42,449
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working with those affected to get them back up and running and we're committed to making sure the update doesn't cause problems for anyone else.

25
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:46,591
[SPEAKER_12]: So don't take that $140 for an answer.

26
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:51,854
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing for you.

27
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,056
[SPEAKER_12]: They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.

28
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:56,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially since they're aware of the problem.

29
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,799
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just, there's no excuse for that.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackboy in our chatroom did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that got bricked.

31
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:06,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

32
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,751
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still a big number.

33
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's something else.

34
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,733
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to figure out how to unbrick them and fast.

35
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:16,013
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.

36
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:16,334
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

37
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,734
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that.

38
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:21,135
[SPEAKER_12]: But I don't know the technical end of it.

39
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:25,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was.

40
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:30,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Eragon, the demo for that is available on Xbox Live.

41
00:02:30,477 --> 00:02:31,557
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 415 megabyte download.

42
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can check it out.

43
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: My problem with the book is that the book, as far as I've gotten through it, is so very poorly written.

44
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,747
[SPEAKER_06]: It reads like it was written by a 12-year-old.

45
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:48,468
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully the game is better than how poorly written the book is.

46
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,528
[SPEAKER_08]: The demo's not better at all.

47
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It's absolutely crap.

48
00:02:52,149 --> 00:02:54,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So the demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?

49
00:02:54,589 --> 00:03:01,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I'm not sure if you've played it, but if you've played Konami's King Arthur, it's about the same level of crap, and that's really bad.

50
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It's boring hack and slash.

51
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:05,896
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds pathetic.

52
00:03:05,976 --> 00:03:07,196
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know what this game is about.

53
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:26,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's a movie, but... Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that he's a dragon rider and gets pulled into all the dragon riding nonsense and everything, but... Well, to defend the writer of the book, I did hear that he did start it in his teens, but that's what beta readers are for.

54
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:27,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Use them.

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Which the entirety of the fanfiction writing community should also know that, too.

56
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:33,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um...

57
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:40,544
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see why the book got all this attention and why they're making a movie of it.

58
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:43,365
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.

59
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw them recently also.

60
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sad.

61
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,446
[SPEAKER_13]: So the game is just hack and slash?

62
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:51,667
[SPEAKER_08]: That's as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted.

63
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:53,528
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't fun.

64
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,809
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like a PS2 game and not even like a current...

65
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Generation of PS2 games.

66
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,070
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like a step back.

67
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they were all hack-and-slashy, too.

68
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,094
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

69
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:08,394
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't look that bad.

70
00:04:08,475 --> 00:04:10,976
[SPEAKER_10]: The screenshots I've seen look pretty good, but I haven't played the demo yet.

71
00:04:10,996 --> 00:04:11,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Screenshots aren't playing.

72
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:13,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, snap.

73
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:14,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, no.

74
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, anyways.

75
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:23,462
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually NVIDIA's big game for, um... Well, actually, no, I guess Fury would be the big game for November.

76
00:04:24,202 --> 00:04:25,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Anywho, um...

77
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:29,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So that fall update for the 360, it did some good.

78
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:42,089
[SPEAKER_10]: And what that would be is actually, well, it's helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives modded to play backed up games.

79
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:48,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And so actually they've started banning some of these people that supposedly have modded systems.

80
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:55,014
[SPEAKER_10]: The funny part about it, though, is they're also banning some people that don't have modded systems but are saying that they are modded.

81
00:04:55,504 --> 00:05:04,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So they don't really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try to stop some of those people from pirating stuff.

82
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:06,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Because pirating is bad.

83
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally.

84
00:05:09,398 --> 00:05:10,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel so weird saying that.

85
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:20,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably be downloading anytime soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.

86
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Some brand new maps came out for free if you're an Xbox Live Gold member.

87
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:26,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm, interesting.

88
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Another perk about being a Gold member.

89
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,048
[SPEAKER_12]: You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this.

90
00:05:32,369 --> 00:05:35,731
[SPEAKER_12]: They are updated version of GoldenEye 64 maps.

91
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:40,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Facility and Temple, those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.

92
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:40,755
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.

93
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,521
[SPEAKER_12]: if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

94
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I sold my Perfect Dark Zero because I didn't like it.

95
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:46,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I just couldn't get into it.

96
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,282
[SPEAKER_10]: It felt weird.

97
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:52,483
[SPEAKER_10]: No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.

98
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:54,983
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my opinion.

99
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,964
[SPEAKER_06]: But GoldenEye was a good game.

100
00:05:59,024 --> 00:05:59,304
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

101
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:00,224
[SPEAKER_12]: I still play Doom.

102
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:01,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And GoldenEye was good.

103
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:06,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.

104
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:06,605
[SPEAKER_12]: At all.

105
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:07,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

106
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:08,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

107
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,326
[SPEAKER_12]: It just wasn't good for me.

108
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,761
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkTetsuya is happy.

109
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,221
[SPEAKER_12]: He says Facility was awesome.

110
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.

111
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:18,544
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what they need?

112
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:19,124
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

113
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:21,825
[SPEAKER_10]: They need to put out a goddamn TimeSplitters game.

114
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,286
[SPEAKER_10]: That was awesome.

115
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:24,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Make your own maps.

116
00:06:25,207 --> 00:06:33,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at any rate, there's been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.

117
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:40,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, there is Ninja Ball, which is basically carrying a ball around.

118
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:44,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Tank Flag, where a tank carries the flag.

119
00:06:44,967 --> 00:06:50,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And Elimination, on that one you're supposed to kill off five opposing team members.

120
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,232
[SPEAKER_06]: With a 16 player limit.

121
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:56,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They also mention more about the Spartan Laser.

122
00:06:57,936 --> 00:07:06,622
[SPEAKER_06]: It's saying that the weapons application will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.

123
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,505
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's sort of like lock targeting computer fire.

124
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:39,019
[SPEAKER_06]: the man cannon funny it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles in looping arcs over the battlefield and there's also saying that they'll be able to fire or you can be shot down while you're in air there's also with the warthog and ghost vehicles they are going to control similarly to how they do in Halo 2 um

125
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:45,316
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're not saying what the X button is going to be used for.

126
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,858
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a secret.

127
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:51,460
[SPEAKER_10]: The rumor for the X button was steel weapons.

128
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Because apparently you're going to be carrying your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.

129
00:07:59,524 --> 00:08:03,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, to stop people who whore certain weapons during the whole game?

130
00:08:03,546 --> 00:08:04,447
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be interesting.

131
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:08,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've heard that you're going to be able to see the weapons on people.

132
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:09,530
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.

133
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting.

134
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:11,508
[SPEAKER_12]: That is kind of cool.

135
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:20,312
[SPEAKER_12]: By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in a first-person shooter, JeremyTodd1 says, In Gears of War, you can't jump, and that's one of the best games coming out.

136
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:23,133
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a little stupid.

137
00:08:25,053 --> 00:08:25,434
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

138
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:30,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Even if it has high production values, it's still retarded that you cannot jump.

139
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:32,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, come on now.

140
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:33,216
[SPEAKER_10]: We're in the next gen.

141
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,978
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to have jumping technology.

142
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:37,178
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we need.

143
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:47,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Anywho, so some things that are also ridiculous out there is, and we talk about this every week, it's not a huge surprise.

144
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:51,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Another EA game comes out and, you know, more microtransactions.

145
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:56,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.

146
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:06,487
[SPEAKER_10]: One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours the collector's edition.

147
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can get the extra cars.

148
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:10,740
[SPEAKER_10]: and whatnot, extra tracks.

149
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,444
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, they're going to have some unlockables that you can buy.

150
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:23,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much the same deal as all the other EA games that they've been charging microtransactions for.

151
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:27,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is just going to be something that we're going to see going forward, I'm thinking.

152
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you don't like them, don't buy them.

153
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:30,414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I say.

154
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:32,055
[SPEAKER_12]: That's exactly what it boils down to.

155
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:33,476
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't like this, don't buy it.

156
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,537
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't encourage other people to buy it either.

157
00:09:36,198 --> 00:09:36,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

158
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,059
[SPEAKER_12]: It's time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.

159
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,379
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

160
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,500
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be cool sometimes.

161
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,281
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, new maps, new songs.

162
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:44,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's kind of neat, but...

163
00:09:44,972 --> 00:09:47,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about this whole buying something that you're going to get in the game later.

164
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:52,179
[SPEAKER_12]: And doesn't that just seem... I still can't get over the whole thing that we talked about.

165
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:59,045
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.

166
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,406
[SPEAKER_12]: That just seems... I don't know.

167
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:04,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes to get through their games, and that's how they want to do it.

168
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,891
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's how they have fun doing it.

169
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:08,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially in a sandbox game, you know, maybe they don't want the challenge.

170
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,155
[SPEAKER_12]: They just want to have fun going around and blowing people up.

171
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:10,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I...

172
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans.

173
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:15,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Just put in all the cheat codes and just ran around and blew things up.

174
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:16,117
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's fun.

175
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,738
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not talking about you, actually, although you probably did this, too.

176
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:20,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

177
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,559
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't know.

178
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,701
[SPEAKER_12]: It just kind of seems like it's taking advantage of those people.

179
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's taking candy from a baby.

180
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:34,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row at lunch because we're not actually saving the game or doing any progress.

181
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,266
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just running around blowing shit up.

182
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,267
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's how we spend our lunches.

183
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:39,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know,

184
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Saints Row is very much like Grand Theft Auto.

185
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:19,058
[SPEAKER_06]: The week goes towards the Jehovah's Witness that knocked on the door to Kristen's house before I left today.

186
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:26,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hiding behind the corner because I know I'm going to have choice words for this one.

187
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:31,145
[SPEAKER_06]: But she's like, she's coming to the door and Kristen's like, Hi, can I help you?

188
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:35,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, Oh, I have very important information for you.

189
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:40,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your own personal copy of things to help you understand what's going on in the world.

190
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:42,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this religious?

191
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:43,906
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's from the Bible!

192
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:46,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me!

193
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:58,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she proceeds to go on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian or believes in God or anything like that.

194
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:06,617
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, first of all, the woman tries to lie about her purpose for being there, which is very unchristian-like.

195
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:09,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Then again, we've had this for centuries.

196
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the Crusades, the Witch Hunts, how about that?

197
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:19,831
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference.

198
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:29,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is, is that you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing that you do.

199
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work.

200
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:35,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, I'm like, and Kristen's like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!

201
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,859
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, shh.

202
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,960
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I said, okay, here's my take on this.

203
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,061
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bible was written by human beings.

204
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:45,501
[SPEAKER_06]: God did not write it.

205
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,822
[SPEAKER_06]: God told them what to put in it.

206
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:51,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, when God comes to Earth and says, here's a book that I wrote by myself.

207
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:52,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you like it.

208
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I will take the Bible literally.

209
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I said, thank you very much, goodbye, and shut the door.

210
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:06,447
[SPEAKER_06]: She gave me this look like, utter disbelief, like, oh my God, nobody's ever pointed that out to me before.

211
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:09,208
[SPEAKER_06]: and turned around and left in stunned silence.

212
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I could say was, oh my god, I'm so hardcore.

213
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:23,696
[SPEAKER_12]: This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico and remember Prop 22 here in California, which was the one that said they were going to write marriage is only between a man and a woman in the state constitution or whatever, right?

214
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:31,240
[SPEAKER_12]: And this woman came to my door and was like, yes, I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.

215
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,683
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?

216
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:36,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm like,

217
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:39,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Honey, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.

218
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:39,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And she did.

219
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,281
[SPEAKER_12]: But she was embarrassed.

220
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,241
[SPEAKER_12]: She was like, oh, oh, I see.

221
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:49,002
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, you're not going to catch it.

222
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: But run.

223
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a very open-minded person.

224
00:13:52,163 --> 00:13:53,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up Southern Baptist.

225
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:54,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, jeez.

226
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,885
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could escape that with an open mind.

227
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:57,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Me too.

228
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:58,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

229
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could escape growing up Southern Baptist in Alabama with an open mind, then I'm fairly tolerant.

230
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:08,108
[SPEAKER_06]: of people's religious, you know, preferences.

231
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:27,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.

232
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,562
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.

233
00:14:31,722 --> 00:14:44,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but I really, I really, I especially dislike, with any argument, anyone coming into something with a, oh, well, I just think it's because, you know, you should.

234
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:50,856
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we can kind of end on the note and say, you know, if you are totally religious, then, like, that's cool.

235
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:51,937
[SPEAKER_12]: We totally respect that.

236
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:56,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, one of my best friends is a very religious person, and I totally respect that because, you know,

237
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:57,273
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

238
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:19,876
[SPEAKER_12]: We gotta move on.

239
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:21,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, I have to read this in chat.

240
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:30,442
[SPEAKER_10]: RPGKing7 says, No, what's better is these two fairly hot Jehovah's Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, If God loves me, then you'll show me your tits.

241
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:32,244
[SPEAKER_12]: That's disgusting.

242
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:33,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on, let's keep it moving.

243
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:36,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, F you to Comcast.

244
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:45,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I upgraded to Comcast's HD service, and first off, there aren't that many channels anyways, but second off, this

245
00:15:45,996 --> 00:15:46,477
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.

246
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:10,916
[SPEAKER_12]: My F.U.

247
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:15,419
[SPEAKER_12]: goes to my taste buds because I'm constantly craving junk food all week.

248
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:16,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Like right now, I'm craving pie.

249
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:19,622
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

250
00:16:19,882 --> 00:16:20,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Miggletop, do you have anything?

251
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:23,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two short ones.

252
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing a preemptive F.U.

253
00:16:26,587 --> 00:16:35,914
[SPEAKER_08]: to Endemiro for not including Lizanka and the new Pump It Up mix that's going to be announced this month because I know it won't be there because they don't like me enough.

254
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:37,615
[SPEAKER_08]: And then F.U.

255
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:38,256
[SPEAKER_08]: to myself.

256
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:41,420
[SPEAKER_08]: for not trying to jump on Taco Bell Boy today.

257
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,480
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still really hot.

258
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Rob, I have one more.

259
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:47,261
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

260
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:51,182
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on behalf of several friends of mine.

261
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,103
[SPEAKER_06]: When... Okay, men, remember this.

262
00:16:55,744 --> 00:17:05,406
[SPEAKER_06]: If you try to hit on somebody while they're at work and say, I'm sorry, I'm a lesbian, don't say, oh, that's okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.

263
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:08,327
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want your cock pissed off.

264
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:10,256
[SPEAKER_06]: They want pussy.

265
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for that blunt explanation.

266
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:25,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to be blunt because the majority of straight men out there only think, I say majority, most that I've encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy and it's not their brain.

267
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:31,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because that is very true.

268
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:34,550
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.

269
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:36,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Men just want to watch.

270
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,000
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

271
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.

272
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:41,985
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesn't really work that way.

273
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:43,206
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not programmed for that.

274
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:43,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway.

275
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,034
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, we're getting into TMI, so let's get into some game releases.

276
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:51,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.

277
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,795
[SPEAKER_12]: In Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you guys.

278
00:17:54,875 --> 00:18:00,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Gears of War is making its way to the Xbox 360 in certain Asian regions this week, so be on the lookout for that.

279
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:07,297
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week in Japan, Area 51 is coming out.

280
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:12,098
[SPEAKER_12]: My Kinoto Hime is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2 in Japan, which...

281
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:17,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's another typical adventure game that is being put out by Sunrise.

282
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:20,553
[SPEAKER_12]: It has a limited edition entertainment as well.

283
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:29,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Okami is making its way to Japan, as well as SSX on Tour is going into the Best Hits collection for EA for the Japanese markets this week.

284
00:18:30,297 --> 00:18:36,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And going over to the Nintendo DS, Blackjack, Hino Torihen is coming out from Sega this week.

285
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And then another Sudoku game is coming out as well from Milestone.

286
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,756
[SPEAKER_12]: and we have this interesting title.

287
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:45,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see how bad I can butcher this.

288
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:46,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that Hinotori?

289
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:47,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Which one?

290
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:49,498
[SPEAKER_06]: The one you said before, Hinotori?

291
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:51,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

292
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:51,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

293
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:52,439
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no.

294
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,079
[SPEAKER_12]: It's separated.

295
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:55,340
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Hinotori-hen.

296
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that means firebird.

297
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that's what it is.

298

[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have this one as well.

299
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:01,762

[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, the U.S.

00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,291

321
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,787
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, wait, I thought Miklatov was a fan of the Winx games.

322
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:40,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I just work on them.

323
00:21:40,886 --> 00:21:42,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really a fan.

324
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:43,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:44,810

328
00:21:52,316 --> 00:21:54,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers I've ever played.

329
00:21:54,678 --> 00:21:56,299
[SPEAKER_12]: I would not be interested in it on the Advance.

330
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:05,347
[SPEAKER_10]: On the PC we've got Final Fantasy XI Vanadil Collection 2007 in case you're not a member of Final Fantasy XI yet.

335
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:21,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Another budget Activision game for you.

[SPEAKER_10]: And Blitz Elite.

337
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:24,072
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

338
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of stuff.

339
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:30,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, that's for sure.

340
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, yeah, seriously.

341
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,232
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.

342
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:40,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.

343
00:23:41,634 --> 00:23:44,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split-screen.

344
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:50,499
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, changing topics completely to something that's already out, but maybe we didn't know about that's in stores.

345
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:56,962
[SPEAKER_12]: One of our listeners, actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted.

346
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,882
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

347
00:24:21,664 --> 00:24:22,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

348
00:24:48,564 --> 00:25:02,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's interesting about this is that, you know, some folks have also been bringing up, well, this is a way for maybe folks who can't really afford the whole system and the more expensive game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of the game telling them they suck.

349
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:03,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

350
00:25:03,612 --> 00:25:12,437
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, if you don't have a dance mat and you don't have the game, dropping $70 or, you know, $49.99 or whatever for the game and dance mats a little much.

351
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know, maybe $20 for a DVD.

352
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:17,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so bad.

353
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm kind of surprised it's not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry Shortcake DDR or what have you.

354
00:25:25,302 --> 00:25:28,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So, well, we'll see.

355
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:34,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, this guy, El Mullitz, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with the Internet.

356
00:25:34,704 --> 00:25:40,306
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura surfs the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with all of you guys.

357
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's called the Website of the Week.

358
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And DarkSakura is going to tell you what her browser is looking at right now.

359
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:58,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the website of the week after lots of looking is thecatsite.com.

360
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's a site all about cats and how to take care of them.

361
00:26:03,002 --> 00:26:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: It has things about kittens.

362
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:15,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior, hairball care.

363
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:18,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I recommend going to thecatsite.com.

364
00:26:18,548 --> 00:26:19,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have a cat.

365
00:26:20,276 --> 00:26:23,979
[SPEAKER_06]: There is Shermie, and Shermie has benefited from this site.

366
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:32,507
[SPEAKER_12]: So go to thecatsite.com I have to admit, I prefer dailykitten.com for my cat needs, my cat-loving needs.

367
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.

368
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Or stuffonmycat.com I've already done stuff on my cat, remember?

369
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:40,854
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right, you did, a long time ago.

370
00:26:41,554 --> 00:26:43,016
[SPEAKER_10]: They need stuffonmybaby.com

371
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,366
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that'd be funny, because people put weird things on their babies.

372
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:50,787
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you should encourage that.

373
00:26:52,688 --> 00:26:53,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there one already?

374
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:55,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm worried I'm going to get porn or something.

375
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's try this.

376
00:26:56,511 --> 00:27:09,319
[SPEAKER_12]: www.stuffonmybaby.com Oh, this page is parked free, courtesy of godaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.

377
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,181
[SPEAKER_12]: How nice.

378
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:13,382
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

379
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:19,499
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess there's no stuff on my baby yet, but GoDaddy says there's one coming soon, as soon as someone buys the domain from him.

380
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm telling you, the stuff on my cat, you know, the new stuff on my baby, because people dress up their kids really stupidly.

381
00:27:24,762 --> 00:27:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a stuff on my cat calendar now.

382
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:30,144
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, how about stuff on my politician?

383
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:33,165
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.

384
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:42,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign commercial going on, and it's basically, he's this ultra-conservative guy,

385
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:49,149
[SPEAKER_12]: and he's bragging about his support of video game violence initiatives.

386
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:51,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Taking a stand against video game violence.

387
00:27:51,811 --> 00:28:02,778
[SPEAKER_12]: But what should be noted about this commercial that Game Politics points out is that in the commercial Santorum delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers towards the end of the commercial an elbow.

388
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:04,980
[SPEAKER_12]: He elbows this wrestler in the face.

389
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,863
[SPEAKER_12]: So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence and then he

390
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,270
[SPEAKER_12]: is violent against a wrestler in the commercial.

391
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Hypocrite much?

392
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:19,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

393
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:20,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm liking this guy.

394
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:22,253
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's this guy's platform.

395
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:24,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

396
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:25,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So why simulate it when you can go do it?

397
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:28,255
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what the conservatives want?

398
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:33,236
[SPEAKER_06]: They want you to put down the video games and they want you to go fight in the real war.

399
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:39,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, it's hard to... It's kind of not just conservatives in my mind.

400
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:41,246
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of, you know, because it was Hillary Clinton's thing, too.

401
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:42,506
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of all across the board.

402
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:47,688
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what party they're with.

403
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:51,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So, we need to re-educate them by voting them out of office.

404
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:57,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you're over the age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator...

405
00:28:58,151 --> 00:29:03,837
[SPEAKER_12]: is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation that's not going to go through or anything.

406
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:04,738
[SPEAKER_12]: So do your research.

407
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:06,019
[SPEAKER_12]: Election Day is coming up.

408
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's actually... I want to change my website.

409
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:09,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

410
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:12,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this one... Wait, wait.

411
00:29:12,505 --> 00:29:14,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we need the... We don't need the music again.

412
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:15,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you sure?

413
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:16,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure.

414
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:17,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sure you're sure?

415
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, fine.

416
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:27,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to verify the name of the site because I've been there before.

417
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:31,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like votesmart.com or smartvote or something like that.

418
00:29:32,901 --> 00:29:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.

419
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:38,285
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays.

420
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:42,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Election Day will have already passed, so maybe it's kind of a move point now.

421
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we should have done this story in part A. Oops.

422
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well.

423
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:49,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at any rate, people should be going there anyway.

424
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:50,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

425
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:56,648
[SPEAKER_12]: Alex in our chatroom says, I nominate Rob for the Gamers Party ticket with Jamie as his vice president.

426
00:29:57,308 --> 00:29:58,848
[SPEAKER_12]: That's nice, except I'm not 35.

427
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Almost, but not quite.

428
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.

429
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:17,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded consoles, but it's also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.

430
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:40,821
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.

431
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:42,442
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

432
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:16,748
[SPEAKER_10]: and then of course certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile locked and only on those profiles can you play them so people are cheating that as well.

433
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:25,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting but I'm sure people are going to find a way around it because they always do.

434
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,371
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places.

435
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:33,572
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

436
00:32:01,465 --> 00:32:05,346
[SPEAKER_12]: and they've got sponsors including Nintendo, Microsoft and Ubisoft.

437
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:14,328
[SPEAKER_12]: The website says Arcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.

438
00:32:14,888 --> 00:32:16,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that mean everyone's getting high?

439
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:16,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

440
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:25,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days and there is a service fee with that though so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian.

441
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:26,251
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about $22 US by the way.

442
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:36,205
[SPEAKER_12]: and Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.

443
00:32:37,325 --> 00:32:37,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Have fun.

444
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:48,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.

445
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:51,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, they're bringing in virtual taxation.

446
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:55,748
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you've earned money, you have to pay taxes, so they are...

447
00:32:56,636 --> 00:33:13,927
[SPEAKER_06]: For anyone doing profits online or playing games like Second Life and World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says, if you're getting a monetary benefit, then it's not treated any differently.

448
00:33:13,987 --> 00:33:14,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Normal rules apply.

449
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:19,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working 9 to 5 in an office.

450
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:25,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically for anyone who earns money via their...

451
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:29,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Internet Addictions, then you're going to get taxed.

452
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's where I have a problem with this.

453
00:33:32,085 --> 00:33:36,308
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses.

454
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:40,230
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want, you know, restitution for that.

455
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:41,651
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I think would be fair.

456
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:44,133
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to go one way, you got to do both.

457
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:47,875
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't have, you know, the cake without paying the money.

458
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:48,535
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

459
00:33:48,775 --> 00:33:49,516
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a bad analogy.

460
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:50,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

461
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I had nothing.

462
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:53,445
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

463
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:30,751
[SPEAKER_10]: and unfortunately none of those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except for maybe the pink one which looks stupid and yeah should you spend your money on this?

464
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:46,157
[SPEAKER_10]: probably not if you already have one but if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP then now's the time I don't know hooray I want a pink PSP not

465
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:52,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, would you buy a... Wait, you're the... Miklatov's the one that's the color whore when it comes to systems.

466
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:58,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you've totally, like, taken systems back and traded it just to get, like, a blue DS and stuff.

467
00:34:58,474 --> 00:34:58,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

468
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:01,076
[SPEAKER_12]: So, any of these new color PSPs interest you?

469
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:01,996
[SPEAKER_12]: The blue one.

470
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:02,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

471
00:35:02,897 --> 00:35:05,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly really want it.

472
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:09,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw the picture and I was like, wow, it's a blue PSP.

473
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I need it back.

474
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:14,042
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was at YaliCon, there was...

475
00:35:15,174 --> 00:35:18,115
[SPEAKER_06]: There were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing a different color DS.

476
00:35:19,436 --> 00:35:20,036
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cute.

477
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:23,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a pink GBA.

478
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,239
[SPEAKER_10]: For like $20 you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.

479
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:30,040
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.

480
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:34,442
[SPEAKER_10]: You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.

481
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:37,003
[SPEAKER_10]: They're available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.

482
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:40,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.

483
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,549
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what I thought was interesting is that I was at the mall today and I didn't notice how many, like, freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to, like, pip my iPod.

484
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:58,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, they had all these, you know, places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever the little encasings they have that, you know, you can put Spongebob on your iPod and stuff and, you know, you can pretty much do the same thing with a PSP.

485
00:35:58,661 --> 00:35:59,482
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I haven't seen this year?

486
00:35:59,702 --> 00:35:59,902
[SPEAKER_12]: What?

487
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,324
[SPEAKER_10]: The knockoff Nintendos.

488
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:02,679
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

489
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:37,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Supposedly, it's going to launch around November 22nd, and 1,100 hours of video would be available to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.

490
00:36:37,517 --> 00:36:46,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period, and purchases would be from $10 to $15, very similar to Pay-Per-View and iTunes.

491
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:53,283
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I'd buy this, though, because to me, this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player if they're going to move this direction.

492
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily, because you can still get

493
00:36:57,473 --> 00:37:00,135
[SPEAKER_10]: You're only going to have so much room on your hard drive to fit movies.

494
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:01,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the other thing.

495
00:37:01,256 --> 00:37:02,237
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no room.

496
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:05,999
[SPEAKER_10]: How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20 gigabyte drive?

497
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:06,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't know.

498
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,861
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the other thing, too.

499
00:37:08,321 --> 00:37:12,944
[SPEAKER_10]: The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it.

500
00:37:13,084 --> 00:37:15,706
[SPEAKER_10]: So they could do this if they wanted to.

501
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:18,168
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the things that they just added.

502
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:19,809
[SPEAKER_10]: So it kind of seems a little...

503
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:29,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, coincidental if they're going to be implementing this pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.

504
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:32,291
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

505
00:37:33,612 --> 00:37:35,593
[SPEAKER_12]: It just seems a little soon for this.

506
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,756
[SPEAKER_12]: I still think you're kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.

507
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:43,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they've got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and the PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution stuff.

508
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,320
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

509
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,243
[SPEAKER_12]: DMN in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late 90s.

510
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:50,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, because you can buy them.

511
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's a bigger hard drive is what they're going to have to do.

512
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:54,561
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you going to do when you're done with a movie?

513
00:37:54,601 --> 00:37:57,663
[SPEAKER_12]: You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and it's still yours?

514
00:37:57,683 --> 00:37:59,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm thinking the drives are not big enough.

515
00:37:59,865 --> 00:38:00,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

516
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:08,612
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that there's a 60 gig thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.

517
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:09,413
[SPEAKER_12]: You know?

518
00:38:09,573 --> 00:38:09,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

519
00:38:10,494 --> 00:38:11,114
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't make sense.

520
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Justin thinks they can stream the movies.

521
00:38:15,658 --> 00:38:18,080
[SPEAKER_12]: They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.

522
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:19,072
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

523
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: That wouldn't necessarily work depending on how bad your service is.

524
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:24,620
[SPEAKER_12]: It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.

525
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:25,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

526
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, Bandit wants to know, when does the Wizard get released for the 360?

527
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:32,391
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it would because it was a Nintendo commercial.

528
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,793
[SPEAKER_12]: So they don't want it.

529
00:38:36,392 --> 00:38:39,234
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura is going to read some of her favorite emails right now.

530
00:38:39,254 --> 00:38:39,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, um...

531
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:10,456
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got quite a number of emails, and they're all going to be read by the ferret, so here's the first one.

532
00:39:12,257 --> 00:39:12,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, never mind.

533
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:15,497
[SPEAKER_06]: First email comes from Wolf.

534
00:39:17,618 --> 00:39:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's two emails, so I'm just going to read them together, because actually I sort of am happy about one.

535
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So this goes out to Jamie.

536
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:31,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game system for two to three times the value when someone who can't enjoy it has to pay that much.

537
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:32,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

538
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:47,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe that morals are becoming slowly corroded over time, and I think somebody's gotta have them, so thank you.

539
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:50,023
[SPEAKER_06]: One for Rob.

540
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you were the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?

541
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:57,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you quit before or after the whole Chocobo raising update?

542
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:05,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI right when they did the Chocobo, but it only lasted about a month.

543
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatovka was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit really late.

544
00:40:09,983 --> 00:40:14,246
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I got Corsair to like level 14, if that, and then quit.

545
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:18,449
[SPEAKER_12]: I did get a Chocobo, and I raised it, but like not past baby stage.

546
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:19,169
[SPEAKER_12]: What was it called?

547
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my Chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.

548
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:25,854
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I quit, and now I'm... I remember you had a little Ken back in the day.

549
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:27,775
[SPEAKER_12]: That was actually my mule.

550
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,210
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

551
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:57,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, AZHP again reporting back from Stonetown's Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol dealie.

552
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.

553
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, my thoughts on the game.

554
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:09,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that I've played, but the whole American Idol thing is...

555
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:13,896
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.

556
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:20,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person because there were only a few sound bites for each judge.

557
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:25,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, since it's on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate and not in a good way.

558
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they talk, the lips don't sync up.

559
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the pitch recognition still needs work.

560
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Judges a little too harshly, just like all the previous games.

561
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,500
[SPEAKER_06]: A decent party game, but not great.

562
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not surprising.

563
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think it's not done yet either.

564
00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:41,012
[SPEAKER_06]: No, well, no, isn't it?

565
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:48,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Were they talking about the little tour they're doing?

566
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:49,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's a final build.

567
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:59,518
[SPEAKER_08]: No, so I wouldn't totally base your opinions on that build, but it's going to give you the general feel of the game at least.

568
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:05,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.

569
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:12,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kutaragi, here is a reason for the Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.

570
00:42:13,306 --> 00:42:15,667
[SPEAKER_06]: People say he's bad to the customers, eh?

571
00:42:16,187 --> 00:42:20,209
[SPEAKER_06]: He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.

572
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:27,313
[SPEAKER_06]: When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.

573
00:42:27,613 --> 00:42:29,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.

574
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:30,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought it might interest you all.

575
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:39,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah, there was a bunch of big fallout over that.

576
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there were even, I remember back in the day, didn't they have image prototypes?

577
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?

578
00:42:49,324 --> 00:42:54,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I seem to remember in, like, Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture, but, you know, this is so long ago.

579
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:55,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

580
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:25,400
[SPEAKER_06]: but that's still an interesting point one not everyone is aware of got an email from Alex it says hey OLR Alex from chat here I suspect I'm too late for mailbag 207 and or that the story I'm going to touch on hasn't come up on the show yet but oh well I'm going to talk anyway I'm pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween which it was however nobody knew how bad this update was a lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing

581
00:43:25,834 --> 00:43:27,355
[SPEAKER_06]: This is now fixed, but there's another problem.

582
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,875
[SPEAKER_06]: The update effectively bricked consoles.

583
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:37,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part A. But I thought it was... This is right at the top of this part, but that's all right.

584
00:43:37,278 --> 00:43:39,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, that listener's in chat tonight.

585
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:39,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

586
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's the same guy who said he had a bricked console.

587
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:47,602
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still think it was interesting that we've got people who do have more thoughts on that one.

588
00:43:49,749 --> 00:44:16,401
[SPEAKER_12]: it was the final comment on here that made me really think about it it's way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening good point another email comes but wait a minute though, at the same time at least the rumor or whatever is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so Sony couldn't say any longer that they're the only console that can do the true HD how well did they test it?

589
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:20,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasn't the time to be rushing things, so I'll buy into that.

590
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:23,404
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an email from Warrior Bob.

591
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:25,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Warrior Bob is cool.

592
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, I heard the discussion this last week about Konami's acquisition of the In The Groove franchise.

593
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:38,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so I'll leave my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.

594
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:42,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I did feel, however, that the situation wasn't portrayed entirely accurately.

595
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:50,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking of was Step Mania, the open source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.

596
00:44:50,681 --> 00:45:00,864
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort, although some resources are shared between the project, some code, and I believe some staff were involved in both In the Groove and Step Mania.

597
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:05,215
[SPEAKER_06]: The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.

598
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:07,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.

599
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:10,981
[SPEAKER_06]: At one point, I worked with the Stepmania team on a very small level, helped write a manual, check out the

600
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:32,262
[SPEAKER_06]: in the Groove One Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.

601
00:45:32,582 --> 00:45:35,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Small corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the next one.

602
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:44,089
[SPEAKER_12]: With all due respect, no, I meant fan tribute, and I still feel that that's how I feel the game is, is because...

603
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:51,393
[SPEAKER_12]: If you look at the folks that developed In The Groove, half of them were posters on DDR Seattle before In The Groove ever came out.

604
00:45:51,473 --> 00:46:03,421
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, maybe it wasn't called a fan tribute like Step Mania was, but in my mind, it was that fandom of DDR and, you know, they probably all met each other on this forum, you know, and stuff that caused them to make the game.

605
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:08,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end, it's all about the dollar.

606
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:09,806
[SPEAKER_06]: They did...

607
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:11,285
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

608
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:26,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Until the dollar came into play and I think Groxor stepped in and all this stuff.

609
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:32,492
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, we had Renee here last week who says she's had interaction with these folks and they're a little bit uppity.

610
00:46:32,632 --> 00:46:32,913
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

611
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:34,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to speak because I don't really know these folks.

612
00:46:34,913 --> 00:46:35,814
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will say this.

613
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:39,436
[SPEAKER_12]: I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.

614
00:46:39,516 --> 00:46:42,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Folks used to ask, what is your legal angle on this?

615
00:46:42,197 --> 00:46:43,277
[SPEAKER_12]: How is this game legal?

616
00:46:43,558 --> 00:46:45,498
[SPEAKER_12]: And they would just say, don't talk about it.

617
00:46:45,518 --> 00:46:46,359
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got it covered.

618
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:48,400
[SPEAKER_12]: And now it's kind of like, you know what?

619
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,181
[SPEAKER_12]: You got served.

620
00:46:52,452 --> 00:46:55,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?

621
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:59,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's kind of the one part I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.

622
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:02,661
[SPEAKER_12]: They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.

623
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:05,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think that the project was well-deserved.

624
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:08,546
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't take somebody else's idea and try to make money on it.

625
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:13,009
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any picture.

626
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:16,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I would feel, oh, but we love your style.

627
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't matter to me.

628
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:18,534
[SPEAKER_06]: You stole my art.

629
00:47:18,894 --> 00:47:19,635
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I would feel.

630
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:25,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, anyway, we have an email from, uh, Schwalt, uh, 120- I'm sorry, is that-

631
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm trying to look at this.

632
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this... My font is very strange on the email, so I apologize.

633
00:47:32,281 --> 00:47:33,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Schwall22.

634
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:34,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that's not... You know what?

635
00:47:34,922 --> 00:47:35,442
[SPEAKER_12]: This is funny.

636
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,642
[SPEAKER_12]: This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.

637
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:42,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?

638
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I think was the game.

639
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:44,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And now he listens to the show.

640
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,024
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of cool.

641
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:46,964
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

642
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:47,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

643
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:52,925
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just to explain, my L's and my 1's look the same in this font, so... Hey folks, love the show and the info.

644
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:55,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.

645
00:47:55,905 --> 00:48:00,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ko and ends with taku, lol.

646
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:09,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but IGN's Matt Kasamasina... Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.

647
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:11,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

648
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:33,009
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say that...

649
00:49:01,694 --> 00:49:08,000
[SPEAKER_10]: The Xbox Live Arcade does not have... You can't trade the games with other people and bring them over.

650
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:13,865
[SPEAKER_10]: You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you can't actually bring your full game with them.

651
00:49:14,105 --> 00:49:19,349
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why your profile is linked to basically your console, so you're only going to be able to download them there.

652
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:21,151
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what's interesting?

653
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:28,537
[SPEAKER_12]: I was listening to Bobby's show earlier tonight, and he was talking about... Because he just got a replacement console, and it screwed up his arcade games because...

654
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:30,403
[SPEAKER_12]: It was tied to the old console.

655
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:35,124
[SPEAKER_12]: But apparently if you're signed in, if you're the one signed in on the console and you bought the game, it will work.

656
00:49:35,685 --> 00:49:35,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

657
00:49:36,085 --> 00:49:37,025
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's how you can take it.

658
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:39,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to somebody else's house.

659
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:42,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Sign in, but it's still linked to your account.

660
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:42,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

661
00:49:42,827 --> 00:49:43,728
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have to sign in.

662
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,548
[SPEAKER_12]: If you copy the game over, it won't work for them.

663
00:49:46,509 --> 00:49:47,229
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what I'm hearing?

664
00:49:47,269 --> 00:49:48,509
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like it's going to happen over the Wii.

665
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking what you might be able to do, though, with that is you might be able to sign in your account.

666
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:57,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work.

667
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,601
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now they're saying you can't just bring your memory card over.

668
00:50:00,641 --> 00:50:02,201
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to bring the whole console with you.

669
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:03,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I don't know about that.

670
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:05,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you can probably bring your profile.

671
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:10,563
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that WiiCon is going to have... Yeah, I think the WiiCon has... Because they say that has internal storage in it.

672
00:50:10,963 --> 00:50:14,284
[SPEAKER_12]: So it certainly could have your Nintendo version of game or card in it.

673
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,364
[SPEAKER_10]: So... There's that.

674
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:19,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, what was the other thing?

675
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:22,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Vandalist in our chatroom says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.

676
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:26,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I don't think that's really going to be an issue at all.

677
00:50:28,032 --> 00:50:34,435
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as the classic controller, though, you're not going to be able to play GameCube games with that.

678
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:36,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

679
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:39,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Personally, I'd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.

680
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:48,320
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper than buying the classic controller, I would think.

681
00:50:49,721 --> 00:50:50,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially third-party ones.

682
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:51,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

683
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:57,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if we're ready to move on to the next email, we have two left

684
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This one comes from Chris.

685
00:51:00,271 --> 00:51:06,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi OLR, when my family and I were taking care of my sister's little terrier puppy Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.

686
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:11,215
[SPEAKER_06]: She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it was.

687
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:15,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.

688
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:20,618
[SPEAKER_06]: This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your show helped cheer me up.

689
00:51:21,158 --> 00:51:25,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me feel.

690
00:51:26,908 --> 00:51:30,509
[SPEAKER_06]: and how you've made my life a little happier.

691
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,850
[SPEAKER_06]: God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.

692
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow, that's amazing.

693
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:38,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

694
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:47,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry about the puppy, but I don't know what to say really.

695
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:48,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, thank you.

696
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:50,135
[SPEAKER_06]: We do our best.

697
00:51:50,155 --> 00:51:50,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Difficult.

698
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:51,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to hear it.

699
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:52,696
[SPEAKER_06]: We are crazy people.

700
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:56,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Last email comes from Mr. Wonderful.

701
00:51:57,338 --> 00:52:03,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys and gal, thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.

702
00:52:03,222 --> 00:52:05,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.

703
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:13,330
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I know that there's all the new swirling around about next gen systems and all that, and I'm still desperately hunting down a Wii order.

704
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:18,061
[SPEAKER_06]: But there seems to be a real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.

705
00:52:18,181 --> 00:52:20,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.

706
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:26,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, the import, and Contact last week, and I'm really loving both of them.

707
00:52:26,264 --> 00:52:29,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Contact's got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay.

708
00:52:30,346 --> 00:52:34,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And the instruction book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars.

709
00:52:35,148 --> 00:52:36,469
[SPEAKER_06]: And a surprising lack of emo.

710
00:52:37,623 --> 00:52:40,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

711
00:52:40,385 --> 00:52:41,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw what the new attorney looks like.

712
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:45,149
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you actually, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.

713
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:49,152
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about Phoenix Wright?

714
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:49,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

715
00:52:49,752 --> 00:52:51,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Mikhail Dov asked if we were talking about Phoenix Wright.

716
00:52:51,553 --> 00:52:51,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

717
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:53,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

718
00:52:54,616 --> 00:53:01,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Star Sign, Final Fantasy III, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52.

719
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:03,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Scourge the Hive.

720
00:53:04,343 --> 00:53:06,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?

721
00:53:07,694 --> 00:53:10,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?

722
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:12,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So what games would you guys recommend?

723
00:53:21,888 --> 00:53:23,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard really good things about Contact.

724
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:28,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually want to check out this game myself, but it's just too busy of a season for me to pick up games I don't know much about.

725
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:35,956
[SPEAKER_12]: Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love Owen Don, so I'm sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.

726
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:42,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy III looks very promising, but of course, as I've admitted in part A, I'm a whore for all things Final Fantasy.

727
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:43,061
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it is.

728
00:53:44,181 --> 00:53:46,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Final Fantasy V, too, because, you know, Game Boy Advance.

729
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:48,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And do it in the Advance port as well.

730
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:50,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Miglatov, anything you can think of there for the DS?

731
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:52,329
[SPEAKER_12]: or PSP.

732
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Luminous 2 for PSP and then you're done.

733
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,552
[SPEAKER_12]: What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?

734
00:53:59,592 --> 00:54:01,473
[SPEAKER_08]: I never played any of those, so I'll play Luminous 2.

735
00:54:01,673 --> 00:54:03,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I almost bought Work Time Fun today.

736
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:06,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good.

737
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if you're a fan of Luminous.

738
00:54:10,796 --> 00:54:13,517
[SPEAKER_10]: For PSP, Tony Hawk's Project 8.

739
00:54:13,858 --> 00:54:14,558
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be coming out.

740
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:16,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.

741
00:54:18,382 --> 00:54:20,143
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Star Sign

742
00:54:38,509 --> 00:55:06,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS and Zappy says I heard WTF is horrible I don't know I like the demo D3 it was kind of cute well honestly graphically it's a crap game but play wise the things that were in there were just so crazy and out there I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed in their spare time but it is so funny also Pokemon Ranger is coming out or actually came out right plenty of suggestions for you my friend

743
00:55:08,177 --> 00:55:10,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's not too much.

744
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:24,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Given the upcoming busy schedule I'm going to have when I start school in January, I've been trying not to get into too many handheld games because I'm not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them.

745
00:55:25,029 --> 00:55:26,651
[SPEAKER_06]: But I am getting Final Fantasy III.

746
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:28,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I've planned on that.

747
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:32,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want Children of Mana, but I'm thinking about borrowing it from my friends when she's done with it.

748
00:55:32,415 --> 00:55:34,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm definitely getting Elite Beat Agents.

749
00:55:35,237 --> 00:55:36,518
[SPEAKER_06]: That I'm definitely getting.

750
00:55:37,526 --> 00:55:38,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, am I getting it?

751
00:55:38,366 --> 00:55:42,807
[SPEAKER_12]: But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores.

752
00:55:42,947 --> 00:55:45,088
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you like your music games, I'm sure you'll like it.

753
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now though, I did just pick up the... God, I forgot the name of it again.

754
00:55:52,769 --> 00:55:53,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Surgery game.

755
00:55:53,609 --> 00:55:54,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Trauma Center.

756
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:55,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Trauma Center, yeah.

757
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I remembered Under the Knife and I was like... Oh yeah, Trauma Center.

758
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to be starting that coming up.

759
00:56:02,511 --> 00:56:03,871
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

760
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:07,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to eventually steal...

761
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:08,722
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

762
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,242
[SPEAKER_06]: To end things on a happy note, what are your guys' favorite alcoholic drinks?

763
00:56:39,722 --> 00:56:46,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I really enjoy a nice glass of divorce, 12-year scotch, and pale ales, Oktoberfest, and other tasty specialty beers.

764
00:56:47,046 --> 00:56:48,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep on rockin', Mr. Wonderful.

765
00:56:50,788 --> 00:56:52,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been getting into wine lately.

766
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, aren't I weird?

767
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,650
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting snooty.

768
00:56:57,211 --> 00:57:01,033
[SPEAKER_12]: If I feel like drinking something a little foo-foo, I'll have a lemon drop.

769
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:05,736
[SPEAKER_12]: But if I'm going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.

770
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:11,430
[SPEAKER_06]: If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios, motherfucker.

771
00:57:12,211 --> 00:57:12,952
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's called.

772
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:13,953
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I, yeah.

773
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:20,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass well tequila or I will be throwing up all over everybody.

774
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:23,784
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the one problem I have with an adios is I don't like tequila, but otherwise it's a good drink.

775
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:24,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I like good tequila.

776
00:57:25,906 --> 00:57:32,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I had actually, okay, Olive Garden has this, if you like foo-foo drinks, Olive Garden has like the tastiest mixed berry daiquiri.

777
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:35,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Sangria, that's the other thing I've been hooked on lately.

778
00:57:35,913 --> 00:57:38,415
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God, yeah, that's my ultimate foo-foo drink.

779
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:42,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say for wines, I'm a very big fan of sweet wines.

780
00:57:42,297 --> 00:57:46,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So I like Umeshu, which is a plum wine.

781
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually real plum wine with the plums in the bottom of it.

782
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:49,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so good.

783
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like Honey Runs.

784
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:56,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's elderberry honey wine.

785
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:59,307
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically a fruit mead.

786
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:02,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually drink mead at Ren Faire.

787
00:58:02,308 --> 00:58:03,649
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only time I actually have mead.

788
00:58:04,429 --> 00:58:05,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't drink until you're 21.

789
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:27,385
[SPEAKER_12]: or 19 in Canada or whatever it is.

790
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:29,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Or whatever country you're in.

791
00:58:30,788 --> 00:58:34,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.

792
00:58:34,972 --> 00:58:35,992
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's our moral thing.

793
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:37,394
[SPEAKER_12]: And we do believe this.

794
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:38,995
[SPEAKER_12]: We never drive when we drink.

795
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:40,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Always have a responsible driver.

796
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:41,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And just drink responsibly.

797
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:47,263
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't get drunk every night at home by yourself because that's

798
00:58:48,663 --> 00:58:50,084
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a sign of depression, I think.

799
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:53,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to say anything.

800
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:53,887
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

801
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:58,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.

802
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:02,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Look, as long as you're not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, that's all.

803
00:59:03,913 --> 00:59:05,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Or an NBC Monday Night movie.

804
00:59:07,115 --> 00:59:08,115
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a last minute email.

805
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:09,496
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

806
00:59:09,556 --> 00:59:13,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay.

807
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:14,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie's evil.

808
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:15,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki is stupid for hating Max.

809
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Love DMN.

810
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:17,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.

811
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:20,614
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, we didn't get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Miklatov.

812
00:59:21,174 --> 00:59:22,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?

813
00:59:24,236 --> 00:59:25,197
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't drink anymore.

814
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:25,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Why not?

815
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:35,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think, well, I won't say why it has to do with some time I shouldn't have drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.

816
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:37,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I see, I see, yes.

817
00:59:38,188 --> 00:59:45,073
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave & Buster's.

818
00:59:45,113 --> 00:59:47,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even remember what they were called, but they were so good.

819
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:48,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, chocolate martini.

820
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:50,338
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the grasshopper.

821
00:59:50,538 --> 00:59:51,138
[SPEAKER_08]: The grasshopper.

822
00:59:51,178 --> 00:59:52,399
[SPEAKER_08]: The frozen grasshopper's so good.

823
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:53,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Dave & Buster's has a really good lemon drop.

824
00:59:54,021 --> 00:59:55,022
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki, make it quick.

825
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:55,802
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to get back to games.

826
00:59:55,822 --> 00:59:56,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Screwdriver.

827
00:59:57,083 --> 00:59:57,924
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

828
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:02,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.

829
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:05,090
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe we'll get off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.

830
01:00:06,778 --> 01:00:07,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get back into some news!

831
01:00:36,147 --> 01:01:03,362
[SPEAKER_10]: A brand new SimCity game and Lord of the Rings Crisis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring And of course, some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs A brand new Road Rash game for next gen And of course, Burnout 5, it's been announced for a while now Dude, new Road Rash?

832
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:03,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah

833
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:06,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Ghost Rider Ghost Rider

834
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:37,497
[SPEAKER_06]: have not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.

835
01:01:39,577 --> 01:01:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or its parent company.

836
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,980
[SPEAKER_06]: SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.

837
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,761
[SPEAKER_06]: We recommend consumers purchase PlayStation products only from authorized SCEA retailers and resellers.

838
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:00,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a big duh anyway.

839
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:04,762
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, especially if you're dealing with something that's got a limited shipment.

840
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.

841
01:02:09,807 --> 01:02:12,776
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

842
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:13,057
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

843
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:20,616
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last-minute story because we're about to move into the Skype line and the other last-minute stories.

844
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:26,640
[SPEAKER_12]: TigerClaw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking about pre-ordering the PlayStation 3.

845
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:35,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill out pre-order forms on BestBuy.com, and it looked legit and everything.

846
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:42,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And what happened, I guess, is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders using different accounts.

847
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:44,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Very interesting.

848
01:02:45,357 --> 01:02:54,665
[SPEAKER_12]: This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the public number and were assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.

849
01:02:55,306 --> 01:03:00,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait.

850
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:03,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And everybody that tried to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.

851
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,576
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you want one from Best Buy, you've got to camp out for it.

852
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:13,132
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a new 800 number here, or actually I should say 877, or a toll-free number here at Orange Lawn Radio.

853
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:15,853
[SPEAKER_12]: And because of that reason, we've opened up our voicemails of the week again.

854
01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:20,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess word hasn't gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week.

855
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:22,657
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was pretty good, so we want to play it for you guys right now.

856
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:24,658
[SPEAKER_12]: So here it is, a voicemail of the week.

857
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:27,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, LLR, it's Paradox Benson.

858
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now on...

859
01:03:29,565 --> 01:03:33,049
[SPEAKER_03]: IndieGuru versus DDR and how fair Konami is.

860
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:35,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with DarkSakura.

861
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:36,893
[SPEAKER_03]: They just totally stole it.

862
01:03:37,254 --> 01:03:42,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that note, I just think that Session, Damani, rocked them both.

863
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,845
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I wanted to know if there's any reason...

864
01:03:47,547 --> 01:03:47,928
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

865
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:15,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, oh goody, we can play with Japanese players, but some of them can't speak English.

866
01:04:15,672 --> 01:04:17,573
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really see the point in this.

867
01:04:18,213 --> 01:04:26,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just kind of losing a bigger server base, and I really just don't see the point in this.

868
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:31,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just keep it up with the show, guys, and I'll be listening for a while.

869
01:04:31,647 --> 01:04:33,087
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week.

870
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:33,808
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate it.

871
01:04:34,068 --> 01:04:35,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Mikotov, you're a PSU whore.

872
01:04:35,508 --> 01:04:36,548
[SPEAKER_12]: What did you think of the voicemail?

873
01:04:36,568 --> 01:04:38,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So, because I've been playing Phoenix, right?

874
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:39,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Objection!

875
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:42,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're doing false testimony.

876
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:52,893
[SPEAKER_08]: If you've been following PSU for months and months, you'd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers were separate.

877
01:04:53,414 --> 01:04:57,875
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you are wrong, and you should not lie on both.

878
01:04:58,375 --> 01:04:59,695
[SPEAKER_12]: But why?

879
01:04:59,836 --> 01:05:01,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't they be on the same server?

880
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:05,364
[SPEAKER_08]: because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything.

881
01:05:05,604 --> 01:05:08,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.

882
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:09,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I always thought it was voice chat.

883
01:05:09,926 --> 01:05:12,367
[SPEAKER_13]: It came down to the fact that 360 supported voice chat within parties.

884
01:05:13,927 --> 01:05:14,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

885
01:05:15,688 --> 01:05:16,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

886
01:05:16,548 --> 01:05:18,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.

887
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:19,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Problem solved.

888
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone play on PC.

889
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:23,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, play on PC.

890
01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:24,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be playing both.

891
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:25,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to play both?

892
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:25,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing both.

893
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:26,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy hard to do.

894
01:05:27,654 --> 01:05:28,234
[SPEAKER_08]: You're crazy.

895
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:28,875
[SPEAKER_08]: You are crazy.

896
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you don't get misset in that game.

897
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:33,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't support more than one character on one system.

898
01:05:33,598 --> 01:05:34,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

899
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,602
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.

900
01:05:39,123 --> 01:05:39,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

901
01:05:39,463 --> 01:05:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, well, okay.

902
01:05:42,045 --> 01:05:42,886
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $10 a month.

903
01:05:42,966 --> 01:05:44,247
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what, two burritos?

904
01:05:44,267 --> 01:05:45,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

905
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:47,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, okay, I'll play on the PC.

906
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:52,754
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's something I can do while I'm doing my live journal or doing other stuff.

907
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,115
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I did PSO.

908
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:56,757
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can carry it around on my laptop.

909
01:05:56,857 --> 01:05:58,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.

910
01:05:58,818 --> 01:06:05,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually looking for it because if I get my iMac, I'm planning on dual formatting it so I can run Windows on my iMac.

911
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:09,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.

912
01:06:10,255 --> 01:06:16,017
[SPEAKER_12]: The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.

913
01:06:16,237 --> 01:06:19,178
[SPEAKER_12]: That's toll free in the US and Canada.

914
01:06:19,258 --> 01:06:26,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we'll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this.

915
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:31,864
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to know if you are going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3 or a Wii.

916
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:37,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you camping out for and why?

917
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:40,712
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are your plans for camping out?

918
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,213
[SPEAKER_12]: What store are you going to go to?

919
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:43,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going with a big group of friends?

920
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:45,456
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to know what your campout plans are for.

921
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:49,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Even if you're not camping out, we want to know why you're not camping out and sitting this one out.

922
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:51,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So we welcome your voicemails.

923
01:06:51,341 --> 01:06:52,882
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll play some of our favorites next week.

924
01:06:52,902 --> 01:06:53,203
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

925
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,337
[SPEAKER_12]: 1-877-426-3657.

926
01:06:57,778 --> 01:07:02,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.

927
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:08,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's that same number, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

928
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,961
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like more information on how to interact with our program, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

929
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:14,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Click on Interact With Us.

930
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:15,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to the phones.

931
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:16,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

932
01:07:16,581 --> 01:07:17,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is this?

933
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:18,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma.

934
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:19,622
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

935
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:19,962
[SPEAKER_02]: It's DMN.

936
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:21,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi DMN, what's on your mind, buddy?

937
01:07:21,723 --> 01:07:22,384
[SPEAKER_02]: DMN!

938
01:07:23,065 --> 01:07:23,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.

939
01:07:24,547 --> 01:07:31,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the weekend here, and I'd like to share my opinion of them.

940
01:07:32,018 --> 01:07:34,461
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early.

941
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:35,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you get it.

942
01:07:35,303 --> 01:07:36,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I really want it.

943
01:07:36,204 --> 01:07:37,005
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your opinion on them?

944
01:07:38,312 --> 01:07:47,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.

945
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:48,936
[SPEAKER_02]: The gameplay is exactly like Owen Don.

946
01:07:48,976 --> 01:07:50,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the same comic book feel to it.

947
01:07:52,077 --> 01:07:53,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's freaking hilarious.

948
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.

949
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:03,981
[SPEAKER_02]: The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four songs.

950
01:08:04,921 --> 01:08:05,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Avril Lavigne

951
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:40,206
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skaterboy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some lady's about to have a baby.

952
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,028
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Canned Heat?

953
01:08:43,588 --> 01:08:44,629
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that stage like?

954
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:51,194
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy at the Japanese motor company.

955
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:56,618
[SPEAKER_02]: His son goes through the rival motor company who's stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.

956
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:58,840
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes a lot of sense.

957
01:08:59,600 --> 01:08:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

958
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:00,221
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.

959
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,839
[SPEAKER_12]: What about the other game you picked up quickly?

960
01:09:02,999 --> 01:09:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical Star Sign is a very, very good RPG.

961
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend it as more so of a beginning RPG.

962
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:11,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.

963
01:09:12,002 --> 01:09:14,543
[SPEAKER_02]: My only beef with it was it felt very linear.

964
01:09:17,184 --> 01:09:18,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it said, go here, go here.

965
01:09:18,944 --> 01:09:20,765
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really make it fun.

966
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:26,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a chance to try the multiplayer mode on it, unfortunately, so I can't give any information on that.

967
01:09:27,945 --> 01:09:28,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd recommend it.

968
01:09:29,126 --> 01:09:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun RPG.

969
01:09:30,487 --> 01:09:34,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a lot of fun little blurbs of text in it.

970
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:36,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps up with the times.

971
01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:39,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I would highly recommend it.

972
01:09:41,435 --> 01:09:42,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, sounds good.

973
01:09:42,716 --> 01:09:48,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking for good DS and portable games.

974
01:09:49,802 --> 01:09:51,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?

975
01:09:54,246 --> 01:09:54,506
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

976
01:09:54,846 --> 01:09:55,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, then we're going to another call.

977
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:57,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, we'll see you pretty soon, okay?

978
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,240
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, take care.

979
01:09:58,340 --> 01:09:58,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

980
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:02,622
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we're going to go to another call here on the Skype line.

981
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:03,722
[SPEAKER_12]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

982
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:04,202
[SPEAKER_12]: That's 1-877-426-3657.

983
01:10:04,222 --> 01:10:09,024
[SPEAKER_12]: So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.

984
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:10,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

985
01:10:10,944 --> 01:10:11,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

986
01:10:11,204 --> 01:10:11,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.

987
01:10:11,725 --> 01:10:12,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Jeremy Todd 1.

988
01:10:12,265 --> 01:10:12,865
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

989
01:10:12,885 --> 01:10:12,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

990
01:10:26,127 --> 01:10:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Luminous for cell phone a couple days ago.

991
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:32,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week.

992
01:10:32,792 --> 01:10:33,173
[SPEAKER_12]: How was it?

993
01:10:34,694 --> 01:10:35,494
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty good so far.

994
01:10:35,514 --> 01:10:37,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they did a pretty good job on it.

995
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:42,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what to say about it.

996
01:10:44,221 --> 01:10:44,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

997
01:10:44,742 --> 01:10:46,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a good job on this.

998
01:10:47,724 --> 01:10:48,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it really surprising?

999
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:50,766
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1000
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:53,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it really surprising just how well it turned out?

1001
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:54,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I...

1002
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:56,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I bought it.

1003
01:10:56,534 --> 01:10:58,095
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only five bucks and it's pretty good.

1004
01:10:59,156 --> 01:11:00,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I've got to play you sometime.

1005
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you play that one to Cell Network?

1006
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:07,059
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, Jamie.

1007
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:07,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, actually.

1008
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

1009
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:09,700
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of cool.

1010
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:10,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Like with Jules, you could do that.

1011
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:12,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

1012
01:11:13,922 --> 01:11:20,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've played a few matches with online and there's no lag either.

1013
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:24,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Gears of War Tuesday, Boop

1014
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:55,346
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.

1015
01:11:55,406 --> 01:11:56,347
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, take care, buddy.

1016
01:11:56,387 --> 01:11:56,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one.

1017
01:11:57,728 --> 01:11:58,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1018
01:11:58,128 --> 01:11:58,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, you too.

1019
01:11:58,468 --> 01:11:58,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

1020
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:58,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1021
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:02,752
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, we're going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1022
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:05,013
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1023
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:05,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1024
01:12:06,695 --> 01:12:07,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hello.

1025
01:12:07,515 --> 01:12:08,316
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you guys?

1026
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:09,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good.

1027
01:12:09,517 --> 01:12:10,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is this?

1028
01:12:11,658 --> 01:12:13,159
[SPEAKER_09]: You know who the fuck this is, Rob.

1029
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:23,347
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who we announced in Part A is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon, yes?

1030
01:12:23,979 --> 01:12:25,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I've crossed over to the dark side.

1031
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:26,500
[SPEAKER_12]: That's right.

1032
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:33,463
[SPEAKER_12]: I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said you'll never do anything with us, and yet hell has apparently frozen over.

1033
01:12:34,663 --> 01:12:37,184
[SPEAKER_09]: And to go back to something way back in the U.S.

1034
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:41,726
[SPEAKER_09]: old times, I tried to get over the rainbow, and I couldn't.

1035
01:12:43,586 --> 01:12:46,448
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I. That's all right.

1036
01:12:46,508 --> 01:12:50,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Folks who may have been following the Understation Live for years might follow it.

1037
01:12:50,489 --> 01:12:51,469
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we do have some folks here.

1038
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Still every other year, right?

1039
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:54,639
[SPEAKER_09]: What was that?

1040
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:55,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Still every other year?

1041
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:57,642
[SPEAKER_09]: What, did we do a USL?

1042
01:13:00,424 --> 01:13:03,566
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.

1043
01:13:04,207 --> 01:13:05,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.

1044
01:13:05,428 --> 01:13:06,388
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an even year.

1045
01:13:06,889 --> 01:13:07,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1046
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:08,350
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean?

1047
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:10,291
[SPEAKER_09]: That means I'll be gay next year.

1048
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:11,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, looking forward to that.

1049
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:18,097
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience, what do they have to look forward to?

1050
01:13:18,778 --> 01:13:20,099
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean you couldn't tell by the promo?

1051
01:13:21,727 --> 01:13:22,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it was a little geeky.

1052
01:13:23,388 --> 01:13:26,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didn't get it.

1053
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:28,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm out there.

1054
01:13:28,349 --> 01:13:28,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the trailer.

1055
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:30,469
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.

1056
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:35,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It is from the season one teaser that they used for the ninth Doctor.

1057
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:36,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the ninth Doctor.

1058
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think is fantastic.

1059
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm big.

1060
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:42,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm, you know, out there.

1061
01:13:43,213 --> 01:13:48,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, you're going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us.

1062
01:13:49,335 --> 01:13:49,735
[SPEAKER_12]: So, right?

1063
01:13:49,795 --> 01:13:50,895
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, definitely.

1064
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,854
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1065
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:34,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be games that I'm currently playing which is not a lot but there are games that I'm out there playing but we will be talking sci-fi and geek like I will be going on a tirade of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television excellent

1066
01:14:35,798 --> 01:14:37,019
[SPEAKER_09]: and stuff like that.

1067
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:44,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.

1068
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:53,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?

1069
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:55,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I am looking into that.

1070
01:14:57,037 --> 01:14:59,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.

1071
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:00,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well,

1072
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:02,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody tune in on Saturday.

1073
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:03,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Come and chat.

1074
01:15:03,518 --> 01:15:04,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Support Travis.

1075
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,201
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he'll see he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.

1076
01:15:09,282 --> 01:15:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, definitely show up.

1077
01:15:10,363 --> 01:15:11,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me know what's going on.

1078
01:15:11,264 --> 01:15:19,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, you'll see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.

1079
01:15:20,311 --> 01:15:26,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I'm going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Rob's greater moments in USL history.

1080
01:15:26,637 --> 01:15:27,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus.

1081
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:27,637
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1082
01:15:28,678 --> 01:15:29,239
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess just...

1083
01:15:29,989 --> 01:15:32,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.

1084
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:33,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Get Rob Blackmail.

1085
01:15:33,552 --> 01:15:34,252
[SPEAKER_12]: That's nice.

1086
01:15:34,773 --> 01:15:44,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I'll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie, who has a sense of decency and politeness, it's oh so small.

1087
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a small percentage of her being.

1088
01:15:46,882 --> 01:15:49,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.

1089
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:59,357
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I was actually, I actually was going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.

1090
01:15:59,637 --> 01:16:01,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think I still might post it, though, because it was pretty funny.

1091
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:05,542
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, should be fun.

1092
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:09,885
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.

1093
01:16:10,786 --> 01:16:11,867
[SPEAKER_12]: You have been assimilated.

1094
01:16:11,987 --> 01:16:19,593
[SPEAKER_12]: No, in all seriousness, we're very excited to have you on board and look forward to what you're going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.

1095
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:20,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you.

1096
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for having me.

1097
01:16:21,778 --> 01:16:25,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show.

1098
01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:26,519
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1099
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:30,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guarantee controversy for geeks out there on the first show.

1100
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,802
[SPEAKER_09]: My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be canceled and pull off the air.

1101
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:37,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, sounds good.

1102
01:16:37,983 --> 01:16:42,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, given what I've heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly.

1103
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:45,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Stargate, but yeah.

1104
01:16:45,825 --> 01:16:46,666
[SPEAKER_12]: What was I going to say?

1105
01:16:46,746 --> 01:16:48,066
[SPEAKER_12]: Something about, oh, forget it.

1106
01:16:49,782 --> 01:16:51,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember because I'm old.

1107
01:16:52,063 --> 01:16:52,783
[SPEAKER_12]: Tune in Saturday.

1108
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:53,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1109
01:16:53,803 --> 01:16:54,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all.

1110
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:54,904
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Rob.

1111
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:56,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Gay Alzheimer's.

1112
01:16:56,824 --> 01:16:57,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Shut up.

1113
01:16:57,584 --> 01:16:59,865
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hanging up on you now because I can do that now.

1114
01:17:00,845 --> 01:17:01,025
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1115
01:17:01,285 --> 01:17:01,525
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1116
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:02,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, Travis.

1117
01:17:02,586 --> 01:17:02,986
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

1118
01:17:03,346 --> 01:17:03,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1119
01:17:05,426 --> 01:17:05,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, God.

1120
01:17:06,226 --> 01:17:07,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Did we make a mistake inviting him on?

1121
01:17:07,947 --> 01:17:08,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1122
01:17:08,903 --> 01:17:13,524
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but sadly, I'm not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.

1123
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:13,965
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1124
01:17:14,025 --> 01:17:15,485
[SPEAKER_12]: I might call in and debate some sci-fi.

1125
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:18,186
[SPEAKER_12]: But for right now, we've got to go to another call that maybe we can debate with.

1126
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1127
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:19,546
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1128
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:21,067
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, guys.

1129
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:21,867
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Foodie Monster.

1130
01:17:22,247 --> 01:17:23,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Foodie Monster.

1131
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:23,927
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

1132
01:17:23,947 --> 01:17:25,668
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty late, man.

1133
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:26,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll tell you that.

1134
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:30,089
[SPEAKER_05]: This whole East Coast, West Coast thing is hiring me up the roof, seriously.

1135
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:36,291
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries even that stay up very late.

1136
01:17:36,564 --> 01:17:37,704
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are hardcore.

1137
01:17:37,744 --> 01:17:40,005
[SPEAKER_12]: You've earned your OLR badge of honor.

1138
01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:41,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Just every other night.

1139
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:42,646
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind, buddy?

1140
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:48,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to share something that popped out of my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted to write about, but I just figured I would call.

1141
01:17:49,188 --> 01:17:49,488
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

1142
01:17:50,168 --> 01:17:54,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you've got to think about it.

1143
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Games are not going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped.

1144
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:02,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not just United States, Europe, and Japan.

1145
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:04,132
[SPEAKER_05]: That's South America.

1146
01:18:04,744 --> 01:18:15,893
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Central America, that's Africa, those places also needed to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be really mainstream.

1147
01:18:16,813 --> 01:18:17,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, movies are everywhere.

1148
01:18:17,874 --> 01:18:23,599
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you won't find too much gaming in Africa.

1149
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:25,560
[SPEAKER_12]: That's an interesting perspective.

1150
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:33,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I've kind of never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how, oh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesn't include Europe.

1151
01:18:34,247 --> 01:18:34,948
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1152
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:59,571
[SPEAKER_12]: and certain South American countries as well.

1153
01:19:00,012 --> 01:19:01,032
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes beyond that.

1154
01:19:01,933 --> 01:19:05,695
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance.

1155
01:19:06,636 --> 01:19:10,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any country in South America has official distributions of games.

1156
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:19,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distributor or licensing here in Argentina, but

1157
01:19:19,941 --> 01:19:20,361
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

1158
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it's double the price.

1159
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:40,964
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, wait a minute.

1160
01:19:42,185 --> 01:19:45,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So gaming is more expensive, generally, in the other countries.

1161
01:19:45,587 --> 01:19:51,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up a Nintendo of Argentina or whatever?

1162
01:19:52,472 --> 01:20:00,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, they should at least have a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent to make things cheaper for all the markets.

1163
01:20:00,938 --> 01:20:01,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there enough of a demand?

1164
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:09,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35 million people.

1165
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say yes.

1166
01:20:10,782 --> 01:20:11,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

1167
01:20:12,564 --> 01:20:19,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, sure, I mean, it's not as much, probably that's why they don't do it, because there's not much market, you know.

1168
01:20:21,013 --> 01:20:26,598
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you consider with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in general, it's not enough market, I guess.

1169
01:20:26,959 --> 01:20:27,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

1170
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:32,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.

1171
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:33,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We appreciate that.

1172
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:35,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1173
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:42,386
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I have a quick review of my magic die, so now I can't play my backups, which has me very sad.

1174
01:20:43,126 --> 01:20:43,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to hear it.

1175
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,088
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

1176
01:20:46,148 --> 01:20:46,688
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for calling.

1177
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, you too, guys.

1178
01:20:47,548 --> 01:20:47,768
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1179
01:20:47,808 --> 01:20:48,069
[SPEAKER_12]: See ya.

1180
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:49,529
[SPEAKER_12]: See ya.

1181
01:20:49,589 --> 01:20:52,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to one more call.

1182
01:20:52,351 --> 01:20:52,911
[SPEAKER_12]: What, Miklatov?

1183
01:20:53,831 --> 01:20:55,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, let's go to one more call here.

1184
01:20:56,653 --> 01:20:57,694
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1185
01:20:57,714 --> 01:20:58,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1186
01:20:59,976 --> 01:21:01,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.

1187
01:21:01,497 --> 01:21:02,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Paradox Vincent.

1188
01:21:02,538 --> 01:21:03,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, you left us the voicemail.

1189
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:05,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1190
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:07,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah, what's on your mind?

1191
01:21:08,383 --> 01:21:09,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, did it get played?

1192
01:21:09,544 --> 01:21:20,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we actually played your voicemail and Miklatov called you a liar because he said if you've been following the Phantasy Star Universe thing like you said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers were separate.

1193
01:21:22,321 --> 01:21:26,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.

1194
01:21:26,223 --> 01:21:27,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what's on your mind?

1195
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because of

1196
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:54,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it was just kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.

1197
01:21:55,629 --> 01:21:57,911
[SPEAKER_12]: So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?

1198
01:21:59,132 --> 01:21:59,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1199
01:21:59,652 --> 01:22:03,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?

1200
01:22:04,075 --> 01:22:08,998
[SPEAKER_12]: You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction crap aside?

1201
01:22:11,659 --> 01:22:12,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of.

1202
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't really see it being so overblown.

1203
01:22:17,043 --> 01:22:19,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like the Gran Turismo HD game.

1204
01:22:20,552 --> 01:22:22,813
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.

1205
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:23,754
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess that's true.

1206
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:30,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo certainly kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.

1207
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:30,757
[SPEAKER_12]: I suppose that's true.

1208
01:22:31,377 --> 01:22:33,898
[SPEAKER_12]: So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?

1209
01:22:33,918 --> 01:22:36,820
[SPEAKER_12]: What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?

1210
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:45,344
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you that kind of gets you into it?

1211
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:59,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of that, because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see just like a giant leap in the resolution.

1212
01:23:00,543 --> 01:23:01,163
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what, though?

1213
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:05,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Mikotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution was sometimes a problem in Lumis?

1214
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:13,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that it gets too bright, and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring at it,

1215
01:23:14,315 --> 01:23:15,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Over and over and over.

1216
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:16,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Hours on hours.

1217
01:23:16,937 --> 01:23:21,179
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those luminous stages make me want to have a seizure.

1218
01:23:21,559 --> 01:23:23,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one in the basic pack, that's...

1219
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:27,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue and neon pink.

1220
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:29,250
[SPEAKER_08]: That hurts my eyes.

1221
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:34,214
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.

1222
01:23:34,274 --> 01:23:34,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate that one.

1223
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:37,157
[SPEAKER_12]: The one from the stupid first game.

1224
01:23:37,758 --> 01:23:40,961
[SPEAKER_12]: What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?

1225
01:23:41,241 --> 01:23:44,524
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?

1226
01:23:44,905 --> 01:23:47,387
[SPEAKER_12]: What else do you think you're going to buy?

1227
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:49,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of depends on the artist pack.

1228
01:23:50,143 --> 01:23:56,805
[SPEAKER_03]: because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shee, then I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard.

1229
01:23:58,165 --> 01:24:04,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was maybe Luminous 2 for the PSP that had them because I'm a giant fan of those.

1230
01:24:05,408 --> 01:24:05,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Right on.

1231
01:24:06,308 --> 01:24:09,469
[SPEAKER_12]: But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?

1232
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, kind of.

1233
01:24:12,190 --> 01:24:12,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1234
01:24:13,922 --> 01:24:16,262
[SPEAKER_12]: I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.

1235
01:24:16,282 --> 01:24:19,243
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions

1236
01:24:41,363 --> 01:24:44,866
[SPEAKER_03]: but made them very small and very kind of typecasted.

1237
01:24:45,827 --> 01:24:47,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1238
01:24:47,328 --> 01:24:48,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think they had a charge per skin?

1239
01:24:50,851 --> 01:24:51,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Charge per skin?

1240
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:54,073
[SPEAKER_12]: In Luminous?

1241
01:24:54,854 --> 01:24:59,978
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't like, like that bird one that's green and white.

1242
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:01,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that stage so much.

1243
01:25:03,541 --> 01:25:03,801
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1244
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:05,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for calling in.

1245
01:25:05,663 --> 01:25:06,343
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to move on.

1246
01:25:06,363 --> 01:25:08,205
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

1247
01:25:11,162 --> 01:25:13,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not really kind of a final thought.

1248
01:25:14,626 --> 01:25:16,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah, alright.

1249
01:25:17,569 --> 01:25:17,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1250
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:19,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, buddy.

1251
01:25:20,353 --> 01:25:21,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for calling in.

1252
01:25:21,173 --> 01:25:22,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, you too, guys.

1253
01:25:22,215 --> 01:25:22,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

1254
01:25:23,962 --> 01:25:27,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.

1255
01:25:27,143 --> 01:25:28,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Think of something clever to say.

1256
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:32,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have... Oh, he admitted you pwned him.

1257
01:25:32,424 --> 01:25:33,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, because I'm awesome.

1258
01:25:33,564 --> 01:25:34,684
[SPEAKER_08]: What a nice guy.

1259
01:25:34,744 --> 01:25:35,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I would have tried to fight you.

1260
01:25:35,684 --> 01:25:39,845
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.

1261
01:25:39,865 --> 01:25:41,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to do one more call?

1262
01:25:41,786 --> 01:25:42,066
[SPEAKER_12]: One more call.

1263
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:42,786
[SPEAKER_12]: We're running a little long.

1264
01:25:42,826 --> 01:25:43,746
[SPEAKER_12]: We have time for one more call?

1265
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:45,186
[SPEAKER_12]: One more?

1266
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:45,847
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you guys think?

1267
01:25:45,927 --> 01:25:46,147
[SPEAKER_12]: One more?

1268
01:25:46,247 --> 01:25:46,727
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, one more.

1269
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:47,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, let's do it.

1270
01:25:47,807 --> 01:25:49,027
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1271
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:49,387
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's this?

1272
01:25:50,267 --> 01:25:51,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Zach from the chat room.

1273
01:25:52,248 --> 01:25:52,508
[SPEAKER_12]: It's who?

1274
01:25:53,490 --> 01:25:54,931
[SPEAKER_01]: and Zappy from the chat room.

1275
01:25:55,872 --> 01:25:56,352
[SPEAKER_13]: Zappy!

1276
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:57,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, what's on your mind, Zappy?

1277
01:25:58,474 --> 01:26:04,518
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for like a week, past week and a half, and it's actually pretty decent.

1278
01:26:05,238 --> 01:26:08,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't find the missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.

1279
01:26:09,221 --> 01:26:10,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, which game was this again?

1280
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:11,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you're cutting out a little bit.

1281
01:26:11,783 --> 01:26:13,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

1282
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:14,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Medal of Honor for the PSP.

1283
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:15,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Ah.

1284
01:26:16,346 --> 01:26:20,049
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and you're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying, or what?

1285
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1286
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:28,559
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually controlling pretty well.

1287
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:38,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing PC first person shooters.

1288
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:42,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.

1289
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:49,468
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first-person shooters.

1290
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:53,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, you know, I kind of like Prey, and I really like my old-school Doom and, you know, Quake 3 and stuff.

1291
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Try to sell me on this game.

1292
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:57,871
[SPEAKER_12]: What's in this game that I might enjoy?

1293
01:26:58,792 --> 01:27:01,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, probably the best part of it is the three-player multiplayer.

1294
01:27:02,595 --> 01:27:10,140
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all the modes, and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's a pretty good selling point.

1295
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,041
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.

1296
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:13,602
[SPEAKER_13]: That's kind of cool.

1297
01:27:13,762 --> 01:27:14,082
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1298
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:14,582
[SPEAKER_13]: I like.

1299
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:17,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Even SOCOM only has 16 players in it.

1300
01:27:19,185 --> 01:27:19,445
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1301
01:27:20,045 --> 01:27:21,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you for the review of the game.

1302
01:27:21,546 --> 01:27:23,027
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?

1303
01:27:23,768 --> 01:27:29,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm probably going to go to the Arcadia convention next week, and I'll give you some hands-on on how it is.

1304
01:27:29,571 --> 01:27:30,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you not far from Montreal?

1305
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:31,032
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1306
01:27:31,798 --> 01:27:32,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in Montreal.

1307
01:27:32,758 --> 01:27:33,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, right on.

1308
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:35,019
[SPEAKER_13]: What other kinds of stuff?

1309
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:38,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?

1310
01:27:39,061 --> 01:27:42,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystick.

1311
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:45,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I haven't seen any real advertisements like on Billboard.

1312
01:27:46,204 --> 01:27:48,845
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not Billboard, but like the pamphlets or anything.

1313
01:27:48,865 --> 01:27:51,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.

1314
01:27:51,546 --> 01:27:58,569
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign or maybe, you know, flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.

1315
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is the second year doing it.

1316
01:28:01,361 --> 01:28:08,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go last year, but they're going to have the Wii, like, an update change early, so I just want to try it out.

1317
01:28:08,805 --> 01:28:11,986
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's true, because Nintendo's one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're going to see the Wii.

1318
01:28:12,046 --> 01:28:12,627
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pretty cool.

1319
01:28:12,947 --> 01:28:14,548
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yeah, definitely go to Arcadia.

1320
01:28:14,628 --> 01:28:18,890
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.

1321
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:22,792
[SPEAKER_12]: We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.

1322
01:28:23,766 --> 01:28:24,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to hear.

1323
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:24,907
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1324
01:28:25,607 --> 01:28:26,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a good one, Zappy.

1325
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:28,468
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got to let you go and get the show over with.

1326
01:28:28,488 --> 01:28:28,989
[SPEAKER_12]: But have a good one.

1327
01:28:29,009 --> 01:28:29,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for calling in.

1328
01:28:30,489 --> 01:28:30,769
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1329
01:28:30,789 --> 01:28:31,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Have fun at Arcadia.

1330
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:31,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1331
01:28:33,011 --> 01:28:33,351
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1332
01:28:33,571 --> 01:28:34,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that was a hang-up noise.

1333
01:28:34,471 --> 01:28:34,731
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1334
01:28:36,152 --> 01:28:37,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys so much for calling in.

1335
01:28:37,313 --> 01:28:39,534
[SPEAKER_12]: We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.

1336
01:28:40,074 --> 01:28:45,657
[SPEAKER_12]: It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get through every week are getting frustrated.

1337
01:28:46,077 --> 01:28:47,718
[SPEAKER_12]: But surely you guys can understand.

1338
01:28:47,778 --> 01:28:50,059
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to get as many different perspectives as we can.

1339
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:51,378
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1340
01:29:12,045 --> 01:29:19,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well anyways, I was going to say, if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's a couple websites you might want to check out.

1341
01:29:19,827 --> 01:29:22,408
[SPEAKER_10]: First, ps3seeker.com.

1342
01:29:23,068 --> 01:29:23,628
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check it out.

1343
01:29:23,648 --> 01:29:35,651
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually are kind of tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii, or PS3.

1344
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:38,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, the Wii would be ps3seeker.com.

1345
01:29:39,232 --> 01:29:40,712
[SPEAKER_10]: So check that out as well for...

1346
01:29:41,633 --> 01:29:44,934
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii, and then some other things.

1347
01:29:46,254 --> 01:29:58,256
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.

1348
01:29:58,576 --> 01:30:03,518
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.

1349
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:10,559
[SPEAKER_10]: You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon because apparently Gears of War is in their store right now.

1350
01:30:11,331 --> 01:30:12,631
[SPEAKER_10]: or at least at some Best Buys.

1351
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:15,072
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh, broken street date.

1352
01:30:15,412 --> 01:30:15,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Oopsie.

1353
01:30:16,092 --> 01:30:16,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

1354
01:30:17,012 --> 01:30:20,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So you might want to check and see if you can score or copy early because that would be pretty cool.

1355
01:30:21,513 --> 01:30:24,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.

1356
01:30:24,874 --> 01:30:27,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.

1357
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:28,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure how well that would play.

1358
01:30:29,295 --> 01:30:34,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And then PSP is getting pumped up in Korea, so that's kind of interesting.

1359
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:38,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And also something that I thought was interesting,

1360
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:40,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Very strange.

1361
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:53,955
[SPEAKER_10]: The Blu-ray, since the Blu-ray drives are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive, which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.

1362
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:59,297
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install 5 gigs of the game onto your hard drive.

1363
01:30:59,597 --> 01:31:01,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Imagine all these other games doing the same thing.

1364
01:31:02,179 --> 01:31:05,140
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.

1365
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:07,181
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um,

1366
01:31:07,938 --> 01:31:20,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, with the fall update for the 360 adding 1080p support, unfortunately some of the Sony LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.

1367
01:31:22,163 --> 01:31:22,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't that ironic?

1368
01:31:23,383 --> 01:31:23,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it?

1369
01:31:24,864 --> 01:31:25,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you think?

1370
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:27,545
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Ray Yane.

1371
01:31:28,105 --> 01:31:29,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, no Alanis.

1372
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:30,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1373
01:31:31,726 --> 01:31:34,867
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier.

1374
01:31:34,887 --> 01:31:36,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on Dick.com, but I found actually...

1375
01:31:37,563 --> 01:31:40,045
[SPEAKER_06]: A bit more about it on magazine.com.

1376
01:31:40,065 --> 01:31:43,488
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.

1377
01:31:44,109 --> 01:31:46,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a working Lego pinball machine.

1378
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:52,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.

1379
01:31:53,277 --> 01:31:56,720
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's so freaking cool.

1380
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.

1381
01:32:00,283 --> 01:32:03,606
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two-player.

1382
01:32:04,797 --> 01:32:12,624
[SPEAKER_10]: and the rumors coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that both state that Zelda is one of the two players.

1383
01:32:14,386 --> 01:32:16,067
[SPEAKER_10]: So, that's kind of interesting.

1384
01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:17,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll have to find out.

1385
01:32:18,049 --> 01:32:18,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

1386
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:20,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure enough, it's just not a misprint or something?

1387
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:23,714
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be, but it's two different places, so... Who knows?

1388
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:26,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, um...

1389
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:27,870
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Tyrant's Birthday

1390
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around this period.

1391
01:33:17,435 --> 01:33:18,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we should have a birthday list.

1392
01:33:19,236 --> 01:33:21,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Right at the end of every show we'll say, happy birthday to these listeners.

1393
01:33:21,398 --> 01:33:21,698
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1394
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:24,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1395
01:33:24,921 --> 01:33:31,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Miklatov, thank you for your rare input as always, but thanks for being the moral support you are for this program.

1396
01:33:31,886 --> 01:33:33,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, you hate this show, don't you?

1397
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:34,408
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure why you come on it.

1398
01:33:35,168 --> 01:33:36,349
[SPEAKER_12]: But what's your final thought anyway?

1399
01:33:36,489 --> 01:33:37,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

1400
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:38,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't.

1401
01:33:39,232 --> 01:33:39,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1402
01:33:39,892 --> 01:33:41,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, what's your final thought?

1403
01:33:41,774 --> 01:33:45,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at E3.

1404
01:33:45,997 --> 01:33:46,277
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1405
01:33:47,115 --> 01:33:47,875
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

1406
01:33:49,976 --> 01:33:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.

1407
01:33:57,058 --> 01:34:00,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now.

1408
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:02,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, pumpkin pie would be awesome.

1409
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week.

1410
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:08,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.

1411
01:34:08,541 --> 01:34:11,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio.

1412
01:34:11,742 --> 01:34:12,862
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are awesome.

1413
01:34:13,142 --> 01:34:14,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We couldn't do this without you.

1414
01:34:14,143 --> 01:34:14,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great week.

1415
01:34:14,703 --> 01:34:15,343
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see you next time.

1416
01:34:18,348 --> 01:34:20,770
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1417
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:23,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
