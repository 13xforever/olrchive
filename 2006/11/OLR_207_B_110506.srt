1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,680
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,960
This is episode number 207 and letís get right back into it.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,360
We got more gaming news for you guys.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Iím going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,720
The much anticipated fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st just like it was speculated

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
last week.

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,280
We talked about that on this program.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,560
And whatís interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,520
And when we say bricked the console that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,200
red lights of doom to appear and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
cannot play games.

12
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,160
It was said though that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
But I know we had a listener.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,520
I want to say it was Alex who was in our chat earlier saying he was one of the lucky less

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,600
than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
to fix it.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,240
And Iím thinking that is messed up.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
Thatís not what I read.

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,880
I read people were actually being able to send them back, but thatís pretty fucked

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
up that they wanted money.

21
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,760
I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,620
The official quote from Microsoft did come from this, ìWe are hearing from a small number

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,880
of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with a fall console update.

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,000
Iíve been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Weíll let you know when the issue is resolved.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,120
If youíre having problems with the update for any reason, please call XBox Support.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,200
Weíre working with those affected to get them back up and running and weíre committed

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,040
to making sure the update doesnít cause problems for anyone else.î So donít take that $140

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
for an answer.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,520
No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
for you.

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,480
They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,200
Especially since theyíre aware of the problem.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,080
Thereís no excuse for that.

35
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,640
Black Boy in our chat room did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
got bricked.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Good job.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Thatís still a big number.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,520
Wow, thatís something else.

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,880
They need to figure out how to un-brick them and fast.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,960
I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
I donít know.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,280
Thatís kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that, but I donít

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
know the technical end of it.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,980
Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was, Eragon, the demo

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:36,200
for that is available on Xbox Live, itís a 415 megabyte download, so you can check

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
it out.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
My problem with the book is that the book, as far as Iíve gotten through it, is so very

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
poorly written, it reads like it was written by a 12-year-old, so hopefully the game is

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,180
better than how poorly written the book is.

51
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,720
The demoís not better at all.

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,280
Itís absolutely crap.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,640
The demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,840
Yeah, and Iím not sure if youíve played it, but if youíve played Konamiís King Arthur,

55
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,040
itís about the same level of crap, and thatís really bad.

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Itís boring hack and slash.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That sounds pathetic.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200
I donít even know what this game is about.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
I know thereís a movie, but Ö

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,740
Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that heís a dragon rider and gets pulled

61
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,520
into all the dragon-riding nonsense and everything, but to defend the writer of the book, I did

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,860
hear that he did start it in his teens, but thatís what beta readers are for, use them,

63
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:35,320
which the entirety of the fan fiction writing community should also know that, too.

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,160
But I donít see why the book got all this attention and why theyíre making a movie

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
of it.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,520
I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Yeah.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
I saw them recently, also.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Itís sad.

70
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,160
So the game is just hack and slash?

71
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,240
Thatís as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted, and it wasnít

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
fun.

73
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,840
It looked like a PS2 game, and not even like a current generation of PS2 games.

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,080
It looks like a step back.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Well, itís developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
were all hack and slashy, too.

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I donít know.

78
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
It didnít look that bad.

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,000
The screenshots Iíve seen look pretty good, but having played the demo Ö

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The screenshots arenít playing.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Oh, snap.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, no.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,960
But, anyways, thatís actually Nvidiaís big game for Ö well, actually, no, I guess Fear

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,240
would be the big game for Novemver.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Anywho, so that fall update for the 360, it did some good, and what that would be is actually Ö

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,200
Well, itís helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,120
modded to play backed-up games.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,240
And so, actually, theyíve started banning some of these people that supposedly have

89
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,720
modded systems.

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,480
The funny part about it, though, is theyíre also banning some people that donít have

91
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,560
modded systems, but are saying that they are modded.

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,200
So they donít really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try

93
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,360
to stop some of those people from pirating stuff, because pirating is bad, totally.

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
I feel so weird saying that.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,880
Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,680
be downloading any time soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.

97
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,200
Some brand new maps came out for free if youíre an Xbox Live Gold member.

98
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Hmm, interesting.

99
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Another perk about being a Gold member.

100
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,680
You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this, they are an updated version

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,860
of GoldenEye 64 maps, Facility and Temple.

102
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,040
Those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.

103
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,200
Thatís kind of cool, if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.

104
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
I sold my Perfect Dark Zero, because I didnít like it.

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,600
I just couldnít get into it.

106
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
It felt weird.

107
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,120
No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Thatís my opinion.

109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,960
But, but, but, there, GoldenEye was a good game.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,600
I donít know, I still play Doom, and GoldenEye was good.

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,400
I just didnít, Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.

112
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
At all.

113
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,960
I donít know, Iím sorry, it just wasnít good for me.

114
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Dark Tetsuyaís happy.

115
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,720
He says Facility was awesome.

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.

117
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
You know what they need?

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
What?

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
They need to put out a goddamn time splitters game.

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
That was awesome.

121
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Weíll see.

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Make your own maps.

123
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:34,280
Well, at any rate, thereís been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.

124
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,560
Basically there is Ninja Ball, which is, you know, basically carrying a ball around.

125
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,080
Tank Flag, where a tank carries a flag.

126
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,640
And Elimination, on that one, youíre supposed to kill off five opposing team members.

127
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,980
With a 16 player limit.

128
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:01,160
They also mentioned more about the Spartan Laser, itís saying that the weapons application

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,280
will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,640
So itís sort of like, you know, lock targeting computer fire.

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:19,880
The Man Cannon, funny, it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles and looping

132
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,420
arcs over the battlefield.

133
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:30,320
And thereís also saying that theyíll be able to fire or you can be shot down while

134
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,640
youíre in air.

135
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,320
Thereís also, with the Warthog and Ghost vehicles, theyíre going to control similarly

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,040
to how they do in Halo 2, but theyíre not saying what the X button is going to be used

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
for.

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,280
Itís going to be ready when itís ready.

139
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,720
The rumor for the X button was steal weapons, because apparently youíre going to be carrying

140
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,440
your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.

141
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,920
So to stop people who whore certain weapons, like during the whole game, thatíll be interesting.

142
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,760
Yeah, Iíve heard that youíre going to be able to see the weapons on people, so interesting.

143
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,040
That is kind of cool.

144
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,160
By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in the first

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
person shooter, Jeremy Todd 1 says in Gears of War you canít jump and thatís one of

146
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
the best games coming out.

147
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Itís a little stupid.

148
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,680
I donít care.

149
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Even if it has high production values, itís still retarded that you cannot jump.

150
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:41,160
Come on now, weíre in next gen, we need to have jumping technology, thatís what we need.

151
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,160
Some things that are also ridiculous out there, and we talk about this every week, itís not

152
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,480
a huge surprise, another EA game comes out and more microtransactions.

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,640
Well, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.

154
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:05,200
One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours

155
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:12,080
the collectorís edition, so you can get the extra cars and whatnot, extra tracks.

156
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,720
And of course, theyíre going to have some unlockables that you can buy, pretty much

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,720
the same deal as all the other EA games that theyíve been charging microtransactions for.

158
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,140
So this is just going to be something that weíre going to see going forward, Iím thinking.

159
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,840
So if you donít like them, donít buy them, thatís what I say.

160
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
Thatís exactly what it boils down to.

161
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,240
If you donít like this, donít buy it, and donít encourage other people to buy it either.

162
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,040
So itís time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.

163
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,760
I donít know, they can be cool sometimes.

164
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
I mean new maps, new songs, I mean thatís kind of neat, but I donít know about this

165
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,520
whole buying something that youíre going to get in the game later.

166
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,160
And doesnít that just seem, I still canít get over the whole thing that we talked about,

167
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,140
I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the

168
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,200
other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,880
That just seems, I donít know, just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes

170
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,240
to get through their games, and thatís how they want to do it, and thatís how they have

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
fun doing it.

172
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,920
Especially in a sandbox game, maybe they donít want the challenge, they just want to have

173
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
fun going around and blowing people up.

174
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Like I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans, just put in all the cheat codes

175
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,520
and just ran around and blew things up.

176
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Hey, thatís fun!

177
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,960
No, Iím not talking about you actually, although you probably did this too.

178
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes I did.

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,520
So, I donít know, it just kind of seems like itís taking advantage of those people, taking

180
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
candy from a baby.

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,060
Well, itís just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row

182
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,960
at lunch, because weíre not actually saving the game or doing any progress, weíre just

183
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,600
running around blowing shit up, and thatís how we spend our lunches, because Saints Row

184
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,880
is very much like Grand Theft Auto.

185
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Well, this type of news makes me angry.

186
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,280
I donít know about you, DarkSakura, but I get angry when I feel like Iím being taken

187
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,880
advantage of, and my poor casual gaming friends are going to have to pay more money to have

188
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,280
the gaming experience they want, so this makes me angsty, and that means itís time for the

189
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
FUs of the Week.

190
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:17,160
The FU of the Week goes towards the Jehovahís Witness that knocked on the door to Kristenís

191
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,760
house before I left today.

192
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,840
Iím hiding behind the corner because I know Iím going to have choice awards for this

193
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
woman.

194
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,600
But sheís like, sheís coming to the door, and Kristenís like, ìHi, can I help you?î

195
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,200
and sheís like, ìOh, I have very important information for you, hereís your own personal

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,960
copy of things to help you understand whatís going on in the world!î And she goes, ìIs

197
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:48,720
this religious?î ìNo, itís from the Bible!î ìExcuse me!î And then she proceeds to go

198
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:56,600
on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian

199
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,840
or believes in God or anything like that, itís, first of all, the woman tries to lie

200
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,600
about her purpose for being there, which is very un-Christian-like, then again, weíve

201
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,520
had this for centuries, ìOh, the Crusades, the witch hunts, how about that?î But anyway,

202
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:21,280
she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference, and the thing is,

203
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,840
you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing

204
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
that you do.

205
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
It doesnít work.

206
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,840
And finally, Iím like, and Kristenís like, ìOh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!î

207
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,960
Iím like, so, I said, ìOkay, hereís my take on this.

208
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,640
The Bible was written by human beings.

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,760
God did not write it.

210
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,280
God told them what to put in it.

211
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,000
Therefore, when God comes to earth and says, ìHereís a book that I wrote by myself.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,360
I hope you like it, then I will take the Bible literally.î And then I said, ìThank you

213
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
very much.

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Goodbye,î and shut the door.

215
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
She gave me this look like, itís utter disbelief, like, ìOh, my God, nobodyís ever pointed

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,360
that out to me before,î and turned around and left, and spent silence.

217
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,320
And all I could see was, ìOh, my God, Iím so hardcore.î

218
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,040
This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico, and I remember Prop 22 here in California,

219
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,160
which is the one that said they were going to write, ìMarriage is only between a man

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,600
and a womanî in the State Constitution, and this woman came to my door and was like, ìYes,

221
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,580
I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.

222
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,800
How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?î

223
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,280
And Iím like, ìHoney, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.î And she did.

224
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:48,360
But she was embarrassed, she was like, ìOh, oh, I see.î Iím like, ìYouíre not going

225
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,080
to catch it, but run.î Iím a very open-minded person.

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,320
I grew up Southern Baptist, I mean, jeez.

227
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,040
If I could escape that with an open mind, if I could escape growing up Southern Baptist

228
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,080
in Alabama with an open mind, then Iím fairly tolerant of peopleís religious preferences.

229
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:17,600
But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that

230
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,720
you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you

231
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,320
ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.

232
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:45,080
We have to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.

233
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,960
I think we can end on the note saying, ìIf you are totally religious, then thatís cool.

234
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,800
We totally respect that.î One of my best friends is a very religious person and I totally

235
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,200
respect that because he respects my right to choose my own religion and the fact that

236
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:05,200
we have freedom of religion in this country, so I think diversity is great.

237
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Thatís why I think youíre welcome to see how you feel, youíre welcome to believe what

238
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
you do, but youíre right.

239
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,320
You can share with me, but your right to share that with me ends when you force it on me.

240
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, and I believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster, actually, no, anyway, weíve got

241
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to move on.

242
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Anyways, I have to read this in chat, RPGKing7 says, ìNo, whatís better is these two fairly

243
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,480
hot Jehovahís Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, ìIf God loves me, then

244
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,080
youíll show me your tits.îî Thatís disgusting, come on, letís keep it moving.

245
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:43,000
Anyways, FU2 Comcast, because I upgraded to Comcastís HD service, and first off, there

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,400
arenít that many channels anyways, but second off, our new cable box keeps randomly shutting

247
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,680
off, like once every hour to once every five minutes, and itís very annoying, and in fact

248
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,800
now itís starting to make static noise out of our right speaker, and I checked everything

249
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,280
and well, theyíre just retarded, so finally the Leafs are coming to fix it on Tuesday,

250
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,000
but I shouldnít have to put up with that crap.

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,960
My FU goes to my taste buds because Iím constantly craving junk food all week, like right now

252
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,480
Iím craving pie.

253
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Thatís it.

254
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Meagletop, do you have anything?

255
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:29,600
I have two short ones, Iím doing a preemptive FU to Endemero for not including Lasenka in

256
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,640
the new Pump It Up mix thatís going to be announced this month, because I know it wonít

257
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,960
be there, because they donít like me enough, and then FU to myself for not trying to jump

258
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,960
on Taco Bell Boy today, because heís still really hot.

259
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Hey Rob, I have one more.

260
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
What?

261
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:56,160
This is on behalf of several friends of mine, when, okay men, remember this, if you try

262
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,000
to hit on somebody while theyíre working to say Iím sorry Iím a lesbian, donít say

263
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,320
oh thatís okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.

264
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,400
They donít want your cock pissed off.

265
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,120
They want pussy.

266
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,640
Thank you for that blunt explanation.

267
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,360
Well, you have to be blunt, because the majority of straight men out there only think, Iím

268
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,800
saying majority, most that Iíve encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy

269
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
and itís not their brain.

270
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,040
Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because theyíre

271
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
so fabulously hot.

272
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Theyíre so fabulously hot.

273
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
That is very true.

274
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,960
Thatís true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.

275
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Men just want to watch.

276
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,520
You know what, yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.

277
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,960
Iím like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesnít really work that way, Iím not programmed

278
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
for that.

279
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,120
Anyway, weíre getting into TMI, so letís get into some game releases.

280
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,040
Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.

In Japan, Iíve got the Japanese release dates for you guys.

Gears of War is making its way to the Xbox 360 in certain Asian regions this week, so

283
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,880

We also have coming out on the Playstation 2 this week in Japan, Area 51 is coming out.

Going over to the Nintendo DS, Blackjack Hainotori-hen is coming out from Sega this week, and then

291
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,440
another Sudoku game is coming out as well from Milestone, and we have this interesting

292
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
title.

293
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,680
Letís see how bad I can butcher this.

294
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,580
Was that Hainotori?

295
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
Which one?

296
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,000
The one you said before Hainotori?

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Oh God, on whichÖ

298
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Sorry.

299
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Oh no, itís separated.

300
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Itís Hainotori-hen.

301
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Ok, that means firebird.

302
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,240
Oh, thatís what it is.

303
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,280
And then we have this one as well, this should be interesting on the DS.

304
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,120
Itís Nisas Shoujo Manga Ka, Chao Manga School.

305
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,760
So this is how to be a shoujo manga artist?

306
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,920
Pretty much, it looks likeÖ no, it looks like it actually takes place like in a school.

307
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Iím looking at some of the screenshots.

308
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
Manga Ka is aÖ

309
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Oh no, it does teach you how to draw.

310
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
A manga writer.

311
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Oh yeah, look, seeÖ

312
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Shoujo is girl.

313
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
See, look, it teaches you how to draw.

314
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,120
Basically, itís going to teach you how to draw Sailor Moon.

315
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, see, look, there it is.

316
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,320
Coming out from TDK Mediactive.

317
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,800
I actually think Iíll get that game.

318
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,560
That might be kind of fun.

319
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,120
The importers are wanting $48.90 for it.

320
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,680
Dude, Iíll get it.

321
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,800
Gotta love those import games and their high, high prices.

322
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,840
Well, hey, if you do Dil Jinshi or an artist, thatís a good game for you.

323
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,480
I need to give PSP a little love real quick as well.

324
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,200
Theyíre also getting some games.

325
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,800
Mostly Koei Entertainmentís bringing out some stuff into their best series.

326
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:54,520
Nobunaga no Yabu is going into the best series, as well as La Corda de Oro.

327
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,480
Looks like this oneís a new game thatís comingÖ no, itís just going into Koei selection.

328
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Marukanaro Jiku no Uchi Day 2.

329
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,320
Enjoy if youíre in Japan and have access to those games.

330
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:16,360
Well, speaking of games that arenít in Japan, how about our friends over in Europe?

331
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,520
So letís see what is coming out in the upcoming week, shall we?

332
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,960
Coming out on the 6th, we have Football Manager 2007 on 360 and PSP.

333
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,680
Thatís an interesting combination.

334
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,360
Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe, which I recommend everybody get because itís

335
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
fun.

336
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
Sega Genesis Collection.

337
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,880
Also on the 10th, we have Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Team

338
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,200
Saber, Mario Slam Basketball, Point Blank for the DS, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue and

339
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,960
Red, Scooby-Doo, Whoís Watching Who?, Warhammer, Mark of Chaos, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007,

340
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,640
which I actually do have to say is pretty damn fun just from the demo.

341
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,920
You can download the demo on Xbox Live right now if you want to give it a go, but I recommend

342
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,880
that if you want to win, use Kane.

343
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,440
Of course, the U.S. is going to be seeing one hell of a week for releases.

344
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,560
Starting off, of course, with the portable stuff, weíve got Elite Beat Agents coming

345
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:26,480
out on the DS, Digimon World DS, My Frogger Toy TrialsÖ crap!

346
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,440
And letís see hereÖ Winx Club, The Quest for CodexÖ also crap!

347
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,000
And letís seeÖ Wait, wait, I thought Megalotov was a fan

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,560
of the Winx games.

349
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,880
I just work on him.

350
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,760
Iím not really a fan.

351
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
Never mind.

352
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,200
I better not grill you further or you might get in trouble.

353
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:52,440
Game Boy Advance, Final Fantasy V Advance is coming out and Polarium Advance as well.

354
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,640
Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers Iíve ever played.

355
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
I would not be interested in it on the Advance.

356
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,920
On the PC, weíve got Final Fantasy XI Vanadial Collection 2007, in case youíre not a member

357
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,000
of Final Fantasy XI yet.

358
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,280
Left Behind, Eternal Forces, the godly Grand Theft Auto game, the Sims 2 Happy Holiday

359
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,040
stuff, and of course, if you have a Microsoft Flight Simulator, the Aircraft Power Pack

360
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
will be coming out.

361
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:26,160
Then on a lot of systems, Call of Duty 3 is going to be coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox,

362
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
and the 360.

363
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,320
Weíve got Tony Hawkís Project 8 coming out on Playstation 2, Playstation 3, Xbox, and

364
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,680
Xbox 360.

365
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,480
Luminous 2 on the PSP.

366
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,580
Of course, weíve also got Dragon Ball Z, Budokai Tenkaichi 2, Guitar Hero 2 is coming

367
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
out.

368
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,400
Weíve got Sopranos and the Sopranos Collectorís Edition, SOCOM US Navy Seals combined Assault

369
00:22:51,400 --> 00:23:00,040
for the Playstation 2, Sega Genesis Collection on the Playstation 2, and PSP.

370
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,460
On the 360, the HD DVD player is coming out this week actually, Gears of War, and then

371
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:14,840
Viva Pinata, and of course, one of my favorites to sell at least, the History Channel, American

372
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,200
Civil War, Nation Divided on PS2 and the 360, another budget Activision game for you, and

373
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Blitz Elite.

374
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Thatís it.

375
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Lots of stuff.

376
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,400
Alright, it should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, thatís for sure.

377
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,240
Oh my God, yeah, seriously.

378
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,040
Itís like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.

379
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,760
Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.

380
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,520
Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split screen.

381
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,840
Changing topics completely to something thatís already out but maybe we didnít know about

382
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,880
thatís in stores, one of our listeners actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent

383
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,520
post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted at a local store.

384
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,320
He spotted Dance Dance Revolution, the DVD game.

385
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,080
He saw this at Best Buy, and you might be thinking, ìOh, thatís interesting, a DDR

386
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,760
game that you can play in your DVD player.î Well, hereís the deal.

387
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,480
You have a dance pad, but since itís a DVD game, it doesnít plug into anything.

388
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,560
You just have a dance pad that you can mimic the on-screen stuff to with the dance pad.

389
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Basically, this is what it is.

390
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,180
Itís an interactive DDR game that can be played on a DVD player.

391
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,120
It has a dancer named Roxy that teaches you how to play the game in over 30 dance sessions,

392
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,260
and this will train you to play with the DDR console games.

393
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,800
The DDR mats are strictly just for show.

394
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,920
Itís put out by imagination, and it retails for 30 bucks.

395
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,840
Why donít they just put it as a training mode for some of these console games?

396
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,680
A lot of people are going, ìOMG, lame!î Thatís basically the response.

397
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,720
But whatís interesting about this is that some folks have also been bringing up, ìWell,

398
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,980
this is a way for folks who canít really afford the whole system and the more expensive

399
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,320
game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of

400
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,640
the game telling them they suck.î I donít know.

401
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:09,600
Also, if you donít have a dance mat and you donít have the game, dropping $70 or $49.99

402
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:16,600
or whatever for the game, the dance mat is a little much, so maybe $20 for a DVD is not

403
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
so bad.

404
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,480
Iím kind of surprised itís not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry

405
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Shortcake DDR or what have you.

406
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,960
This guy, El Mullet, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with

407
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
the Internet.

408
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,480
DarkSakra serves the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with

409
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
all of you guys.

410
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Itís called the Website of the Week, and DarkSakra is going to tell you what her browser

411
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,080
is looking at right now.

412
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,600
The website of the week, after lots of looking, is the Catsite.com.

413
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,040
Yes, itís a site all about cats and how to take care of them.

414
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:14,640
It has things about kittens, it has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior,

415
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
hairball care.

416
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,120
I recommend going to the Catsite.com.

417
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,440
Yes, I have a cat.

418
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,600
There is Shermy, and Shermy has benefited from this site.

419
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I have to admit, I prefer DailyKitten.com for my cat needs.

420
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
My cat-loving needs.

421
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,240
Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.

422
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Or StuffOnMyCat.com.

423
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,680
Iíve already done StuffOnMyCat, remember?

424
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
Thatís right, you did.

425
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
A long time ago.

426
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
They need StuffOnMyBaby.com.

427
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Wow.

428
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,080
I think that would be funny because people put weird things on their babies.

429
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,760
I donít know if you should encourage that.

430
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
Is there one already?

431
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
Oh, Iím worried Iím going to get porn or something.

432
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Letís try this.

433
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
www.stuffonmybaby.com.

434
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:10,800
Oh, this page is parked free courtesy of GoDaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.

435
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
How nice.

436
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,840
So I guess thereís no Stuff On My Baby yet, but Go Daddy says thereís one coming soon,

437
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
as soon as someone buys the domain from them.

438
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Iím telling you, the Stuff On My Cat, they needed the Stuff On My Baby because people

439
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,800
dress up their kids really stupidly.

440
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,120
I have a Stuff On My Cat calendar now.

441
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,080
How about Stuff On My Politician?

442
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,320
I donít know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.

443
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,080
Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign

444
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,700
commercial going on, and basically heís this ultra-conservative guy, and heís bragging

445
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,880
about his support of video game violence initiatives, taking a stand against video game violence.

446
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,840
But what should be noted about this commercial, that Game Politics points out, is that in

447
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,840
the commercial, Santorium delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers, towards the

448
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,400
end of the commercial, an elbow.

449
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,800
He elbows this wrestler in the face.

450
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,240
So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence, and then he is violent against

451
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,280
a wrestler in the commercial, and pretty much anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

452
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,120
Thatís this guyís platform, anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.

453
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Why is it simulated when you can go do it?

454
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,360
You know what the conservatives want?

455
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,680
They want you to put down the video games, and they want you to go fight in the real

456
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
war.

457
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,960
Well, you know, itís kind of not just conservatives in my mind, because it was Hillary Clintonís

458
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
thing too.

459
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
Itís kind of all across the board.

460
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,900
I think thereís just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what

461
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,900
party theyíre with.

462
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,400
We need to re-educate them by voting them out of office, because if youíre over the

463
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,200
age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator

464
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,800
is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation thatís not going

465
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,920
to go through or anything.

466
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,280
So do your research.

467
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
Election Day is coming up.

468
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:11,520
You know, thereís actually, I want to change my website, because this one, and Iím just

469
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
trying to verify that.

470
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
Wait, wait, do we need theÖ

471
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
We donít need the music again.

472
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Are you sure?

473
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Iím sure.

474
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Are you sure youíre sure?

475
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:27,400
Iím trying to verify the name of the site, because Iíve been there before.

476
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,800
I think itís like VoteSmart.com or SmartVote or something like that.

477
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,360
I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.

478
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,660
You know whatís funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays, Election

479
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,060
Day will have already passed, so maybe itís kind of a move point now.

480
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,880
Maybe we should have done this story in Part A. Oops, oh well.

481
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
No.

482
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,640
Well, anyway, people should be going there anyway.

483
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,760
Alex in our chat room says, ìI nominate Rob for the Gamersí Party ticket with Jamie as

484
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,080
his Vice President.î Thatís nice, except Iím not 35.

485
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Almost, but not quite.

486
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,280
Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.

487
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:13,120
Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded

488
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,240
consoles, but itís also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.

489
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,360
Thatís right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going

490
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,640
to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on

491
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,000
locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent

492
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,600
players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.

493
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,720
Basically there are three ways to hack your G-scores, and basically there are three different

494
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
methods.

495
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,760
Save games dating from the launch to March and April that were unlocked and you can be

496
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,800
traded with other users.

497
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Games after that have been locked to specific consoles, but people are hex editing them

498
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,380
to change the console ID.

499
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,320
And then, of course, certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile

500
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,400
locked and only on those profiles can you play them, so people are cheating that as

501
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,960
well.

502
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,140
Very interesting, but Iím sure people are going to find a way around it, because they

503
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,600
always do.

504
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,720
Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to

505
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,000
you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places, because we talked about the

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,840
Game Pro thing earlier in the show, weíve talked about E3, but these are all things

507
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
that happen in America.

508
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,280
Of course, you know the other big shows that happen, thereís the one in Germany, thereís

509
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,400
Tokyo Game Show, thereís other game shows in other parts of the world where we have

510
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
listeners.

511
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,920
I know we have listeners in Canada and the Arcadia Gaming Festival is going to be taking

512
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,800
place November 10th through the 12th at the Stade Unipree in Montreal in Canada.

513
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,360
Itís going to be a very big event, theyíre saying, and theyíve got sponsors including

514
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,920
Nintendo, Microsoft, and Ubisoft.

515
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,600
The website says, ìArcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and

516
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,680
emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.î Does that mean everyoneís

517
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
getting high?

518
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I donít know.

519
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,080
Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days, and there is a service fee with that

520
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,280
though, so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian, thatís about $22 US by the way.

521
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,580
Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who

522
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,440
might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.

523
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,080
Have fun.

524
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:48,920
Also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.

525
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,820
Basically theyíre bringing in virtual taxation.

526
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,360
If you earn money, you have to pay taxes, so for anyone doing profits online or playing

527
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:09,560
games like Second Life or World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says,

528
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,920
ìIf youíre getting a monetary benefit, then itís not treated any differently.

529
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Normal rules apply.

530
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,800
Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working nine to five

531
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:27,640
in an office.î So basically for anyone who earns money via their internet addictions,

532
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,560
then youíre going to get taxed.

533
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,120
Hereís where I have a problem with this.

534
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,840
If theyíre going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses

535
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,760
and I want restitution for that.

536
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Thatís why I think it would be fair.

537
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,200
If you want to go one way, youíve got to do both.

538
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,160
You canít have the cake without paying the money.

539
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
I donít know.

540
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Thatís a bad analogy.

541
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
Whatever.

542
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,160
I had nothing.

543
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,960
But I want damn money for losing tons of money in an online game.

544
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
I think thatís only fair.

545
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,480
So, the big trend with Japan and actually the United States and portable consoles is

546
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,280
releasing them in multiple colors.

547
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,440
Well, youíre going to get three brand new colors in Japan for the PSP.

548
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,440
Thatís right.

549
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,360
Theyíre going to be getting pink, silver, and metallic blue and unfortunately none of

550
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,040
those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except

551
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,760
for me, the pink one, which looks stupid.

552
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
Should you spend your money on this?

553
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,560
Probably not if you already have one.

554
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,760
But if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP, then nowís the time.

555
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I donít know.

556
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
Hooray.

557
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,760
I want a pink PSP.

558
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Not.

559
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Wait.

560
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,160
Miklotov is the one thatís the color whore when it comes to systems.

561
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,400
Youíve totally taken systems back and traded it just to get a blue DS and stuff.

562
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Yep.

563
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
So do any of these new color PSPs interest you?

564
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
The blue one.

565
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Of course.

566
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
I honestly really want it.

567
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,920
I saw the picture and I was like, ìWow, itís a blue PSP.

568
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,640
I need it back.î

569
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,200
When I was at Yalicon, there were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing

570
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,640
a different color DS.

571
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
Thatís cute.

572
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,240
I have a pink GBA.

573
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,200
For like $20, you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.

574
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,480
In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.

575
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,800
You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.

576
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,640
Theyíre available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.

577
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,440
Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.

578
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,260
You know what I thought was interesting is I was at the mall today and I didnít notice

579
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,520
how many freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to PIP my iPod.

580
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,840
They had all these places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever little encasings they

581
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,240
have that you can put SpongeBob on your iPod and stuff and you can pretty much do the same

582
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
thing with the PSP.

583
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
You know what I havenít seen this year?

584
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,240
What?

585
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
The knockoff Nintendos.

586
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Maybe they finally got pulled.

587
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Didnít they get sued years ago or something?

588
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I donít know.

589
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
That doesnít stop people.

590
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Maybe they didnít sell well.

591
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
I donít know.

592
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Oh yeah, laws.

593
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,600
Theyíre going to put laws in place to stop the black market.

594
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,920
Oh, thatís going to work.

595
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,520
Well, Microsoft is hoping that this will sell well, if it is true anyway.

596
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,520
This is in rumor status right now, but it certainly seems plausible.

597
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,320
The rumor is that Microsoft will begin offering downloadable HD movies later this month.

598
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Supposedly itís going to launch around November 22nd and 1,100 hours of video would be available

599
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,640
to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.

600
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,840
Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period and purchases would be from $10 to

601
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,420
$15, very similar to pay-per-view and iTunes.

602
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,060
I donít know if Iíd buy this though, because to me this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player

603
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,000
if theyíre going to move this direction, right?

604
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,480
Not necessarily, because youíre only going to have so much room on your hard drive to

605
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
fit movies.

606
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Yeah, thatís the other thing.

607
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,600
Thereís no room.

608
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,880
How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20-gigabyte drive?

609
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,320
Well, I donít know, but hereís the other thing too.

610
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,960
The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it, so they

611
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,000
could do this if they wanted to.

612
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
Thatís one of the things that they just added.

613
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
So it kind of seems a little coincidental if theyíre going to be implementing this

614
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,160
pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.

615
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,680
I donít know.

616
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,840
It just seems a little soon for this.

617
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I still think youíre kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.

618
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,880
Well, theyíve got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution

619
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
stuff.

620
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Weíll see.

621
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,240
Justin in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late

622
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
ë90s.

623
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
I donít know, because you can buy them.

624
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,840
Theyíre going to have to announce a bigger hard drive is what theyíre going to have

625
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
to do.

626
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,640
What are you going to do when youíre done with a movie?

627
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,440
You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and itís still

628
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
yours?

629
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Iím thinking the drives are not big enough.

630
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Possibly.

631
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,800
I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that thereís a 60-gig

632
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,200
thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.

633
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
You know?

634
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
I donít know.

635
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
It doesnít make sense.

636
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,680
Justin thinks they can stream the movies.

637
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,680
They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.

638
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
I donít know.

639
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,560
That wouldnít necessarily work, depending on how bad your service is.

640
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,120
It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.

641
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,480
Weíll see.

642
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,600
And of course, Bandit wants to know, ìWhen does the Wizard get released for the 360?î

643
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:36,260
I donít think it would, because it was a Nintendo commercial, so they donít want it.

644
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
But I donít know.

645
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
I could be wrong.

646
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,040
One thing that we want is your e-mails.

647
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,480
Every week we invite you guys to e-mail us at MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and we

648
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,840
pick a few of our favorite letters that hopefully youíd like them too, and we read them here

649
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
on air.

650
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:54,600
So please, why donít you drop us an e-mail, MailBag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, and the

651
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Dark Sakura is going to read some of her favorite e-mails right now.

652
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:09,840
Well, weíve got quite a number of e-mails now, all going to be read by the ferret, so

653
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,720
hereís the first one.

654
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,040
Okay, never mind.

655
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,920
First e-mail comes from Wolf.

656
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,460
I actually have two e-mails, so Iím just going to read them together, because actually

657
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,160
I sort of am happy about one.

658
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
ìSo this goes out to Jamie.

659
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,120
I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game

660
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,280
system for two to three times the value when someone who canít enjoy it has to pay that

661
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
much.î

662
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:42,960
Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe morals are becoming slowly corroded

663
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,800
over time, and I think somebodyís got to have them, so thank you.

664
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,400
One for Rob, ìI think youíre the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?

665
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,360
Did you quit before or after the whole chocobo-raising update?î

666
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,600
I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI, right when they did the chocobo,

667
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,240
but it only lasted about a month.

668
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,880
Miklotov was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit.

669
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,280
I think I got Coursera to level 14, if that, and then quit.

670
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,560
I did get a chocobo, and I raised it, but not past baby stage.

671
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,980
ìOh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.î But then I quit, and now

672
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,980
Iímó

673
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,660
I remember you had a little Kim back in the day.

674
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:31,240
That was actually my mule, so it was a secondary character I had named Little Kim.

675
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,760
Maybe someday Iíll go back to Final Fantasy XI, but right now itís all about Final Fantasy

676
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,800
Star Universe, as far as MMOs go.

677
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,840
And Final Fantasy XII, hello!

678
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Lots of stuff to be playing.

679
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,240
Well, as far as other e-mails are concerned, we have one from AZHP again.

680
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:55,960
Okay, it says, ìHey guys, AZHP again, reporting back from Stonetowns, Karaoke Revolution presents

681
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,000
American Idol dealie.

682
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,160
Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.

683
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,840
But anyway, my thoughts on the game.

684
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,160
Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that Iíve played, but the whole

685
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,160
American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.

686
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,720
I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person,

687
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,680
cause there were only a few sound bites for each judge.

688
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,760
Also since itís on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate, and not in

689
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,880
a good way.

690
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,000
And when they talk, the lips donít sync up.

691
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,560
Also, the pitch recognition still needs work, judges a little too harshly, just like all

692
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
the previous games.

693
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
A decent party game, but not great.

694
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,480
Yeah, thatís not surprising.

695
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,440
Well, I think itís not done yet either.

696
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
No.

697
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Well, no, isnít it?

698
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,800
Were they talking about the little tour theyíre doing?

699
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah.

700
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,440
I donít think thatís a final build.

701
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:55,840
No, so I wouldnít totally base your opinions on that build.

702
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,400
But, you know, itís going to give you the general feel of the game, at least.

703
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,640
Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.

704
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,280
Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kudaragi, here is a reason for the

705
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.

706
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,220
People say heís bad to the customers, eh?

707
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,720
He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.

708
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,600
When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the

709
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,680
technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.

710
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,080
So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.

711
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
Thought it might interest you all.

712
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,800
Yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah,

713
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,240
there was a bunch of big fallout over that.

714
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,760
I think there were evenóI remember back in the dayódidnít they have image prototypes?

715
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,160
Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?

716
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I seem to remember in Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture,

717
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,240
but you know, this is so long ago.

718
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
Yeah.

719
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,400
But thatís still an interesting point, one that not everyone is aware of.

720
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,960
Got an email from Alex, it says, ìHey, O.L.R., Alex from chat here.

721
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,320
I suspect Iím too late for mailbag 207.î And or that the story Iím going to touch on

722
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,360
hasnít come up on the show yet, but oh well, Iím going to talk anyway.

723
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,440
ìIím pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween,

724
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,440
which it was.

725
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,320
However, nobody knew how bad this update was.

726
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,920
A lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing.

727
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,920
This is now fixed, but thereís another problem.

728
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,120
The update effectively bricked consoles.î Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part

729
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,520
A, but I thought it wasó

730
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,240
This is right at the top of this part, but thatís alright.

731
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,200
Actually, our listener, that listenerís in chat tonight.

732
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,200
Yeah.

733
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,040
So heís the same guy who said he had a bricked console, so.

734
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,720
But I still think it was interesting that, you know, weíve got people who do have more

735
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,800
thoughts on that one.

736
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,840
It was the final comment on here that made me really think about it.

737
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,400
Itís way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening.

738
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Good point.

739
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Another email comesó

740
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,280
But wait a minute, though, at the same time, you know, partóat least the rumor or whatever

741
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,440
is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so

742
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,720
Sony couldnít say any longer that theyíre the only console that can do the true HD.

743
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
So at the sameó

744
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
But how well did they test it?

745
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,920
Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasnít the time to be rushing things, so Iíll buy

746
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,920
into that.

747
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,680
We have an email from Warrior Bob.

748
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
Warrior Bob is cool.

749
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Hey, guys.

750
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,360
I heard the discussion this last week about Konamiís acquisition of the In the Groove

751
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,360
franchise.

752
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,020
I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so Iíll leave

753
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,680
my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.

754
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,960
I did feel, however, that the situation wasnít portrayed entirely accurately.

755
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:46,000
Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking

756
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,720
of was StepMania, the open-source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.

757
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,720
In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort,

758
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,960
although some resources are shared between the projects, some code, and I believe some

759
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,460
staff were involved in both In the Groove and StepMania.

760
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,000
The settlement implies that marketing and sales of a game of such similarity does constitute

761
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,880
infringement that is on Rockstar Red Octaneís and not StepManiaís, as they have never sold

762
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
anything.

763
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,120
The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.

764
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,480
Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.

765
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,640
At one point I worked with the StepMania team on a very small level, helped write a manual,

766
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,940
check out the In the Groove 1 Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have

767
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,200
an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.

768
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,360
So while corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the

769
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,360
next one.

770
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:43,200
With all due respect, no, I meant Fan Tribute and I still feel thatís how I feel the game

771
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,960
is because if you look at the folks that developed In the Groove, half of them were posters on

772
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,320
DDR Seattle before In the Groove ever came out, so maybe it wasnít called a fan tribute

773
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,120
like StepMania was, but in my mind it was that fandom of DDR and they probably all met

774
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,800
each other on this forum and stuff that caused them to make the game.

775
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:08,240
I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end itís all about the dollar

776
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,120
and they did steal the idea.

777
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,640
And that was kind of part of what I was saying last week is that I kind of felt a little

778
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,880
bit bad because I feel like it was an innocent thing and they really did just want to make

779
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,740
the concept of dance games better until the dollar came into play and I think Rock Store

780
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:29,320
stepped in and all this stuff, but then again we had Renee here last week who says sheís

781
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,520
had interaction with these folks and theyíre a little bit uppity.

782
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,280
I donít know, Iím not going to speak because I donít really know these folks, but I will

783
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,280
say this.

784
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,760
I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.

785
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,240
Folks used to ask, ìWhat is your legal angle on this?

786
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,560
How is this game legal?î and they would just say, ìDonít talk about it.

787
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,080
Weíve got it covered.î And now itís kind of like, ìYou know what?

788
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,880
You got served.

789
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,200
Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?î Thatís kind of the one part

790
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,360
I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.

791
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,040
They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.

792
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,140
I still think that the product was well-deserved.

793
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,480
You donít take somebody elseís idea and try to make money on it.

794
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,440
Itís like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any

795
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
picture.

796
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,840
Itís like, ìOh, but we love your style.î That doesnít matter to me.

797
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
You stole my art.

798
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,880
Thatís how I would feel.

799
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:32,120
Anyway, my font is very strange on the e-mail, so I apologize.

800
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,680
I think itís Schwal 22.

801
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah.

802
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
You know what?

803
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,680
This is funny.

804
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.

805
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,600
I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?, I think was the game, and now he listens to

806
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,600
the show.

807
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Itís kind of cool.

808
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
Thatís pretty cool.

809
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,000
Just to explain, my Lís and my 1ís look the same in this font.

810
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Hey, folks.

811
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Love the show and the info.

812
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,840
I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.

813
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,280
I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ìcoî and ends with ìtakuî lol.

814
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,880
Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but

815
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:13,640
IGNís Matt Casamassina stated earlier this week that that would be possible.

816
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,760
Any sort of clarity would be good because I donít own a GameCube and may need to buy

817
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:18,760
the controller.

818
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,440
Lastly, the SD memory cards will not be able to play downloaded games at a friendís house

819
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,480
on his or her Wii.

820
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
How is that possible?

821
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,280
I understand the region coding of a system, but how can a system justify where the ROM

822
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,960
ñ thatís basically what it is, the emulators are already on the system ñ came from in

823
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,040
the first place?

824
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,840
How will they expect to sell virtual games when they canít travel?

825
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,400
Oh well, sorry for the long e-mail, just info.

826
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,800
I think everyone should be aware of and keep up the good work.

827
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,120
Itís a very informative show, and sometimes questionable.

828
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,000
Man Cannon and Love HamÖsterÖ

829
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,680
Dude, it really is called the Man Cannon.

830
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,360
Thatís what they said on the sites this week.

831
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,680
It really is the Man Cannon.

832
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,080
What were you going to say, Logie?

833
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:06,680
I was going to say that the Xbox Live Arcade does not have ñ you canít trade the games

834
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,080
with other people and bring them over.

835
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,200
You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you canít actually bring your full

836
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,960
game with them.

837
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,600
Thatís why your profile is linked to basically your console, so youíre only going to be

838
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,600
able to download them there.

839
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,600
You know whatís interesting?

840
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,000
I was listening to Bobbyís show earlier tonight, and he was talking about ñ because he just

841
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,600
got a replacement console and it screwed up his arcade games because it was tied to the

842
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,600
old console.

843
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,080
But apparently if youíre signed in, if youíre the one signed in on the console and you bought

844
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,160
the game, it will work.

845
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,680
So thatís how you can take it, like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to

846
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,680
somebody elseís house.

847
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,240
Sign in, but itís still linked to your account.

848
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Right.

849
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,240
So you have to sign in.

850
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,040
If you copy the game over, it wonít work for them.

851
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,040
Is that what Iím hearing?

852
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,040
It sounds like itís going to have a little ñ

853
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,640
But Iím thinking what you might be able to do though with that is you might be able to

854
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,520
sign in your account, maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work, but right

855
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,680
now theyíre saying you canít just bring your memory card over.

856
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,640
You have to bring the whole console with you, which I donít know about that.

857
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,560
I think you can probably bring your profile.

858
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,280
I think that Wii-Con is going to have ñ yeah, I think the Wii-Con has ñ because they say

859
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,760
that has internal storage in it, so it certainly could have your Nintendo version of gamer

860
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,760
card in it.

861
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,760
Thereís that.

862
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,880
And then, of course, what was the other thing real quick?

863
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,160
Vandalus in our chat room says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.

864
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,080
Yeah, so I donít think thatís really going to be an issue at all.

865
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,480
As far as the classic controller though, you will probably ñ youíre not going to be able

866
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,280
to play GameCube games with that, not at all.

867
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,120
And personally, Iíd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.

868
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:45,600
Youíd probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper

869
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,140
than buying the classic controller, I would think.

870
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,680
Especially third-party ones.

871
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Exactly.

872
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,620
Well, if weíre ready to move on to the next email, we have two left.

873
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,920
This one comes from Chris.

874
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,400
ìHi, O.L.R., when my family and I were taking care of my sisterís little terrier puppy,

875
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,680
Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.

876
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,360
She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it

877
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
was.

878
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,800
Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.

879
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,800
This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your

880
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,000
show helped cheer me up.

881
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,180
Iíd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me

882
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,920
feel when you do the show and how you have made my life a little happier.

883
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,720
God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.î

884
00:51:34,720 --> 00:52:03,360
Thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.

885
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,520
Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.

886
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,920
First off, I know that thereís all the news swirling around about next-gen systems and

887
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,120
all that, and Iím still desperately hunting down a Wii order, but there seems to be a

888
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:18,120
real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.

889
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,320
I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.

890
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,280
I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, The Import, and Contact last week, and Iím

891
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,280
really loving both of them.

892
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,940
Contactís got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay, and the instruction

893
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,760
book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars, and a surprising

894
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,640
lack of emo.

895
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,320
Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldnít have it any other way.

896
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,760
I saw what the new attorney looks like.

897
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:54,640
You know, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.

898
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,640
The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Starsign, Final Fantasy

899
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:05,000
3, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52, Scourge the Hive, and Touch

900
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Detective.

901
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,640
Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?

902
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,080
I mean, really, Iím teasing.

903
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,400
Iím sure the gameís great.

904
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,960
Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?

905
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,280
Weíll go ahead and answer this part before we move on to the second part of the email.

906
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
So what games would you guys recommend?

907
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,480
Iíve heard really good things about Contact.

908
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,880
I actually want to check out this game myself, but itís just too busy of a season for me

909
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,520
to pick up games I donít know much about.

910
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,120
Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love

911
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,960
Owen Dawn, so Iím sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.

912
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,800
Final Fantasy 3 looks very promising, but of course, as Iíve admitted in part A, Iím

913
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,640
a whore for all things Final Fantasy.

914
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,640
Yes, it is.

915
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,400
Final Fantasy 5, too, because, you know, the game will advance, and do it in the Advance

916
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
port as well.

917
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,840
Miklotov, anything you can think of there for the DS?

918
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,840
Or PSP?

919
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:57,920
Well, Luminous 2 for PSP, and then youíre done.

920
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,560
What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?

921
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,560
I never played any of those, so I play Luminous 2.

922
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,880
I almost bought Work Time Fun today, but...

923
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,840
Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good, especially if youíre a fan of Luminous.

924
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,200
For PSP, Tony Hawkís Project 8, thatís going to be coming out.

925
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,400
Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.

926
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,600
Iím trying to think what else.

927
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
Really good stuff.

928
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,000
Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP, SOCOM, if youíre into the first person shooter

929
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
stuff.

930
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Justice League is coming out, Marvel already came out, Ultimate Alliance.

931
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Need for Speed, Carbon.

932
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,160
Thereís a ton of stuff coming out on PSP and DS.

933
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,200
DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Starsign, Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery

934
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,720
Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS, and Zappy says ìI heard WTF is horrible.î I donít

935
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,240
know, I liked the demo at E3, it was kind of cute.

936
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,920
Well honestly, graphically, itís a crap game, but play-wise, the things that were in there

937
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,720
were just so crazy and out there, I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed

938
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,720
in their spare time, but it is so funny.

939
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,000
Also Pokemon Ranger is coming out, or actually came out.

940
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Right.

941
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,360
Plenty of suggestions for you, my friend.

942
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,440
Well, thereís not too much, given the upcoming busy schedule Iím going to have when I start

943
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,760
school in January, Iíve been trying not to get into too many handheld games because Iím

944
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,480
not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them, but I am

945
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,240
getting Final Fantasy III, Iíve planned on that, I do want Children of Mana, but Iím

946
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,120
thinking about borrowing it with my friends when sheís done with it, and Iím definitely

947
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,400
getting Elite Beat Agents.

948
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,760
That Iím definitely getting.

949
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,400
Oh yeah, am I getting it.

950
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,560
But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores, so if you like

951
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,800
your music games, Iím sure youíll like it.

952
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:53,000
Right now, though, I did just pick up the, I forgot the name of it again, the Surgery

953
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Game.

954
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Oh, Trauma Center.

955
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Trauma Center, yeah.

956
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,600
I remembered Under the Knife and I was like, oh yeah, Trauma Center, and Iím going to

957
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,960
be starting that coming up, so Iím looking forward to that.

958
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,280
I have to eventually steal our copy of Phoenix right from Danís DS so I can play it.

959
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Was that the end of the mailbag?

960
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,840
No, thereís more to this letter.

961
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
Oh, Iím sorry.

962
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,000
Iím also going to be playing, Iíve also got Loco Rocco on PSP, which I actually love.

963
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,400
To finish up with the emails, also I just wanted to rant briefly about the PS3.

964
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,200
Iím trying to want this system, but weíve got a Devil May Cry with no Dante and no Devil

965
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,000
Trigger and Metal Gear Game with Snake committing suicide.

966
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,440
Whatís next, a Street Fighter where Ryu gets tired of fighting?

967
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,520
To end things on a happy note, what are your guysí favorite alcoholic drinks?

968
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,520
I really enjoy a nice glass of Dewarís 12-year Scotch and Pale Ales, Oktoberfest, and other

969
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,160
tasty specialty beers.

970
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,640
Keep on rocking, Mr. Wonderful.

971
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,040
Iíve been getting into wine lately.

972
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,220
I know, arenít I weird, Iím getting snooty.

973
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:02,040
If I feel like drinking something a little fufu, Iíll have a lemon drop, but if Iím

974
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,680
going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.

975
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:14,800
If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios Motherfucker, thatís what itís called.

976
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,600
I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass Well tequila or I will be throwing up all

977
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,600
over everybody.

978
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,520
Thatís the one problem I have with an Adios is I donít like tequila, but otherwise itís

979
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,520
a good drink.

980
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,520
I like good tequila.

981
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:32,640
Olive Garden has this, if you like fufu drinks, Olive Garden has the tastiest mixed berry

982
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,640
daiquiri.

983
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,640
Oh, sangria!

984
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Thatís the other thing Iíve been hooked on lately.

985
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,280
Oh God, yeah, thatís my ultimate fufu drink.

986
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,640
I would say for wines, Iím a very big fan of sweet wines, so I like Umeshu, which is

987
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,480
a plum wine, actually real plum wine with the plums on the bottom of it, oh so good.

988
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:59,560
And I like Honey Runís, itís elderberry honey wine, itís basically a fruit mead.

989
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:04,600
I actually drink mead at Ren Faire, thatís the only time I actually have mead, because

990
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,560
when itís hot and youíre having this honey drink, it goes right to your head, and youíre

991
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:14,080
like, ìWow, Iím drunk.î My beer of choice is Shemay, the premier in the blue label,

992
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:19,560
and I also like Fat Tire, Bass, Guinness.

993
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,680
Rama in our chat room is pointing out, ìHey guys, you know we have underage people listening.î

994
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,680
Iím answering the email.

995
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,440
Donít drink until youíre 21, or 19 in Canada, or whatever it is.

996
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,920
Or whatever country youíre in, legal limit.

997
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,720
But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.

998
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,440
Hereís our moral thing, and we do believe this, we never drive when we drink, always

999
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,440
have a responsible driver, and just drink responsibly.

1000
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:49,680
And donít get drunk every night at home by yourself, because thatís a sign of depression,

1001
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,680
I think.

1002
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,720
Iím not going to say anything.

1003
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,640
I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.

1004
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,840
As long as youíre not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, thatís

1005
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
all.

1006
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Or an NBC Monday night movie.

1007
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,560
We got a last minute email.

1008
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,320
Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay, Jamieís evil, and Lokiís stupid for hating

1009
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,320
Max.

1010
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,320
Love DMN.

1011
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,320
Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.

1012
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,600
Wait, we didnít get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Mikol Tov.

1013
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,160
Mikol Tov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?

1014
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,160
I donít drink anymore.

1015
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
Why not?

1016
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,640
Because I think, well, I wonít say why, but it has to do with some time I shouldnít have

1017
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,000
drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.

1018
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,360
I see, I see, yes.

1019
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:44,520
But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave

1020
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,520
and Busterís.

1021
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,640
I donít even remember what they were called, but they were so good.

1022
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Ooh, chocolate martini.

1023
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,640
Oh, the grasshopper.

1024
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,640
The grasshopper.

1025
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,640
The frozen grasshopperís so good.

1026
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,000
Actually, Dave and Busterís has a really good lemon drop.

1027
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,120
All right, Loki, make it quick, we gotta get back to games.

1028
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,120
Screwdriver.

1029
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
All right.

1030
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,320
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send your emails, and maybe weíll get

1031
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,680
off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.

1032
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,000
Letís get back into some news.

1033
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Excellent.

1034
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,520
Anyways, so, weíve got, you know, we mentioned a lot of games coming out recently, and of

1035
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,160
course thereís going to be some more games coming out from EA, and during their last

1036
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:25,680
earnings announcement, they announced a bunch of new titles, some not a big surprise, some

1037
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:31,480
pretty cool, including Sims 3, which is a big duh, which is also going to be on the

1038
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:38,320
Wii and Playstation 3, next gen version of Black, a brand new SimCity game and Lord of

1039
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:49,640
the Rings, Crysis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring, and of course

1040
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:57,640
some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs, a brand new Road Rash game for next gen,

1041
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,080
and of course Burnout 5, itís been announced for a while now.

1042
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,720
Dude, new Road Rash?

1043
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
Yeah.

1044
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:11,120
Funny, I remember talking about Ghost Rider, part A, but whatever.

1045
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,920
You know, you want to know, ever since part A now, Iíve had Henry Rollins Ghost Rider

1046
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:15,920
running through my head.

1047
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,200
I have to go watch The Crow now.

1048
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,280
Okay, but anyway, things that, well, not surprising, Sony is warning of Playstation 3 pre-order

1049
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,280
scams.

1050
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,960
Theyíve issued a statement saying that websites offering discounted or book shipments have

1051
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,600
not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.

1052
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:45,600
The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or

1053
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,840
its parent company, SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as

1054
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,500
their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.

1055
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,840
We recommend consumers purchase Playstation products only from authorized SCEA retailers

1056
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,120
and resellers, which is a big duh anyway.

1057
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,160
You know, especially if youíre dealing with something thatís got a limited shipment,

1058
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:09,960
donít order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.

1059
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,960
Common sense people.

1060
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,960
All right.

1061
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,960
So thatís it.

1062
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,120
All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last minute story because weíre about to

1063
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:21,480
move into the Skype line and the other last minute stories.

1064
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,880
Tiger Claw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking

1065
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,680
about pre-ordering the Playstation 3.

1066
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,120
Apparently at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill

1067
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:37,420
out pre-order forms on bestbuy.com and it looked legit and everything.

1068
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,480
What happened I guess is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders

1069
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,000
using different accounts.

1070
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Very interesting.

1071
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,320
This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the

1072
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,520
public number and weíre assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.

1073
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:02,000
Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait and everybody that tried

1074
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,360
to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.

1075
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,400
So if you want one from Best Buy, youíve got to camp out for it.

1076
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,400
We have a new 800 number here, actually I should say 877 or a toll free number here

1077
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,240
at Orange Launch Radio and because of that reason weíve opened up our voicemails of

1078
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,240
the week again.

1079
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,000
I guess word hasnít gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week

1080
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,760
but it was pretty good so we want to play it for you guys right now.

1081
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,920
So here it is, a voicemail of the week.

1082
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,840
Hey, OLR, itís Paradox Vincent.

1083
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:35,720
Yeah, now on In the Guru versus DDR and how fair Konami is, I agree with Dark Sakura on

1084
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:41,960
it, they just totally stole it and on that note, I just think that Session, Delaunay,

1085
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:50,160
Rock from both and also I wanted to know if thereís any reason that the Xbox 360 version

1086
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:56,440
of Phantasy Star Universe canít play with its PC and PS2 buddies because I bought it

1087
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,800
and my friend bought it as well and we were all excited about it for months and months

1088
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,240
and we finally get in there and we try lots of different channels and we canít find each

1089
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:12,400
other so we finally end up on Segaís official site and it says ìOh goody, we can play with

1090
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,240
Japanese playersî but some of them canít speak English so I donít really see the point

1091
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:25,640
in this and theyíre just kind of losing a bigger server base and I really just donít

1092
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:30,720
see the point in this so yeah, just keep it up with the show guys and Iíll be listening

1093
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,720
for a while.

1094
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,120
Alright, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week, we appreciate it.

1095
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,640
Mikl Tov, youíre a PSU whore, what did you think of the voicemail?

1096
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,200
So, because Iíve been playing Phoenix, right?

1097
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Objection!

1098
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,640
Because youíre doing false testimony, if youíve been following PSU for months and

1099
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:52,140
months, youíd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers

1100
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:58,520
were separate so you are wrong and you should not lie on the road.

1101
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,400
But why, why canít they be on the same server?

1102
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,800
Because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything, and Final

1103
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,360
Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.

1104
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,600
I always thought it was voice chat, it came down to the fact that 360 supported voice

1105
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,600
chat within parties.

1106
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:19,400
That could be it too, but you know what, who cares, have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.

1107
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Problem solved!

1108
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
Everyone play on PC!

1109
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Yeah, play on PC.

1110
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
Iím going to be playing both.

1111
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,400
Youíre going to play both?

1112
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,400
Iím playing both.

1113
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Thatís crazy hard to do.

1114
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,400
Youíre crazy.

1115
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
You are crazy.

1116
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,320
How you donít get in the set in that game, I couldnít support more than one character

1117
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,320
on one system.

1118
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:39,520
Well, no, a friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.

1119
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:45,440
So I was like, well okay, itís $10 a month, itís like, what, two burritos?

1120
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:51,160
So I said, well okay, Iíll play on the PC, and itís something I can do while Iím doing

1121
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,720
my live journal or doing other stuff.

1122
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,320
Thatís how I did PSO.

1123
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,960
And I can carry it around on my laptop.

1124
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,760
Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.

1125
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:02,360
Iím actually looking for, because if I get my iMac, Iím planning on dual formatting

1126
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,720
it, so I can run Windows on my iMac.

1127
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:10,280
Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.

1128
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:19,240
The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657, thatís toll free in the US and Canada.

1129
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:23,620
Hey, weíll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we

1130
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:28,160
only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this, we want to know if you

1131
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,400
are going to be camping out for a Playstation 3 or a Wii.

1132
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,120
And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you

1133
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,720
camping out for and why.

1134
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,960
And what are your plans for camping out?

1135
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,380
What story are you going to go to?

1136
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,640
Are you going with a big group of friends?

1137
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,880
We want to know what your camp out plans are for.

1138
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,160
Even if youíre not camping out, we want to know why youíre not camping out and sitting

1139
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,160
this one out.

1140
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,160
So we welcome your voicemails.

1141
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:57,800
Weíll play some of our favorites next week, 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.

1142
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,720
Now weíre going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge

1147
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,360
Letís go to the phones.

1148
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,600
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1149
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,600
Who is this?

1150
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,600
Itís Ronma.

1151
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:19,600
No, Iím just kidding.

1152
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,600
Itís DMN.

1153
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,600
Hey, DMN.

1154
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,600
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1155
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
DMN.

1156
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,600
Not much.

1157
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:30,760
I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the week here, and Iíd like

1158
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,000
to share my opinion of them.

1159
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,840
Heís a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early on.

1160
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,840
I know.

1161
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
You get it early on.

1162
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,840
Whatís your opinion on?

1163
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,940
Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding

1164
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,160
of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.

1165
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:52,600
The gameplay is exactly like Oh and Don, it has the same comic book feel to it, itís

1166
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:58,360
freaking hilarious, and surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.

1167
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:03,400
The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four

1168
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,360
songs, and it doesnít really adjust well into the next difficulty, because those last

1169
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:13,400
three or four songs on medium are so incredibly hard, and then the first four or five on the

1170
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,400
next hardest difficulty are easy.

1171
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:23,680
What Iím curious about, are songs like the Avril Lavigne song and stuff, are they grossly

1172
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,320
out of place, or do they somehow work?

1173
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:31,440
A lot of them are grossly out of place, Iíll be honest.

1174
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:38,720
Avril Lavigneís skater boy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some

1175
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,940
lady is about to have a baby.

1176
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:45,560
What about Canned Heat, whatís that stage like?

1177
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:52,580
The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy of a Japanese motor company, his son goes through

1178
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:57,720
the rival motor company whoís stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.

1179
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,860
That makes a lot of sense.

1180
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,860
It does.

1181
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:04,280
Okay, what about the other game you picked up, quickly?

1182
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,520
Magical Star Sign is a very very good RPG, I would recommend it as more so of a beginning

1183
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:17,840
RPG, I enjoyed it, my only beef with it was that it felt very linear, basically it said

1184
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:22,960
go here, go here, it didnít really make it fun, I havenít had a chance to try the multiplayer

1185
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:28,480
mode on it, unfortunately, so I canít give any information on that, but Iíd recommend

1186
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:35,760
it, itís a fun RPG, itís got a lot of fun little words of text in it, it keeps up with

1187
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:40,080
the times, I would highly recommend it.

1188
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:46,000
Alright, sounds good, well that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking

1189
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,840
for good DS and portable games.

1190
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,960
Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?

1191
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,960
Umm, no.

1192
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,480
Alright, then weíre going to another call, hey weíll see you pretty soon, okay?

1193
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,480
Alright, take care.

1194
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,480
Later.

1195
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:06,840
Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on the Skype line, itís 1-877-GAME-OLR,

1196
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:15,760
thatís 1-877, what the hell are the numbers there, 426-3657, so letís go to another call

1197
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,960
here on the Skype line.

1198
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,640
Hi, youíre on Orange Launch Radio, whoís this?

1199
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,680
Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.

1200
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,960
Hey, Jeremy Todd 1, whatís on your mind?

1201
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:30,600
I got luminous for cell phones a couple of days ago.

1202
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,600
Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week, how was it?

1203
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,200
Itís pretty good so far, I think they did a pretty good job on it.

1204
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,560
I have not heard what to say about it.

1205
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,560
Okay.

1206
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,160
Iím doing a good job on this.

1207
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,160
Isnít it really surprising?

1208
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,160
What?

1209
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,160
Isnít it really surprising just how well it turned out?

1210
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:59,760
Yeah, Iím glad I bought it, itís $25 and itís pretty good, Jeremy, Iíve got to play

1211
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,760
you sometime.

1212
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,280
Can you play that one to Cell Network?

1213
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,280
I donít know, can you?

1214
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:08,280
I can actually.

1215
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
Really?

1216
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
Thatís kind of cool.

1217
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,280
Like with Joolz, you could do that.

1218
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,280
Oh, thatís cool.

1219
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:23,840
Yeah, Iíve played a few matches with online and thereís no lag either.

1220
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,960
Do I hear somebody playing that in the background?

1221
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:28,640
Turn down the damn music in the studio.

1222
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,640
Alright, well cool, then I guess maybe this is a mobile game Iíll have to seek out and

1223
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,800
find, I donít know, weíll see.

1224
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,040
Any other mobile games youíve been playing lately?

1225
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,400
No, Luminous is the only cell phone game I bought.

1226
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,240
Iím not into cell phone gaming much.

1227
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:49,200
Alright, Jeremy, tell one any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1228
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,880
Gears of War Tuesday.

1229
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,480
I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.

1230
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,480
Alright, take care, buddy.

1231
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
Have a good one.

1232
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,480
Bye.

1233
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,480
Yep, you too.

1234
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,480
Thanks.

1235
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,480
Bye.

1236
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,120
Alright, weíre going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1237
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,160
Hello, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1238
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,160
Whoís this?

1239
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,520
Well, hello, how are you guys?

1240
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,520
Iím good.

1241
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,520
Who is this?

1242
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,760
You know who the fuck this is, Rob.

1243
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:19,000
If Iím not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who

1244
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,320
we announced in part A, is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon,

1245
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,320
yes?

1246
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:25,880
Yes, Iíve crossed over to the dark side.

1247
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
Thatís right.

1248
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,960
I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said youíll never do anything

1249
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,800
with us, and yet, hell has apparently frozen over.

1250
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,000
And to go back to something way back in the USO times, I tried to get over the rainbow,

1251
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
and I couldnít.

1252
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,960
Thatís an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I.

1253
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,920
Thatís all right, folks who maybe have been following the Understation Live for years

1254
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:50,920
might follow.

1255
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:51,920
You know we do have some folks here.

1256
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,280
Itís still every other year, right?

1257
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:55,280
What was that?

1258
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,280
Still every other year.

1259
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,840
What, did we do a USO?

1260
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,840
No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.

1261
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,840
Oh, thatís all right, itís an even year.

1262
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
Yeah.

1263
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
What does that mean?

1264
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,600
That means Iíll be gay next year.

1265
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,240
Oh, looking forward to that.

1266
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:17,080
All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience,

1267
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,840
what do they have to look forward to?

1268
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,480
You mean you couldnít tell by the promo?

1269
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,600
Well, yeah, it was a little geeky.

1270
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,960
Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didnít get it.

1271
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:27,960
Iím out there.

1272
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:28,960
Itís the trailer.

1273
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:29,960
Itís fantastic.

1274
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,960
It is.

1275
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,360
It is from the season one teaser that they used for the Ninth Doctor, yeah, the Ninth

1276
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,360
Doctor.

1277
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,440
Which I think is fantastic.

1278
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,880
Iím big, Iím, you know, out there.

1279
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,360
Now, youíre going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and

1280
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,200
everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us, right?

1281
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,200
Yeah.

1282
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,240
So, if youíre a Doctor Who fan, a Battlestar fan, a sci-fi fan, youíve got to tune in

1283
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:59,120
to the Travis Donovan experience.

1284
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,400
Travis Donovan Live, otherwise known as TDL.

1285
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,120
TDL, sounds like fun.

1286
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,000
What time on Saturday are you going to be?

1287
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:15,280
Starting right now for about 9 oíclock Central Standards, which is 7 Pacific, 10 on the East.

1288
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,560
Alright, sounds good.

1289
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,240
Do you talk games on your program too?

1290
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,640
Are you going to talk any games?

1291
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,000
I will be.

1292
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,440
Games that Iím currently playing, which is not a lot, but there are games that Iím out

1293
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,620
there playing, but we will be talking sci-fi and geek, like I will be going on a tirade

1294
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:34,400
of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television.

1295
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,400
Excellent.

1296
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,240
And stuff like that, current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my

1297
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,520
twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.

1298
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:50,300
Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast

1299
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,880
version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?

1300
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,360
I am looking into that.

1301
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,640
Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.

1302
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:00,640
Alright.

1303
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,900
Well, everybody tune in on Saturday, come and chat, support Travis and then heíll see

1304
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,640
he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.

1305
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,280
Yes, definitely show up and let me know whatís going on.

1306
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:16,320
Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, youíll

1307
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,360
see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.

1308
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,160
Also, Iím going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Robís greater

1309
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,880
moments in USL history.

1310
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,520
Jesus, alright.

1311
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:32,680
I guess just encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.

1312
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,680
Get Rob blackmail.

1313
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,680
Thatís nice.

1314
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:41,200
Yeah, and Iíll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie who has

1315
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:45,640
a sense of decency and politeness, itís all so small, itís a small percentage of her

1316
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,640
being.

1317
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,920
I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.

1318
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,880
No, I was actually going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only

1319
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:00,000
emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.

1320
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,880
I think I stole my post-it though because it was pretty funny.

1321
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:04,880
Alright.

1322
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,880
It should be fun.

1323
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:10,840
Alright, well good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.

1324
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
You have been assimilated.

1325
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,600
No, in all seriousness, weíre very excited to have you on board and look forward to what

1326
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,640
youíre going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.

1327
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,800
Well, thank you.

1328
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
Thank you for having me.

1329
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:27,680
Iím glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show and guarantee

1330
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,800
controversy for geeks out there on the first show.

1331
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,200
My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be cancelled and pull off the air.

1332
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,200
Ooh, sounds good.

1333
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:45,920
Actually given what Iíve heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly, I love Stargate, but yeah.

1334
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:46,920
What was I going to say?

1335
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,920
Something about, oh, forget it.

1336
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:48,920
I wonít.

1337
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:49,920
No, say it.

1338
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,120
No, I canít remember because Iím old.

1339
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,120
Tune in Saturday.

1340
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,120
Yes.

1341
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,120
Thatís all.

1342
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,120
Thatís Rob.

1343
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,120
Gay Alzheimerís.

1344
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,960
Rob, Iím hanging up on you now because I can do that now.

1345
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,960
Yes.

1346
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
All right.

1347
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
Have a good one, Travis.

1348
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:04,960
You too.

1349
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,960
Bye.

1350
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:06,960
Oh, God.

1351
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,960
Did we make a mistake inviting him on?

1352
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:08,960
I donít know.

1353
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,560
No, but sadly, Iím not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.

1354
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:14,560
I donít know.

1355
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,360
I might call in and debate some sci-fi, but for right now, we got to go to another call

1356
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,360
that maybe we can debate with.

1357
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
Hi, youíre on Orange Lounge Radio.

1358
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
Whoís this?

1359
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
Hey, guys.

1360
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,360
This is Foodie Monster.

1361
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,360
Hi, Foodie Monster.

1362
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
Whatís on your mind?

1363
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
Itís pretty lame, man.

1364
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:31,080
Iíll tell you that this whole East Coast, West Coast thing is high me up the roof, seriously.

1365
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:34,920
You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries

1366
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,600
even that stay up very late.

1367
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
You guys are hardcore.

1368
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,880
Youíve earned your OLR badge of honor.

1369
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,480
Just every other night.

1370
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:43,320
Whatís on your mind, buddy?

1371
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,760
I just wanted to share something that popped up in my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted

1372
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,120
to write about it, but Iím just sure I will call.

1373
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,420
I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you got

1374
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,420
to think about it.

1375
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:00,360
Games arenít going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped, and

1376
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,960
thatís not just United States, Europe and Japan.

1377
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:09,000
Thatís South America, thatís Central America, thatís Africa.

1378
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,840
Those places also need to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be

1379
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,280
really mainstream.

1380
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,280
Movies are everywhere.

1381
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:23,040
You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you wonít find too much gaming

1382
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,040
in Africa.

1383
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,360
Thatís an interesting perspective.

1384
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,800
Iíve never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how

1385
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,440
ìOh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesnít include

1386
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:39,960
Europe when that whole thing went down.î A lot of people sometimes donít consider

1387
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:42,200
any launch thatís been claimed to be worldwide.

1388
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:46,160
I donít think theyíve ever truly worldwide launched a system.

1389
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,320
I think, and correct me if Iím wrong, I think the Wii is the closest weíre getting.

1390
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,020
They are launching the Wii in a ton of countries, but still, we are missing out on places like

1391
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:59,880
Africa, like you said, certain African countries, and certain South American countries as well.

1392
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,280
It goes beyond that.

1393
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,240
Thereís no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance,

1394
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,960
like not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any countries of America that has official

1395
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,960
distribution of games.

1396
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:18,480
Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distribution of licensing here

1397
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,600
in Argentina, but then they pulled out.

1398
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,840
Now, everything you buy is like grey market stuff, itís like click-sync, but only people

1399
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:32,680
import it here, and you pay like, seriously, today a PS2 here is $300.

1400
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,800
You mentioned that, wait, you said the PS2 is $300?

1401
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:37,800
Yeah.

1402
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
Thatís double the price.

1403
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,480
I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, ìWait a minute.î

1404
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,660
So gaming is more expensive generally in the other countries.

1405
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:51,200
Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up like a Nintendo of Argentina

1406
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,200
or whatever?

1407
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:58,360
Well, I mean, they should at least have like a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent

1408
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:02,040
to make things cheaper for all the markets.

1409
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,440
Is there enough of a demand?

1410
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,680
I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35

1411
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,680
million people.

1412
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:10,680
I would say yes.

1413
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,680
Interesting.

1414
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,680
Interesting.

1415
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:13,680
I mean, sure.

1416
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,880
I mean, itís not as much, probably thatís why they didnít do it, because thereís not

1417
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,760
much market, you know.

1418
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:20,760
Interesting.

1419
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,560
I mean, if you consider it with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in

1420
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,400
general, itís not enough market, I guess.

1421
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,400
Hmm.

1422
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,640
Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.

1423
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,640
We appreciate that.

1424
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:36,120
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?

1425
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:41,080
No, but I have a quick a few of my mocha dice, and now I canít play my backups, which has

1426
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,360
to be very sad.

1427
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,360
Sorry to hear it.

1428
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,360
All right.

1429
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,360
Have a good one, buddy.

1430
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,360
Thanks for calling.

1431
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,360
Okay.

1432
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,360
You too, guys.

1433
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,360
Later.

1434
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:51,360
Okay.

1435
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,360
Thanks.

1436
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,360
Thank you.

1437
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,360
Muah.

1438
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:55,360
One more call.

1439
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,360
What, Miklotov?

1440
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,360
Okay.

1441
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,360
Letís go to one more call here.

1442
01:20:58,360 --> 01:20:59,360
Hi.

1443
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,360
Youíre on Orange Laundry Radio.

1444
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:01,360
Whoís this?

1445
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,360
Hey.

1446
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,360
This is Paradox Vincent.

1447
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,360
Hi, Paradox Vincent.

1448
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,360
Hey.

1449
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,360
You left us the voicemail.

1450
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,360
Yes.

1451
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,360
Ah.

1452
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,360
Whatís on your mind?

1453
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,360
Oh.

1454
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,360
Did it get played?

1455
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,360
Yeah.

1456
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:13,360
We actually played your voicemail, and Miklotovó

1457
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,360
Called you a liar.

1458
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:15,360
Yeah.

1459
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,580
Miklotov called you a liar, because he said if youíve been following the Phantasy Star

1460
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,920
Universe thing, like he said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers

1461
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:20,920
were separate?

1462
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:21,920
Yeah, I win.

1463
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,920
Good job.

1464
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,920
You won the case, Miklotov.

1465
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,920
Good job.

1466
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:25,920
Yes.

1467
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:26,920
I'm the best finisher.

1468
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:34,360
In all seriousness, paradox Vincent, what's on your mind tonight?

1469
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:40,200
Well I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.

1470
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,880
Yeah, what's on your mind?

1471
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:52,400
Well I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because, I don't know, it was just

1472
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,680
kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.

1473
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,760
So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?

1474
01:21:58,760 --> 01:21:59,760
Yes.

1475
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:04,160
And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?

1476
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:08,400
You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction

1477
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,400
crap aside?

1478
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:18,040
Yeah, kind of, because I didn't really see it being so overblown, kind of like the Gran

1479
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,360
Turismo HD.

1480
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,120
Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.

1481
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,120
I guess that's true.

1482
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,280
Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and the Gran Turismo certainly

1483
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,160
kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.

1484
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,440
I suppose that's true.

1485
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,840
So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?

1486
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,920
What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?

1487
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:44,360
Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you

1488
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:46,320
that kind of gets you into it?

1489
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:54,880
Yeah, it's kind of that because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see

1490
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,600
just like a giant leap in the resolution.

1491
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,600
You know what though?

1492
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,180
Miklotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution

1493
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,600
was sometimes a problem in Luminous?

1494
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:13,600
Yeah, I think that it gets too bright and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring

1495
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,840
at it over and over for hours on hours.

1496
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,400
I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those Luminous stages make

1497
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,600
me want to have a seizure.

1498
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,960
Yeah, that one in the basic pack, I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue

1499
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:28,360
and neon pink.

1500
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,160
That hurts my eyes.

1501
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:34,200
It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.

1502
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,200
I hate that one.

1503
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,840
I hate that one from the stupid first game.

1504
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,840
What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?

1505
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:44,960
Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?

1506
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,440
What else do you think you're going to buy?

1507
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:54,560
It kind of depends on the artist pack because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shih, then

1508
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:59,480
I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard from, I think it was maybe Luminous

1509
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:03,480
2 for the PSP that had them.

1510
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,380
I'm a giant fan of those.

1511
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:10,440
But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?

1512
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:15,240
Yeah, kind of.

1513
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,840
Do you like that?

1514
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,020
The folks that are supporting the microtransactions in Luminous say, I kind of like being able

1515
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,960
to build the game the way I want it.

1516
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,360
If I don't want missions, I take them out.

1517
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,360
Do you like that?

1518
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,120
Is that appealing to you?

1519
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:34,380
I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.

1520
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:41,720
I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions but made

1521
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:47,320
them very small and very typecasted.

1522
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:51,040
Do you think they added charge per skin?

1523
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,040
Charge per skin?

1524
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:53,040
In Luminous?

1525
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,040
It's different.

1526
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,940
That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't

1527
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:00,000
like, like that bird one that's green and white.

1528
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I hate that stage so much.

1529
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,600
Paradox Vinson, thanks so much for calling in.

1530
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,600
We've got to move on.

1531
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:12,080
Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?

1532
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,800
Not really kind of a final thought, but yeah, all right.

1533
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:17,800
Okay.

1534
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,520
Have a good one, buddy.

1535
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,520
Thanks for calling in.

1536
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:22,520
All right.

1537
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,520
You too, guys.

1538
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,520
Keep it up.

1539
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,520
Bye.

1540
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,240
Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.

1541
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,240
Think of something clever to say.

1542
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,200
Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have come up with something better.

1543
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,360
He admitted you pwned him.

1544
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:33,360
I know because I'm awesome.

1545
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,680
What a nice guy.

1546
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,680
I would have tried to fight you.

1547
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:36,680
I would have taken you out.

1548
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,880
I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.

1549
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,120
Do you want to do one more call?

1550
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:42,120
One more call?

1551
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,120
We're running a little long.

1552
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,120
We have time for one more call?

1553
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,120
One more?

1554
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,120
What do you guys think?

1555
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:47,120
One more?

1556
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,120
All right.

1557
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,120
One more.

1558
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,120
Sure.

1559
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,120
Let's do it.

1560
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,120
Hi.

1561
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,120
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1562
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,120
Who's this?

1563
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,120
It's Zappy from the chat room.

1564
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,120
It's who?

1565
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,120
Zappy from the chat room.

1566
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,120
Hi, Zappy.

1567
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:03,720
I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for the past week and a half, and it's actually

1568
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,720
pretty decent.

1569
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:09,160
I don't find this missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.

1570
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,160
Wait.

1571
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,160
Which game was this again?

1572
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,160
Because you're cutting out a little bit.

1573
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,160
Oh, sorry.

1574
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:17,400
Medal of Honor for the PSP.

1575
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,640
You're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying or what?

1576
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,640
Yes.

1577
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:28,080
You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually be controlling

1578
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,080
pretty well.

1579
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:36,640
I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing

1580
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:39,160
PCT, first person shooters.

1581
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:43,160
Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.

1582
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:48,760
Knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first

1583
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,760
person shooters.

1584
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:55,280
I kind of like Prey and I really like my old school Doom and Quake 3 and stuff.

1585
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,680
Try to sell me on this game.

1586
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,000
What's in this game that I might enjoy?

1587
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,840
Well, probably the best part of it is the 3D player multiplayer.

1588
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:08,720
It has all the modes and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's

1589
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:11,440
a pretty good selling point.

1590
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,160
You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.

1591
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,160
That's kind of cool.

1592
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Okay.

1593
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:16,160
I like.

1594
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:20,160
I think Capcom only has 16 players in it.

1595
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:21,600
Well, thank you for the review of the game.

1596
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,200
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?

1597
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:28,200
Well, I'll probably go to the Arcadia convention next week and I'll give you some hands-on

1598
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,560
how it is.

1599
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,680
Are you not far from Montreal?

1600
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,680
I'm in Montreal.

1601
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,280
Oh, right on.

1602
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,280
What other kinds of stuff?

1603
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,520
Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?

1604
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,480
Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystiq, although I haven't seen

1605
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:49,040
any real advertisements on Billboards, no, not Billboards, but the pamphlets or anything.

1606
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,720
I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.

1607
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,840
That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign

1608
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:58,880
or maybe flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.

1609
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,440
Well, if this is the second you're doing it, I didn't go last year, but they're going to

1610
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,880
have the Wii and a bit change early, so I just want to try it out.

1611
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,440
Yeah, that's true because Nintendo is one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're

1612
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,440
going to see the Wii.

1613
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:13,440
That's pretty cool.

1614
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,040
You can only go to Arcadia.

1615
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:21,200
We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.

1616
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,280
We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.

1617
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,760
Great to hear.

1618
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:25,760
All right.

1619
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:26,760
Have a good one, Zappi.

1620
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:29,120
We got to let you go and get the show over with, but have a good one.

1621
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,120
Thanks for calling in.

1622
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,120
All right.

1623
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,120
Have fun at Arcadia.

1624
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:33,120
Later.

1625
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,120
All right.

1626
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,120
Oh, that was a hang-up noise.

1627
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,120
All right.

1628
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,240
Well, thank you guys so much for calling in.

1629
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,160
We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.

1630
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,880
It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get

1631
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:48,000
through every week are getting frustrated, but surely you guys can understand we want

1632
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,780
to get as many different perspectives as we can, but we're just running a little long

1633
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:56,160
and about out of time, but I will ask really quickly in studio, are there any last-minute

1634
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,160
questions?

1635
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,160
Those of you guys that didn't get through could always leave a voicemail.

1636
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,160
Exactly.

1637
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,680
You could always leave a voicemail of the week, so try that.

1638
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:01,680
Please leave a voicemail.

1639
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,680
Yeah, please do.

1640
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,160
Any last-minute stories here in studio?

1641
01:29:05,160 --> 01:29:07,400
Yes, of course.

1642
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,400
You first.

1643
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,400
Okay.

1644
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,120
The last one I have is the one you pointed out to me.

1645
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,120
Oh.

1646
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,120
Okay.

1647
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:18,160
Well, anyways, I was going to say if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's

1648
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,120
a couple of websites you might want to check out.

1649
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,120
First ps3seeker.com.

1650
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,120
You can check it out.

1651
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:29,120
They actually are tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target

1652
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:35,960
locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii or PS3, and then

1653
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,280
of course the Wii would be ps3seeker.com slash Wii.

1654
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,640
So check that out as well for the Wii.

1655
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:46,260
And then some other things.

1656
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:52,200
Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too

1657
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:58,840
happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.

1658
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:04,840
That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.

1659
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:09,240
You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon, because apparently Gears of War

1660
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,960
is in their store right now, or at least it's some Best Buys.

1661
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,360
Uh oh, broken street date.

1662
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:16,360
Oopsie.

1663
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,360
Oh well.

1664
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,440
So you might want to check and see if you can score a copy early, because that would

1665
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,440
be pretty cool.

1666
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,800
And of course there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.

1667
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,560
Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.

1668
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:33,640
I'm not sure how well that would play, and then PSP is getting Pump It Up in Korea, so

1669
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:36,360
that's kind of interesting.

1670
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:43,320
And also something that I thought was very strange, the Blu-Ray, since the Blu-Ray drives

1671
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:47,600
are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot

1672
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:51,960
of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive,

1673
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,440
which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.

1674
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:58,720
For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install five gigs of the game onto your

1675
01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,320
hard drive, and imagine all these other games doing the same thing.

1676
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,760
That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.

1677
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:14,360
And finally, with the fall update for the 360, adding 1080p support, unfortunately some

1678
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:22,320
of the Sony 1080p LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.

1679
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,960
Isn't that ironic, isn't it?

1680
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,580
Don't you think?

1681
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:27,580
It's like Ray Yang.

1682
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,580
Hey, hey, no Alanis.

1683
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:29,580
All right.

1684
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:37,480
There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier, it was on Dick.com, but I found actually

1685
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,080
a bit more about it on magazine.com.

1686
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:44,240
You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.

1687
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:53,320
A working Lego Pinball Machine, yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.

1688
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,020
So that's so freaking cool.

1689
01:31:56,020 --> 01:32:00,400
I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.

1690
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,960
There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two player.

1691
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:09,200
And the rumor is coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that

1692
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:14,480
both state that Zelda is one of the two players.

1693
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:17,560
So that's kind of interesting, I guess we'll have to find out.

1694
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:18,560
Hmm.

1695
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,760
Sure, it's not just a misprint or something?

1696
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,320
It could be, but it's two different places, so I don't know, what else?

1697
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:30,480
All right, well, gosh, we're kind of running long tonight, so we had a long bonus segment,

1698
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:35,280
of course, though, that unfortunately those of you guys that listen to us on the audio

1699
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,280
blog feed won't be able to hear it.

1700
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:41,280
Sorry, that's just incentive to listen live to us on OrangeLaundryDay.com or on AllGames.com.

1701
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:45,840
Hey, we've got to do something special for the live folks, surely you guys will understand.

1702
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,640
DMN has informed me of something.

1703
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,640
What's that?

1704
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,920
It's DJ Tyrant's birthday.

1705
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:52,920
Is it really?

1706
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:53,920
That's what he said.

1707
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:56,800
Well, happy birthday, that's right, I remember seeing something in the LJ about it, and I

1708
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:59,560
believe he is of the legal age of 21 now.

1709
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,560
Oh.

1710
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,400
So strippers and booze for you, my friend.

1711
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,680
It's also my mother's birthday.

1712
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:05,040
Oh, how nice.

1713
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:06,040
Yes.

1714
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:07,960
My mommy is 48 today.

1715
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:11,960
She told me she was 29, and I said, pardon my French mom, bullshit.

1716
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,200
All right, well, happy birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around

1717
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:17,200
this period.

1718
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:20,040
Maybe we should have a birthday list, and then right at the end of every show we'll

1719
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:22,000
say happy birthday to these listeners, we'll see.

1720
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,160
Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1721
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:30,000
Miklotov, thank you for your rare input, as always, but thanks for being the moral support

1722
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,320
you are for this program.

1723
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,460
Actually, you hate this show, don't you, so I'm not sure why you come on it, but what's

1724
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:36,460
your final thought anyway?

1725
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:37,960
I don't want to go to work tomorrow.

1726
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:38,960
And don't.

1727
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,960
Okay.

1728
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,800
Loki, what's your final thought?

1729
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:46,320
Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at U3.

1730
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
All right.

1731
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,000
Dark Sakura.

1732
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:57,120
Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.

1733
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:02,400
And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now, like pumpkin pie would

1734
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,400
be awesome.

1735
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:08,680
Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week, and so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.

1736
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:11,800
Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting independent radio.

1737
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,160
You guys are awesome.

1738
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,200
We couldn't do this without you.

1739
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,200
