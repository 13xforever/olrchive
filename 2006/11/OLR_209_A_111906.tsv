13914	15276	Tonight, November 19th, 2006.
15637	25090	Our own stories from the console lineups, a recent horror game causes controversy in Rome, and for those not ready to go to next gen, there's Dreamcast Love coming for ya.
32475	33516	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio
61741	62481	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers,
83044	84125	Drunami, Orange Lounge Radio 1 and Only
101687	104448	or the Isle of Lesbos, as I was saying over dinner.
104468	104769	All right.
123857	128000	All right, anyway, also say hello to somebody who's come from a long way away.
128421	132624	Certainly not the Isle of Lesbos, but the Isle of Redmond, Washington.
132664	135426	Say hello to Mr. DMN, John.
135667	136888	Hi, everybody.
137228	140330	And you guys know John because he calls into our show like all the frickin' time.
140591	140971	I don't.
141571	141892	Yes, you do.
142332	146155	And now he's here in studio with us.
146175	148777	Yeah, I'm actually going to call when the Skyplane's open.
149218	149358	What?
149458	149638	What?
150018	150158	What?
151635	152836	I'm going to do it right now, hold on.
152876	154217	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
154537	160781	What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day?
161261	164443	Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium.
165363	166924	And where do you work for a first-time listener?
167044	171046	I work at the magical land where wheeze flow like wine, Nintendo.
173208	173528	Really?
173708	173948	Yes.
174729	175489	Last I checked.
176344	180105	I sometimes have WeFlo when I drink a lot of wine, but I don't... Alright, forget it.
180145	180645	Bad joke.
180685	185147	Look, you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days, you're all gonna just die.
185647	187367	So, anyway, well, welcome to the show, DMN.
187387	187668	Thank you.
187688	188328	Thank you for having me.
188408	195710	And, you know, just having him here in the studio and, like, hanging out with us all weekend, it just proves, Orange Launch Radio listeners, stalking us works.
195870	196550	It really does.
196690	196810	Yeah.
196830	201592	Because here he is, and he violated me last night, and it was... No, I'm just kidding.
201652	202592	I'm totally joking.
202612	203733	That's not what you said.
203833	205013	You were... You were...
206360	207101	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
234662	235483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
253200	254121	Thank you for watching!
270721	272262	and we invite you guys to be nerdy with us.
272322	275604	So please, come to our chat room if you're listening to us live here on Sunday night.
275644	279506	If you're not listening to us on our audio blog, you can come join us in the chat room.
279926	282548	It's chat.orangelunchradio.com and guess what?
282608	289612	If you are listening live on this Sunday night, you definitely want to be here tonight because DMN, what did you bring with you for one of our random chatters tonight?
289972	290713	I brought a Wii.
292554	293834	Not my Wii, you sickos.
294135	295055	Get your head out of the gutter.
295095	296476	No, a Wii and a box with
297512	298352	and all that fun stuff.
299113	302374	And I do know we have a worldwide audience, but it should be said this is a U.S.
302554	303174	region Wii.
303194	311817	Yeah, this is a region one Wii, so I'm really sorry to all you Japanese, South American, Antarctican, European listeners.
312337	313937	It probably won't do you much good.
314157	314497	Yeah, sorry.
314518	315978	But if you want to win it that badly, you know.
316658	318200	All right, you got to be in chat.
318260	321323	It's going to be at some point tonight, more rules to come later.
321383	330911	But first, we usually start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week, but obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted by other madness going on out there.
330931	336196	And that would be the craziness going on around the PlayStation 3 and Wii lineups.
336696	338038	So first off, PlayStation 3.
338378	343102	I know a lot of us here in this room weren't really going to do the campout thing for the PlayStation 3.
343363	346626	You know, I've voiced previously on the program, I'm not ready for PlayStation 3.
347106	349308	It's just, there's no game out right now I really want.
349709	357016	Wake Me When Metal Gear Solid 4, Final Fantasy XIII, some of the big franchises are on their way, but I'm not into PS3 right now, and I think Loki's in a very similar camp.
357773	358654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
380231	384195	Wait, you see, I don't understand DarkSakura, because you tend to go back and forth.
384295	388498	You're like, some days you're very anti-PlayStation, some days you're very like, you better bring me that damn PlayStation.
388558	390320	No, I hate it, okay?
390440	390760	I hate it.
390800	393042	But I have to have every video game system that comes out.
393162	393483	I see.
393783	398087	So it's the collector in me that says, I want, and besides that, I want to play White Knights when it's out.
399248	401590	Why the hate for Sony PlayStation right now?
401870	404913	Because Ken Kudrag eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet and is leashed to the jungle gym.
405093	406114	I see, I see.
406919	407660	Thank you, Megzy.
408140	412003	But certain games are going to change your mind, like White Nights and things are going to change your mind later?
412163	413744	Well, White Nights I definitely want to play.
414244	422869	There's a few other things that I'm sort of curious about, but right now not curious enough that I would go out and wait in line for a PS3.
422889	426272	One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date.
426312	426612	Wow.
427428	428749	I'm going to interview him Monday.
429910	434392	Now, this is a lot of controversy going around around the PlayStation 3 launch.
434772	439455	Did your co-worker actually wait in the line to get a PlayStation 3 to play, or were they getting one to sell?
439895	440636	He was getting one to play.
441036	442357	Oh, well, that's admirable.
442517	443117	He got Madden.
443658	444278	Okay, I see.
444478	445479	I'm a sports game fan.
445499	446719	Yeah, I can see that.
446739	452383	If you're a hardcore sports game, you want to have the up graphics and all that cool stuff that comes with the new system.
452443	453003	Okay, I see that.
453877	458140	Alright, so more to come on PlayStation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers.
458240	459782	And, you know, I can say this.
459962	463645	I did touch the demo station they had at Target.
464105	468889	I randomly went to Target on, I think it was Wednesday I went there, Wednesday night.
468949	472231	I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house, like shampoo and stuff.
472531	474813	And there was already a line forming for the PlayStation 3.
475153	475954	And I just said hi.
476194	477515	I was like, PlayStation 3, right?
477555	478196	They're all, yeah.
478256	480958	So, you know, they were, you know, having fun just camping out.
481257	481778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
489958	492380	I gotta be honest, guys, I'm not feeling it.
492560	494822	I don't know, maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it.
494862	496724	I mean, again, I'm playing this in a Target.
497064	500827	I'm not sitting down on my couch with my, you know, surround and the HD and all that stuff.
500847	502028	I just, I wasn't feeling that.
502088	506732	I feel like, I don't know, Burnout's more of a racer for me, or even Test Drive was better.
506992	508273	I just wasn't feeling the Motorstorm.
508293	512897	I mean, granted, it's a different, it's, you know, a very different type of racer, but even, it felt kind of...
513357	514277	Thanks for watching!
531423	532904	That probably is the game I would pick up.
533085	533665	It would be that game.
534105	546496	Yeah, well, I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards the sports gamers and the hardcore because you usually see the people who, especially the sports games, who just come and will buy it without hesitation.
546516	552401	They always have the stupid Madden day where people, I've heard, camp out for it if that is the case.
552481	555464	It's kind of sad, but yeah, I see your point.
556384	556965	All right.
557403	558784	Well, so that was pretty much PlayStation 3.
559004	561466	Loki, did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week?
561506	563008	Did you play a demo station or anything?
563328	565930	I went by the Best Buy.
566010	570434	Actually, today it was funny because I went down there and it was completely dead and the station was open.
570954	574617	I saw Motorstorm, but it looks exactly the same when I saw it at E3.
574918	580222	Although the videos I've seen online look really cool and it made me want to get it at some point.
580682	583204	But, I don't know.
583325	584746	Then we saw that Lair...
585876	593502	Like the demonstration thing going on at Walmart that was frozen on Saturday.
594603	605751	So yeah, I don't really know how well the demo kiosks are working, but at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen, so I don't know.
606761	607461	All right.
607721	612522	Well, let's go to the chat room over at chat.orangelunchradio.com for some comments from our chatters.
612542	613762	They're like the invisible guests.
613782	615203	We love to be an interactive show.
615643	617443	So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there.
617483	617823	Let's see.
619143	623964	JeremyTaw1 says, Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mere toy?
624964	628645	Not when there's a profit to be made, as some people found out with PlayStation 3.
628945	630365	That was really their mere motivation.
630425	633006	It's like, hey, I make more money doing this than I do at my job.
633266	633546	I don't know.
634490	635732	Me, personally, I don't know.
636673	641438	The little angel that sits on my shoulder says, not a good idea, so I don't do it.
641559	645283	But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things.
646324	650048	Black Lab in our chatroom says, congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot.
651470	654914	We have some crazy news about those PlayStation 3 lines we'll get to a little bit later.
655495	664658	Okay, so after the PlayStation 3 launch, obviously, then the Wii line started forming, and that's kind of where we come in, because I think we've also voiced previously on the program that we have played Wii.
664978	677263	Wii is the cheaper option, and as we said earlier in the program, you know, we do this show as a hobby, not a job, so, you know, our day jobs only give us so much money, so the Wii is really, realistically, in my eyes, the more affordable console anyway.
677603	680084	So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up.
680444	682285	But Loki, you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii.
682305	683645	You had a Wii before a lot of people did.
683685	684305	How did this happen?
684966	698510	Because I work for a video and game distributor, and of course we get ours in early, like on Wednesdays when we got them in, so that we could ship them to our customers so that they would have them for the street date.
698710	706953	And me being the greedy bastard that I am, I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City, and so I had mine on Thursday.
708186	709947	and playing it ever since.
710807	712208	So you know what this meant, boys and girls.
712308	714048	Party at Loki's house on Friday.
715269	716269	So, right on.
717350	719230	So yeah, we played a little bit of the Wii there.
719290	722131	So then flash forward to last night when the real camping started.
722732	729174	Some of us were at dinner and we were at Strings and this little local Italian place.
729214	731795	I keep forgetting we're an international show so not everybody knows that.
732115	736777	And we were just sitting around and I don't know, like lightning just kind of struck and we were just kind of like
737549	743111	Dude, let's go buy cookies and orange soda and go around to lines and just hand out goodies.
743451	748452	Let's just go and talk to gamers, and Loki can tape it, maybe we can do a YouTube thing, and we'll just hand him stuff.
748492	759055	Because, you know, you read all those reports about people getting shot and stuff, but we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line that a lot more people were being very cordial, so we were like, let's go have fun, let's go meet some more nerds.
759435	760075	So we did.
760115	766117	We started at a local Target, we went to a Walmart, we went to GameStop, where people were lining up for the midnight launch.
766479	767581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
782320	786202	DMN, what did you think about our little experience doing the cookie patrol?
786462	787722	I thought that was a lot of fun.
787923	791404	You got to interact with a lot of people who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii.
792424	800528	I honestly think that most of those people in that line were there to play it, not to eBay it, whereas opposed to the PS3 people that are thinking, ooh, I can make double what I bought off this.
800788	802609	I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line.
803229	805391	A lot of these people were really good in line.
806191	806992	They had a lot of fun.
807432	809193	They seem to be very grateful for the cookies.
809694	812596	So if any of you are listening, hi and we love you.
813717	814577	Alright, very cool.
815318	818540	So anyway, one of our favorite, now we liked a lot of the people that we met.
818580	823624	I mean, it was kind of weird because we would walk up at first and some people were like, what are these guys going to do to us?
823664	825765	Do they have big BB guns or what's going to happen?
825785	827386	You're poisoning the cookies, Rob.
827467	829348	You're poisoning the cookies so you can get your wiggy.
829844	830965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
841815	843937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
867336	869177	Right on.
869437	872398	So getting back into this where Chris and Jamie, no, it's cool, it's cool.
873058	878880	So I called Jamie on my phone because I asked the Target Greatland line, I go, how many units are you guys getting here?
878900	879240	And they're like, 60.
880200	883661	And I'm looking at the line, I'm like, there's only like 25 people in this line.
883701	885342	This is like a great opportunity to line up.
885782	890743	So I called Jamie on my cell and I said, girl, if you want a Wii, get your butt down here.
891504	892304	You can get a Wii.
892604	893164	So what happened?
893444	894745	I interrupted something you were doing.
895065	896105	Somebody else had
896935	910223	This was just basically me being exhausted already, and somebody else said, oh yeah, the Target Greatlands are doing a midnight lunch, which part of my brain went bullshit, but the rest of me was so tired that I was like, yay, I'm gonna go!
910763	923711	We were actually, my friend Marissa, who I mentioned on the show a few times, she was in town, and she's a singer-songwriter from LA, and there was a singer-songwriter convention going on, just actually a few, at the, what was it, the...
924787	925227	Marriott?
925507	926507	Yeah, the Marriott.
926527	928608	Chris, we don't need to tell them all where I live.
928728	928968	Sorry.
929068	931429	That's all right.
931549	933569	So we were exhausted.
933609	934770	It was very claustrophobic.
934790	939671	They had blocked off an entire section just for the musicians, and everyone was like, oh, man.
939711	940911	And then Jamie calls me on my phone.
940931	942052	She's like, oh, where are you?
942132	943272	I'm like, I'm at the end of the hall.
943292	945893	She's like, oh, we need to go to Target right now.
947613	949033	I'm like, are you sick or something?
949053	951034	But I was just like, oh, it's like, where are you going to get a Wii?
953439	955079	I'm like, okay.
955640	959501	And since I'm hanging out with her, she's my ride, and I wasn't really expecting to get one.
959541	962481	Part of me was excited, too, because Megzi called earlier.
963182	964002	Oh, yeah, Megzi.
964062	965042	And was humping her Wii.
965122	967023	Yeah, she's like, I'm touching it!
967623	968483	I'm touching it!
970243	971084	That was her on the phone.
971124	971964	It was really, really funny.
974022	974262	DarkSakura!
995733	997054	It was really, really funny.
997114	999576	And then she parked and said, can we hang out with you guys?
1000097	1003599	And then someone, like, she wasn't really in the, you know, in the zone.
1003639	1006942	So let me clarify, DarkSakura used her celebrity to cut in line.
1007002	1009284	Yeah, she was, you're a bitch, Jamie.
1009324	1009964	I'm not a bitch.
1010024	1010224	No, no.
1010405	1010945	No, she's not.
1010985	1016629	She wouldn't have done it if, I mean, they were getting 60, and there was only like 20 people in line, so, you know, nobody was getting hurt, so.
1016809	1023434	But we ended up going there, and slowly it dawned on me, this is not a midnight launch, because it was like a half an hour until midnight.
1023454	1024075	It wasn't like a full launch.
1024806	1027328	It was like 11.30 something.
1028008	1030850	And I'm like, Jamie, this isn't a midnight launch.
1030870	1033993	She's like, it's not.
1034833	1038295	I was, again, already tired of having been around that many people.
1039376	1041658	It was really claustrophobic where we were with Marissa.
1041738	1044660	But we jumbled things around.
1044720	1049143	We ended up, what we were going to do is we were going to go back, wait with them until morning.
1050043	1050944	This is like at 1 o'clock.
1051536	1058381	We were going to wait with them, and then at one point I was going to go for coffee and donuts, which started off really weird, I just said, because we had to leave and go get stuff.
1058841	1061002	And I'm like, does anybody want anything while I'm gone?
1061022	1066046	And someone's like, oh, the eyes kind of looked and went, huh?
1066746	1067727	Someone's getting something?
1067767	1069168	I'm like, does anyone want coffee?
1070069	1071610	And everybody went, me? !
1072552	1080298	I think one thing we've kind of discovered through this whole process is that people are really not used to other people just wanting to do nice things for them.
1080578	1084261	Everyone was so shocked that I offered to get... Someone actually brought out their money.
1084281	1085202	I'm like, no, no, it's on me.
1085622	1089746	And they're like, oh... They looked at me with the weirdest look like I was giving them a razor.
1092708	1094169	It was so... Yeah, that kind of razor.
1094229	1095911	Like, killing yourself razor.
1095931	1096391	Not the phone.
1097152	1098633	But it's so...
1099383	1106050	Yeah, and by the time we got back and we waited until like 3.30, I said, all right, I'm going to go get coffee.
1106130	1111616	And I counted how many people were in line, and it was like just under 30, but to be safe, I said 35.
1112737	1117342	So I went to the Shell station down the street and said, I need 35 cups of coffee.
1118122	1118403	And they...
1119153	1123297	They gave me free powdered creamer and free sugar.
1123578	1126701	You know, the stuff that they have for that store only, for the Shell station.
1126721	1128783	Because if you buy 35 cups of coffee, you get this free.
1129183	1131266	I'm like, okay.
1131306	1135490	And I bought some other creamer, and I came back, and everyone was like, oh, coffee!
1136431	1137832	They were really, really, really happy.
1137892	1139374	I'm like, courtesy of Orange Lingerie, yeah.
1140384	1141905	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1161608	1163210	and so I said, okay, I get coffee.
1163550	1165952	But it didn't end there because you got donuts too.
1166012	1167093	I got crispy.
1167254	1168094	I got six.
1168114	1176182	Well, what happened was I bought too much coffee and where the Target is, there's a Best Buy just like in the same parking structure.
1176663	1179906	So I'm like, well, I've got too much coffee so I'm going to go see if they want some coffee.
1180464	1183287	And sure enough, the, oh my gosh, that line was longer.
1183307	1186451	Yeah, when we went to Best Buy with the cookies, they were running from the back to the front.
1186471	1189575	I'm like, dude, we're going to come up the line and like people are mobbing us for cookies.
1189715	1190396	But they were cool.
1190416	1191337	I like the Best Buy line too.
1191577	1194120	They had a big sign that said, we spawns here.
1194481	1196143	And I asked the guy, I'm like, what the hell does that mean?
1196183	1198746	And they're like, get it because it's going to spawn here in a couple hours.
1198866	1200328	I'm like, oh my God.
1201308	1204429	And I thought I was a nerd for doing a radio program on the internet.
1204489	1207470	Meanwhile, while Chris is running around in my car, which I'm like, my baby.
1207890	1208571	Your baby's fine.
1208591	1212652	Some kid asked to borrow my DS, and then I pulled up my micro to play.
1212772	1213953	Oh, can I play your micro?
1214493	1215113	What's this?
1215833	1217034	So I had to explain the micro.
1217434	1219414	This is a dead system, basically, here.
1219434	1221735	I have Puzzle Fighter.
1221855	1222656	What else do you have?
1224116	1225376	I have Kingdom Hearts.
1225977	1226937	I want to play Puzzle Fighter.
1226957	1229638	What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts?
1230982	1234764	Anyway, so we got too much coffee.
1234844	1237446	I went over to the Best Buy line, and they swarmed me.
1237666	1238687	I'm like, I'm coming back.
1238727	1243910	I had to make, I think, five trips to Shell Station to get that much cups of coffee.
1244010	1246991	And then I called out, does anyone want donuts?
1247572	1249653	And everyone perked up, donuts?
1249673	1251254	There was a security guard at Best Buy.
1251654	1254236	And he was like, oh, can you get me the cream-filled one?
1254336	1254596	Okay.
1257444	1259126	The security guard was so cute.
1259206	1260368	He looked so tired.
1260828	1262931	And he's like, can you get me a coffee?
1263111	1264273	I'm like, yeah, I'm coming back with more.
1264954	1267657	And people just liked it.
1267737	1270601	I bought six dozen donuts.
1271181	1271622	And what?
1271722	1273805	Six dozen plus one for the guard.
1275373	1276814	I made sure I got him the cream custard.
1276834	1278054	That is so cute.
1278774	1281255	And all the time I said, courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio.
1281915	1285416	You gave mad pimpage to our show, Chris, and for that we love you.
1285976	1289777	But you weren't doing it just, I mean, the promo for the show was just a bonus, right?
1289897	1302300	Yeah, well, I was, you know, I'm not really on this show that often, but I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge because I was hanging out with Jamie, and I really wanted to, you know, it's like, you guys have been sweet to me, so I figured, hey, you know.
1302844	1304205	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1332915	1335996	The goodness of my heart doesn't factor in at all.
1336896	1343778	But, you know, there's a couple old people in the Best Buy line, and they were so grateful for that coffee, it made my day.
1344218	1346319	Dude, one guy in the Great Land line had a beer.
1346519	1348439	I saw that.
1348839	1357062	There was a guy there who said, hey, and he's really cool, we were talking about ThinkGeek and different t-shirts and the joys of Firefox.
1357942	1361203	And he's like, I got some beer if you want some.
1362631	1364232	and I was like, what kind?
1365313	1365713	Bass.
1366854	1368274	Ooh.
1368735	1375579	Because for anyone who doesn't know, I love beer a lot and I'm trying to cut down on my beer consumption.
1376179	1377540	So I was sorely tempted.
1377580	1380001	I was like, Bass, I love you.
1380281	1381082	Give me beer.
1381322	1381922	Oh, wait, no.
1382823	1386045	Because the whole problem with that is the guys are going around the corner to pee.
1387677	1390438	I don't have the equipment to go around the corner and pee.
1390498	1394178	Well, you could, but it's just not as sanitary.
1394819	1402380	Okay, I'm in an awkward position on the floor, right next to Rob's legs, but somebody in the chatroom asked me how much money I spent.
1402440	1403400	I can't tell who that is.
1405901	1407201	Oh, FootyMonster, probably.
1407221	1408662	FootyMonster, they asked me how much money I spent.
1410202	1410482	Enough.
1410942	1411242	Enough.
1411842	1414663	It was my money, though, so Orange Lounge will continue to...
1415495	1419339	Spend all of the money that they get on your crackin' booth.
1419859	1424484	I would also like to add something that's kind of funny according to NextGenWars.com.
1427167	1428628	It looks like Wii is beating out PlayStation 3.
1429769	1431251	Well, they have more units at launch.
1431311	1433193	I mean, that's kind of, I mean, to be fair.
1433293	1435375	Well, I mean, but they basically got a greater market share.
1436038	1436659	Slept in his car!
1436699	1436959	That's fine.
1457885	1463969	No, Extrovert was really cool because I didn't feel like camping out and I was like, you know, I like my warm bed.
1464429	1466450	I'll just pick up a Wii at the second shipment.
1466490	1467451	They're going to keep coming.
1467511	1467871	I'm cool.
1468211	1470633	But Extrovert was like, I'll gamb out if you want one.
1470913	1472314	I'm like, okay, here's money.
1472494	1472934	Have fun.
1473314	1474095	So you did it.
1474275	1476616	This is the best thing ever.
1476796	1478638	I love spending money when it's somebody else's.
1479278	1479758	I do.
1480058	1484041	I found that spending money when it's not your own
1484648	1486909	is very, it's a very nice thing.
1487490	1490011	Now, before I forget, by the way, Bandit sent me the link.
1506801	1510024	They gave out tickets and didn't even honor them and all this junk.
1510084	1515729	So I have to admit, hearing these stories on the internet about stores that had failed launches previously made me a little bit nervous.
1515769	1516930	But you came back.
1516970	1519011	You walked through the door and you were like, I love Target.
1519171	1520453	I love Target.
1520513	1521273	What made it so great?
1521293	1521774	What happened?
1521794	1522394	How did it go down?
1523855	1531422	First of all, the store manager himself was outside and letting everybody know exactly what's going to happen before the store opened.
1531842	1533964	Excuse me, I have to burp.
1536949	1538170	This is great radio.
1540011	1541613	Sorry, it just took some airborne.
1541653	1544215	Man, you can't blame me.
1546537	1554623	So basically the store manager explained everything and then we were in line.
1554663	1558426	They handed out things for us to fill out as to which games we wanted to get.
1559062	1569631	and then they kind of escorted us into the store where we handed them the flyer that we filled out and then they got everything for us and then sent us to a register.
1569971	1574414	It was very, very, very, very organized, well organized.
1575435	1577577	No glitches, nobody upset.
1577657	1580860	Everybody knew they were going to get one, that was going to get one.
1581080	1582861	It was wham, bam, thank you ma'am, Chris.
1583722	1585043	It was very, very convenient.
1585214	1585855	Yes, it was.
1586075	1591199	And I even told the lady that walked me over to the register that I appreciated it.
1591359	1592920	What the hell?
1593460	1595342	And so that's the end.
1595442	1595642	Bye.
1596570	1598431	All right, well, thank you, Extover, for sharing that.
1598951	1600631	I just got linked to the best site ever.
1600891	1603372	Did you also, your website, the week's later in the show, did you?
1603852	1606213	No, this is, well, I might make this next week's.
1606473	1609214	All right, did you find the process to be just as great?
1609374	1610514	Oh, yeah, very smooth.
1610894	1612235	But I laughed at the stupid woman.
1613555	1615195	Oh, my gosh.
1616136	1617736	The prettiest looking woman.
1618216	1620097	There were, like, actually walks up from her SUV.
1623064	1626466	And she's all in her skirt and her high heels looking all prissy, prissy, prissy.
1626906	1627826	And she walks to the end of the line.
1627846	1628827	And she walks with an attitude.
1628887	1630067	It's like, I didn't have to wait.
1630127	1630628	I didn't have to wait.
1630768	1631788	I didn't have to wait.
1631908	1633049	And she walks all the way back there.
1633109	1635410	And they basically said, oh, we're the last ones to get it.
1636130	1637991	And she walks back because she's so pissed off.
1638752	1639933	I was like, haha!
1640393	1644075	There were like a few people who showed up thinking they can just jump in the line.
1644675	1646576	And the guy said, I'm sorry, we don't have any more.
1646596	1647537	These are the only people.
1647757	1651519	You know, that was probably going to be me if Extra Red had been so volunteer.
1651579	1652219	But I would have been okay.
1652540	1653780	I wouldn't have left away in a huff.
1653820	1654561	I would have understood.
1654781	1657082	I would have been, okay, I'm going to Kmart because no one shops at Kmart.
1659494	1668651	But anyway, we've got to keep moving as we want to get in the show, but we want to give a great big round of applause to the line at Target Great Land and Center Sites and the great staff there for making the relaunch good.
1668711	1669052	Yay!
1669887	1681630	And I also want to give a round of applause to the guy at the front of the line at Walmart in Rancho Cordova, the grandpa who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid.
1681710	1685451	Not to sell it on eBay, but he looked like the nicest guy in the world.
1685491	1689272	So I want to give him a round of applause, too, because I liked him a lot.
1689312	1690472	And I liked all the gamers.
1690512	1691493	He didn't take your cookie, though.
1691873	1693493	No, he didn't take the cookie, but that's okay.
1694253	1695234	I understand.
1695294	1696714	I'm not going to force people to take the cookies.
1697797	1698917	Alright, so anyway.
1698937	1700738	Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chat room.
1700838	1704620	Why are they even, that was Shadow Charlie, but why are they even talking about Paris Hilton?
1704900	1707641	Oh, because Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one.
1707861	1712123	Well, we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems, use their celebrity to get systems.
1712143	1712823	We'll talk about that later.
1712843	1714884	Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free, okay?
1715864	1716104	Alright.
1716424	1718385	Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii.
1718645	1724307	Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature of the Wiimote easily.
1725968	1726308	Alright.
1727489	1731391	Anyway, let's get into another favorite segment we like to do here on Orange Launch Radio.
1731412	1735174	This is usually how we kick off the show and we don't have launch party stories to tell.
1735574	1736395	Oh, I forgot to ask.
1736875	1737455	I'm so sorry.
1737715	1738456	I didn't even ask.
1739336	1741198	You guys all camped in the line for the Wii.
1741518	1742138	What did you get?
1742178	1743299	What games did you end up getting?
1743539	1744740	DarkSakura.
1744860	1748142	I got, well, I actually got another Wiimote.
1748942	1753825	And then I got Zelda, Excite Truck, and Trauma Center.
1754586	1754746	Which...
1756246	1758627	Those are the exact same three games I got, by the way.
1758787	1762189	That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck, and Zelda.
1762369	1762669	Loki?
1764009	1777275	I feel so bad, but I got Zelda, Excite Truck, Rayman's Raving Rabbids, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, Red Steel, and Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.
1777295	1778976	I think that was it.
1778996	1780196	Did you get SpongeBob?
1780396	1781517	I did not get SpongeBob.
1782017	1784518	I will talk about it in a little bit, but...
1785168	1790049	Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used pretty quick at a GameStop.
1790749	1790990	Ouch.
1791370	1791570	Ouch.
1792890	1794370	Not sounding like some good reviews there.
1794390	1796171	I'll get into how it should get me in just a minute.
1796471	1799032	I want to say this comment from chat, though, real quick about the Wii lines.
1799772	1802993	Ranma said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems, not sell them.
1803633	1805153	Another very interesting observation.
1805193	1811935	I mean, I've noted this observation was made on blogs where, you know, most of the people in the PlayStation 3 lines were eBay profiteers.
1812515	1814917	and most of the people in the Wii lines actually plan on playing them.
1815337	1820160	I asked, you know, and I didn't expect people to be honest with me, but I asked straight up, I said, who's selling the Wii on eBay?
1820460	1824383	And only one person kind of fessed up to that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay.
1824503	1825844	Like, their friend ratted them out.
1825964	1826424	That was it.
1827445	1828486	One guy at Best Buy
1832368	1838154	and I'm using that money to buy the Wii and I'm like, what, are you selling the Wii 2?
1838214	1847124	Give me back the cookie and he's like, he said, no, I actually want to play the Wii so it's very interesting just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people had
1848181	1850502	PooEater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports.
1851603	1859167	My girlfriend, Migsy, she's been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop, and she says it's actually gotten kind of boring.
1859587	1859887	Really?
1859967	1863689	I mean, it's good to learn how things go, I guess, but it's...
1864264	1866507	It's not, it's not really a, you know...
1884787	1886328	Hey, you want to check out what I just got?
1886428	1886908	Fire it up.
1887008	1887409	Here you go.
1888349	1894173	Pass off to Drew Nami for a minute, because I want to ask, you just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room, and you played Wii Sports.
1894633	1895393	What was your impressions?
1895673	1896974	It's just pick it up and go.
1896994	1899216	There's nothing to it at all.
1899496	1904539	It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing, but everything else was easy.
1906460	1906740	All right.
1907219	1907939	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
1933025	1938686	and every time they try to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted so I haven't actually gotten started yet.
1940247	1943148	I played some Mario but mostly I was playing Cooking Mama.
1943168	1946308	And I have my Elite Beat Agents today.
1946488	1947369	Thank you.
1948749	1949029	Alright.
1949429	1949789	That's it.
1950129	1950489	Very cool.
1950969	1951570	Have fun with it.
1952070	1953350	Play lots of the Wii for next week.
1954139	1954519	and Pinball.
1954599	1956820	Oh, Pinball, like real Pinball, not virtual console Pinball.
1956840	1965584	Dan had a Pinball party last night, so I've actually, well, of course we weren't there, but I was playing some of the machines while Sauce was here last week, too.
1966865	1971687	Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about before we got into How Was Your Gaming Week, but I've got to read these.
1972047	1978770	Robway in our chatroom says, I think less people want to resell the Wii because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling.
1979130	1980711	Plus, I'm not buying from the eBay scum.
1981810	1985656	Megzi said, I showed the parentals Wii Sports.
1985816	1987378	They were like speechless in awe.
1988480	1989181	Kind of interesting.
1989701	1990883	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1991504	1994828	My gaming week was great, especially with the Wii on Thursday.
1995009	1997873	We started off with Wii Sports, and that was actually pretty fun.
2000176	2001717	The Wii Tennis was really cool.
2001797	2003658	I mean, everyone really had fun with it.
2004858	2010160	Then I tried a little bit of Wii Boxing, which is a little weird because I didn't really read the manual on how to play it.
2010400	2013802	So I couldn't quite get it to work correctly, but it was still fun.
2014242	2017223	Wii Golf was kind of okay, I guess.
2018024	2020885	And then Wii Bowling, I didn't really try that too much.
2021005	2023046	And then the baseball, I think, is way too damn hard.
2023126	2026447	At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous.
2027668	2030069	Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend.
2030089	2032130	I've been playing lots of that.
2032210	2033191	That game is really fun.
2033271	2035131	That's the best way to describe it.
2036232	2045276	Although the music is so goddamn horrible, you really need the SD memory card and just to load your own MP3s.
2045856	2051478	I tell you, once you do that, it makes the game completely better.
2051838	2052759	It's a really fun game.
2054868	2056248	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz
2084170	2085251	I didn't like them.
2085691	2086512	I didn't like them too much.
2086632	2090234	So, you know, it's not something I would play by myself.
2090335	2094818	Maybe a good party game, but, you know, money's better spent elsewhere.
2095258	2098000	And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits.
2098020	2102103	Because if you're really interested in a minigame type of game, that is the one for you.
2102143	2103644	Because it's just insane.
2104125	2108708	I mean, the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim, just how off the wall weird they are.
2109361	2116203	My favorite was the eating one, that you trace the food, and one of the foods was a baseball that the guy would eat.
2116303	2118084	I was like, what the hell, he's eating a baseball?
2119445	2122606	It's excellent, so definitely you need to check that out.
2122986	2126007	Zelda is pretty awesome, but I mean, what do you expect from a Zelda?
2126067	2130268	It's just pretty neat, so Zelda, yay.
2130788	2131709	And then, of course...
2132932	2134293	Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam.
2135154	2139157	I bought this thinking it's going to be like SSX, because I love SSX.
2139878	2140899	It's not SSX.
2141179	2155731	It's not even close to being SSX, and I got really frustrated with this right away, because to be honest, I don't know if it was my TV, but the cables I had, the detail on it, I had trouble seeing some of the tracks.
2156051	2161156	I want a game that I can get into and have fun with, and Excite Truck was that, Tony Hawk was not.
2161276	2161476	So,
2162461	2163302	I wouldn't recommend it.
2163542	2167425	I mean, unless you're a really big Tony Hawk fan, I really wouldn't recommend it.
2167625	2169727	So, yeah.
2170207	2172489	And then, of course, finally, virtual console games.
2172529	2176131	I tried Mario 64, which is okay with the classic controller.
2177953	2182516	I wonder how well it'll look with the component cable, but it looks just like it did before.
2182917	2191243	And then Zelda seemed a bit dark to me, but I guess that was because it was from the collection disc or something that came out of the GameCube not too long ago.
2192454	2195276	Now it makes sense because, hey, it's already been ported, right?
2196157	2196697	Exactly.
2197138	2202881	I wish it was brighter, though, because all those games that we saw at E3 were very vivid and bright, and that's what I kind of liked about them.
2203402	2206904	And now, I mean, I think it's all about the cables, though, right now.
2207164	2209226	But that was pretty much it.
2209286	2218532	Yeah, of course, you know, the usual suspects, Call of Duty 3 on the 360, and Gears of War a little bit, and Elder Scrolls finally finished it.
2219056	2224417	SSJ 100 Matt wants to know, what does Nelly, Loki's wife, have to say about Loki playing all those games this week?
2224638	2227258	Now, here's the funny thing about that, actually.
2228739	2241342	Nelly originally, if you have her as a friend on LiveJournal, you would have seen that she wrote some pretty negative reviews on the Wii, saying, if I really wanted to exercise, I would go to the gym, I won't play the Wii.
2242254	2250719	Ironically enough, though, once she picked up Excite Truck, she's been playing it for five hours yesterday and a couple hours today.
2251620	2257043	And she's actually finished all the four different cups in it, all the way up through the Platinum Cup.
2257063	2257863	She's all finished with it.
2258184	2260945	Now she's going back to get S rankings on all the other tracks.
2261886	2263167	I haven't even played it that much.
2263247	2265508	So that's how much she's liked this, and she loves the game.
2265528	2266248	She says it's like...
2268247	2274634	It's basically like Woman Driver the game because it allows you to crash through trees and just drive aimlessly.
2274674	2275234	And you get points.
2275295	2275935	You get rewarded.
2276155	2278598	Yeah, you get rewarded for driving recklessly.
2279519	2280660	So she loves the game.
2280840	2281701	Sail at Mervin's.
2281781	2283142	We're just kidding.
2283928	2290370	You know what I like, though, playing on there is the Mii Channel, and I like creating stupid Miis that I sent to Rob, which is great.
2290490	2295192	Oh, gosh, I went into my Mii Channel, like, suddenly, like, eight new Miis all dropped in my little thing.
2295252	2296093	Loki sent you this.
2296173	2296913	Loki sent you this.
2297273	2304376	And he sent him and Nellie, and then he sent, like, Damien, who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side or what you did to get those horns.
2305016	2305836	I don't know what you did.
2306196	2310178	And then he just sent me a guy with a giant afro and called it afro.
2310398	2311458	It's from DDR.
2311798	2312199	I get it.
2312259	2312659	I get it.
2312719	2312939	Yeah.
2313119	2313379	All right.
2314435	2316120	Alright, let's talk to our guests.
2316400	2317744	Oh, I gotta say, my gaming week.
2318024	2318586	I'll make it quick.
2319229	2322470	Fantasy Star Universe before the mass hysteria of the Wii launch.
2322490	2323871	I played a lot of Fantasy Star Universe.
2324691	2327213	Online mode because they opened up some new areas in online.
2327813	2331274	Motube is a new planet you can go to and some new missions are available as well.
2331755	2338057	I got my butt handed to me in Motube though because the missions, even though they're level 15, they're a little bit harder than the ones on New Days.
2338418	2339878	So it's good though.
2339898	2342159	I'm glad they're keeping it fresh with new content.
2342479	2346841	Let's hope Sega gets it right this time and consistently gives us the new stuff.
2346881	2348222	I'll be a very happy camper if so.
2349574	2350835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2369812	2374614	When I get mad at the patients, I stab them with my scalpel and just kill them.
2374755	2376015	I have a review from Megzi.
2376075	2379457	She said the trauma center for the DS makes you want to hit yourself with a brick.
2380057	2380477	It's hard.
2380557	2383298	It's a really hard game, and you have to remember.
2383659	2385239	It's almost like Simon Says.
2385619	2388461	I don't know if Simon Says, but you have to remember.
2389161	2390242	First, I've got to drain it.
2390362	2391862	Then, I've got to scalp it.
2391922	2393263	Then, I've got to take it out with a thing.
2393303	2394343	Then, I've got an antibiotic.
2394604	2396665	You have to remember what order you have to do everything in.
2396745	2397585	It's crazy.
2399199	2400439	DMN, You Watch Me Play It
2428353	2429494	I will pick up Mortal Kombat, though.
2430515	2434118	I'm totally being a hypocrite because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat when it comes out on the Wii.
2434278	2435419	DMN, how was your gaming week?
2435840	2438942	Well, I played a bunch of games at work that I can't talk about.
2440584	2446849	But, let's see, at home, I actually busted out the Super Nintendo, played some Tecmo Super Bowl, Wario's Woods.
2448570	2451273	Actually, when I got here, I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP.
2451313	2454395	I played a lot of Luminous 2, played a lot of Burnout Revenge on his 360.
2455922	2463488	and this is actually the first time I've actually gotten to play the Wii and play it on my own terms rather than, you're playing this for eight hours, have fun.
2465130	2468272	But I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun with the system.
2469293	2472436	Trauma Center is just funny because, again, the stabbing people.
2474518	2475699	Excite Truck's pretty fun.
2475719	2478621	I actually did not like Raving Rabbids.
2479001	2480082	I just thought it was stupid.
2481984	2483205	But yeah, that's about it.
2483976	2484857	I'm boring like that.
2510089	2515331	Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 pets, and you can kill animals and turn them into ghost animals.
2515451	2516692	But no, it's actually really fun.
2518292	2524275	All the animals, you can't actually tell the animals what to do, but they have their own personalities and they just kind of run around.
2525255	2526776	You can tell them not to do something.
2527776	2533779	All my cats that I have for my Sims, they are on the furniture all the time and I can't get them to stop, but...
2535200	2536842	and I also played Pokemon Ranger.
2537163	2538044	That game is weird.
2538725	2542911	That's like, I'm old school Pokemon fan, like the trainer games.
2543332	2544273	Those are the only ones I like.
2544293	2547118	I don't have pinball or anything like that and I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that.
2547799	2548299	It's not.
2548560	2548660	It's
2549199	2550359	I have plushies of those.
2550399	2550719	Yeah, they...
2575969	2580591	That's always with you, but the friends that you make follow you around until you're done with them.
2581091	2584233	And you can use your Pokemon, so it's even worse than training them.
2584773	2585553	You use them.
2586474	2589135	It's like, do that for me, and then get the hell out.
2590176	2592417	So that's a weird game.
2592477	2597499	I mean, if you like Pokemon anyway, I mean, I guess it's a really cool game, but I like training them.
2597599	2599520	I like using them for purposes of battle.
2600480	2601961	I like trying to kill my Pokemon.
2603041	2604402	PETA doesn't like me, I don't think.
2605769	2606650	Okay, that was my gaming week.
2607731	2608131	Right on.
2608311	2608972	Drew Nami!
2609052	2610593	Drew, I really, really like your shirt.
2610613	2612235	It says noob.
2612795	2614016	Noob, it's what's for dinner.
2614036	2620021	And it has a noob assuming the position, kind of like the cuts of meat chart.
2620542	2621763	Yeah, that's so funny.
2621943	2624685	Drew Nami, or Drew Nawi, how was your gaming week?
2625526	2632012	I actually decided to kick it a little bit old school because I didn't get any of the next gen stuff, so I went back to my old...
2632694	2637176	MechWarrior games, just started playing MechWarrior 3, MechWarrior 4, MechCommander 2, that kind of stuff.
2638677	2643660	Didn't do much else except Guitar Hero, and they really ramped up the difficulty on Expert Mode.
2643780	2648042	It is almost impossibly hard when you get to the stuff like Miserlew.
2648963	2652064	Other than that, not much else.
2652565	2653205	Alright, very cool.
2653612	2657774	You know what's funny is that earlier in the show I was talking about our history as a music gaming network.
2658094	2661836	I think you're the only... Oh no, DarkSakura played Guitar Hero 2 last week.
2662356	2663217	Because I haven't played it yet.
2663277	2664357	I've played a bunch of that too.
2666498	2667299	Pandora is hot.
2667319	2668419	Pandora is fucking hot.
2669119	2671240	Pandora makes me fail songs.
2674167	2686602	Well, that was our gaming week, and hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well, whether you were in the PlayStation 3 camp, or the Wii camp, or the F the Next Generation camp, or maybe 360, you're just holding out on 360, whatever, hope you had a good gaming week as well.
2687183	2691848	We gotta get into some gaming news, so real quick housekeeping, real quick, just wanted to say...
2693484	2697789	For those that have been saying, why do you put out Part B so late in the week?
2697849	2700092	Why do we have to wait so long for Part B?
2700252	2705679	Okay, we're going to try a new thing and we're going to put out Part B a little bit earlier, so look for it this week.
2707175	2708736	There's another podcast out there.
2708796	2711616	It's another show that's syndicated on all games like we are.
2711736	2713337	Our show replays on all games on Monday.
2713657	2716697	And there's a show on Thursday, I think, on all games.
2716757	2718958	I apologize if I messed that up, called Game Addict Hotline.
2719298	2729260	There's a spin-off show from that called Cross Platform where they have multiple people come together from different podcasts and magazines and stuff and just talk about random stuff.
2729320	2731781	So the guy there, Luke, I've been chatting with for a little bit.
2731801	2732561	So he had me on.
2733161	2735524	Episode 4 and 5, so you should check that out.
2735544	2738026	So go to GameAddictHotline.com and you can download the show.
2738466	2743711	And you can hear how GamerAndy yells at me for being excited about Blue Dragon.
2743811	2748215	But look, number 3 most anticipated title in Japan, GamerAndy.
2748736	2749577	That's all I have to know.
2750117	2752399	All the Final Fantasy people, you know what a Final Fantasy whore I am.
2752539	2753020	No, yeah.
2754070	2756471	GamerAndy is great and so are all the guys there that have been on the program.
2756511	2757412	So check that out.
2757432	2757932	It was a good time.
2758892	2760113	One other thing I want to say real fast.
2760253	2762894	DMM, do you have anything you want to share with our listeners?
2765054	2765915	I have a cookie.
2766555	2767856	Oh, you mean that thing.
2768936	2769716	Yeah, I have a Wii.
2770016	2770917	I'm going to give it to somebody.
2771777	2772697	It's going to be a random chatter.
2772717	2773278	If
2775175	2781260	When Rob says go, which won't be now, but at some point, please PM him in the chat room.
2781300	2781800	No, no, no.
2782641	2785643	I'll give the rules in chat a little later because PMs are going to be too much.
2785663	2786464	Well, we can do PMs.
2786784	2787044	All right.
2787684	2788185	We'll do PMs.
2788265	2790727	Yeah, PM him with your... Not now.
2791087	2791547	Not now.
2791587	2793169	If you do it now, you're disqualified.
2793209	2793389	Yes.
2793509	2796851	Now we have to find a way to say go.
2797592	2800154	Please PM Rob with your...
2801081	2808985	Screen name, your actual name if you like, and a number we can reach you at because we may call you tonight and make an ass of you on the internet and say you won a Wii.
2809225	2812367	Yeah, if we can call you on air, just give us your number and we'll do that.
2812567	2814988	Orange Lounge Radio employees are not eligible.
2815008	2815569	Yeah, sorry.
2816769	2817570	Sorry, people.
2817750	2826574	But yeah, other than that, you'll get a Wii when I get back to Seattle because I have the Wii, just not here.
2826594	2827915	Okay.
2829064	2832525	If there's any questions, I don't have a computer, so deal with it.
2834265	2835045	I think that's it.
2835345	2836186	Back to you, Rob.
2836926	2837666	No, there was something else.
2837806	2838606	What else?
2839286	2841707	Oh, that's something else.
2841747	2842667	I'm not wearing any pants.
2845087	2846428	You've got to tell me these things beforehand.
2847088	2847528	Kirby.
2848068	2848628	Kirby, yes.
2851108	2851989	STFU, Rob.
2852429	2852909	I mean, wait.
2853309	2853629	Wait.
2854298	2859600	Coming Thursdays to Orange Lounge Radio, DJ Tyron and myself will be hosting a show called STFU.
2861280	2864641	It's going to be maybe a 30-45 minute show.
2865401	2870863	It will be pre-taped until we decide, hey, we're going to feel the wrath of the live listeners.
2871843	2872784	We don't know what time.
2873144	2875764	More details on that will be announced as they come.
2876305	2881166	But we look forward to being a part of the Orange Lounge Radio family, and we are going to have a lot of fun with it.
2882085	2882805	So when's that start?
2882866	2883886	Thursday after Thanksgiving, right?
2883906	2885907	Yes, it'll be the first Thursday after Thanksgiving.
2885967	2891931	We're shooting for an evening sort of time so people can, you know... We're going to have it at 3 in the morning.
2892592	2892912	All right.
2893132	2894553	No, it was 7 o'clock?
2894573	2895193	I think it was going to be 7.
2895233	2895974	Yeah, I think we're going to do 7.
2896014	2899296	Because most of the other shows are at 7 or 7.30, so probably in that window somewhere.
2900106	2904069	All right, just real quick, I want to say one more time because now everybody's talking about the contest.
2904210	2905471	Everybody in chat is like, contest, contest, contest.
2905751	2909614	Okay, ask an op if you need to know how to private message somebody in chat.
2909814	2914618	The folks in chat would request that if you already have a Wii, you don't enter the contest.
2914658	2921104	But since there's no way for us to verify it, maybe you know someone in need of a Wii, so we're not going to stop people that already have one from entering.
2921144	2923866	But, you know, you win brownie points with the ladies.
2923926	2925087	Use your best judgment, yeah.
2926988	2934032	Only PM me when I say to, and after a certain period of time, one number will be drawn at random.
2934052	2939035	So it's not the first person to PM me, it's one number from someone who PMs me will be drawn at random.
2939855	2945818	And by the way, if you're PMing me other things during the show, because there's a lot of people in chat tonight, I can't look at them right now because there's too much else going on.
2945838	2954002	I'm very sorry, folks, but you have to look at the general chat or, I don't know, see if Loki or DarkSakura can answer.
2954022	2955463	Or ask one of your friendly ops.
2956038	2956318	All right.
2958118	2958419	All right.
2958539	2961519	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news already.
2961839	2967320	And I know we haven't given the 360 a lot of love tonight, but Loki, can you change that for us a little bit?
2967440	2968321	Of course I can.
2968781	2971561	I love the 360 and I'll still be playing plenty.
2972102	2979263	Anyways, so on the 15th, you know, there is a big anniversary, the fifth year anniversary of Halo.
2980043	2983384	And of course, to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Halo,
2983948	2984448	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3014380	3014941	XBOX 360 EXCLUSIVE MAPS
3035768	3043191	Also, the first Halo 3 television ad will air during ESPN Monday Night Football on December 4th.
3043391	3045392	And it'll be a 60-second spot.
3046472	3047853	So that'll be very interesting.
3047873	3052295	Tune in to that to watch it or catch it on YouTube the day after.
3056156	3056777	Alrighty.
3056957	3060198	Sorry, I've been having to argue a little bit with some people in chat room.
3060218	3060458	They're like,
3061273	3066217	Look, the rules are the rules, and it's DMN's Wii, and he can do whatever he wants to give it away, because he doesn't have to be doing it.
3066298	3067499	So, that's it.
3068039	3069881	Yeah, it's a very massive Wii you have there, DMN.
3070441	3071862	Anyway, I wanted to say real quick on the Halo 3.
3072383	3074765	So, the beta coming out in spring.
3074825	3080950	Now, you have said on previous episodes, you are convinced that the game is coming out in, what, March, April, somewhere in that window.
3081550	3082992	Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?
3083412	3087035	No, they beta tested Phantasy Star Universe right before it came out.
3088316	3088977	What's the big deal?
3089177	3089417	I mean...
3089827	3092529	It doesn't have to be beta tested months in advance.
3092589	3101434	In fact, the only exception I've seen so far with demos and Xbox Live would probably be the stuff from E3.
3101874	3105256	Lost Planet got a demo and Test Drive Unlimited and stuff like that.
3105776	3112120	I mean, that stuff was way early, but then again, it was also already done for that show, so they didn't have to really work on it.
3112681	3113941	So yeah, it makes perfect sense.
3113981	3118364	Why would you have a beta test for something and then wait like six months to put it out?
3119332	3120035	I'm still telling you.
3120598	3121020	End of March.
3121763	3123310	So, whatever.
3124376	3125857	Alright, you all will see.
3126637	3127958	We shall, we shall see.
3128898	3134441	Speaking of things that need to be beta tested, perhaps the PlayStation 3 backwards compatibility should have been play tested.
3134741	3140324	I'm sure you guys have been hearing the reports about, I think we got into it a little bit last week, some of the games don't work right.
3140904	3145186	They have little bugs, I don't know if any, are any of them rendered unplayable that you've heard of?
3145306	3146607	I don't think any of them are necessarily unplayable.
3146627	3147307	I don't know about unplayable.
3147327	3150109	But you've got graphical audio bugs quite a bit.
3150769	3167323	but it's very interesting because there was an interview with Sony Computer Entertainment America exec Jack Trenton and he made this very interesting and bizarre quote in response to the question do you have a response for people experiencing backwards compatibility issues and or television upscaling problems
3167830	3168130	Quote,
3190356	3190937	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3212574	3216735	I know, and FireballManChatroom says, that's just giving a big fuck you to the gaming community.
3216855	3217575	I tend to agree.
3217615	3219015	I mean, that's a very snide thing to say.
3219035	3220876	I want a flying car and make breakfast.
3221116	3222936	He just said, look, we have bugs.
3223036	3223716	We'll fix them.
3224056	3224497	Our bad.
3224637	3232218	I want to get a big pro tip for every single higher up at every single video game company.
3232798	3235019	You don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
3235339	3236699	Shut the hell up.
3238019	3239200	This includes mine, too.
3239980	3241120	I know you're listening, Perrin.
3243564	3246146	Now, they are working on patch to fix this stuff.
3248027	3253531	To be fair, Microsoft, their games aren't backwards compatible.
3254231	3255572	Not all of them.
3256393	3262277	They have as many backwards compatible games as Sony has games that aren't working in backwards compatibility.
3262317	3264919	It's about that.
3266120	3267881	It'll be fixed in a patch.
3267961	3269182	People can quit their bitching.
3269282	3271564	Granted, there's still going to be other problems, but
3272031	3274992	That's why they have these updates and firmware updates and stuff like that.
3275052	3277833	So, not a huge deal right now, I think.
3278233	3284315	And besides, with that big of a library, I mean, the percentage of games that aren't working is about, like, 2%.
3284395	3286896	That's really not that big a deal.
3287076	3289737	So, it will be fixed soon.
3290437	3294119	I mean, they could have said, at least, hey, we're doing better than 360 is.
3294199	3295979	Granted, yeah, this guy is an idiot.
3296079	3300321	I mean, they do not need people like him talking because...
3300922	3307768	They already have people like, you know, Kaz and just spout off dumbass remarks.
3307928	3312832	LokiFNX in our chatroom with very familiar sounding names says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.
3314173	3315074	It's very rude.
3315094	3316575	It's just rude.
3316655	3317556	It's horrible PR.
3318076	3318697	It is a little bit.
3320458	3326964	Considering they're relying on these people to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they were really rude to them at launch.
3327725	3328225	Yeah.
3328522	3329423	Interesting words.
3330103	3339789	What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks, and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound like pricks.
3339809	3340730	Them's fighting words.
3341250	3343052	Those are fighting words.
3343072	3345693	Despite all this crap, I do still consider myself a Sony fanboy.
3345773	3348415	I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.
3348955	3349436	You want to go outside?
3349456	3350356	You want to go to the parking lot?
3350597	3351817	You want to go get taught a lesson?
3352278	3352578	All right.
3353258	3354059	Fight, fight.
3355140	3356120	I might shoot him.
3356140	3357161	Okay.
3357181	3357301	Okay.
3358123	3358723	I get a stuff.
3360584	3367789	Anyway, speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.
3367949	3368789	Well, not really got shot.
3368809	3370490	Well, actually, in other states they got shot.
3371271	3378095	But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their PS3.
3380356	3385739	And... Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game system.
3390215	3392476	$600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay.
3393396	3402199	But there's people getting shot over this and I'm like... You people are pathetic.
3402319	3406220	Wait, let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up on mic again.
3406621	3411042	Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.
3411502	3412482	You smartass.
3414783	3417064	But I'm just all...
3419474	3427495	You know, it's... They were shooting people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.
3427975	3443678	I guess the PS3 must be the must-own console, because that's, you know, every year you hear about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them, and now it's... My mom did that!
3443698	3446439	My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle Me Elmo.
3447199	3447699	That's hot.
3448159	3448299	Um...
3449109	3453431	and now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation 3s.
3453491	3454051	It's crazy.
3454551	3454951	You know what?
3457072	3470897	I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back to any of those, you know, assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and bork acid poured over the stump.
3470997	3472338	You know, that's probably someone's fetish.
3472898	3474999	While having to watch Bad Santa.
3475322	3475642	DarkSakura.com
3503900	3507002	A big flippin' F you to Sony.
3507923	3508924	All-encompassingly.
3509865	3513768	And all of your retarded, as the name would notice something, retarded fanboys.
3514308	3518612	As in, not that all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.
3520533	3526117	Um, all those... I guess, it's stupid men, really.
3526818	3530301	But, it's all the ones, oh, we're gonna sell it on eBay.
3530681	3531942	You people are disgusting.
3533742	3538024	And I have a secondary FU that I think is going to go in line with somebody else's in this room.
3538444	3539185	FU to Art Thieves.
3540926	3541246	Okay.
3541406	3542266	Ooh, ouch.
3542306	3543287	All right, Loki.
3545148	3552611	FU to Nintendo, MadCatz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.
3552851	3557493	Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday?
3558154	3558614	Or today?
3559274	3559734	Whatever.
3560595	3560895	Why...
3561482	3562443	Do I have to wait?
3562703	3564945	I cannot stand composite cables.
3565145	3567326	I need higher def cables.
3568527	3572550	How will I live in a high def world with standard composite cables?
3573110	3576593	It's just... It's barbaric!
3578374	3578674	Alright.
3578895	3580416	And besides, why do I have to wait until December?
3580516	3581256	I don't want to wait.
3583018	3583458	Alright, um...
3584159	3602312	My FU of the week goes to DarkSakura, Chris, and Extifer and the entire line at Target Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, Hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my bed, warm and toasty asleep.
3602645	3606287	And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache, so F you to my toothache, no.
3606727	3612310	If we really wanted to attack revenge on you, we would have dumped some ice water on you too.
3612410	3614611	I would have locked the door to my house, so you couldn't do that.
3615111	3617353	If it makes you feel any better, I've thought about calling you at 5.
3617653	3619193	Alright, well, alright.
3620154	3621335	So, no, I'm teasing.
3621375	3625577	Of course they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little bit of sand in my vagina this week.
3626617	3628078	DMN, your FUs of the week.
3629379	3631760	My first FU of the week goes to T-Mobile.
3632423	3635924	because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation with money to spend.
3635964	3640006	And then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money and you're going to fucking hate your weekend.
3640226	3643527	But thankfully, I have friends who help me out, but they don't get FUs.
3643567	3644467	But T-Mobile does.
3644867	3649849	If you ever take my fucking money without my permission again, people will die.
3650569	3653250	And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR the other day.
3653883	3655564	I totally pwned you a butterfly.
3655845	3658907	Rematch, bitch, right now.
3659227	3659888	Right now, alright.
3659928	3660808	Oh, no, you didn't.
3660888	3661709	Oh, yes, I did.
3661809	3662810	I will soak it, LaQuisha.
3662870	3664071	It's already been brought in.
3664411	3666192	Alright, Chris, you're FU of the week.
3667813	3668494	Alright, then Drew.
3668514	3670395	Drew, you're FU of the week.
3670415	3671036	You got served.
3672897	3674879	Okay, FU to Demass Marketing Strategies.
3674979	3680843	Why do we have just not enough game systems for everyone to watch the first time around?
3680863	3683125	It still makes no fucking sense to me.
3684334	3686695	FU to the ramped-up difficulty levels on Guitar Hero 2.
3686775	3687255	What the hell?
3687695	3689996	I mean, I know you're going to make it harder, but Jesus!
3690456	3691557	Miserlew on Expert?
3691597	3693577	What the hell?
3693937	3695158	Also, FU to the DMV.
3695258	3696658	I know everyone shares FU.
3697099	3702260	Now they have to have your birth certificate, even though you've been through the whole thing before, just for a new something.
3703021	3705441	So you get to stand in line, not once, but twice.
3706022	3706802	Isn't it lovely?
3706962	3707562	Ain't it grand?
3708503	3708803	Fine.
3709123	3709823	Chris, you're FU's.
3710821	3713122	Well, Jamie kind of already stated my FU.
3713482	3714403	FU to art thieves.
3714523	3716404	My art was stolen on DeviantArt.
3716904	3717784	That was fun.
3717905	3719225	Why would somebody steal art?
3719365	3728509	You know, well, it was kind of funny because it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school technically, so I'm not that great.
3728890	3733672	But it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown enough that she thought no one would recognize it.
3733692	3738054	But somebody did and they informed me and she did it on both her accounts and...
3738727	3745692	She actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description, too!
3746012	3746592	Word for word.
3747013	3748094	It was really, really funny.
3748394	3748894	What a hooker.
3749134	3753497	But, um... I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thief.
3753577	3754058	My bad.
3754758	3755198	Oh, no.
3755819	3766746	I draw, so... I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an FU, but I kind of, like, confused why don't you know this, is all the people who ask me why are you doing this online when I was handing out coffee...
3768163	3773766	I'm kind of not pleased that people have just lost faith in humanity.
3774066	3777768	Like, I know you read about all these things happening, it's like, people are killing each other for a PS3!
3777808	3781590	But there are nice people left, and they're all gay.
3786252	3789094	I love you, Drew.
3790835	3791315	Wow.
3792676	3794817	They knew me as the lesbian in line.
3796874	3798235	That's how they know you on the show, too.
3798275	3798895	But we love you.
3799795	3801196	You're much more than a lesbian.
3801996	3803176	You're also the chick with blue hair.
3804157	3806038	And I feed you sugar.
3806558	3808018	I give you sugar.
3808959	3816622	Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week.
3817302	3819703	A pregnant woman, actually.
3820390	3824211	was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey.
3824891	3838195	And she says, nine months pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's father, and her younger brother.
3839475	3840115	Okay.
3840976	3844797	Yeah, you're really... You're stupid!
3846585	3847647	That is pretty stupid.
3847667	3850310	Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.
3851111	3853314	Why are you allowed to be pregnant?
3854556	3855217	No, no, no, no, no.
3855477	3857520	This is where I'm going off because this is one of the things I hate.
3857981	3860164	I hate when stupid people breed.
3861306	3865710	When people exist only on this earth to start out babies.
3865730	3868793	Jamie, she really, really, really, really wanted one.
3869173	3869413	No.
3870334	3870734	No, no, no.
3870774	3871095	Seriously.
3871155	3874618	What is more important, the birth of your child or a video game system?
3874698	3875939	You are a disgusting person.
3876199	3878541	And I hope your child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.
3878822	3879142	Depends.
3879182	3880183	How ugly is your child?
3882325	3882865	Wow.
3883506	3883946	Wow.
3885988	3887850	It depends on if she was at Walmart or not.
3888815	3892577	LandmineFairy in chat says, WTF, is she going to play Trauma Center while in labor?
3892617	3894138	She was at... No, no, no.
3894478	3895659	She will not be playing Trauma Center.
3895699	3897640	Trauma Center's not on a PlayStation 3.
3898060	3898740	Oh, that's right.
3900241	3900621	Oh, snap.
3900641	3904483	She'll be playing one of the 15 games that came out for it, and that's about it.
3904663	3907965	I guess... No, she will not be playing Motorstorm until March.
3908625	3914208	She will be playing... She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spider-Man impregnated her.
3914308	3914608	I don't know.
3915269	3915369	Oh...
3916204	3923067	To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.
3924567	3936892	I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child, you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.
3937413	3939894	No video game system is worth your child's life.
3941214	3941574	Alright.
3942135	3942975	I love the chat room.
3943355	3944355	SSJ100Matt says...
3946192	3948094	Loki, it's New Jersey after all.
3950277	3953821	I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.
3954301	3956744	I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once.
3956764	3957805	It was fun.
3957966	3961029	For all you people in Jersey, that's Loki at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3961049	3961790	There you go.
3961930	3962711	Send the hate mail.
3962791	3963292	Fire away.
3963872	3965274	I'm just reading the chat room, okay?
3965855	3966535	I didn't say it.
3966776	3967016	All right.
3968821	3972042	To one very strange incident in a line, too.
3972762	3985424	A line that was complimented on a very big blogging site, Joystick, gave kudos to Best Buy in Landmark Center, Best Buy in Boston, where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.
3985464	3993586	But what happened is that, okay, ways it would happen, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event the next day.
3994062	3995002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
4018587	4019448	And then what happened?
4019528	4022370	By 3 p.m., they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.
4022810	4027193	So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.
4027493	4033917	They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just come back and get their system.
4034458	4037260	And anything that was left over was automatically raffled off.
4037380	4047446	So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.
4047847	4048347	Good for them.
4049082	4053946	So it's good to hear that not every line was just fucking nuts.
4054186	4056248	So good for you guys in Boston.
4057149	4062513	Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and Wii launches.
4062533	4070860	They were basically doing this in conjunction with the law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.
4073242	4078626	So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going on in regards to the system launches elsewhere.
4080285	4080905	That's pretty good.
4080985	4088087	I know with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles, it's real chaos.
4088407	4094489	But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this week at launch, you may be in luck.
4094669	4098509	There may be some more coming in next week for Black Friday.
4099170	4108152	So if you really want to fight the chaos in the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more...
4109855	4113257	Systems out there for next week and stuff.
4113777	4114117	I don't know.
4114157	4118260	Personally, I don't think that there's a real big need for it right now.
4118340	4122582	With only 15 games going to be out before the end of the year, you probably could wait.
4122722	4124883	You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.
4124943	4127525	I mean, what's coming out next month anyways?
4127585	4129406	Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.
4129426	4132487	Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.
4133028	4135469	Yeah, so it's not a huge deal.
4135709	4139371	But that's cool at least that they're shipping them relatively quick.
4141596	4145357	Do you think this is going to drive the eBay prices down as the market gets more diluted?
4145377	4146198	It already has, actually.
4146258	4152079	From what I was reading, they're going for about $1,500 now.
4152880	4163803	But, you know, I think it really... That's also another reason I think you're probably not seeing a lot of Wiis on eBay because their shipments are going to be coming in around the same time.
4164183	4166884	I think we heard that we're getting our next shipment after Thanksgiving.
4167384	4167684	So...
4169102	4174626	Yeah, it's gonna be, they're gonna have systems out there, and people don't really need to spend, you know, tons of money.
4176188	4179130	Uh, Ranma just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.
4179630	4182613	Uh, what's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?
4183113	4184174	Two gunshots to the head.
4185895	4186116	Ouch.
4186616	4187597	Ouch, ouch, ouch.
4188317	4189879	Hey, look, I didn't write them, I only read them.
4190759	4192821	Alright, uh, yeah, um...
4193652	4196693	You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.
4197213	4198534	You guys remember John Edwards?
4198934	4201515	He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.
4202395	4203736	He ran with John Kerry, right?
4204636	4207717	Well, there was a story circulating around the internet that what happened.
4207837	4219522	Now, what's interesting to note about John Edwards is he's kind of, you know, he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know, and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart.
4219542	4222303	So he's kind of in that camp and it's kind of one of his platforms or whatever.
4222765	4224466	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4239713	4240534	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4268976	4270697	Very interesting back and forth.
4271497	4277960	Obviously, there's the he said and they said type thing, so it's really hard to know who's right.
4278040	4287943	But if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little silly.
4288023	4289604	One of his staffers is probably fired.
4289924	4295346	Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.
4295826	4296366	Interesting.
4297847	4298907	What's this quote from Walmart?
4298947	4300428	Here's the quote from Walmart.
4300468	4305710	While the rest of America's working families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.
4306050	4306270	Ouch.
4306951	4313693	Certainly not good if he's trying to run for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?
4313813	4314654	Most people probably forget.
4316534	4316895	I don't know.
4317055	4317395	I don't know.
4317475	4318095	I'm just thinking.
4318115	4319216	It was a while ago.
4319976	4320316	We'll see.
4320696	4321016	We'll see.
4322097	4324998	On a small political note, he made a
4325894	4331918	He made a joke about George Bush and everyone took it to be a joke about him insulting the troops.
4332438	4334159	They're going to play that too.
4334400	4335560	That was Kerry, not Edwards.
4335580	4336181	Oh, that was Kerry?
4336301	4337161	Yeah.
4337462	4340443	He did that in Seattle and I thought it was the funniest thing ever.
4340463	4342825	He's not running anyway because he's associated with John Kerry.
4345247	4347048	Alright, this isn't Crossfire, boys and girls.
4347388	4349189	We've got to keep it moving.
4350150	4353492	We're just going to have to go to a different country or something to get us off of this tangent.
4354198	4354478	PS3, PS4, PS5
4380491	4407821	Sony's crackdown on all of the shipping LickSanClose, PlayAsia is not sending any Sony products to Europe eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done but there is a company that's advertising in these stations stating PS3 order now for Christmas and they're giving a premium 150 minute phone number to call
4408914	4414799	to leave details on the phone service to where they'll be called back when the systems are available.
4415439	4420123	A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently investigating it further.
4420563	4427269	We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.
4429269	4436571	A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff going on just to get their hands on a PlayStation 3.
4436952	4438232	Jesus Christ, Sony.
4438632	4440333	What are you trying to hide from Europe?
4440453	4442914	Let them import the goddamn systems.
4443174	4445795	But I still think that this stinks of scam.
4446715	4448175	Oh, no, I don't doubt that one bit.
4448475	4451657	I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up.
4451717	4453117	And scammers, shut the fuck up.
4453937	4457098	Alright, you should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story.
4457158	4457619	No, I'm kidding.
4457699	4458239	You know I love you, DMN.
4461676	4463877	Anyways, sorry.
4465338	4473584	So, it's kind of funny though, I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart.
4473824	4480328	It's really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going there with a PlayStation 3 in there.
4480488	4490155	And well, basically they found out it's not running actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's actually a PlayStation 3.
4490885	4491526	Live footage.
4491706	4495629	So, oops, I guess that sucks.
4496049	4503394	But that was actually coming from Gamer Randy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there.
4504095	4506737	One for the TV, one for a DVD player.
4508653	4512975	I'm just asking this question hypothetically to bring up debate.
4513436	4516017	Is this necessarily such a bad thing, though?
4516157	4522200	I mean, if that's what Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine?
4522620	4523901	I mean, if that's how they want to do it?
4524121	4529063	That's fine, but I still think it's funny how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk.
4530384	4530984	It's authentic.
4531765	4532385	I'll give them that.
4533926	4534446	You're harsh.
4534566	4535006	You're harsh.
4535707	4536007	All right.
4536460	4542667	Well, you know, Sony may not be the only folks experiencing some broken things here at launch.
4542988	4554761	Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually, just before we went live, and I think I missed the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are breaking down, but
4555117	4556358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4578167	4582729	So two of these things they were touting at E3, just for whatever reason, not ready to go just yet.
4583189	4589052	Should be noted, it's kind of interesting, I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't available either.
4589092	4592333	You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop channel.
4592653	4599456	And some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now.
4599556	4602477	All those people that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today.
4602877	4604838	So, you know, everybody's trying to download that at once.
4604918	4607019	And thankfully I didn't have a problem, I guess...
4607472	4610674	We're lucky in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores.
4610774	4614656	But, yeah, you know, certainly interesting to have all these updates.
4614957	4623041	Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not detrimental to the system's operation.
4623101	4625003	It is, first and foremost, the gaming console.
4625423	4633748	I honestly think that the news channel is coming out a little later because it was announced that they're partnering with CNN and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out yet.
4634722	4643143	I have no idea about the forecast channel, but it was interesting to see that firmware update right out of the box when you connected to the internet.
4644980	4650245	Mike W0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down.
4650265	4651666	Well, yeah, that's because it happened to me.
4652166	4653928	So I was pissed, of course.
4653968	4655749	And if my Wii breaks, I'm going to be pissed too.
4656130	4662975	But no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay or it's, you know, but it's kind of one of the things like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point.
4662995	4665437	You know, every launch console has bugs.
4665878	4672183	But, you know, in the first wave, no matter what the system, PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.
4673430	4679151	Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?
4680432	4693314	I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and again, this was so new, it didn't make our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like it said, you need to eject the disc and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things like that.
4693334	4695395	Yeah, that and lots of, like, disc read errors.
4695515	4696855	Yeah, little things like that.
4698275	4700636	That's not the amount that Sony is.
4701340	4703762	I'm going to chat room to read more comments.
4703802	4705543	If you want to join our chat room, chat.orangeloungeradio.com
4727713	4729654	Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat.
4729694	4731135	Do you really want news or weather?
4732016	4733196	No, I don't.
4733216	4735378	That would be nice.
4735438	4737259	I would like the internet browser.
4737459	4738440	Yeah, I would like that, definitely.
4738960	4748287	I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.
4748467	4749928	I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry.
4749948	4753811	Honestly, if you want to know what the weather is going to look like, it's called looking out the fucking window.
4753831	4754151	Open a window.
4757190	4758291	I can't open the window.
4758331	4760272	The sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.
4763194	4764094	Oh, touche.
4764234	4766475	That's why I live in Seattle where it's cloudy and rainy all day.
4767936	4769957	At least you know what it's always going to be like there.
4770518	4776621	Well, at any rate, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for is music.
4777822	4785827	And there's going to be an MP3 player out in Europe anyway on 8th December that will be 20 Pounds.
4787749	4788970	Game Boy Advance and DS
4810983	4813326	Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting?
4813626	4822674	Well, if it is a redo of the PlayOn, the PlayOn had a capacity to take a 2GB SD card.
4824756	4826958	I thought they already had something like that already.
4827438	4828419	That was the PlayOn.
4828839	4829420	No, here.
4830001	4831962	It's not the PlayOn or whatever.
4832102	4833864	It's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.
4834404	4837107	They use it mainly for, I don't know,
4837657	4841540	Pirating Games, and other things, but it's also meant for media.
4842360	4847044	And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte hard drive, micro drive in there.
4847544	4848505	Well, this one's official.
4849145	4849886	Alright, interesting.
4851616	4854438	I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick.
4854638	4857680	Miklatov PM'd me, and he said his Wii froze up today.
4858041	4860062	He was exiting the Mii channel, and it just froze.
4860142	4861503	He had to turn it off and on.
4861563	4867107	So there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get patched or something.
4867127	4870850	Mine froze up once, but it actually didn't really freeze up.
4870890	4876995	It just seemed like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system.
4877748	4881151	Before they launched the internet thing, so yeah, I didn't like it.
4881191	4889218	Well, I tried to do the Shop Channel today, and it just froze up when I was trying to go into Shop Channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.
4889298	4893002	Yeah, mine's kind of a little delayed today, too.
4893462	4899427	I mean, I can let little web errors slide, because those are at least fixed in an hour, you know, just depending on the issue.
4899747	4904712	Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues ever since the damn game came out, so...
4906020	4908582	A World of Warcraft, Long Q Times, and all that fun stuff.
4910122	4914725	Anywho, so, you know, of course you're going to get issues with a console like this.
4914945	4921409	And, you know, I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they cut out, like, you know, DVD playback and stuff like that.
4921849	4922669	But not a big deal.
4922789	4926411	But actually, they were aiming for an even lower price point than $249.
4926491	4931294	They would have liked to have seen it at under $100, according to Miyamoto.
4932052	4939976	and his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money could be spent on proving the interface and software.
4940557	4951063	And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and photos and other pricey parts they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.
4951903	4957206	And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for $99?
4957326	4960748	I mean as it is they're flying off the shelves pretty quick but
4961426	4964447	$99 is just stupid low.
4965608	4965968	I don't know.
4966688	4972651	Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted as the revolution that the revolution was going to be $99?
4973051	4979013	I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?
4979313	4979774	I do think.
4981054	4982395	But, um, I don't know.
4982655	4984035	I think $249 is pretty good.
4985036	4986937	Definitely, it's different.
4987457	4990478	A lot of people, though, I think their competition is going to be saying...
4990899	4992761	Well, our graphics are better.
4992821	4997684	We can do HD movies, but... Yeah, so what?
4997724	5006231	I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.
5006792	5009754	I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me.
5010014	5012216	So, whatever.
5014178	5014498	Alright.
5015539	5015619	Um...
5016292	5023896	Moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.
5024016	5026758	I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming.
5026818	5027478	And you know what?
5027558	5030359	Hey, Drew's waving his hand over there.
5030399	5033401	What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?
5033441	5035662	Is it just the cost or what's the deal?
5036443	5037523	Right now it's the cost.
5038143	5041825	I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.
5042166	5042386	Right.
5043556	5049558	Final Fantasy XIII, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side, Super Smash Bros.
5049598	5051879	Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.
5052479	5054940	I'm just waiting for the big name titles.
5055281	5057341	Well, what current gen systems do you have?
5057381	5058242	Do you have a Dreamcast?
5058402	5059302	I have a PS2.
5059382	5060322	I want a Dreamcast.
5060763	5062143	Well, you can probably still get one cheap.
5062223	5067145	And good news for you Dreamcast owners, there is another Dreamcast game coming out.
5067185	5072087	PlayAsia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December.
5072563	5074444	It's a side-scrolling space shooter.
5075484	5080405	It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.
5080825	5087007	It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured, distributed, or endorsed by Sega.
5087447	5095889	One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo AES and NVS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.
5096129	5096589	Oh, interesting.
5096629	5097310	I didn't even catch that.
5097530	5098350	I went to the website.
5100672	5111423	www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com The one thing about it though is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other Neo Geo carts.
5112284	5115207	So yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo.
5117343	5119205	Unless you get CD or Dreamcast.
5119586	5126512	Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince, that OLR reported on a few months ago.
5126532	5127273	Yeah, that's true.
5127293	5128314	Remember the Genesis game?
5128354	5128594	Yeah.
5128975	5129375	Very cool.
5131823	5132083	DarkSakura.com
5158929	5162031	My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.
5162051	5162611	It's smashmyps3.com.
5184969	5191993	Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have Smash My PS3.
5192673	5211084	And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation 3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting outside.
5211488	5215549	and waiting and waiting for their very own PlayStation 3.
5216829	5239613	Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.
5241058	5244219	Translated, that means they smashed that thing to the ground.
5245639	5249221	It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.
5249381	5251601	Now, abstract translation.
5251621	5256023	A method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.
5257023	5261524	Now, I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe that... They did take the second one and sell it.
5261644	5264245	Gets their conscience cleared a little bit.
5264565	5267826	Out of curiosity, will you be visiting smashmywee.com?
5268406	5269347	No, that will make me cry.
5270720	5282246	No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny because there's people who are so freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.
5284247	5288188	Yeah, actually, there's a... You can't get laid, Jernami.
5289733	5294336	There's actually, there was a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.
5294376	5298899	The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool, and I'm looking forward to it.
5298939	5301401	There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.
5301821	5305924	Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!
5307825	5311248	Satan commands that I give my soul to Sony!
5311448	5318953	Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like, watching someone smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point.
5320165	5322207	Wait, does that mean Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?
5323548	5324249	I haven't seen that.
5324309	5325670	No, I love Little Nicky.
5326511	5328112	Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.
5328132	5329553	Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes.
5329653	5330454	He eats crayons.
5331675	5333517	He's like the poo of Cthulhu.
5336600	5340763	He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his fecal matter.
5343606	5346028	Wow, that's interesting.
5346648	5346969	Alright.
5348690	5352371	What we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip here.
5352931	5358572	And it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having to hold off on the contest a little bit here.
5358832	5360632	We'll fill you in after this taped segment what we're going to do.
5360652	5363193	We're hoping the rest of the chat comes back.
5363293	5364453	Rob broke the internet.
5364693	5365393	I didn't break it.
5365453	5366773	I have a backup plan just in case.
5366813	5368374	I'll run it by DMN.
5368394	5369794	But we're going to go to this taped bit.
5370054	5372914	DarkSakura and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland.
5373274	5376495	And they thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?
5377213	5382237	So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different people.
5382277	5385019	So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?
5385640	5391284	Well, in the car we were thinking, hey, it'd be a cool idea to interview people to see why they're out in line.
5391364	5395407	So I was, like, Jamie was keeping our place in line and I was going to go play reporter.
5395827	5399870	And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.
5399950	5401151	I don't like talking to new people.
5402692	5403133	She's shy.
5404506	5405967	I am pretty shy around new people.
5406047	5408149	So I walked up and I was representing Orange Lounge.
5408169	5411951	So I'm like, oh, hi, do you mind if I interview you for OrangeLoungeRadio.com?
5411991	5412731	It's a video game.
5413051	5414352	You know, I went through the whole thing.
5414752	5417034	And kind of most of them went, uh, sure.
5417634	5420756	So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.
5420836	5422016	So I'm sorry.
5422537	5423517	I'm sorry you have to listen to those.
5424098	5425038	No, it's cool.
5425078	5426359	So, yeah, Demon?
5426419	5430541	So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.
5430561	5430981	Good job.
5431021	5431802	Oh, yeah.
5432503	5434084	Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.
5435164	5442908	This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Lounge Radio message line from the line outside Target in Citrus Heights, California.
5442928	5445729	Say hi, everybody.
5446129	5451852	So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the night.
5451992	5454613	So we'll begin by our house lesbian.
5454653	5454993	Hi.
5455133	5455393	Hi.
5456194	5457655	And stay tuned to listen.
5457835	5458335	Okay, bye-bye.
5459758	5463823	Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Lauren's Lounge Radio.
5464003	5470732	I am Chris, also known as Disney Punk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target Garden Center, actually.
5470752	5472394	We're under the sign that says Garden Center.
5473014	5475097	And there's probably, it looks to be about 30 people online.
5475197	5477380	I'm going to start at the end because the end rules.
5478298	5482022	I'm right in front of a guy and a girl.
5482122	5485245	One's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black hats on.
5485325	5486426	One's got an Alcatraz office on.
5486446	5487067	That's great.
5487387	5488628	So I'm just going to ask a couple of questions.
5488808	5490029	First of all, can you state your name?
5490390	5490790	Jamie.
5491070	5491391	Jamie?
5494113	5496295	Our host, DarkSakura, actually named Jamie, too.
5496916	5497837	They're going to fight.
5497977	5498417	No, I'm kidding.
5498898	5500099	Can I have your name?
5500519	5500759	Erin.
5500840	5500980	Erin?
5501060	5501240	Erin?
5501935	5507598	Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at, what is it, 2?
5507858	5508858	Oh, it's 2 o'clock in the morning?
5509299	5512560	Well, it's my birthday today.
5512900	5513260	Thanks.
5513461	5515902	I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.
5516302	5522885	I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones because the codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.
5523585	5526987	Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?
5527787	5528028	No.
5528848	5529588	Definitely not.
5529708	5530309	Definitely not?
5530729	5531049	Why not?
5531938	5533641	I'm not as interested really right now.
5534642	5536345	Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.
5537607	5538007	Fair enough.
5538748	5540531	And can I ask you guys a random question?
5541492	5544296	What's your favorite color?
5544316	5544517	Blue.
5545037	5545298	Green?
5545774	5547915	Okay, those were both wrong answers and you fail.
5549116	5549476	I'm kidding.
5549736	5549996	Orange.
5550236	5551177	Orange, okay.
5552417	5553238	Can I ask you, sir?
5553298	5554338	What's your name?
5554398	5554739	Nathan.
5554979	5555279	Nathan?
5555619	5558741	Okay, why do you think the Wii U is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5558761	5562162	Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan.
5562222	5562863	I grew up on it.
5564704	5565964	All right, old school fan.
5565984	5569286	Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?
5569626	5570407	No, absolutely not.
5570667	5570927	Okay.
5572608	5574009	And here's your obligatory question.
5575996	5576756	Hmm, that's a good one.
5577517	5579278	I can't really think of a little obligatory question.
5579638	5581159	What's your favorite color?
5581279	5581499	Red.
5581519	5581579	Red?
5581739	5581999	Okay.
5582439	5583240	That was the right answer.
5583380	5583740	You win.
5584060	5587622	All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.
5587702	5592885	There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here, and there isn't a big line, so good luck.
5593405	5600569	Good evening, radio fans, and this is Kristen again with your Wii.
5600949	5601770	I guess it would be...
5602854	5605718	and our cast of Are We... I don't know what you call it.
5605998	5608541	But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.
5609463	5611145	And I'm here with... Can you say your name?
5611445	5611766	Sarah.
5612006	5612326	Sarah.
5613868	5617192	I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line.
5617232	5618854	And now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.
5618915	5619015	So...
5620641	5622923	But she's got, she's probably got the most awesome hat here.
5622983	5630347	It's a white hat, like baseball cap, with a V. It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.
5630748	5633109	So, can I ask you, she's actually got, what's your shirt?
5633509	5634210	Donkey Kong.
5634230	5634550	That's awesome.
5634570	5636071	It's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.
5636131	5636631	That's awesome.
5637051	5641374	So, can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5642275	5644696	Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?
5644736	5646017	How long, actually, how long have you been here?
5646713	5649914	I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.
5650234	5651275	Not too terribly long, yeah.
5651355	5652575	Okay, that's not bad.
5652775	5655756	Why do you think the Wii is waiting for us this early in the morning?
5657717	5658778	Twilight Princess, first of all.
5658978	5665180	Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while, and I think it's certainly worth the wait.
5665440	5667061	Yep.
5667781	5668661	Did you get a PS3?
5669142	5671402	Oh, hell no.
5671483	5675164	Do you see a difference, or is it just the price, or...?
5675882	5680246	I would not pay $600 to test out an unused, unproven format of disc.
5680406	5680646	No.
5680726	5681367	Screw Sony.
5681387	5682548	They're getting too big for their shorts.
5684390	5686672	Oh, you are loved by many Orange Lounge listeners.
5687652	5690895	They all bash Sony all the time.
5690975	5693798	And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?
5694478	5694799	Blue.
5695700	5697081	You fail and lose.
5697661	5698041	I'm sorry.
5698241	5699241	I meant to say orange.
5699281	5700182	I meant to say orange!
5700282	5702422	Okay, you survived.
5702943	5707544	Alright, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii, but I don't think it'll be that bad.
5707564	5708625	There's not that many people online.
5709385	5710485	Okay, thank you very much.
5710765	5711586	You're welcome.
5712306	5715327	Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?
5715787	5716868	What is your quest?
5717208	5717588	You!
5718128	5719209	Cake or death!
5721708	5737543	I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question, I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions, but I was so nervous, I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them, and I just kept, what's your favorite color?
5738043	5744950	It's alright, it's just an internet radio show, you don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie, you still are, you're Saint Chris, remember?
5744970	5745150	It's
5745862	5747823	She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.
5747963	5753584	No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.
5755665	5757765	I was trying to help your radio.
5757946	5758626	No, it's funny.
5758686	5761086	I like it because I like hearing people's reactions to it.
5761467	5761827	No.
5762507	5763207	Hell no.
5763907	5766308	But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later.
5766348	5768609	But anyway, I just had to interrupt to say that because that was funny.
5768709	5769589	So back to the tape.
5770194	5776596	Hello radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people, in line for the Wii.
5776676	5777556	Can you guys state your names?
5778236	5780857	Uh, Stellon, John.
5781757	5784558	How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?
5784678	5786318	It's like nine, about like eight.
5786358	5787999	Okay, what's your name?
5788419	5788819	Kyle.
5789019	5790860	Kyle, how long have you been here?
5790960	5791720	Uh, just Kyle.
5791820	5795501	Okay, uh, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?
5795521	5795781	Uh,
5798539	5798739	What?
5799200	5800961	Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5801041	5801981	What's so special about it?
5802442	5803703	Because it's so kick-ass.
5803843	5804523	And there's Zelda.
5805864	5807005	I'm just picking it up for a friend.
5807905	5808406	Wow.
5809426	5813329	Damn, he must owe you or you owe him.
5813369	5813949	Do you owe him money?
5814670	5814950	Okay.
5816591	5817972	I'm just here for kicks.
5819012	5820473	You're just hanging out in the cold?
5820493	5820573	Yeah.
5821094	5821474	All right.
5821494	5825336	All right, David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?
5825376	5825477	No.
5826641	5828602	No, Sony Scott.
5828622	5830324	Not unless they drop the price.
5832145	5834887	Okay, he's just here for kids.
5834947	5838229	All right, and your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?
5839330	5839570	Green.
5840571	5840931	Plaid.
5841391	5841931	Yellow.
5842212	5842532	Yellow?
5843032	5843893	Okay, you win.
5844053	5844773	Plaid wins.
5844893	5846394	All right, well, thank you guys.
5846435	5853179	If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock tonight, or we're on podcast.
5853199	5854380	You can download it on iTunes.
5855024	5857905	Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, though.
5858505	5858986	Yay, Wii!
5859046	5864788	Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but because the next one is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.
5865508	5868789	But we're interviewing people at the Wii, so Jamie, stop talking to people.
5868929	5869949	What?
5870270	5870770	Okay.
5870830	5872971	State your name, please.
5872991	5874871	DarkSakura, the Great and Mighty.
5876072	5877092	That was pretty pathetic.
5877112	5878713	Light my ass!
5879273	5879613	Literally?
5880245	5881246	Yeah, in public.
5881526	5885169	Okay, you get to be asked these questions too.
5885489	5888951	First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5889652	5890232	I was bored.
5890652	5893074	Okay.
5894215	5895816	Alright, are you getting a PS3?
5897277	5901500	Yeah.
5902120	5906524	We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a trader and pre-ordered one right before he quit GameStop.
5907164	5907925	Do you guys actually get it?
5908645	5909846	No, we're getting a second shipment.
5911129	5914090	I don't care because Sony sucks my butt.
5916031	5921772	Your obligatory question, can you peel potatoes correctly?
5923133	5930755	You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama, and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.
5934016	5935836	Nintendo, please give her money.
5936636	5939057	Better living than Nintendo, I am now the aluminum chef.
5940481	5940781	Uh-huh.
5941341	5945182	Anyway, thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.
5945823	5947003	I go on to the next step.
5947223	5952265	Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the WeLine at Target.
5952625	5960127	And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are apparently, or one of them at least, is apparently a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second when I get closer to him.
5960575	5963257	They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.
5964738	5968942	I just think that that's like old school, you know.
5969082	5971964	Alright, alright, I get it.
5972184	5974546	Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.
5974726	5975607	What's your name?
5975627	5975887	Gary.
5976168	5976448	Gary.
5976928	5977409	What's your name?
5977449	5977809	Horatio.
5978849	5985578	Jordan Can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at 2 in the morning waiting for a week?
5994437	5996839	We want the Wii.
5996879	5997579	We want the Wii.
5997919	5999680	Why do you want the Wii so badly?
5999800	6000661	Twilight Princess.
6000721	6001922	Twilight Princess.
6002842	6003162	And you?
6003182	6005564	Twilight Princess.
6005824	6007685	Twilight Princess.
6007725	6009006	Car, yo!
6009987	6010767	Can I get your name?
6011267	6011688	Kristen.
6013149	6013549	Travis.
6013569	6014129	Travis.
6014469	6015030	Why are you out here?
6016210	6017211	To get a Wii for his brother.
6018772	6019452	You owe him money?
6019693	6020853	No, I'm just a good friend.
6021113	6021574	I'm not broke.
6021594	6022074	That's sweet.
6024427	6027129	Can I get your name?
6027149	6027510	Steven.
6027770	6028590	Steven?
6028631	6033614	I'm going to actually have an interview with you.
6034235	6036577	Steven, why are you here?
6036637	6042541	Can I ask you guys, can I ask you guys, did you get a PS3?
6042681	6044082	Or planning on getting a PS3?
6044423	6046744	Maybe with $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.
6046945	6048466	That's the only game I will be getting for that.
6048526	6048886	No.
6049507	6049647	No?
6049987	6050387	Not at all?
6050407	6050467	No.
6051667	6052848	I'll borrow his video game.
6052868	6053448	Yeah, I'll borrow one.
6053468	6053748	No, no PS3.
6053768	6054989	Yeah, Final Fantasy 13.
6055029	6056830	Alright, and here's your blanket question.
6056910	6058450	What's your favorite color?
6058531	6058711	Blue.
6058731	6059211	You failed.
6059231	6059891	Green.
6059971	6060572	Okay, that's correct.
6079303	6089568	I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a DarkSakura fanboy apparently.
6089588	6090729	So I'll be there in a second.
6096670	6104573	Hello radio listeners, I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.
6104973	6107514	So can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?
6107954	6111035	Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.
6111055	6111955	You're not in the chat at all?
6112275	6113636	Okay, but you are a listener?
6113716	6114476	Archive listener.
6115016	6115336	Awesome.
6115636	6118637	Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m.
6118657	6119098	for a Wii?
6119998	6120578	Wait, the Wii?
6120618	6121899	I thought I was in the, like, PS3 line.
6122019	6124820	No, I'm getting a Wii.
6125040	6125940	Okay, why are you getting a Wii?
6126847	6127427	Spongebob.
6129929	6131870	I often hear Zelda's pretty good.
6131990	6134211	Okay, well, we'll buy that.
6134551	6136332	All right, are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?
6137433	6138713	I'll buy it.
6138753	6141055	If my friends get it, I'll play it, but I'm not going to buy it myself.
6141115	6142315	All right, Dave.
6142475	6143896	All right, what's your favorite color?
6144296	6144596	Brown.
6146277	6147418	No, hold on.
6148378	6148919	I thought white.
6148939	6151540	Loki is displeased with you.
6155958	6157158	Loki is displeased with you.
6157179	6159079	Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.
6159119	6160860	Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.
6161300	6162080	I like Microsoft.
6162340	6162600	Okay.
6162900	6164521	Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?
6165101	6165601	It's amazing.
6166161	6166761	It's amazing.
6166801	6168422	What's your favorite part?
6168542	6170563	I like FU's of the Week.
6170763	6172863	Damien just informed us that he came up with that.
6173203	6175704	It's funny because I always talk about the roads in Sacramento.
6175744	6177285	I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.
6177305	6177945	So it's pretty cool.
6178837	6179718	Awesome.
6179878	6184984	Is there any advice you'd want to give Rob, Jamie, and Loki?
6185625	6186606	I don't know.
6186626	6188648	Tell them to go snorkeling more.
6188688	6190149	Yeah, go snorkeling more often.
6190290	6192592	More snorkeling inside the gaming news.
6193874	6194694	I see.
6194734	6196657	Can I give you a hint of another...
6198078	6200379	Hello, Orange Line listeners, I'm at the front of the line.
6200399	6201599	Somebody just yelled.
6224961	6227323	That was interesting.
6227423	6234147	Anyway, I'm at the front of the line with some people playing Monopoly, and I actually haven't gotten an okay to interview all of them, but let's start.
6234547	6236989	Can I interview you guys?
6237029	6238149	Yeah.
6238229	6238610	Okay.
6238630	6239550	Can I get your name?
6239650	6240191	I'm Nick.
6240511	6240811	Rod.
6241151	6241411	Rod.
6242572	6243132	Farnsworth.
6243433	6244693	Farnsworth.
6244713	6245234	Katie.
6245434	6246334	Katie.
6246374	6246775	Katie.
6246895	6248436	I like to go by Epis.
6248756	6249016	Epis.
6250384	6259090	Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?
6259130	6260791	We need a cool place to play Monopoly.
6264453	6266134	What's the Wii worth waiting for?
6267375	6270117	Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.
6270137	6272458	I mean, that's all we're really doing.
6272498	6273619	We have nothing else better to do.
6273879	6276341	Just hang out with friends, play some games.
6277330	6279432	And we really want the Wii, I guess.
6279472	6280252	Why do you really want the Wii?
6281093	6283474	Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.
6283835	6285376	Nothing better to do next weekend.
6285776	6286156	That works.
6287477	6288178	I want to fit in.
6288498	6289759	I want to be in the end crowd.
6290319	6291920	You're not cool unless you have a Wii.
6292100	6292661	Exactly.
6293561	6294442	Thank you so much.
6294542	6296803	Do you want me to come back?
6297164	6297364	Yeah.
6297424	6297584	Okay.
6299266	6305048	I heard it actually increases sexual performance.
6306208	6308148	With the wrist movements.
6309029	6310649	No, with the wrist movements.
6310729	6317551	The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.
6317631	6320152	I think that's the most interesting answer I've gotten yet.
6320832	6325073	I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way of innovating the game system.
6325779	6328019	and that's the most intelligent one at the table.
6328139	6329540	All right.
6329560	6334501	Can I ask you guys, are you getting a PS3 at all or what do you think about it?
6335621	6338922	If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay attention at all.
6338942	6340842	The one that goes down in price.
6341282	6341842	Hang on, I'm moving.
6342162	6344403	You mean the piece of shit three that already has glitches?
6344443	6345123	Yeah, pretty much.
6345603	6347583	Oh, whoa!
6347603	6349164	Well, yeah, I'll be getting one.
6349264	6349404	Uh...
6352040	6361242	Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's going to be a glitch and $600 for something that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once in a while?
6361662	6366584	Yeah, that's luck, getting a hooker downtown than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.
6368104	6368964	Okay, I like this table.
6368984	6369884	These people are interesting.
6370325	6372285	Okay, you guys get an obligatory question.
6372305	6372925	What's your favorite color?
6373245	6373485	Clear.
6374326	6375706	Fail.
6375726	6376146	Vlog.
6376226	6377766	I'll accept that.
6379407	6380147	Corn yellow.
6381098	6381518	Interesting.
6381818	6382218	I accept.
6383659	6384679	Jeremy, you stole mine.
6385239	6385579	Fail.
6386039	6386480	I'll pink.
6387440	6388020	I like pink.
6388080	6388700	Okay.
6389020	6389820	Light purple.
6392121	6392901	Okay, I'll accept that.
6392921	6395902	All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.
6396622	6397823	Well, thank you guys for evening.
6397843	6398163	Good luck.
6399361	6400603	Alright, that was our last one.
6400623	6402024	They are at the front of the line.
6403146	6407191	And I'll call one more time to tell you how I feel about all this.
6407451	6408973	If anyone really gives a shit.
6409133	6410775	So, alright, thanks.
6410795	6414960	This is the last one I'll be making of these because I bet you're just
6415920	6416581	and Sick of Me.
6416841	6422744	But you get one more little tidbit and that is from Wah, your token lesbian of the show.
6424385	6436391	I'm actually out here because a bunch of people are waiting out in line and they look cold and they do not look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.
6436771	6442514	So Jamie and I actually offered to get them coffee and donuts and that's pretty much why I'm out here.
6443078	6444739	It's because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.
6445219	6446080	That's the only reason.
6446500	6447941	And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too.
6448041	6449281	So, eh, whatever.
6449942	6452183	I've never played Zelda before.
6452543	6455324	I've never got to because my daddy did not let me.
6455785	6456765	I was a deprived child.
6457165	6461107	So, anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.
6461127	6461708	Disney Punk.
6462288	6466410	And this is in front of Target reporting for the Wii line.
6467190	6470192	And, oh, just to let you know, there's a Best Buy, like, right across the way.
6470272	6471753	And that line's, like, ten times as long.
6472561	6475144	and that amuses me.
6476425	6479568	But this line's cooler because they're getting coffee and donuts soon.
6479588	6484874	Alright, have fun out there in the Ethernet.
6487006	6488026	All right, thank you, Chris.
6488406	6492468	I know some of the folks in the chat room were like, oh, this is long, this is long.
6492488	6494268	You guys are talking to too damn many people.
6494288	6494728	I am so sorry.
6494748	6496269	Don't be sorry, because you know what?
6496769	6499690	Usagi hit the, or Usagi, I... Say Usagi.
6499850	6502031	Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to hell.
6502271	6509533	But no, no, she's right on here, because the quote here is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all about, the best people on earth.
6510013	6510874	And that's exactly it.
6512035	6515037	That's what made last night so fun, was just meeting other nerds.
6515137	6516418	It was really amazing.
6516458	6520521	They were so nice, and they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.
6521402	6523084	It was really important to interview.
6523124	6525245	There weren't that many people in line, considering.
6526066	6527367	It's like, well, there's not that many people.
6527387	6531030	We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on, and Rob can edit it later.
6531130	6532931	But it was just really fun meeting all of them.
6532991	6535954	They all said thanks, and they all asked, so when is it going to be played?
6535974	6536274	Yeah.
6536634	6538235	It was like, I think some of them are in here now.
6538255	6539315	I saw Ace Ender earlier.
6539335	6539835	Oh, he's back.
6540015	6542756	Oh, that must have been that whole Netsplit thing came back and some of those other people.
6542816	6544057	Oh, hi!
6544157	6550279	I have to say, too, the group that let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.
6550299	6551679	You guys were infinitely awesome.
6551699	6552400	Thank you so much.
6552440	6553640	Sources of amusement.
6554020	6555802	and kept me from passing out.
6555862	6560326	The entire night, the people that were right next to us and right behind us, they just were so nice.
6561087	6563629	Somebody kept walking up and down just talking to us.
6563870	6564830	Everybody was so nice.
6564891	6567453	It was like one big block party.
6567893	6570776	It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.
6572197	6575621	I was hearing the single best commentary coming from that game of Risk.
6576281	6577282	That was the best.
6577502	6578944	Every now and then you'd hear that collective...
6580859	6583681	And every so often I would ask, who took over the world yet?
6585502	6588744	I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday, you know.
6589365	6591366	I just took Australia, motherfucker.
6592407	6593347	WTF, mate.
6595709	6595989	All right.
6596670	6597150	DMN's We
6620712	6622714	and he's giving it away out of the goodness of his heart.
6622994	6624855	This was not something that was given to him.
6624895	6629719	This was not something that he bought this with his own money and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?
6629799	6630079	Yes.
6630179	6632361	Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners, something like that.
6632621	6633842	So we can do whatever rules we want.
6633882	6635863	So here's the new rules.
6636244	6637465	It's easy and it's still fair.
6637485	6638545	Biggest e-penis wins.
6638645	6638946	Go.
6639046	6639726	No, no, no.
6639766	6640167	No, I'm kidding.
6640407	6641187	So here it is.
6641307	6644570	Now instead of sending me a private message in chat, here's what you're going to do.
6644890	6648873	And remember, this only applies to folks listening live Sunday night.
6649133	6651695	This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast on all games.
6651735	6658619	This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes or whatever program you use to download our audio archive later on.
6658939	6659540	Okay, here it is.
6659620	6662842	If you're listening Sunday night and you want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.
6663422	6665704	Send an email, one email.
6665764	6668345	If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.
6668726	6672408	If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP, you will be disqualified.
6672928	6674710	And you don't have much time to pull any tricks.
6674750	6675190	So here it is.
6675530	6692156	Send one email to wecontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you on air or a Skype name will do as well.
6692736	6700119	And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in and we'll be drawing a very random one when we kick off part B. All right?
6701519	6705140	Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast, you're going to have to wait a day.
6705561	6705981	All right.
6706861	6707842	Sucks for you.
6708142	6713304	All right, so we will be back soon to determine the winner of the Wii contest.
6714164	6715625	And for those of you, yep, you do it now.
6715645	6716385	Ready, set, go, right now.
6717165	6719406	Yep, you have like five minutes to get it in there.
6719446	6720026	Go, hurry.
6720086	6721967	What the hell are you doing listening to us?
6722027	6723948	Open up your email and freaking email us.
6723988	6727169	All right, nope, subject does not have to be any particular something.
6727209	6729310	We just open up the email address for that.
6729390	6729870	Send one email.
6729890	6730931	But the more you suck up to me.
6730951	6731351	Yep.
6731764	6733165	with your screen name and your number.
6733185	6736627	We're going to give away the Wii right at the top of Part B. So that's it.
6736827	6737347	Oh, yes, Chris?
6737627	6741189	If you send a naked picture with it, you know, extra bonus points.
6741489	6742370	Oh, stop, stop.
6742910	6743190	All right.
6743610	6744391	Boobs only, please.
6745151	6745451	All right.
6746572	6748133	We'll be back in a little bit to find out the winner.
6748413	6753135	Those of you listening to us on the audio archive, we'll be back in about a day, and you can hear the exciting conclusion.
6753476	6756217	Those of you guys on All Games Radio or listening on Sunday night, stick around.
6756257	6756897	We'll be right back.
6757618	6757898	Bye.
