117000	119000	From the far off land of Wisconsin

135000	137000	Hi everybody

155000	161000	What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day
161000	165000	Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium
165000	167000	And where do you work for our first time?
167000	171000	I work at the magical land where Wii's flow like wine Nintendo
171000	173000	Really?
173000	174000	Yes
174000	176000	Last I checked
176000	179000	I sometimes have Wii flow when I drink a lot of wine but I don't
179000	180000	Alright forget it bad joke
180000	183000	Look you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days
183000	185000	You're all gonna just die
185000	187000	So anyway well welcome to the show DMN
187000	188000	Thank you thank you for having me
188000	190000	And you know just having him here in the studio
190000	192000	And like hanging out with us all weekend
192000	194000	It just proves Orange Launch Radio listeners
194000	195000	Stalking us works
195000	196000	It really does
196000	197000	Yeah
197000	198000	Here he is
198000	200000	And he violated me last night
200000	201000	And it was no I'm just kidding
201000	202000	I'm totally chill
202000	203000	That's not what you said
203000	204000	You were
204000	205000	You were
205000	207000	Can I say that?
207000	209000	And it's a family show boys and girls
209000	210000	Sort of
210000	211000	I know it's not really
211000	212000	No it's not
212000	213000	Alright look
213000	214000	I know we might have gotten some new listeners this week
214000	216000	You know not just because you know iTunes
216000	219000	And all the great reviews you guys have been leaving for us there
219000	221000	I've been you know up in our ranking and stuff
221000	223000	And XB stream and the cool people over there at us
223000	224000	Default podcasts
224000	225000	Just everywhere else we've been listed
225000	228000	And then locally this week we got some support as well
228000	230000	We'll talk about that in a little bit
230000	231000	So if you're new to Orange Launch Radio
231000	233000	And want to say hey and welcome
233000	234000	And we're just a program
234000	237000	We go on for like two and a half three hours
237000	239000	We're gamers just like the rest of you guys
239000	240000	We don't get paid for this
240000	241000	At least not yet
241000	243000	We've been doing this almost five years
243000	244000	In May it'll be five years
244000	246000	So about four and a half years we've been doing this
246000	248000	We started as a program dedicated to
248000	249000	Dance Dance Revolution
249000	250000	And music based video games
250000	252000	Parappa amplitude things of that nature
252000	254000	But you know we found that
254000	257000	It kind of ended up being a little too limiting
257000	259000	Especially when there was a very slow period
259000	261000	Think of the period before DDR Supernova
261000	262000	Before Guitar Hero
262000	264000	There was a very slow period of music gaming
264000	266000	So we thought you know we're video game nuts first
266000	268000	So we started doing a general video game show
268000	269000	So that's where we're at now
269000	270000	Because we're all nerds
270000	272000	And we invite you guys to be nerdy with us
272000	273000	So please come to our chat room
273000	275000	If you're listening to us live here on Sunday night
275000	277000	If you're not listening to us on our audio blog
277000	279000	You can come join us in the chat room
279000	282000	It's chat.orangelaunchradio.com
282000	283000	And guess what
283000	285000	If you're listening live on this Sunday night
285000	286000	You definitely want to be here tonight
286000	288000	Because DMN what did you bring with you
288000	290000	For one of our random chatters tonight?
290000	292000	I brought a Wii
292000	294000	Not my Wii you sickos
294000	295000	Get your head out of the gutter
295000	297000	No a Wii and a box with the Wii Sports
297000	299000	And all that fun stuff
299000	300000	And I do know we have a worldwide audience
300000	301000	But it should be said
301000	303000	This is a US region Wii
303000	305000	Yeah this is a region one Wii
305000	307000	So I'm really sorry to all you
307000	310000	Japanese, South American, Antarctica
310000	312000	European listeners
312000	314000	It probably won't do you much good
314000	316000	But if you want to win it that badly
316000	318000	You gotta be in chat
318000	320000	It's gonna be at some point tonight
320000	321000	More rules to come later
321000	322000	But first
322000	324000	We usually start off the show with a little bit of
324000	325000	How was your gaming week
325000	328000	But obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted
328000	331000	By other madness going on out there
331000	334000	And that would be the craziness going on around
334000	336000	The Playstation 3 and Wii lineups
336000	338000	So first off, Playstation 3
338000	340000	I know a lot of us here in this room
340000	342000	Weren't really gonna do the campout thing
342000	343000	For the Playstation 3
343000	345000	You know I've voiced previously on the program
345000	347000	I'm not ready for Playstation 3
347000	348000	It's just there's no game out right now
348000	349000	I really want
349000	351000	Wake me when Metal Gear Solid 4
351000	352000	Final Fantasy 13
352000	354000	Some of the big franchises are on their way
354000	355000	But I'm not into PS3 right now
355000	357000	I think Loki's in a very similar camp
357000	359000	But DarkSakura has expressed on a previous show
359000	361000	That she was already signed up
361000	362000	Thanks to her husband for a Playstation 3
362000	363000	So what happened?
363000	364000	How did that go down?
364000	366000	Did he just bring it home magically one day
366000	367000	Or did you guys wait anywhere?
367000	368000	No because it was an employee purchase
368000	369000	It's gonna be on the next shipment
369000	370000	Which is fair
370000	372000	You know he got to reserve it first
372000	373000	We were guaranteed one
373000	374000	But now Dan's like
374000	376000	Maybe I'm just gonna cancel my reserve
376000	378000	I'm like the hell you will
380000	381000	Wait you see
381000	382000	I don't understand DarkSakura
382000	384000	Cause you tend to go back and forth
384000	386000	You're like some days you're very anti-PlayStation
386000	387000	Some days you're very like
387000	388000	You better bring me that damn Playstation
388000	389000	No
389000	390000	I hate it okay
390000	391000	I hate it
391000	392000	But I have to have every video game system
392000	393000	That comes out
393000	394000	I see
394000	395000	So it's the collector in me that says
395000	396000	I want
396000	397000	And besides that I'm gonna play White Knights
397000	398000	When it's out
398000	399000	And
399000	402000	Why the hate for Sony Playstation right now?
402000	404000	Cause Ken Kuragi eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet
404000	405000	And is leased to the jungle gym
405000	406000	I see
406000	407000	I see
407000	408000	Thank you Magsy
408000	410000	But certain games are gonna change your mind
410000	412000	Like White Knights and things are gonna change your mind later
412000	414000	Well White Knights I definitely wanna play
414000	418000	There's a few other things that I'm sorta curious about
418000	420000	But right now not curious enough
420000	423000	That I would go out and wait in line for a PS3
423000	426000	One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date
426000	427000	Wow
427000	429000	I'm going to interview him Monday
429000	430000	Was your coworker
430000	431000	Now was your coworker
431000	434000	Now this is a lot of controversy going around around the Playstation 3 launch
434000	438000	Did your coworker actually wait in the line to get a Playstation 3 to play
438000	439000	Or were they getting one to sell
439000	440000	He was getting one to play
440000	442000	Oh well that's admirable
442000	443000	He got Madden
443000	444000	Okay I see
444000	446000	So sports game fan you know obviously
446000	448000	Yeah I can see that if you're a hardcore sports game
448000	450000	You wanna have the up graphics and all that cool stuff
450000	452000	That comes with you know the new system
452000	453000	Okay I see that
453000	458000	Alright so more to come on Playstation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers
458000	460000	And you know I can say this
460000	464000	I did touch the demo station they had at Target
464000	468000	I randomly went to Target on I think it was Wednesday I went there
468000	471000	Wednesday night I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house
471000	472000	Like shampoo and stuff
472000	475000	And there was already a line forming for the Playstation 3
475000	476000	And I just said hi
476000	477000	I was like Playstation 3 right
477000	478000	They're all yeah
478000	481000	So you know they were you know having fun just camping out
481000	483000	I didn't ask the eBay question but I went in the store
483000	485000	And they actually had a demo station there to play
485000	487000	So I picked up MotorStorm
487000	489000	And just played that a little bit
489000	492000	And I gotta be honest guys I'm not feeling it
492000	494000	I don't know maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it
494000	496000	I mean again I'm playing this in a Target
496000	498000	I'm not sitting down on my couch
498000	500000	My you know surround and the HD and all that stuff
500000	502000	I just I wasn't feeling it
502000	505000	I feel like I don't know burnouts more of a racer for me
505000	506000	Or even test drive was better
506000	508000	I just wasn't feeling the MotorStorm
508000	509000	I mean granted it's a different
509000	511000	It's you know a very different type of racer
511000	514000	But even it felt kind of slow to me
514000	515000	Kind of clunky I don't know
515000	517000	So I wasn't really feeling the love with MotorStorm
517000	518000	I'm sorry to say
518000	522000	I did see the basketball game which is NBA 07 yes
522000	523000	And that looked very nice
523000	524000	I thought it was a very good looking game
524000	526000	And pretty slick
526000	528000	So if I were going to be getting a Playstation 3 at launch
528000	531000	That would because you know I like basketball more than any other sport
531000	533000	That probably is the game I would pick up
533000	534000	It would be that game but
534000	538000	Yeah well I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards
538000	540000	The sports gamers and the hardcore
540000	542000	Because you usually see the people who
542000	544000	Especially the sports games who just come
544000	546000	And will buy it without hesitation
546000	548000	They always have the stupid Madden day
548000	551000	Where people I've heard camp out for it
551000	552000	If that is the case
552000	554000	It's kind of sad but
554000	556000	Yeah I see your point
556000	559000	Well so that was pretty much Playstation 3
559000	561000	Loki did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week
561000	563000	Did you play a demo station or anything
563000	566000	I watched I went by the best buy actually
566000	568000	Today it was funny because I went down there
568000	570000	And it was completely dead and the station was open
570000	573000	I saw MotorStorm but I mean it looks exactly the same
573000	575000	When I saw it at E3
575000	577000	Although the videos I've seen online look really cool
577000	580000	And it made me want to get it at some point
580000	583000	But I don't know
583000	588000	Then we saw that lair demonstration thing going on
588000	592000	At Walmart that was frozen on Saturday
592000	596000	So yeah I don't really know
596000	600000	How well the demo kiosks were working
600000	603000	But at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen
603000	606000	So I don't know
606000	609000	Alright well let's go to the chat room
609000	611000	Over at chat.orangelandtrader.com
611000	612000	For some comments from our chatters
612000	613000	They're like the invisible guests
613000	615000	We love to be an interactive show
615000	617000	So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there
617000	618000	Let's see
618000	620000	JeremyTau1 says
620000	624000	Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mirror toy?
624000	626000	Not when there's a profit to be made
626000	629000	As some people found out with Playstation 3
629000	630000	That was really their mirror motivation
630000	633000	It's like hey I make more money doing this than I do at my job
633000	634000	I don't know
634000	636000	Me personally I don't know
636000	639000	The little angel that sits on my shoulder says
639000	640000	Not a good idea
640000	641000	So I don't do it
641000	645000	But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things
645000	647000	BlackLab in our chat room says
647000	650000	Congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot
650000	654000	We have some crazy news about those Playstation 3 lines
654000	655000	We'll get to a little bit later
655000	657000	Okay so after the Playstation 3 launch
657000	659000	Obviously then the Wii line started forming
659000	661000	And that's kind of where we come in
661000	663000	Because I think we've also voiced previously on the program
663000	664000	That we have played Wii
664000	666000	Wii is the cheaper option
666000	667000	And as we said earlier in the program
667000	670000	You know we do this show as a hobby not a job
670000	673000	So you know our day jobs only give us so much money
673000	675000	So the Wii is really realistically
675000	677000	In my eyes the more affordable console anyway
677000	680000	So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up
680000	682000	But Loki you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii
682000	683000	You had a Wii before a lot of people did
683000	684000	How did this happen?
684000	688000	Because I work for a video and game distributor
688000	692000	And of course we get ours in early
692000	695000	Like on Wednesdays when we got them in
695000	696000	So that we could ship them to our customers
696000	698000	So that they would have them for the street date
698000	700000	And me being the greedy bastard that I am
700000	705000	I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City
705000	707000	And so I had mine on Thursday
707000	710000	And playing it ever since
710000	712000	So you know what this meant boys and girls
712000	714000	Party at Loki's house on Friday
714000	716000	So right on
716000	719000	So yeah we played a little bit of the Wii there
719000	720000	So then flash forward to last night
720000	722000	When the real camping started
722000	724000	Some of us were at dinner
724000	726000	And we were at Strings
726000	729000	And this little local Italian place
729000	731000	I keep forgetting we're an international show
731000	732000	So not everybody knows that
732000	733000	And we were just sitting around
733000	735000	And I don't know like lightning just kind of struck
735000	737000	And we were just kind of like
737000	740000	Dude let's go like buy cookies and orange soda
740000	743000	And go around to lines and just hand out goodies
743000	745000	Let's just go and like talk to gamers
745000	746000	And Loki can tape it
746000	747000	Maybe we can do a YouTube thing
747000	748000	And we'll just hand him stuff
748000	750000	Because you know you read all those reports
750000	751000	About people getting shot and stuff
751000	754000	But we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line
754000	756000	That a lot more people were being very cordial
756000	757000	So we were like
757000	758000	Let's go have fun
758000	759000	Let's go meet some more nerds
759000	760000	So we did
760000	761000	We hit up
761000	762000	We started at a local Target
762000	763000	We went to a Walmart
763000	764000	We went to GameStop
764000	766000	Where people were lining up for the midnight launch
766000	768000	That they already had pre-ordered
768000	770000	We went to another Target
770000	772000	The Great Land or Super Target
772000	773000	Whatever it's called
773000	774000	We went to like a Best Buy
774000	775000	Circuit City
775000	776000	We went all around
776000	777000	We went to Toys R Us too
777000	778000	That was fun
778000	779000	Yeah the one guy at Toys R Us
779000	780000	That looked very scary
780000	781000	He was like throw the cookie and drive
781000	785000	DMN what did you think about our little experience
785000	786000	Doing the Cookie Patrol?
786000	787000	I thought that was a lot of fun
787000	789000	You got to interact with a lot of people
789000	791000	Who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii
791000	794000	I honestly think that most of those people in that line
794000	795000	Were there to play it
795000	796000	Not to eBay it
796000	797000	Where as opposed to the PS3 people
797000	798000	Are thinking
798000	800000	Oh I can make double what I bought off this
800000	802000	I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line
802000	805000	A lot of these people were really good in line
805000	807000	They had a lot of fun
807000	809000	They seemed to be very grateful for the cookies
809000	811000	So if any of you are listening
811000	812000	Hi and we love you
812000	814000	Alright very cool
814000	815000	So anyway
815000	816000	One of our favorite lines
816000	818000	Now we liked a lot of the people that we met
818000	819000	I mean it was kind of weird
819000	821000	Because we would walk up at first
821000	822000	And some people were like
822000	823000	What are these guys going to do to us
823000	824000	Do they have BB guns
824000	825000	Or what's going to happen
825000	827000	You're poisoning the cookies Rob
827000	828000	You're poisoning the cookies
828000	829000	So you can get your weegee
829000	831000	That was my running joke throughout the whole night
831000	832000	Is that people went you know
832000	834000	I'd say oh the cookie
834000	835000	The arsenic in the cookies
835000	837000	Will kick in about 15 minutes
837000	838000	Have your wallets out
838000	839000	Wait wait wait
839000	840000	Arsenic?
840000	841000	I thought it was laxative
841000	842000	Whatever it was I don't know
842000	843000	Whatever the joke was
843000	844000	So we went to all these people
844000	845000	We met a lot of great people
845000	846000	But we
846000	847000	I don't know what it was
847000	848000	About the line to target Great Land
848000	850000	But maybe it was the fact that like
850000	851000	Somebody in that line there
851000	852000	Actually listened to the program
852000	853000	And like knew who we were
853000	854000	And that was kind of cool
854000	855000	And then there was just a
855000	856000	Like there was another girl
856000	857000	That you ended up giving your hat to
857000	858000	Right
858000	859000	Even though everybody everywhere
859000	860000	Was asking for your wee hat
860000	861000	My jacket too
861000	862000	God
862000	863000	What made you give it to that girl
863000	865000	She seemed really genuinely interested in the wee
865000	867000	And she seemed pretty hardcore
867000	868000	Right on
868000	869000	Yeah she was
869000	870000	And so getting back into this
870000	871000	Where Chris and Jamie
871000	873000	No it's cool it's cool
873000	874000	So I called Jamie on my phone
874000	875000	Because I really
875000	876000	I asked the target Great Land line
876000	877000	I go
877000	878000	How many units are you guys getting here
878000	879000	And they're like 60
879000	880000	And I'm looking at the line
880000	881000	I'm like
881000	883000	There's only like 25 people in this line
883000	885000	This is like a great opportunity to line up
885000	887000	So I called Jamie on my cell
887000	888000	And I said
888000	889000	Girl if you want a wee
889000	890000	Get your butt down here
890000	892000	You can get a wee
892000	893000	So what happened
893000	894000	I interrupted something you were doing
894000	896000	Somebody else had
896000	899000	This was just basically me being exhausted already
899000	900000	And somebody else said
900000	901000	Oh yeah
901000	902000	The target Great Lands are doing
902000	904000	The target Great Lands are doing a midnight launch
904000	906000	Which part of my brain went bullshit
906000	908000	But the rest of me was so tired
908000	909000	That I was like
909000	910000	Yeah I'm gonna go
910000	911000	We were actually
911000	912000	My friend Marissa
912000	914000	Who I mentioned on the show a few times
914000	915000	She was in town
915000	917000	And she's a singer-songwriter from LA
917000	918000	And there was a
918000	920000	Singer-songwriter convention going on
920000	922000	Just actually a few
922000	923000	At the
923000	924000	What was it
924000	925000	The Marriott
925000	926000	Yeah the Marriott
926000	927000	It was the Marriott
927000	928000	Chris we don't need to tell them all where I live
928000	929000	Sorry
929000	930000	That's alright
930000	932000	So we were
932000	933000	You know we were exhausted
933000	934000	It was very claustrophobic
934000	936000	They had blocked off an entire section
936000	938000	Just for the musicians
938000	939000	And everyone was like
939000	940000	Oh man
940000	941000	And then Jamie calls me on my phone
941000	942000	She's like
942000	943000	Where are you
943000	944000	I'm like
944000	945000	I'm at the end of the hall
945000	946000	She's like
946000	947000	We need to go to Target
947000	948000	Right now
948000	949000	I'm like
949000	950000	Are you sick or something
950000	951000	I was just like
951000	952000	Where am I gonna get a wee
952000	953000	I'm like
953000	954000	Okay
954000	956000	And since I'm hanging out with her
956000	957000	I kind of
957000	958000	She's my ride
958000	959000	And I wasn't really expecting
959000	960000	To get one
960000	961000	And part of me was excited too
961000	963000	About because Megsy called earlier
963000	964000	Oh yeah Megsy
964000	965000	And was humping her wee
965000	966000	Yeah she's like
966000	967000	I'm touching it
967000	968000	I'm touching it
968000	969000	Ah
969000	971000	That was her on the phone
971000	972000	It was really really funny
972000	976240	Funny enough that's not the first time they had that conversation
976240	979000	I was getting all excited and all that
979000	980000	So we
980000	981000	You had wee fever
981000	982000	We ran down there
982000	983000	Weaver fever
983000	984000	We pulled up to the
984000	985000	Weevil
985000	987000	We pulled up to the line
987000	989000	And Jamie rolled down the window
989000	990000	And screamed out
990000	992000	Orange Little Dream
992000	993000	And someone at the front yelled
993000	994000	Dark Sakura
994000	997000	It was really really funny
997000	998000	And then she parked and said
998000	1000000	Can we hang out with you guys
1000000	1001000	And then someone like
1001000	1003000	She wasn't really in the zone
1003000	1004000	So let me clarify
1004000	1007000	Dark Sakura used her celebrity to cut in line
1007000	1008000	Yeah
1008000	1009000	You're a bitch Jamie
1009000	1010000	I'm not a bitch
1010000	1011000	No no
1011000	1012000	She wouldn't have done it if
1012000	1013000	I mean they were getting 60
1013000	1015000	And there was only like 20 people in line
1015000	1016000	So you know nobody was getting hurt so
1016000	1018000	But we ended up going there
1018000	1020000	And slowly it dawned on me
1020000	1021000	This is not a midnight launch
1021000	1023000	Cause it was like a half an hour till midnight
1023000	1027000	It was like 1130 something
1027000	1028000	And it was
1028000	1029000	And Jamie
1029000	1030000	I'm like Jamie
1030000	1031000	This isn't a midnight launch
1031000	1032000	She's like
1032000	1033000	It's not
1033000	1034000	So we ended up
1034000	1035000	I was
1035000	1036000	I was
1036000	1038000	Again already tired of having been around that many people
1038000	1040000	It was really claustrophobic
1040000	1041000	We were with Marissa
1041000	1044000	But we jumbled things around
1044000	1045000	We ended up
1045000	1046000	What we were gonna do
1046000	1047000	Is we were gonna go back
1047000	1049000	Wait with them until morning
1049000	1051000	This is like at one o'clock
1051000	1052000	We were gonna wait with them
1052000	1053000	And then at one point
1053000	1055000	I was gonna go for coffee and donuts
1055000	1056000	Which started off really weird
1056000	1057000	I just like
1057000	1058000	Cause we had to leave and go get stuff
1058000	1059000	And I'm like
1059000	1061000	Does anybody want anything while I'm gone?
1061000	1063000	And someone's like
1063000	1065000	The eyes kind of looked and went
1065000	1066000	Huh?
1066000	1067000	Someone's getting something?
1067000	1068000	I'm like
1068000	1069000	Does anyone want coffee?
1069000	1071000	And everybody went
1071000	1072000	Me?
1072000	1074000	I think one thing we've kind of discovered
1074000	1075000	Through this whole process
1075000	1076000	Is that
1076000	1078000	People are really not used to
1078000	1080000	Other people just wanting to do nice things for them
1080000	1082000	Everyone was so shocked
1082000	1083000	That I offered to get
1083000	1084000	Someone actually brought up their money
1084000	1085000	I'm like
1085000	1086000	No no it's on me
1086000	1087000	And they're like all
1087000	1088000	They looked at me with like the weirdest look
1088000	1090000	Like I was giving them a razor
1090000	1093000	It was so
1093000	1094000	Yeah that kind of razor
1094000	1096000	Like killing killing yourself razor
1096000	1097000	Not the phone
1097000	1098000	But it's
1098000	1099000	So
1099000	1100000	Yeah
1100000	1101000	By the time we got back
1101000	1102000	And we waited for
1102000	1103000	Until like
1103000	1104000	Like 3.30
1104000	1105000	I said
1105000	1106000	Alright I'm gonna go get coffee
1106000	1108000	And I counted how many people were in line
1108000	1109000	And it was like
1109000	1110000	Something like
1110000	1111000	Just under 30
1111000	1112000	But to be safe I said 35
1112000	1114000	So I went to the shell station
1114000	1115000	Down the street
1115000	1116000	And said
1116000	1118000	I need 35 cups of coffee
1118000	1119000	And they
1119000	1120000	They gave me
1120000	1121000	They gave me free
1121000	1122000	A powdered creamer
1122000	1123000	And free sugar
1123000	1124000	You know the stuff that they have
1124000	1125000	For that store only
1125000	1126000	For the shell station
1126000	1127000	Cause like if you buy
1127000	1128000	35 cups of coffee
1128000	1129000	You get this free
1129000	1130000	I'm like
1130000	1131000	Okay
1131000	1132000	So
1132000	1133000	I got some other creamer
1133000	1134000	And I came back
1134000	1135000	And everyone was like
1135000	1136000	Oh coffee
1136000	1138000	They were really really really happy
1138000	1139000	I'm like courtesy
1139000	1140000	Of Orange Land Jameo
1140000	1143000	Yeah nice pimping for the show by the way
1143000	1144000	Props to Chris
1144000	1145000	I mean she
1145000	1146000	She did this for no reason
1146000	1148000	Other than she just thought it would be fun
1148000	1149000	To just buy people coffee
1149000	1151000	That's actually the reason why I was in line
1151000	1153000	Is I was looking forward to the fact
1153000	1154000	Actually I was really tired
1154000	1155000	I was more tired than Jamie
1155000	1156000	I'm like
1156000	1157000	Do I really want to wait outside
1157000	1158000	But then I offered to get coffee
1158000	1160000	And it's just the light in people's eyes
1160000	1161000	Went
1161000	1162000	And so I said
1162000	1163000	Okay I get coffee
1163000	1164000	But it didn't end there
1164000	1165000	Because you got doughnuts too
1165000	1166000	How did you
1166000	1167000	I got crispy
1167000	1168000	I got
1168000	1169000	I got six
1169000	1170000	Well what happened was
1170000	1171000	I had bought too much coffee
1171000	1172000	And right
1172000	1173000	There's
1173000	1174000	Where the Target is
1174000	1175000	There's a Best Buy
1175000	1176000	Just like
1176000	1177000	In the same parking structure
1177000	1178000	So I'm like
1178000	1179000	Well I've got too much coffee
1179000	1180000	So I'm gonna go see if they want some coffee
1180000	1181000	And sure enough
1181000	1182000	The
1182000	1183000	Oh my gosh
1183000	1184000	That line
1184000	1185000	Yeah when we went to Best Buy
1185000	1186000	With the cookies
1186000	1187000	They were running from the back
1187000	1188000	To the front
1188000	1189000	I'm like
1189000	1190000	Dude we're gonna come up the line
1190000	1191000	They were cool
1191000	1192000	I like the Best Buy line too
1192000	1193000	They had a big sign that said
1193000	1194000	We spawn's here
1194000	1195000	And I asked the guy
1195000	1196000	I'm like
1196000	1197000	What the hell does that mean
1197000	1198000	And they're like
1198000	1199000	Get it
1199000	1200000	Because it's gonna spawn here
1200000	1201000	In a couple hours
1201000	1202000	I'm like
1202000	1203000	Oh my god
1203000	1204000	Meanwhile
1204000	1205000	And I thought
1205000	1206000	I was a nerd for doing a radio program
1206000	1207000	On the internet
1207000	1208000	Meanwhile while Chris is running around
1208000	1209000	In my car
1209000	1210000	Which I'm like
1210000	1211000	My baby
1211000	1212000	Your baby's fine
1212000	1213000	Some kid asked to borrow my DS
1213000	1214000	And then I pulled up my micro
1214000	1215000	To play
1215000	1216000	Oh can I play your micro
1216000	1217000	What's this
1217000	1218000	So I had to explain the micro
1218000	1219000	This is a dead system basically
1219000	1220000	Here
1220000	1221000	And play
1221000	1222000	I have Puzzle Fighter
1222000	1223000	What else do you have
1223000	1224000	Uh
1224000	1226000	I have Kingdom Hearts
1226000	1227000	I wanna play Puzzle Fighter
1227000	1231000	What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts
1231000	1232000	Anyway
1232000	1233000	So uh
1233000	1234000	Yeah
1234000	1235000	So I got too much coffee
1235000	1236000	I went over to the Best Buy line
1236000	1237000	And they swarmed me
1237000	1238000	I'm like
1238000	1239000	I'm coming back
1239000	1240000	I had to make
1240000	1241000	I think five trips
1241000	1242000	To Shell Station
1242000	1243000	Oh my god
1243000	1244000	To get that much cups of coffee
1244000	1245000	And then I'm like
1245000	1246000	Does it
1246000	1247000	And then I called out
1247000	1248000	Does anyone want donuts
1248000	1249000	Everyone perked up
1249000	1250000	Donuts
1250000	1251000	There was a security guard at Best Buy
1251000	1252000	And he was like
1252000	1254000	Oh can you get me the cream filled one
1254000	1259000	The security guard was so cute
1259000	1260000	He looked so tired
1260000	1261000	And he's like
1261000	1262000	Oh he's like
1262000	1263000	Can you get me a coffee
1263000	1264000	I'm like
1264000	1265000	Yeah I'm coming back with more
1265000	1266000	And um
1266000	1267000	People just liked it
1267000	1271000	I bought six dozen donuts
1271000	1274000	And six dozen plus one for the guard
1274000	1275000	I got the little
1275000	1276000	I made sure I got him the cream
1276000	1277000	That is so cute
1277000	1279000	And all the time I said
1279000	1281000	Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio
1281000	1284000	You gave mad pimpage to our show Chris
1284000	1285000	And for that we love you
1285000	1287000	But you weren't doing it just
1287000	1288000	I mean
1288000	1289000	The promo for the show was just a bonus right
1289000	1290000	Yeah well I was
1290000	1293000	You know I'm not really on this show that often
1293000	1296000	But I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge
1296000	1297000	Because I was hanging out with Jamie
1297000	1299000	And I really wanted to you know
1299000	1301000	It's like you guys have been sweet to me
1301000	1302000	So I figured hey you know
1302000	1304000	It's like I'm doing something nice
1304000	1305000	I'm here representing your show
1305000	1307000	So here by from here on out folks
1307000	1310000	We're gonna refer to Chris as Saint Chris
1310000	1311000	Because she
1311000	1314000	No she did this out of the goodness of our she
1314000	1316000	She went and got donuts and coffee
1316000	1317000	For two lines
1317000	1319000	Of people waiting for the wee
1319000	1321000	So a little gesture goes a long way
1321000	1322000	So good for you Chris
1322000	1323000	We love you
1323000	1325000	They look so cool
1325000	1326000	But they looked at me crazy
1326000	1327000	Some guy went up to me and goes
1327000	1328000	Why are you doing this
1328000	1330000	And this is like
1330000	1332000	Well you guys look cold
1332000	1333000	The goodness of my heart
1333000	1336000	Doesn't factor in at all
1336000	1337000	But you know
1337000	1339000	Guys there's a couple old people
1339000	1340000	In the Best Buy line
1340000	1342000	And they were so grateful for that coffee
1342000	1343000	It made my day
1343000	1345000	Dude one guy in the Great Land line
1345000	1346000	Had a beer
1346000	1347000	I saw that
1347000	1348000	Somebody offered it back
1348000	1349000	There was a guy there who said
1349000	1351000	Hey he's really cool
1351000	1352000	You know we were talking about like
1352000	1354000	ThinkGeek and different t-shirts
1354000	1355000	And you know
1355000	1357000	The joys of Firefox
1357000	1359000	And he's like
1359000	1361000	I got some beer if you want some
1361000	1363000	And I was like
1363000	1364000	What kind?
1364000	1365000	Bass
1365000	1368000	Oooh
1368000	1371000	Because for anyone who doesn't know
1371000	1372000	I love beer a lot
1372000	1374000	And I'm trying to cut down on my beer
1374000	1375000	Consumption
1375000	1377000	So I was sorely tempted
1377000	1378000	I was like
1378000	1379000	Bass
1379000	1380000	I love you
1380000	1381000	Give me beer
1381000	1382000	Oh wait no
1382000	1384000	Because the whole problem with that is
1384000	1386000	The guys are going around the corner to pee
1386000	1388000	I don't have the equipment
1388000	1390000	To go around the corner and pee
1390000	1391000	Well you could
1391000	1392000	No
1392000	1394000	But it's just not a cemetery
1394000	1395000	No
1395000	1397000	Okay I'm in an awkward position on the floor
1397000	1399000	Right next to Rob's legs
1399000	1401000	But somebody in the chatroom asked me
1401000	1402000	How much money I spent
1402000	1403000	I can't tell who that is
1403000	1404000	I
1404000	1406000	Footy something?
1406000	1407000	Oh footy monster probably
1407000	1408000	Footy monster
1408000	1409000	They asked me how much money I spent
1409000	1410000	Enough
1410000	1411000	Enough
1411000	1413000	It was my money though
1413000	1415000	So Orange Lounge will continue to
1415000	1417000	Spend all of the money that they get
1417000	1418000	On our crackin' booths
1418000	1419000	On your crackin' booths
1419000	1421000	I would also like to add something
1421000	1422000	That's kind of funny
1422000	1424000	According to nextgenwars.com
1424000	1425000	Uh
1425000	1429000	It looks like Wii is beating up PlayStation 3
1429000	1431000	Well they have more units at launch
1431000	1432000	I mean that's kind of
1432000	1433000	I mean to be fair
1433000	1434000	Well they
1434000	1435000	I mean they've basically got a greater market share
1435000	1436000	Well we'll see
1436000	1437000	We'll see
1437000	1438000	I mean we'll see
1438000	1439000	It's still a long ways to go
1439000	1440000	It's still a long ways to go
1440000	1441000	I mean I'm not
1441000	1442000	I'm just trying to be fair
1442000	1443000	Extifer I brought you in for a minute
1443000	1444000	My roommate Extifer
1444000	1445000	Who's co-host on the Wednesday show
1445000	1447000	Who's a little sick from camping out
1447000	1448000	All this morning
1448000	1449000	Yeah
1449000	1450000	Now you went and met
1450000	1451000	Jamie
1451000	1452000	And Chris at one point
1452000	1453000	I slept in his car
1453000	1454000	I did
1454000	1455000	I was hopped up on AMD
1455000	1456000	That's fine
1456000	1457000	At the time
1457000	1458000	No
1458000	1459000	Extifer was really cool
1459000	1460000	Because I had pretty much
1460000	1461000	Roto
1461000	1462000	I didn't feel like camping out
1462000	1463000	And I was like
1463000	1464000	You know
1464000	1465000	I like my warm bed
1465000	1466000	I'll just pick up a Wii
1466000	1467000	At the second shipment
1467000	1468000	They're gonna keep coming
1468000	1469000	I'm cool
1469000	1470000	But Extifer was like
1470000	1471000	I'll get him out
1471000	1472000	If you want one
1472000	1473000	I'm like
1473000	1474000	Okay
1474000	1475000	Here's money
1475000	1476000	Have fun
1476000	1477000	So you did it
1477000	1478000	I love spending money
1478000	1479000	When it's somebody else's
1479000	1480000	I do
1480000	1481000	I found that
1481000	1482000	Spending money
1482000	1484000	When it's not your own
1484000	1485000	Is very
1485000	1487000	It's a very nice thing
1487000	1488000	Now
1488000	1489000	Before I forget
1489000	1490000	By the way
1490000	1491000	Bandit sent me the link
1491000	1492000	Okay
1492000	1493000	I gotta start wrapping this up
1493000	1494000	So we can keep getting into game news
1494000	1495000	But
1495000	1496000	I've heard on other podcasts
1496000	1497000	I wanna say it was
1497000	1498000	It was one of the other all game shows
1498000	1499000	I wanna say it was
1499000	1500000	Alon from Chatterbox
1500000	1502000	I apologize if I'm misappropriating this
1502000	1503000	But
1503000	1505000	He had a horrible target experience
1505000	1506000	With the Xbox 360
1506000	1507000	Like
1507000	1508000	They gave out tickets
1508000	1509000	And didn't even honor him
1509000	1510000	And all this junk
1510000	1511000	So
1511000	1512000	I have to admit
1512000	1513000	You hearing these stories on the internet
1513000	1514000	About stores that had failed launches previously
1514000	1515000	Made me a little bit nervous
1515000	1516000	But
1516000	1517000	You came back
1517000	1518000	You walked through the door
1518000	1519000	And you were like
1519000	1520000	I love Target
1520000	1521000	I love Target
1521000	1522000	What made it so great
1522000	1523000	What happened
1523000	1524000	How did it go down
1524000	1525000	First of all
1525000	1527000	The store manager himself
1527000	1528000	Was outside
1528000	1529000	And letting everybody know
1529000	1530000	Exactly what's gonna happen
1530000	1531000	Before the store opened
1531000	1532000	And
1532000	1534000	Excuse me I have to burp
1534000	1537000	And
1537000	1538000	This is great right here
1538000	1539000	And so
1539000	1542000	Sorry I just took some Airborne
1542000	1543000	Man you can't blame me
1543000	1545000	No I
1545000	1546000	I went and
1546000	1548000	So basically the store manager
1548000	1549000	You know
1549000	1550000	Explained everything
1550000	1551000	And then he
1551000	1552000	Then
1552000	1553000	We
1553000	1554000	You know
1554000	1555000	Were in line
1555000	1556000	They handed out things
1556000	1557000	For us to fill out
1557000	1559000	As to which games we wanted to get
1559000	1560000	And then
1560000	1561000	They kind of
1561000	1562000	Escorted us into the
1562000	1563000	Into the store
1563000	1565000	Where we handed them the flyer
1565000	1566000	That we filled out
1566000	1568000	And then they got everything for us
1568000	1569000	And then sent us to a register
1569000	1572000	It was very very very very
1572000	1573000	Organized
1573000	1574000	Well organized
1574000	1576000	No glitches
1576000	1577000	Nobody you know upset
1577000	1579000	Everybody knew they were gonna get one
1579000	1580000	That was gonna get one

1585000	1586000	Yes it was
1586000	1587000	And I even told the lady
1587000	1588000	That walked me over to the register
1588000	1589000	That I was very

1590000	1591000	That

1593000	1594000	Um
1594000	1595000	And uh
1595000	1596000	And so that's the end
1596000	1597000	Bye
1597000	1598000	Alright well thank you
1598000	1599000	Extover for sharing that
1599000	1601000	I just got linked to the best site ever
1601000	1602000	Did you
1602000	1603000	Did you also
1603000	1604000	Your website the weeks later in the show
1604000	1605000	Did you
1605000	1606000	No this is
1606000	1607000	I might make this next weeks
1607000	1608000	Alright did
1608000	1610000	Did you find the process to be just as great
1610000	1611000	Oh yeah
1611000	1612000	Very smooth
1612000	1613000	But I laughed at the stupid woman
1613000	1614000	Oh my gosh
1614000	1615000	So
1615000	1616000	Uh
1616000	1617000	Somebody
1617000	1618000	The prissiest looking woman
1618000	1619000	There were like
1619000	1620000	Actually walks up from her SUV
1620000	1622000	Here you go
1622000	1623000	Okay
1623000	1625000	And she's all in her skirt and her high heels
1625000	1627000	Looking all prissy prissy prissy
1627000	1628000	And she walks to the end of the line
1628000	1629000	And she walks with an attitude
1629000	1630000	Like I didn't have to wait
1630000	1631000	I didn't have to wait
1631000	1632000	I didn't have to wait
1632000	1633000	And walk all the way back there
1633000	1634000	And she went back and they basically said
1634000	1636000	Oh we're the last ones to get it
1636000	1638000	And she walks back looking so pissed off
1638000	1639000	I was like
1639000	1640000	Ha ha
1640000	1642000	There were like a few people who showed up
1642000	1644000	Thinking they can just jump in the line
1644000	1646000	And the guy said I'm sorry
1646000	1647000	We don't have anymore
1647000	1648000	We're the only people
1648000	1649000	You know that was probably gonna be me
1649000	1651000	If extra had been so volunteer
1651000	1652000	But I would have been okay
1652000	1653000	I wouldn't have left away in a huff
1653000	1654000	I would have understood
1654000	1655000	You know
1655000	1656000	I would have been okay
1656000	1657000	I'm going to Kmart
1657000	1658000	Cause no one shops at Kmart
1658000	1659000	But anyway
1659000	1660000	We gotta keep moving
1660000	1661000	Cause we wanna get in the show
1661000	1663000	But we wanna give a great big round of applause
1663000	1666000	To the line at Target Greatland and Citrus Heights
1666000	1667000	And the great staff there
1667000	1668000	For making the relaunch good
1668000	1669000	Yay
1669000	1671000	And I also wanna give a round of applause
1671000	1673000	To the guy at the front of the line
1673000	1675000	At Walmart in Rancho Cordova
1675000	1676000	The grandpa
1676000	1678000	Who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday
1678000	1681000	Waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid
1681000	1682000	Not to sell it on eBay
1682000	1685000	But he looked like the nicest guy in the world
1685000	1686000	So I wanna give him a round of applause too
1686000	1688000	Cause I liked him a lot
1688000	1690000	And I liked all the gamers we met
1690000	1691000	He didn't take your cookie though
1691000	1692000	No he didn't take the cookie
1692000	1693000	But that's okay
1693000	1694000	I understand
1694000	1697000	And I'm not gonna force people to take the cookies
1697000	1698000	Alright so anyway
1698000	1700000	Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chatroom
1700000	1701000	Why are they even
1701000	1702000	That was Shadow Charlie
1702000	1704000	But why are they even talking about Paris Hilton
1704000	1705000	Oh cause
1705000	1707000	Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one
1707000	1710000	Well we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems
1710000	1712000	Use their celebrity to get systems
1712000	1713000	We'll talk about that later
1713000	1715000	Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free okay
1715000	1716000	Alright
1716000	1718000	Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii
1718000	1720000	Fireboma says Paris Hilton
1720000	1723000	Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature
1723000	1724000	Of the Wiimote easily
1727000	1728000	Anyway
1728000	1730000	Let's get into another favorite segment
1730000	1731000	We like to do here on Orange Land Australia
1731000	1733000	This is usually how we kick off the show
1733000	1735000	And we don't have launch party stories to tell
1735000	1736000	Oh I forgot to add
1736000	1737000	Oh I'm so sorry
1737000	1738000	I didn't even ask
1738000	1741000	You guys all camped in the line for the Wii
1741000	1742000	What did you get?
1742000	1743000	What games did you end up getting?
1743000	1744000	Dark Soccer
1744000	1745000	I got
1745000	1748000	Well I actually got another Wiimote
1748000	1751000	And then I got Zelda Excite Truck
1751000	1754000	And Trauma Center
1754000	1755000	Which
1755000	1758000	Those are the exact same three games I got by the way
1758000	1762000	That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck and Zelda
1762000	1763000	Loki?
1763000	1765000	I feel so bad but
1765000	1769000	I got Zelda Excite Truck
1769000	1772000	Rayman's Raving Rabbids
1772000	1775000	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Red Steel
1775000	1778000	And Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam
1778000	1779000	I think that was it
1779000	1780000	Did you get Spongebob?
1780000	1782000	I did not get Spongebob
1782000	1785000	I will talk about it in a little bit but
1785000	1788000	Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used
1788000	1790000	Pretty quick at a GameStop
1790000	1792000	Ouch ouch
1792000	1794000	Not sounding like some good reviews there
1794000	1799000	I want to say this comment from chat though real quick about the Wii lines
1799000	1803000	Rama said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems not sell them
1803000	1805000	Another very interesting observation
1805000	1808000	I have noted this observation was made on blogs where you know
1808000	1812000	Most of the people on the Playstation 3 lines were eBay profiteers
1812000	1815000	Most of the people on the Wii lines actually plan on playing them
1815000	1818000	I asked you know and I didn't expect people to be honest with me but I asked straight up
1818000	1820000	I said who is selling the Wii on eBay
1820000	1824000	And only one person kind of fessed up so that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay
1824000	1826000	Like their friend ratted them out
1826000	1827000	That was it
1827000	1829000	One guy at Best Buy
1829000	1834000	Fessed up and said yeah I bought two Playstation 3's and I sold them both on eBay for a profit
1834000	1838000	And I am using that money to buy the Wii and I am like what are you selling the Wii too?
1838000	1839000	Give me back the cookie
1839000	1840000	And he is like
1840000	1842000	He said no I actually want to play the Wii
1842000	1844000	This is very interesting
1844000	1847000	Just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people have
1847000	1851000	Pooeater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports
1851000	1857000	My girlfriend Migzy she has been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop
1857000	1859000	And she says it has actually gotten kind of boring
1859000	1860000	Really?
1860000	1863000	I mean it is good for like to learn how things go I guess
1863000	1866000	But it is not really a you know
1866000	1869000	I got to agree Wii Sports is pretty much a
1869000	1871000	Look it is a glorified tech demo
1871000	1875000	But I could see that as a good multiplayer game especially with like Wii Bowling
1875000	1881000	It strikes me as a good party game and a good thing to like just show somebody the Wii to get into
1881000	1885000	You know what I mean like if I wanted to take it over and show my sister who maybe does not play video games
1885000	1888000	Say hey you want to check out what I just got fire it up here you go
1888000	1890000	Pass it off to Drew Nami for a minute because I want to ask
1890000	1893000	You just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room
1893000	1896000	And you played Wii Sports what was your impressions?
1896000	1898000	Just pick it up and go
1898000	1900000	There is nothing to it at all
1900000	1905000	It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing but everything else was easy
1905000	1907000	Alright
1907000	1909000	We have been putting off long enough
1909000	1911000	We are already like more than 20 minutes into the show
1911000	1913000	Let us talk about how is your gaming week
1913000	1916000	And since there is a lot of us we want to kind of keep it a little bit brief
1916000	1918000	But I know some people like Loki got like 7 games
1918000	1921000	So Dark Sakura how is your gaming week?
1921000	1924000	Well actually I did not play the Wii yet
1924000	1927000	Because I was so tired that we went right to bed pretty much
1927000	1929000	But I have been playing Cooking Mama
1929000	1931000	Which I found a used one
1931000	1933000	I was so happy
1933000	1937000	And every time I tried to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted
1937000	1939000	So I have not actually gotten started yet
1939000	1941000	I played some Mario
1941000	1943000	But mostly I was playing Cooking Mama
1943000	1946000	And I have my Elite Beat Agents today
1946000	1948000	Thank you
1948000	1950000	Alright that is it
1950000	1951000	Very cool
1951000	1952000	Have fun with it
1952000	1954000	Play lots of the Wii for next week
1954000	1955000	And pinball
1955000	1957000	Like real pinball not virtual console pinball
1957000	1959000	I had a pinball party last night so I have actually
1959000	1961000	Well of course we were not there
1961000	1963000	But I was playing some of the machines
1963000	1966000	While Sauce was here last week too
1966000	1969000	Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about
1969000	1971000	Before we got into how is your gaming week
1971000	1972000	But I got to read these
1972000	1973000	Robway in our chatroom says
1973000	1975000	I think less people want to resell the Wii
1975000	1979000	Because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling
1979000	1981000	Plus I am not buying from the eBay scum
1981000	1983000	Megzi says
1983000	1985000	Megzi said I showed the parentals Wii Sports
1985000	1987000	They were like speechless in awe
1987000	1988000	Megzi!
1988000	1989000	Kind of interesting
1989000	1991000	Loki how was your gaming week?
1991000	1993000	My gaming week was great
1993000	1995000	Especially with the Wii on Thursday
1995000	1997000	We started off with Wii Sports
1997000	1999000	And that was actually pretty fun
1999000	2001000	The Wii Tennis was really cool
2001000	2004000	I mean everyone really had fun with it
2004000	2006000	Then tried a little bit of Wii Boxing
2006000	2008000	Which is a little weird
2008000	2010000	Because I did not really read the manual on how to play it
2010000	2013000	So could not quite get it to work correctly
2013000	2014000	But it was still fun
2014000	2017000	Wii Golf was kind of okay I guess
2017000	2021000	And then Wii Bowling did not really try that too much
2021000	2023000	And then the baseball I think is way too damn hard
2023000	2026000	At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous
2026000	2030000	Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend
2030000	2032000	Been playing lots of that
2032000	2033000	That game is really fun
2033000	2035000	That is the best way to describe it
2035000	2039000	Although the music is so goddamn horrible
2039000	2043000	You really need the SD memory card
2043000	2045000	And just load your own MP3's
2045000	2047000	I tell you once you do that
2047000	2050000	It makes the game completely better
2050000	2053000	It is a really fun game
2053000	2055000	Then moving on
2055000	2057000	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz
2057000	2059000	If you played Monkey Ball before
2059000	2060000	And you were used to it
2060000	2062000	Then you probably liked this game
2062000	2065000	I thought that the original Monkey Ball was too hard
2065000	2071000	Or at least it was too frustrating for me to put more attention towards it
2071000	2073000	So I got really sick of the game really quick
2073000	2077000	And this is after level 7
2077000	2079000	And it was pretty damn hard
2079000	2081000	And I was just like fuck this
2081000	2082000	I do not want to play this
2082000	2084000	And the minigames to be honest
2084000	2086000	I did not like them
2086000	2087000	I did not like them too much
2087000	2090000	So it is not something I would play by myself
2090000	2092000	Maybe a good party game
2092000	2095000	But money is better spent elsewhere
2095000	2098000	And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits
2098000	2101000	Because if you are really interested in a minigame type of game
2101000	2102000	That is the one for you
2102000	2104000	Because it is just insane
2104000	2107000	I mean the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim
2107000	2109000	Just how off the wall weird they are
2109000	2111000	My favorite was the eating one
2111000	2112000	That you trace the food
2112000	2115000	And like one of the foods was a baseball
2115000	2116000	The guy would eat
2116000	2118000	I was like what the hell he is eating a baseball
2118000	2120000	It is excellent
2120000	2123000	So definitely you are going to need to check that out
2123000	2124000	Zelda is pretty awesome
2124000	2126000	But I mean what do you expect from a Zelda
2126000	2128000	It is just pretty neat
2128000	2130000	So Zelda yay
2130000	2133000	And then of course
2133000	2135000	Tony Hawk's Downhole Jam
2135000	2138000	I bought this thinking it is going to be like SSX
2138000	2140000	Because I love SSX
2140000	2141000	It is not SSX
2141000	2143000	It is not even close to being SSX
2143000	2146000	And I got really frustrated this right away
2146000	2148000	Because to be honest
2148000	2149000	I do not know if it was my TV
2149000	2151000	But the cables I had the detail on it
2151000	2153000	I had trouble seeing some of the tracks
2153000	2156000	And I just
2156000	2158000	I want a game that I can get into and have fun with
2158000	2160000	And Excite Truck was that
2160000	2161000	Tony Hawk was not
2161000	2163000	So I would not recommend it
2163000	2165000	I mean unless you are a really big Tony Hawk fan
2165000	2167000	I really would not recommend it
2167000	2170000	So yeah
2170000	2171000	And then of course finally
2171000	2172000	Virtual Console Games
2172000	2174000	I tried Mario 64
2174000	2176000	Which is ok with the classic controller
2176000	2180000	I wonder how well it will look with the component cables
2180000	2182000	But it looks just like it did before
2182000	2183000	And then Zelda
2183000	2185000	Seemed a bit dark to me
2185000	2188000	But I guess that was because it was from the collection disc
2188000	2190000	Or something that came out of the GameCube
2190000	2191000	Not too long ago
2191000	2193000	Now it makes sense
2193000	2195000	Because hey it is already imported right
2195000	2196000	Exactly
2196000	2198000	I wish it was brighter though
2198000	2200000	Because like all those games we saw at E3
2200000	2201000	Were very vivid and bright
2201000	2203000	And that is what I kind of liked about them
2203000	2204000	And now
2204000	2206000	I mean I think it is all about the cables though
2206000	2207000	Right now
2207000	2208000	So
2208000	2209000	That was pretty much it
2209000	2211000	Yeah of course you know the usual suspects
2211000	2212000	Call of Duty 3
2212000	2213000	On the 360
2213000	2214000	And
2214000	2217000	Gears of War a little bit
2217000	2218000	And other scrolls
2218000	2219000	Finally finished it
2219000	2220000	SSJ100Matt wants to know
2220000	2222000	What does Nellie, Loki's wife
2222000	2224000	Have to say about Loki playing all those games this week
2224000	2225000	Now here is the funny thing
2225000	2227000	About that actually
2227000	2229000	Nellie originally
2229000	2232000	If you have her as a friend on LiveJournal
2232000	2234000	You would have seen that she wrote
2234000	2236000	Some pretty negative reviews on the Wii
2236000	2238000	Saying if I really wanted to exercise
2238000	2240000	I would go to the gym
2240000	2241000	I won't play the Wii
2241000	2243000	Ironically enough though
2243000	2245000	Once she picked up Excite Truck
2245000	2246000	She has been playing it
2246000	2248000	She played it for five hours yesterday
2248000	2250000	And a couple hours today
2250000	2251000	So
2251000	2253000	And she has actually finished
2253000	2255000	All the four different cups in it
2255000	2257000	All the way up through the platinum cup
2257000	2258000	She is all finished with it
2258000	2260000	Now she is going back to get S-Rank games
2260000	2261000	On all the other tracks
2261000	2263000	I haven't even played it that much
2263000	2264000	So that is how much she is like this
2264000	2265000	And she loves the game
2265000	2266000	She says it is like
2266000	2269000	It is basically like
2269000	2270000	Women driver the game
2270000	2272000	Because it allows you to crash through trees
2272000	2274000	And just drive aimlessly
2274000	2275000	And you get points
2275000	2276000	You get rewarded
2276000	2278000	Yeah you get rewarded for driving recklessly
2278000	2280000	So she loves the game
2280000	2282000	Sail at Mervyn's
2282000	2284000	But you know what
2284000	2285000	You know what I like though
2285000	2286000	Playing on there
2286000	2287000	Is the Mii Channel
2287000	2288000	And I like creating stupid Miis
2288000	2289000	That I sent to Rob
2289000	2290000	Which is great
2290000	2291000	Oh gosh
2291000	2292000	I went into my Mii Channel
2292000	2293000	And suddenly like
2293000	2294000	Eight new Miis
2294000	2295000	All dropped in my little thing
2295000	2296000	Loki sent you this
2296000	2297000	Loki sent you this
2297000	2298000	And he sent him and Nellie
2298000	2299000	And then he sent like
2299000	2300000	Damian
2300000	2302000	Who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side
2302000	2303000	Or what you did
2303000	2304000	To get those horns
2304000	2305000	I don't know what you did
2305000	2306000	And then he just
2306000	2308000	He sent me a guy with a giant afro
2308000	2309000	And called it Afro
2309000	2311000	It is from DDR
2311000	2312000	I get it
2312000	2313000	I get it
2313000	2314000	Alright
2314000	2315000	Alright
2315000	2316000	Let's talk to our guests
2316000	2317000	Oh I got to say
2317000	2318000	My gaming week
2318000	2319000	I'll make it quick
2319000	2320000	Phantasy Star Universe
2320000	2321000	Before the
2321000	2322000	You know
2322000	2323000	Mass hysteria of the Wii launch
2323000	2324000	I played a lot of Phantasy Star Universe
2324000	2325000	Online mode
2325000	2326000	Because they opened up some new areas
2326000	2327000	In online
2327000	2329000	Motube is a new planet you can go to
2329000	2331000	And some new missions are available as well
2331000	2333000	I got my butt handed to me
2333000	2334000	In Motube though
2334000	2335000	Because the missions
2335000	2336000	Even though they're level 15
2336000	2337000	They're a little bit harder
2337000	2338000	Than the ones on New Days
2338000	2339000	So
2339000	2340000	It's good though
2340000	2341000	I'm glad they're keeping it fresh
2341000	2342000	With new content
2342000	2343000	Let's hope
2343000	2345000	Sega gets it right this time
2345000	2347000	And consistently gives us the new stuff
2347000	2348000	I'll be a very happy camper if so
2348000	2350000	When it came to the Wii
2350000	2351000	I would say
2351000	2352000	Trauma Center
2352000	2354000	Is a very overlooked launch title
2354000	2356000	I didn't play the one on the DS
2356000	2358000	I just heard a lot of people rave about it
2358000	2359000	And you know
2359000	2361000	I hate those Discovery Channel shows
2361000	2362000	That are all about surgery
2362000	2363000	Because I get like
2363000	2364000	I'm a big wimp
2364000	2365000	When it comes to blood
2365000	2366000	And things like that
2366000	2367000	But I love Trauma Center
2367000	2368000	It's so fun
2368000	2369000	And it's
2369000	2371000	When I get mad at the patients
2371000	2372000	I stab them with my scalpel
2372000	2373000	And just kill them
2373000	2376000	I have a review from Meg Z
2376000	2377000	She said
2377000	2378000	The Trauma Center for the DS
2378000	2380000	Makes you want to hit yourself with a brick
2380000	2381000	It's hard
2381000	2382000	It's a really hard game
2382000	2383000	And you have to like remember
2383000	2385000	It's almost like Simon says
2385000	2387000	I don't know if like Simon says
2387000	2388000	But you have to remember like
2388000	2389000	Okay
2389000	2390000	First I got to drain it
2390000	2391000	Then I got to scalp it
2391000	2393000	Then I got to take it out with a thing
2393000	2394000	Then I got an antibiotic
2394000	2395000	And you have to remember
2395000	2396000	Like what order you have to do everything in
2396000	2397000	It's crazy
2397000	2398000	But it's fun
2398000	2399000	And DMN
2399000	2400000	You watched me play it
2400000	2401000	And I was like
2401000	2402000	Stressing out
2402000	2403000	I was like
2403000	2404000	That was hilarious
2404000	2405000	That was cool
2405000	2406000	I had a good time
2406000	2407000	But yeah
2407000	2408000	It's kind of an overlooked launch title
2408000	2409000	But I think it's kind of fun
2409000	2410000	$50?
2410000	2411000	I don't know
2411000	2412000	I'm still not loving these high prices for games
2412000	2413000	But
2413000	2414000	Whatever
2414000	2415000	It's
2415000	2416000	You know I guess I could always trade it back
2416000	2417000	Or whatever
2417000	2418000	You know
2418000	2419000	Rampage is $29.99
2419000	2420000	But it's Rampage
2420000	2422000	How many times have I played Rampage
2422000	2423000	In whatever
2423000	2424000	Incorations
2424000	2425000	I have no interest in it
2425000	2426000	I'm sorry Midway
2426000	2427000	But I'm just
2427000	2428000	You know
2428000	2429000	Get a new franchise
2429000	2430000	I will pick a Mortal Kombat though
2430000	2431000	So
2431000	2432000	I'm totally being a hypocrite
2432000	2433000	Because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat
2433000	2434000	When it comes out of the way
2434000	2435000	DMN
2435000	2436000	How was your gaming week?
2436000	2437000	Well I
2437000	2438000	Played a bunch of games at work
2438000	2439000	That I can't talk about
2439000	2440000	But
2440000	2441000	Let's see
2441000	2442000	At home
2442000	2444000	I actually busted out the Super Nintendo
2444000	2446000	Played some Tecmo Super Bowl
2446000	2447000	Wario's Woods
2447000	2449000	Actually when I got here
2449000	2451000	I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP
2451000	2453000	I played a lot of Luminous 2
2453000	2454000	Played a lot of Burnout Revenge
2454000	2456000	On his 360
2456000	2458000	And this is actually the first time
2458000	2460000	I've actually gotten to play the Wii
2460000	2461000	And play it on my own terms
2461000	2462000	Rather than
2462000	2463000	You're playing this for 8 hours
2463000	2464000	Have fun
2464000	2465000	But
2465000	2468000	I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun
2468000	2469000	With the system
2469000	2471000	Trauma Center is just funny
2471000	2472000	Again
2472000	2473000	The stabbing people
2473000	2475000	Excite Truck is pretty fun
2475000	2477000	I actually did not like
2477000	2478000	Raving Rabbids
2478000	2480000	I just thought it was stupid
2480000	2481000	But
2481000	2482000	Yeah
2482000	2483000	That's about it
2483000	2484000	I'm boring like that
2484000	2485000	Oh wait wait wait wait
2485000	2487000	Elite Beat Agents
2487000	2488000	Yeah
2488000	2489000	I played a lot of that
2489000	2490000	Alright
2490000	2491000	Right on
2491000	2492000	Chris
2492000	2493000	I know you don't usually play
2493000	2494000	A whole lot of games
2494000	2496000	But did you try out anything this week
2496000	2497000	That you liked?
2497000	2498000	Well
2498000	2499000	I got Cookie Mama
2499000	2500000	So that was really good
2500000	2502000	I haven't played the Wii yet
2502000	2503000	Which I got
2503000	2504000	Which is a surprise to me now
2504000	2506000	I didn't expect to get it
2506000	2508000	I did however
2508000	2509000	I got Sims 2 Pets
2509000	2511000	Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 Pets
2511000	2513000	And you can kill animals
2513000	2515000	And turn them into ghost animals
2515000	2516000	But no
2516000	2517000	It's actually really fun
2517000	2518000	All the animals
2518000	2520000	You can't actually tell the animals
2520000	2521000	What to do
2521000	2522000	But
2522000	2523000	They have their own personalities
2523000	2524000	And they just kind of run around
2524000	2526000	You can tell them not to do something
2526000	2528000	All my cats
2528000	2529000	That I have for my Sims
2529000	2530000	They don't
2530000	2532000	They are on the furniture all the time
2532000	2533000	And I can't get them to stop
2533000	2534000	But
2534000	2536000	And I also played Pokemon Ranger
2536000	2538000	That game is weird
2538000	2539000	That's like
2539000	2541000	I'm old school Pokemon fan
2541000	2543000	Like the trainer games
2543000	2544000	Those are the only ones I like
2544000	2545000	I don't have pinball or anything like that
2545000	2547000	And I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that
2547000	2548000	It's not
2548000	2549000	It's kind of weird
2549000	2550000	It's like
2550000	2552000	You have to make the Pokemon think you're a friend
2552000	2554000	So you draw a circle around it
2554000	2555000	With your stylus
2555000	2556000	Many many times
2556000	2558000	But it will get pissed off
2558000	2560000	And hurt your stylus circle
2560000	2561000	And then you have to try again
2561000	2562000	And your stylus will die
2562000	2564000	And then you have to start over
2564000	2565000	But you get a friend
2565000	2567000	You get a friend that travels with you nonstop
2567000	2568000	Which is
2568000	2569000	I have no idea what that Pokemon is
2569000	2571000	It's the plus minus Pikachu thing
2571000	2572000	Oh
2572000	2573000	Plus one minus
2573000	2574000	Yeah that thing
2574000	2575000	I have plushies of those
2575000	2576000	Yeah they
2576000	2577000	That's always with you
2577000	2578000	But you can get
2578000	2579000	Like the friends that you make
2579000	2580000	Follow you around
2580000	2581000	Until you're done with them
2581000	2582000	And you can use your Pokemon
2582000	2584000	So it's even worse than training them
2584000	2585000	You use them
2585000	2586000	You use
2586000	2587000	It's like
2587000	2588000	You get that for me
2588000	2589000	And they get the hell out
2589000	2590000	But
2590000	2591000	So that's
2591000	2592000	Wow
2592000	2593000	That's a weird game
2593000	2594000	I mean if you like Pokemon anyway
2594000	2596000	I mean I guess it's a really cool game
2596000	2598000	But I like training them
2598000	2600000	I like using them for purposes of battle
2600000	2602000	I like trying to kill my Pokemon
2602000	2605000	PETA doesn't like me I don't think
2605000	2606000	So
2606000	2607000	Okay that was my gaming week
2607000	2608000	Right on
2608000	2609000	Drewnami
2609000	2611000	Drew I really really like your shirt
2611000	2612000	It says noob
2612000	2613000	Noob
2613000	2614000	It's what's for dinner
2614000	2616000	And it has a noob
2616000	2618000	It has a noob assuming the position
2618000	2619000	Cut up like the
2619000	2620000	Cuts a meat chart
2620000	2622000	Yeah that's so funny
2622000	2623000	Drewnami
2623000	2624000	Or Drewnawee
2624000	2625000	How was your gaming week?
2625000	2627000	I actually decided to kick a little bit old school
2627000	2628000	Because I didn't get
2628000	2631000	Didn't get any of the next gen stuff
2631000	2632000	So I went back to my old
2632000	2633000	MechWarrior games
2633000	2634000	Just started playing MechWarrior 3
2634000	2635000	MechWarrior 4
2635000	2636000	MechCommander 2
2636000	2637000	That kind of stuff
2637000	2640000	Didn't do much else except
2640000	2641000	Guitar Hero
2641000	2643000	And they really ramped up the difficulty
2643000	2644000	On expert mode
2644000	2646000	Which is almost impossibly hard
2646000	2648000	When you get to the stuff like Miserloo
2648000	2650000	Ugh
2650000	2652000	Other than that not much else
2652000	2653000	Alright very cool
2653000	2655000	You know what's funny is that you know
2655000	2656000	Earlier in the show I was talking about
2656000	2658000	Our history as a music gaming network
2658000	2659000	I think you're the only
2659000	2660000	Oh no
2660000	2662000	Dark Soccer played Guitar Hero 2 last week
2662000	2663000	Cause I haven't played it yet
2663000	2664000	I've played a bunch of that too
2664000	2666000	What's your favorite spot?
2666000	2667000	Pandora is hot
2667000	2669000	Pandora is fucking hot
2669000	2671000	Pandora makes me fail songs
2671000	2673000	Alright
2673000	2675000	Well that was our gaming week
2675000	2677000	And hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well
2677000	2679000	Whether you were in the Playstation 3 camp
2679000	2680000	Or the Wii camp
2680000	2682000	Or the F the next generation camp
2682000	2683000	Or maybe 360
2683000	2685000	You're just there holding out on 360
2685000	2687000	Whatever hope you had a good gaming week as well
2687000	2688000	We gotta get into some gaming news
2688000	2690000	So real quick housekeeping
2690000	2691000	Real quick
2691000	2693000	Just wanted to say
2693000	2694000	For those that have been saying
2694000	2697000	Why do you put out part B so late in the week
2697000	2700000	Why do we have to wait so long for part B
2700000	2701000	Okay
2701000	2702000	We're gonna try a new thing
2702000	2704000	And we're gonna put out part B a little bit earlier
2704000	2706000	So look for it this week

2719000	2721000	There's a spinoff show from that called Cross Platform
2721000	2724000	Where they have multiple people come together
2724000	2727000	From different podcasts and magazines and stuff
2727000	2729000	And just talk about random stuff
2729000	2730000	So the guy there, Luke

2905000	2906000	Okay
2906000	2907000	Okay
2907000	2908000	Ask an OP
2908000	2909000	If you need to know
2909000	2910000	How to private message
2910000	2911000	Somebody in chat
2911000	2912000	Um
2912000	2913000	The folks in chat
2913000	2914000	Would request that if you
2914000	2915000	Already have a Wii
2915000	2916000	You don't enter the contest
2916000	2917000	But since there's no way
2917000	2918000	For us to verify it
2918000	2919000	Maybe you know someone
2919000	2920000	In need of a Wii
2920000	2921000	So we're not gonna stop
2921000	2922000	People that already have one
2922000	2923000	From entering
2923000	2924000	But you know
2924000	2925000	You know
2925000	2926000	You win brownie points
2926000	2927000	Use your best judgement

2938000	2939000	From someone who PMs me

2947000	2948000	In chat tonight
2948000	2949000	I can't look at them right now
2949000	2950000	Cause there's too much else
2950000	2951000	Going on
2951000	2952000	I'm very sorry folks
2952000	2953000	But you have to
2953000	2954000	No love letters
2954000	2955000	General chat
2955000	2956000	Or
2956000	2957000	I don't know
2957000	2958000	See if
2958000	2959000	See if Loki or DarkSakura
2959000	2960000	Can answer
2960000	2961000	Or ask
2961000	2962000	One of your friendly OP's
2962000	2963000	Alright
2963000	2964000	So
2964000	2965000	I know we haven't given
2965000	2966000	The 360 a lot of love tonight
2966000	2967000	But Loki can you change that
2967000	2968000	For us a little bit
2968000	2969000	Of course I can
2969000	2970000	I love the 360
2970000	2971000	And I'll still be playing
2971000	2972000	Plenty
2972000	2973000	Anyways
2973000	2974000	Um
2974000	2975000	So
2975000	2976000	On the 15th
2976000	2977000	You know
2977000	2978000	There's a big anniversary
2978000	2979000	The 5th year anniversary
2979000	2980000	Of Halo
2980000	2981000	And of course
2981000	2983000	To commemorate the 5th anniversary
2983000	2984000	Of Halo
2984000	2985000	They announced some more things
2985000	2987000	About Halo 3
2987000	2989000	And some stuff for Halo 2
2989000	2990000	Um
2990000	2991000	So starting things off
2991000	2993000	Halo 3 is going to be getting a multiplayer beta
2993000	2995000	In the spring of 2007
2995000	2996000	Which uh
2996000	2997000	If I remember correctly
2997000	2998000	I think that they
2998000	2999000	That news came out a while ago
2999000	3001000	At least it was rumored to be happening
3001000	3002000	So
3002000	3003000	There will be
3003000	3004000	Some sort of demo coming out
3004000	3006000	Spring of 2007
3006000	3007000	Um
3007000	3009000	No word on
3009000	3010000	What you know
3010000	3011000	That will consist of
3011000	3013000	And whether it will be free
3013000	3014000	So
3014000	3015000	I don't know
3015000	3016000	Something coming out though
3016000	3017000	Spring 2007
3017000	3018000	So that's pretty cool
3018000	3019000	Um
3019000	3020000	Halo 2 is actually
3020000	3021000	Going to be getting some
3021000	3023000	Xbox 360 exclusive maps
3023000	3024000	Um
3024000	3025000	Brand new multiplayer maps
3025000	3027000	Also coming out in the spring
3027000	3028000	Um
3028000	3030000	Exclusively for Xbox 360 players
3030000	3031000	So
3031000	3032000	You know
3032000	3034000	Sorry if you have just an Xbox
3034000	3035000	Um
3035000	3036000	Also
3036000	3038000	The first Halo 3 television ad
3038000	3039000	Will air
3039000	3040000	Um
3040000	3041000	During ESPN Monday Night Football
3041000	3043000	On December 4th
3043000	3045000	And it will be a 60 second spot
3045000	3046000	Um
3046000	3047000	So that will be very interesting
3047000	3048000	You know
3048000	3049000	Checking
3049000	3050000	Or tune into that to watch it
3050000	3051000	Or catch it on YouTube
3051000	3052000	The day after
3053000	3054000	So
3055000	3056000	Alrighty
3056000	3057000	Sorry
3057000	3058000	I haven't been having to
3058000	3059000	Argue a little bit
3059000	3060000	With some people in chat room
3060000	3061000	They're like
3061000	3062000	Look the rules are the rules
3062000	3063000	And it's DMN's Wii
3063000	3064000	And he can do whatever he wants
3064000	3065000	To give it away
3065000	3066000	Because he doesn't have to be doing it
3066000	3067000	So
3067000	3068000	That's it
3068000	3069000	Yeah it's a very massive Wii
3069000	3070000	You have there DMN
3070000	3071000	Anyway
3071000	3072000	I wanted to say real quick
3072000	3073000	On the Halo 3
3073000	3074000	So
3074000	3075000	The beta coming out in spring
3075000	3076000	Now you have said
3076000	3077000	In the previous episodes
3077000	3078000	You are convinced
3078000	3079000	That the game is coming out in
3079000	3080000	What?
3080000	3081000	March?
3081000	3082000	April?
3082000	3083000	Somewhere in that window?
3083000	3084000	Uh huh
3084000	3085000	Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?
3085000	3086000	No
3086000	3087000	They beta tested
3087000	3088000	Fantasy Star Universe
3088000	3089000	Right before it came out
3089000	3090000	What's the big deal?
3090000	3091000	I mean
3091000	3092000	It doesn't have to be beta tested
3092000	3093000	Months in advance
3093000	3094000	In fact
3094000	3096000	The only exception I've seen so far
3096000	3097000	Um
3097000	3099000	With demos and Xbox Live
3099000	3101000	Would probably be the stuff from E3
3101000	3102000	You know
3102000	3103000	Lost Planet got a demo
3103000	3104000	And Test Drive Unlimited
3104000	3105000	And stuff like that
3105000	3106000	I mean
3106000	3107000	That stuff was way early
3107000	3108000	But then again
3108000	3109000	It was also already done
3109000	3110000	For that show
3110000	3111000	So they didn't have to really
3111000	3112000	Work on it
3112000	3113000	Um
3113000	3114000	So yeah
3114000	3115000	It makes perfect sense
3115000	3116000	Why would you have a beta test
3116000	3117000	For something
3117000	3118000	And then wait like six months
3118000	3119000	To put it out
3119000	3120000	I'm still telling you
3120000	3121000	End of March
3121000	3122000	So
3122000	3123000	Whatever
3123000	3124000	Alright
3124000	3126000	You all will see
3126000	3127000	We shall
3127000	3128000	We shall see
3128000	3129000	Uh
3129000	3130000	Speaking of things
3130000	3131000	That need to be beta tested
3131000	3133000	Perhaps the PlayStation 3
3133000	3134000	Backwards compatibility
3134000	3135000	Should have been play tested
3135000	3136000	I'm sure you guys have been
3136000	3137000	hearing reports about
3137000	3138000	I think we got into it
3138000	3139000	A little bit last week
3139000	3140000	Some of the games
3140000	3141000	Don't work right
3141000	3142000	Uh
3142000	3143000	They have little bugs
3143000	3144000	I don't know if any
3144000	3145000	Are any of them
3145000	3146000	Rendered unplayable
3146000	3147000	That you've heard of
3147000	3148000	I don't think any of them
3148000	3149000	Are necessarily unplayable
3149000	3150000	I don't know about
3150000	3151000	Unplayable
3151000	3152000	But you've got graphical
3152000	3153000	Audio bugs
3153000	3154000	Quite a bit
3154000	3155000	But it's very interesting
3155000	3156000	Because there was an interview
3156000	3157000	With Sony Computer
3157000	3158000	Entertainment America exec
3158000	3159000	Jack Trettin
3159000	3160000	And he made this
3160000	3161000	Very interesting
3161000	3162000	And bizarre quote
3162000	3163000	In response to the question
3163000	3164000	Do you have a response
3164000	3165000	For people experiencing
3165000	3166000	Backwards compatibility
3166000	3167000	Issues and or television
3167000	3168000	Upscaling problems
3168000	3169000	Quote
3169000	3170000	I would like my car to fly
3170000	3171000	And make me breakfast
3171000	3172000	But that's an unrealistic
3172000	3173000	Expectation
3173000	3174000	We've reported problems
3174000	3176000	On only 200 of the
3176000	3178000	8000 PlayStation 1 and 2 games
3178000	3179000	I would challenge the average
3179000	3180000	Consumer to say
3180000	3181000	There are significant problems
3181000	3182000	With any of the games
3182000	3183000	In their library
3183000	3185000	If you look at our competitors
3185000	3186000	One machine has zero
3186000	3187000	Backwards compatibility
3187000	3188000	And one only has it
3188000	3190000	With a third of their games
3190000	3192000	Someone needs to notify him
3192000	3193000	That the Wii will actually
3193000	3194000	Play all GameCube games
3194000	3195000	But
3195000	3196000	And then also
3196000	3197000	The older games
3197000	3198000	Here's the other thing
3198000	3199000	That's kind of funny
3199000	3200000	200 games so far
3200000	3201000	Out of the 8000
3201000	3202000	Because it's only been
3202000	3203000	Released in one region
3203000	3204000	So far
3204000	3205000	You do realize
3205000	3206000	There are other games
3206000	3207000	In other regions
3207000	3208000	Of course
3208000	3209000	He might not realize that
3209000	3210000	Since he thinks that
3210000	3211000	The Wii doesn't play
3211000	3212000	Any other games
3212000	3213000	But
3213000	3214000	I know
3214000	3215000	And Fireball Man
3215000	3216000	Chatroom says
3216000	3217000	That's just giving
3217000	3218000	A big fuck you
3218000	3219000	To the gaming community
3219000	3220000	And I tend to agree
3220000	3221000	I mean that's a very
3221000	3222000	Snide thing
3222000	3223000	I want a flying car
3223000	3224000	To fix them
3224000	3225000	We'll fix them
3225000	3226000	Our bad
3226000	3227000	I want to get
3227000	3228000	A big
3228000	3229000	Pro-tip
3229000	3230000	For every single
3230000	3231000	Higher up
3231000	3232000	At every single
3232000	3233000	Video game company
3233000	3234000	You don't know
3234000	3235000	What the fuck
3235000	3236000	You're talking about
3236000	3237000	Shut the hell up
3237000	3238000	Hello
3238000	3240000	This includes mine too
3240000	3241000	I know you're listening
3241000	3242000	Perrin
3242000	3243000	Now
3243000	3245000	They are working on
3245000	3247000	Patch to fix this stuff
3247000	3248000	It's
3248000	3249000	You know
3249000	3250000	To be fair
3250000	3251000	Microsoft
3251000	3252000	Their games
3252000	3253000	Aren't
3253000	3254000	Backwards compatible
3254000	3255000	Not all of them
3255000	3256000	I mean
3256000	3257000	They have about
3257000	3258000	They have as many
3258000	3259000	Backwards compatible games
3259000	3260000	As Sony has
3260000	3261000	Games that aren't working
3261000	3262000	In backwards compatibility
3262000	3263000	I mean
3263000	3264000	It's about
3264000	3265000	About that
3265000	3266000	So
3266000	3267000	It'll be fixed
3267000	3268000	In a patch
3268000	3269000	You know
3269000	3270000	People can quit
3270000	3271000	Their bitching
3271000	3272000	Granted
3272000	3273000	There's still gonna be
3273000	3274000	Other problems
3274000	3275000	But
3275000	3276000	That's why they have
3276000	3277000	These updates
3277000	3278000	And firmware updates
3278000	3279000	And stuff like that
3279000	3280000	So
3280000	3281000	Not a huge deal
3281000	3282000	I mean
3282000	3283000	It's going to be in the library
3283000	3284000	I mean
3284000	3285000	The percentage of
3285000	3286000	Games that aren't working
3286000	3287000	Is about like
3287000	3288000	2%
3288000	3289000	That's really
3289000	3290000	Not that big
3290000	3291000	Of a deal
3291000	3292000	So
3292000	3293000	It will
3293000	3294000	Be fixed soon
3294000	3295000	I mean
3295000	3296000	At least
3296000	3297000	They could have said
3297000	3298000	At least
3298000	3299000	Hey we're
3299000	3300000	We're doing better
3300000	3301000	Than 360
3301000	3302000	Granted
3302000	3303000	Yeah
3303000	3304000	This guy
3304000	3305000	Is an idiot
3305000	3306000	I mean
3306000	3307000	They do not
3307000	3308000	Need people like
3308000	3309000	Him
3309000	3310000	You know
3310000	3314280	familiar sounding name, says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.
3314280	3318120	It's very rude. It's just rude. It's horrible PR.
3318120	3322080	It is a little bit. Considering they're relying on these people
3322080	3325600	to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they're
3325600	3330240	really rude to them at launch. Interesting words.
3330240	3335080	What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for
3335080	3339160	the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound
3339160	3341200	like pricks. Them's fighting words.
3341200	3344360	Those are fighting words. I still, despite all this crap, I do still
3344360	3348040	consider myself a Sony fanboy. I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.
3348040	3350320	So, you want to go outside? You want to go to the parking lot?
3350320	3355040	You want to go get Todd a lesson? All right. Fight. Fight.
3355040	3358040	I might shoot him. Okay.
3358040	3361360	I get to stop. Anyway.
3361360	3367860	Speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.
3367860	3371320	Well, not really got shot. Well, actually, in other states they got shot.
3371320	3377520	But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their
3377520	3385400	PS3. Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game
3385400	3386400	system. It's not the whole diamond.
3386400	3390120	It's $599 US dollars. I don't fucking care.
3390120	3395380	$600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay. But there's people getting shot over this
3395380	3403400	and I'm like, you people are pathetic. Wait.
3403400	3406840	Let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up a mic again.
3406840	3411560	Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.
3411560	3422720	You smart ass. I'm just all, you know, it's, they were shooting
3422720	3427880	people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.
3427880	3432400	I guess the PS3 must be the must own console because that's, you know, every year you hear
3432400	3437440	about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking
3437440	3441840	each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them.
3441840	3445720	My mom did that. My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle
3445720	3449180	Me Elmo. That's hot.
3449180	3453560	And now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation threes.
3453560	3455920	It's crazy. You know what?
3455920	3461080	I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back
3461080	3466280	to any of those assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis
3466280	3470800	shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and boric acid poured over the stump.
3470800	3475280	You know, that's probably someone's fetish. You know, while having to watch Bad Santa.
3475280	3479800	No, while having to watch Manos, the Hands of Fate.
3479800	3485080	You know, Jamie is starting to sound a little angsty. And you know what happens when Jamie
3485080	3487240	gets angsty? People die?
3487240	3491280	Well, suddenly background music starts coming in and we get into a regular segment of the
3491280	3496280	show. Oh, look, right on cue.
3496280	3509960	FUs of the Week time, Dark Sakura. A big flippin' FU to Sony. All-encompassingly.
3509960	3514880	And all of your retarded, as you may notice, I'm saying retarded fanboys, as in not that
3514880	3521680	all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.
3521680	3529560	All those, I guess it's stupid men, really. But it's rather like, oh, we're going to sell
3529560	3536080	it on eBay. You people are disgusting. And I have a secondary FU that I think is going
3536080	3540160	to go in line with somebody else's in this room. FU to Art Thieves.
3540160	3552800	FU to Nintendo, Mad Catz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.
3552800	3561520	Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday or today? Whatever. Why do
3561520	3569560	I have to wait? I cannot stand composite cables. I need higher def cables. How will I live
3569560	3579440	in a high def world with standard composite cables? It's barbaric. And besides, why do
3579440	3584200	I have to wait until December? I don't want to wait.
3584200	3591920	My FU of the Week goes to Dark Sakura, Chris, and Extrofer, and the entire line at Target
3591920	3599600	Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my
3599600	3605000	bed, warm and toasty asleep. And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache,
3605000	3609760	so FU to my toothache. No. If we really wanted to effect revenge on you,
3609760	3612280	we would have dumped some ice water on you, too.
3612280	3614600	I would have locked the door to my house so you couldn't do that.
3614600	3619240	If it makes you really better, I thought about pulling you at five.
3619240	3624120	So, no, I'm teasing. Of course, they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little
3624120	3629400	bit of sand in my vagina this week. DMN, your FUs of the Week.
3629400	3635120	My first FU of the Week goes to T-Mobile because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation
3635120	3638560	with money to spend, and then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money, and
3638560	3642160	you're going to fucking hate your weekend. But thankfully, I have friends who help me
3642160	3647440	out, but they don't get FUs. But T-Mobile does. If you ever take my fucking money without
3647440	3652440	my permission again, people will die. And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR
3652440	3655680	the other day. I've totally pwned you a butterfly.
3655680	3659160	We're going to... I want to play you a... Rematch, bitch, right now.
3659160	3661720	Right now. Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did.
3661720	3664360	I will still get Laquisha. It's already been brought in.
3664360	3669080	All right. Chris, your FUs of the Week. All right, then Drew. Drew, your FUs of the
3669080	3671080	Week. You guys serve.
3671080	3678080	Okay, FU to Dimash Marketing Strategies. Why do we have just not enough game systems for
3679040	3684320	everyone who watches it the first time around? It still makes no fucking sense to me.
3684320	3688480	FU to the ramped up difficulty levels of Guitar Hero 2. What the hell? I mean, I know you're
3688480	3693160	going to make it harder, but Jesus. Miserloo on Expert? What the hell?
3693160	3699200	Also, FU to the DMV. I know everyone shares FU. Now they have to have your birth certificate
3699200	3703040	even though you've been through the whole thing before just for a new something. So
3703040	3708040	you get to stand in line not once, but twice. Isn't it lovely? Ain't it grand?
3708040	3713040	Fine. Chris, your FUs. Well, Jimmy kind of already stated my FU.
3713040	3717960	FU to Art Thieves. My art was stolen on DeviantArt. That was fun.
3717960	3722200	Why would somebody steal art? You know, well, it was kind of funny because
3722200	3726960	it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school
3726960	3731360	publicly, so I'm not that great, but it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown
3731360	3735880	enough that she thought no one would recognize it, but somebody did and they informed me
3735880	3741640	and she did it on both her accounts and she actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's
3741640	3747640	member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description too. Word for word. It was really,
3747640	3751480	really funny. What a hooker.
3751480	3754520	I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thieves. My bad.
3754520	3759040	Oh, no. I draw, so. I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an
3759040	3765000	FU, but a kind of confused why don't you notice is all the people who asked me why are you
3765000	3772400	doing this online when I was handing out coffee. I'm kind of not pleased that people have just
3772400	3776080	lost faith in humanity. It's like I know you read about all these things happening, it's
3776080	3781160	like people are killing each other for a PS3, but there are nice people left and they're
3781160	3789680	all gay. I love you, Drew.
3789680	3797000	Wow. They knew me as the lesbian in line.
3797000	3802080	That's how they knew you on the show too. We love you. You're much more than a lesbian.
3802080	3804440	You're also the chick with blue hair. All right.
3804440	3809040	And I feed you sugar. I give you sugar.
3809040	3818680	Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week. A pregnant
3818680	3826080	woman actually was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey, and she says nine months
3826080	3831000	pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried
3831000	3835960	to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's
3835960	3842760	father, and her younger brother. Okay, yeah, you're really...
3842760	3847720	You're stupid. That is pretty stupid.
3847720	3851160	Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.
3851160	3856300	Why are you allowed to be pregnant? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is where I'm going off
3856300	3861860	because this is one of the things I hate. I hate when stupid people breed. When people
3861860	3868080	exist only on this earth to start out babies. Jamie, she really, really, really, really
3868080	3872080	wanted one. No. No, no, no. Seriously, what is more important,
3872080	3876560	the birth of your child or a video game system? You are a disgusting person, and I hope your
3876560	3878760	child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.
3878760	3885980	Depends. How ugly is your child? Wow. Wow.
3885980	3891160	It depends on if she was at Walmart or not. Landmine Fairy in Chat says, WTF, is she going
3891160	3895440	to play Trauma Center while in labor? No, no, no. She will not be playing Trauma
3895440	3898040	Center. Trauma Center is not on PlayStation 3.
3898040	3902320	Oh, that's right. Oh, snap. She'll be playing one of the 15 games that
3902320	3907560	came out before and that's about it. No, she won't let me play Motorstorm until
3907560	3910800	March. She will be playing Rises of the Old Man.
3910800	3915360	She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spiderman impregnated her. I don't
3915360	3919440	know. To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel
3919440	3924520	very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.
3924520	3931960	I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child,
3931960	3937480	you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.
3937480	3940320	No video game system is worth your child's life.
3940320	3946800	All right. I love the chat room. SSJ100Matt says, Loki,
3946800	3954240	it's New Jersey after all. I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.
3954240	3957560	I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once. It was fun.
3957560	3959720	All right. For all you people in Jersey, that's loki
3959720	3963680	at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. There you go. Send the hate mail. Fire away.
3963680	3968880	I'm just reading the chat room, okay? I didn't say it.
3968880	3974960	To one very strange incident in a line, to a line that was complimented on a very big
3974960	3982360	blogging site, Joystiq, gave kudos to Best Buy in the landmark center, Best Buy in Boston,
3982360	3985680	where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.
3985680	3992520	What happened is that, okay, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event
3992520	3996120	the next day. What happened is that at 11 p.m. the night
3996120	4001760	before, the general manager walked over to the line and told them he didn't care whatever
4001760	4005400	system they wanted to use. So they formed this list. There was a line
4005400	4009760	and you had to check in every hour. They had roll call every half hour, whatever,
4009760	4013240	for the line. And if you weren't there, you were out.
4013240	4018660	And so what happened is that there was, I guess, 40 people in line.
4018660	4022860	And then what happened, by 3 p.m. they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.
4022860	4027540	So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.
4027540	4032320	They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just
4032320	4036560	come back and get their system. And anything that was left over was automatically
4036560	4039900	raffled off. So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager
4039900	4044580	that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's
4044580	4047920	interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.
4047920	4052560	Good for them. So it's good to hear that not every line was
4052560	4056640	just, you know, fucking nuts. So good for you guys in Boston.
4056640	4061840	Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and
4061840	4067400	Wii launches. Basically doing this in conjunction with the
4067400	4073240	law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.
4073240	4076320	So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going
4076320	4080880	on in regards to the system launches elsewhere. That's pretty good.
4080880	4087400	I know it wasn't with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles.
4087400	4091800	It's real chaos. But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this
4091800	4097240	week at launch, you may be in luck. There may be some more coming in next week
4097240	4102680	for Black Friday. So if you really want to fight the chaos in
4102680	4109920	the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more
4109920	4115240	systems out there for next week and stuff. I don't know, personally, I don't think that
4115240	4120200	there's a real big need for it right now. With only 15 games going to be out before
4120200	4122720	the end of the year, I mean, you probably could wait.
4122720	4124840	You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.
4124840	4129560	I mean, what's coming out next month anyways? Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.
4129560	4132960	Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.
4132960	4138240	Yeah, so it's not a huge deal. But that's cool at least that they're shipping
4138240	4143520	them relatively quick. Do you think this is going to drive the eBay
4143520	4147280	prices down as the market gets more deluded? It already has actually, from what I was reading.
4147280	4156920	They're going for about $1,500 now. That's also another reason I think you're
4156920	4162960	probably not seeing a lot of Wees on eBay, because their shipments are going to be coming
4162960	4165680	in around the same time. I think we heard that we're getting our next
4165680	4170840	shipment after Thanksgiving. So, yeah, they're going to have systems out
4170840	4174520	there, and people don't really need to spend tons of money.
4174520	4179920	Rama just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.
4179920	4183040	What's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?
4183040	4188240	Two gunshots to the head. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
4188240	4189800	Hey, look, I didn't write them. I only read them.
4189800	4197280	You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.
4197280	4202320	You guys remember John Edwards? He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.
4202320	4206080	He ran with John Kerry, right? Well, there was a story circulating around
4206080	4209480	the Internet that what happened. Now, what's interesting to note about John
4209480	4215320	Edwards is he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know,
4215320	4220120	and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart, so he's kind of in
4220120	4223240	that camp and it's one of his platforms or whatever.
4223240	4229980	What happened is that according to a statement that he made, his wife told him, his wife
4229980	4234920	Elizabeth said, hey, we want to get a PlayStation 3 for the young kids.
4234920	4238120	What happened is that she made the comment, and again, this is according to a statement,
4238120	4241400	in front of one of the staff people. Well, the staff people mentioned it then in
4241400	4246500	front of a volunteer, and the volunteer started to make all efforts to get one, and so who
4246500	4251320	did the volunteer call? Walmart, and tried to use John Edwards' name
4251320	4254760	to say, hey, this guy wants a PlayStation 3, you should help us out.
4254760	4259520	So of course, Walmart used the opportunity to put out their own release and say, well,
4259520	4266900	Edwards is here criticizing us and now he wants a PlayStation 3 and he's being a little
4266900	4271920	bit hypocritical, huh? So it's very interesting back and forth.
4271920	4277520	Obviously, there's the he said and they said type things, so it's really hard to know who's
4277520	4282640	right, but if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little
4282640	4287040	unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little
4287040	4288040	silly. One of his staffers is fired?
4288040	4292520	Yeah, one of his staffers is probably fired. Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively
4292520	4295960	soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.
4295960	4298840	Interesting. What's this quote from Walmart?
4298840	4301880	Oh, here's the quote from Walmart. Quote, while the rest of America's working
4301880	4305920	families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.
4305920	4308860	Ouch. Certainly not good if he's trying to run
4308860	4313760	for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?
4313760	4317480	Most people will probably forget. I don't know, I don't know.
4317480	4322120	I'm just thinking, you know, it's a while ago, and I will say, we'll see.
4322120	4329200	On a small political note, he made a joke about George Bush, and everyone took it to
4329200	4334480	be a joke about him insulting the troops. They're going to play that too.
4334480	4336880	That was Kerry, not Edwards. Oh, that was Kerry?
4336880	4339160	Yeah. He did that in Seattle, and I thought it
4339160	4342240	was the funniest thing ever. He's not running anyway, because he's associated
4342240	4346760	with John Kerry. All right, this isn't Crossfire, boys and
4346760	4351920	girls. We've got to keep it moving. We're just going to have to go to a different country
4351920	4355940	or something to get us off of this tangent. Well, there's a country that I would certainly
4355940	4359680	love to visit if somebody would like to send me a plane ticket there, but in the interim,
4359680	4367080	I will just have to cover news there. Basically, the PS3 folks are, it's, stupid
4367080	4374400	freaking Sony, but there's a company that's placing ads in London train stations saying
4374400	4379120	that they will be able to sell a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.
4379120	4383440	The thing is, is that Sony's cracked down on all of the shipping.
4383440	4390480	They're saying Play Asia is not sending any Sony products to Europe.
4390480	4398520	eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done, but there is a company that's advertising
4398520	4405360	in these stations stating PS3, order now for Christmas, and they're given a premium, one
4405360	4412120	fifty minute phone number to call to leave details on the phone service to where they'll
4412120	4419040	be called back when the systems are available. A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently
4419040	4423580	investigating it further. We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and
4423580	4429200	urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.
4429200	4434760	A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff
4434760	4436880	going on just to get their hands on the PlayStation 3.
4436880	4442240	Jesus Christ, Sony, what are you trying to hide from Europe? Let them import the goddamn
4442240	4446560	systems. But I still think that this stinks of scam.
4446560	4451640	Oh no, I don't doubt that one bit. I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up,
4451640	4454640	and scammers, shut the fuck up. Scammers just die.
4454640	4457760	You should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story. No, I'm kidding. You
4457760	4467520	know I love you, DMN. Anyways, sorry. So, it's kind of funny though,
4467520	4473920	I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart, and it's
4473920	4478800	really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going
4478800	4484360	there with a PlayStation 3 in there, and well, basically they found out it's not running
4484360	4489200	actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's
4489200	4496960	actually PlayStation 3 live footage. So, oops, I guess that sucks, but that was actually
4496960	4505080	coming from GamerAndy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there, one for the TV,
4505080	4511680	one for a DVD player. Is this, I'm just asking this question hypothetically
4511680	4517720	to bring up debate, is this necessarily such a bad thing though? I mean, if that's what
4517720	4523260	Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine? I mean, if that's
4523260	4525360	how they want to do it? That's fine, but I still think it's funny
4525360	4531760	how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk. It's authentic, I'll
4531760	4537120	give them that. You're harsh, you're harsh. Alright, well,
4537120	4542000	you know, Sony may not be the only thing, only folks experiencing some broken things
4542000	4547120	here at launch. Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just
4547120	4550520	yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually just before we went live, and I think it missed
4550520	4553900	the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are
4553900	4557640	breaking down, but, you know, any launch console is going to have their issues where certain
4557640	4562740	ones don't work, so that's inevitable. But what should be interesting to note is that
4562740	4566780	some of the stuff they said was going to be available on the Wii isn't really quite ready
4566780	4571880	yet. What's interesting is that the forecast channel is not actually going to show up until
4571880	4577240	December 20th, and the news channel will not actually start until January 27th of next
4577240	4581880	year, so two of these things they were touting at E3 just for whatever reason, not ready
4581880	4584480	to go just yet. It should be noted, it's kind of interesting,
4584480	4588320	I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't
4588320	4592020	available either. You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop
4592020	4596040	channel, and some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that
4596040	4600080	because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now. All those people
4600080	4603680	that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today, so, you know, everybody's
4603680	4607880	trying to download that at once, and thankfully I didn't have a problem. I guess we're lucky
4607880	4613200	in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores, but, yeah, you know,
4613200	4614880	certainly interesting that they have all these updates.
4614880	4621200	Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not
4621200	4625480	detrimental to the system's operation. It is first and foremost a gaming console. I
4625480	4629480	honestly think that the news channel's coming out a little later because it was announced
4629480	4633520	that they're partnering with CNN, and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out
4633520	4638240	yet. I have no idea about the forecast channel, but, yeah, it was interesting to see that
4638240	4642200	firmware update right out of, I don't want to say right out of the box, but when you
4642200	4645160	connected to the internet.
4645160	4650400	Mikew0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down. Well,
4650400	4654800	yeah, that's because it happened to me, so I was pissed, of course, and if my Wii breaks,
4654800	4659840	I'm going to be pissed, too. But, no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay, but
4659840	4663040	it's kind of one of the things, like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point,
4663040	4669360	you know, every launch console has bugs, but, you know, in the first wave, no matter what,
4669360	4673000	this isn't PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.
4673000	4680360	Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?
4680360	4684440	I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and, again, this was so new, it didn't make
4684440	4687800	our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like, it said, you
4687800	4692960	need to eject the disk and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things
4692960	4697440	like that, and lots of, like, discrete errors, yeah, little things like that, so.
4697440	4702120	That's not the amount that Sony is supposedly reporting, right?
4702120	4705400	Well, but I don't know, who's tracking it? We don't know, you know, no one's tracking,
4705400	4708880	and keep in mind, Sony doesn't have as many consoles out there, so I don't know, until
4708880	4712220	we see some hard figures, and are these companies going to release statistics on how many broken
4712220	4715940	machines they have? Probably not, so I don't know if this is on the same level as Three
4715940	4721720	Rings of Death or not, on 360, so who knows? Who knows?
4721720	4727760	I'm going to chat room to read more comments, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
4727760	4731880	Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat, do you really want news or weather?
4731880	4738560	No, I don't, but I would like the internet browser, yeah, I would like that, definitely.
4738560	4743800	I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like
4743800	4748320	it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.
4748320	4750880	I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry, I still have no one to play.
4750880	4753080	Honestly, if you want to know what the weather's going to look like, it's called looking out
4753080	4754080	the fucking window.
4754080	4757080	Open a window.
4757080	4760120	I can't open the window, the sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.
4760120	4761120	Oh, touche.
4761120	4767960	That's why I live in Seattle, where it's cloudy and rainy all day.
4767960	4770280	At least you know what it's always going to be like there.
4770280	4775880	Well, at any rate, you know, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for
4775880	4777920	is music.
4777920	4785240	And there's going to be an MP3 player out, in Europe anyway, on 8th December, that will
4785240	4787160	be 20 pounds.
4787160	4791880	It's for the Game Boy Advance and DS, that's supposed to be just like the Playon.
4791880	4799600	It has a 512 megabyte SD card that lets you load music files onto it via your PC, then
4799600	4806960	you plug in the adapter into your Game Boy SP, your Game Boy Micro, or Nintendo DS, and
4806960	4811240	you can listen to songs on the go.
4811240	4813480	Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting.
4813480	4820280	Well, if it is a redo of the Playon, it will also have a, the Playon had a capacity to
4820280	4824720	take a 2 gigabyte SD card, so.
4824720	4826600	I thought they already had something like that already.
4826600	4828600	That was the Playon.
4828600	4834120	No, here, it's not the Playon or whatever, it's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.
4834120	4840720	They use it mainly for, I don't know, pirating games and other things, but it's also meant
4840720	4841720	for media.
4841720	4846440	And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte, like hard drive, micro
4846440	4847440	drive in there.
4847440	4848920	Well, this one's official.
4848920	4850840	All right, interesting.
4850840	4855160	I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick, Miek Latov
4855160	4858080	PM'd me and he said his Wii froze up today.
4858080	4860200	He was exiting the Mii channel and it just froze.
4860200	4866240	He had to turn it off and on, so there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get
4866240	4867240	patched or something.
4867240	4871760	Mine froze up once, but it, well actually it didn't really freeze up, it just seemed
4871760	4878160	like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system before they
4878160	4880080	launched the internet thing.
4880080	4881080	So yeah, I didn't like it.
4881080	4886040	Well, I tried to do the shop channel today and it just, it froze up when I was trying
4886040	4889640	to go into shop channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.
4889640	4893080	Yeah, mine kind of a little delayed today too, so.
4893080	4897640	I mean, I can let little web errors slide because those are at least fixed in an hour,
4897640	4899760	you know, just depending on the issue.
4899760	4904600	Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues for like, ever since the damn game came out,
4904600	4910240	so I don't know, a World of Warcraft, long queue times and all that fun stuff, so.
4910240	4915920	Anywho, so you know, of course you can get issues with a console like this and you know,
4915920	4918920	I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they'd cut out, like
4918920	4922880	you know, DVD playback and stuff like that, but not a big deal.
4922880	4927040	But actually they were aiming for even lower price point than $249, they would have liked
4927040	4932180	to have seen it at under $100 according to Miyamoto.
4932180	4937440	And his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money
4937440	4940720	could be spent on proving the interface and software.
4940720	4945760	And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and
4945760	4952040	photos and other pricey parts, they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.
4952040	4957280	And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for
4957280	4958280	$99?
4958280	4966840	I mean, as it is, they're flying off the shelves pretty quick, but $99 is just stupid low.
4966840	4970360	Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted
4970360	4973600	as the revolution, that the revolution was going to be $99?
4973600	4977200	I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone
4977200	4979160	made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?
4979160	4981160	I do think.
4981160	4985360	But I don't know, I think $249 is pretty good.
4985360	4987320	Definitely it's different.
4987320	4991600	A lot of people though, I think their competition is going to be saying, well, our graphics
4991600	4992600	are better.
4992600	4996800	You know, we can do HD movies, but yeah.
4996800	4997800	So what?
4997800	5001840	You know, I just, I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like
5001840	5006520	it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.
5006520	5013120	I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me, so whatever.
5013120	5021520	All right, moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you
5021520	5023920	know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.
5023920	5027840	I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming, and you know what?
5027840	5030800	Hey, you know, Drew's waving his hand over there.
5030800	5033480	What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?
5033480	5036560	Is it just the cost, or what's the deal?
5036560	5042040	Right now it's the cost, and I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.
5042040	5048600	Like Final Fantasy 13, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side
5048600	5051760	Super Smash Bros. Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.
5051760	5055080	I'm just waiting for the big name titles.
5055080	5057280	Well, what current gen systems do you have?
5057280	5058280	Do you have a Dreamcast?
5058280	5059280	I have a PS2.
5059280	5060280	I want a Dreamcast.
5060280	5064640	Well, you probably still get one cheap, and good news for you Dreamcast owners, there
5064640	5067320	is another Dreamcast game coming out.
5067320	5072020	Play Asia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December
5072020	5073020	October.
5073020	5075560	It's a side-scrolling space shooter.
5075560	5080840	It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.
5080840	5084640	It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured,
5084640	5087480	distributed, or endorsed by Sega.
5087480	5091400	One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo
5091400	5095840	AES and NBS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.
5095840	5096840	Oh, interesting.
5096840	5097840	I didn't even catch that.
5097840	5098840	I went to the website.
5098840	5099840	Ah, very cool.
5099840	5106040	I just want to give the website real quick, if anyone's interested, www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com.
5106040	5110440	The one thing about it, though, is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other
5110440	5117600	Neo Geo carts, so yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo, unless
5117600	5119440	you get CD or Dreamcast.
5119440	5124760	Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince,
5124760	5126640	that OLR reported on a few months ago.
5126640	5127640	Yeah, that's true.
5127640	5128640	Remember the Genesis game?
5128640	5129640	Yeah, very cool.
5129640	5136200	All right, well, we're going to move on, and I was thinking we were going to do the drawing
5136200	5140240	very soon, but now there was just a net split, so we have to wait for that situation to clear
5140240	5144320	itself out before we can do the giveaway, so I'll have to wait a little bit on that,
5144320	5150240	but definitely make your way on over to chat.orangelaungeradio.com when the situation resolves a little later
5150240	5151240	on in the evening.
5151240	5155500	We'll be doing that Wii giveaway, but for now, we've got to do one of our favorite segments
5155500	5160560	here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that is Dark Sakura's very own website of the week.
5160560	5163940	She surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and left and right, and finds a
5163940	5167480	website that she deems worthy of your attention.
5167480	5170120	Dark Sakura, what should the kids be looking at this week?
5170120	5181280	My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.
5181280	5182280	It's smashmyps3.com.
5182280	5190760	Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have
5190760	5192760	Smash My PS3.
5192760	5198680	And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed
5198680	5205760	young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation
5205760	5213760	3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting and waiting and waiting for
5213760	5216320	their very own PlayStation 3.
5216320	5225520	Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several
5225520	5233760	different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said
5233760	5240920	PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.
5240920	5245640	Translated, that means they smash that thing to the ground.
5245640	5250240	It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.
5250240	5257040	At abstract translation, a method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.
5257040	5260920	Now I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe they did take the second
5260920	5261920	one and sell it.
5261920	5266400	Now that their conscience cleared a little bit, out of curiosity, will you be visiting
5266400	5267400	SmashMyWe.com?
5267400	5268400	The sequel?
5268400	5270400	No, that will make me cry.
5270400	5276520	No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny, because there's people who are so
5276520	5282640	freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.
5282640	5290600	Yeah, I actually, there's a, you can't get laid, Jiranami, there's actually, there was
5290600	5294400	a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.
5294400	5297960	The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool,
5297960	5298960	and I'm looking forward to it.
5298960	5301840	There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.
5301840	5305960	Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!
5305960	5306960	Let's pray.
5306960	5311240	Say it in commands that I give my soul to Sony.
5311240	5315560	Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like watching someone
5315560	5319360	smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point?
5319360	5322480	Wait, does that mean that Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?
5322480	5324480	I haven't seen that.
5324480	5326680	No, I love Little Nicky!
5326680	5327680	Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.
5327680	5331840	Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes, he eats crayons.
5331840	5336680	He's like the Pooh of Cthulhu.
5336680	5340160	He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his
5340160	5342200	fecal matter.
5342200	5346680	Wow, that's interesting.
5346680	5352040	Alright, what we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip
5352040	5356520	here, and it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having
5356520	5358560	to hold off on the contest a little bit here.
5358560	5362400	We'll fill you in after this taped segment, what we're going to do, we're hoping the rest
5362400	5363400	of chat comes back in.
5363400	5364520	Rob broke the internet.
5364520	5365520	I didn't break it.
5365520	5366840	I have a backup plan just in case.
5366840	5370080	I'll run it by DMN, but we're going to go to this taped bit.
5370080	5373440	Dark Soccer and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland, and they
5373440	5377280	thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?
5377280	5382160	So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different
5382160	5383160	people.
5383160	5385800	So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?
5385800	5390560	Well, in the car we were thinking, hey vehicle, I did interview people to see why they're
5390560	5391560	out in line.
5391560	5395900	So I was like, Jamie was keeping our place on the line, and I was going to go play reporter.
5395900	5399880	And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.
5399880	5402800	I don't like talking to new people.
5402800	5403800	I'm pretty shy.
5403800	5406120	I am pretty shy around new people.
5406120	5408240	So I walked up and I was representing Orange Land.
5408240	5412080	So I'm like, hi, do you mind if I interview you for orangelandradio.com?
5412080	5413080	It's a video game.
5413080	5417700	You know, I went through the whole thing, and most of them went, uh, sure.
5417700	5420920	So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.
5420920	5421920	So I'm sorry.
5421920	5424160	I'm sorry you have to listen to those.
5424160	5425160	No, it's cool.
5425160	5426680	So yeah, DMN?
5426680	5430640	So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.
5430640	5431640	Good job.
5431640	5432640	Oh, yeah.
5432640	5434440	Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.
5434440	5441520	This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Land Radio message line from the line outside Target
5441520	5442520	in Citrus Heights, California.
5442520	5443520	Say hi, everybody.
5443520	5451480	So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the
5451480	5452480	night.
5452480	5454480	So, well, done by our house lesbian.
5454480	5455480	Hi.
5455480	5456480	Hi.
5456480	5457480	And, uh, stay tuned to listen.
5457480	5458480	Okay, bye-bye.
5458480	5463840	Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Orange Land Radio.
5463840	5469640	I am Chris, also known as DisneyPunk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target
5469640	5470640	Garden Center, actually.
5470640	5474600	We're under the sign that says Garden Center, and there's probably looks to be about 30
5474600	5475600	people online.
5475600	5477600	I'm going to start at the end, because the end rules.
5477600	5478600	Huh.
5478600	5479600	It's girls and acts.
5479600	5480600	The girls.
5480600	5484800	I'm right in front of a guy and a girl, one's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black
5484800	5485800	hats on.
5485800	5486800	One's got an Alcatraz office on.
5486800	5487800	That's great.
5487800	5488800	So we're going to ask a couple of questions.
5488800	5489800	First of all, can you state your name?
5489800	5490800	Jamie.
5490800	5491800	Jamie?
5491800	5492800	Our co-star, Focker, actually, is named Jamie, too.
5492800	5493800	No, I'm kidding.
5493800	5494800	Can I have your name?
5494800	5495800	Aaron.
5495800	5496800	Aaron.
5496800	5506800	Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at,
5506800	5509800	what is it, two, two o'clock in the morning?
5509800	5511800	Well, it's my birthday today.
5511800	5512800	Thanks.
5512800	5515800	I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.
5515800	5520000	I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones, because the
5520000	5522800	codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.
5522800	5526800	Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?
5526800	5527800	No.
5527800	5528800	Definitely not.
5528800	5529800	Definitely not.
5529800	5530800	Why not?
5530800	5533800	I'm not as interested, really, right now.
5533800	5536800	Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.
5536800	5537800	Fair enough.
5537800	5540800	And can I ask you guys a random question?
5540800	5542800	What's your favorite color?
5542800	5543800	Blue.
5543800	5544800	Green?
5544800	5547800	Okay, those were both wrong answers and you failed.
5547800	5548800	I'm kidding.
5548800	5549800	Orange.
5549800	5550800	Orange, okay.
5550800	5553800	Can I ask you, sir, what's your name?
5553800	5554800	Nathan.
5554800	5555800	Nathan?
5555800	5558800	Okay, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?
5558800	5561800	Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan,
5561800	5562800	I grew up on it.
5562800	5565800	All right, old school fan.
5565800	5568800	Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?
5568800	5569800	No, absolutely not.
5569800	5570800	Okay.
5570800	5574800	And here's your obligatory question.
5574800	5576800	That's a good one.
5576800	5578800	I can't really think of an obligatory question.
5578800	5579800	What's your favorite color?
5579800	5580800	Red.
5580800	5581800	Red?
5581800	5582800	Okay.
5582800	5583800	That was the right answer.
5583800	5584800	You win.
5584800	5587800	All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.
5587800	5591800	There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here and there isn't a big line,
5591800	5592800	so good luck.
5592800	5594800	Good evening, radio fans.
5594800	5600800	And this is Kristin again with your Wii.
5600800	5604800	I guess it would be our cast of our Wii.
5604800	5605800	I don't know what you call it.
5605800	5608800	But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.
5608800	5610800	And I'm here with, can you state your name?
5610800	5611800	Sarah.
5611800	5612800	Sarah.
5612800	5616800	I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line,
5616800	5620800	and now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.
5620800	5622800	But she's probably got the most awesome hat here.
5622800	5625800	It's a white hat, like, baseball cap with a Wii.
5625800	5630800	It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.
5630800	5632800	So can I ask you, she's actually great.
5632800	5633800	What's your shirt?
5633800	5634800	Donkey Kong.
5634800	5635800	That's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.
5635800	5636800	That's awesome.
5636800	5641800	So can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5641800	5644800	Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?
5644800	5646800	Actually, how long have you been here?
5646800	5649800	I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.
5649800	5651800	Not too terribly long, yeah.
5651800	5652800	That's not bad.
5652800	5657800	Why do you think the Wii is waiting for just early in the morning?
5657800	5658800	Twilight Princess, first of all.
5658800	5663800	Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while,
5663800	5666800	and I think it's certainly worth the wait.
5666800	5667800	Yep.
5667800	5668800	Did you get a PS3?
5668800	5670800	Oh, hell no.
5670800	5675800	Do you see a difference, or is it just the price?
5675800	5680800	I would not pay $600 to test out an unproven format of disc, no.
5680800	5683800	They're getting too big for their shorts.
5683800	5687800	Oh, you are loved by many Orange Los Angeles nerds.
5687800	5690800	Are they all bashed on you all the time?
5690800	5693800	And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?
5693800	5695800	Blue.
5695800	5697800	You fail and lose.
5697800	5698800	I'm sorry.
5698800	5699800	I meant to say orange.
5699800	5700800	I meant to say orange.
5700800	5702800	Okay, you survived.
5702800	5706800	All right, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii,
5706800	5707800	but I don't think it will be that bad.
5707800	5709800	There's not that many people in line.
5709800	5710800	Thank you very much.
5710800	5711800	You're welcome.
5711800	5715800	Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?
5715800	5716800	What is your quest?
5716800	5717800	You.
5717800	5720800	Cake or death.
5720800	5721800	Cake, please.
5721800	5722800	Very well.
5722800	5724800	I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question.
5724800	5728800	I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions,
5728800	5731800	but I was so nervous.
5731800	5734800	I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them,
5734800	5737800	and I just kept, what's your favorite color?
5737800	5738800	It's all right.
5738800	5739800	It's an internet radio show.
5739800	5742800	You don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie.
5742800	5743800	You still are.
5743800	5745800	You're Saint Chris, remember?
5745800	5747800	She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.
5747800	5751800	No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line
5751800	5753800	if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.
5753800	5757800	I wanted to, they both, I was trying to help your radio.
5757800	5758800	It's fun.
5758800	5759800	No, it's funny.
5759800	5761800	I like it, because I like hearing people's reactions to it.
5761800	5762800	No.
5762800	5763800	Hell no.
5763800	5766800	But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later,
5766800	5768800	but I just had to interrupt to say that, because that was funny.
5768800	5769800	So back to the tape.
5769800	5774800	Hello, radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people,
5774800	5776800	in line for the Wii.
5776800	5777800	Can you guys speak your name?
5777800	5779800	Stella.
5779800	5781800	John.
5781800	5783800	How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?
5783800	5785800	Since, like, nine.
5785800	5786800	About, like, eight.
5786800	5787800	Okay.
5787800	5788800	What's your name?
5788800	5789800	Kyle.
5789800	5790800	Kyle?
5790800	5791800	How long have you been here?
5791800	5792800	Just kind of.
5792800	5797800	What do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5797800	5798800	What?
5798800	5800800	Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5800800	5802800	What's so special about it?
5802800	5805800	Because it's so kick-ass, and there's Zelda.
5805800	5807800	I'm just picking it up for a friend.
5807800	5808800	Wow.
5808800	5812800	Damn, he must owe you, or you owe him.
5812800	5814800	Do you owe him money?
5814800	5816800	Okay.
5816800	5818800	I'm just here for kicks.
5818800	5820800	You're just hanging out in the cold.
5820800	5821800	All right.
5821800	5825800	David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?
5825800	5826800	No.
5826800	5831800	Not unless you drop the prize.
5831800	5833800	Okay.
5833800	5834800	He's just here for kicks.
5834800	5835800	All right.
5835800	5838800	And your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?
5838800	5839800	Green.
5839800	5840800	Plaid.
5840800	5841800	Yellow.
5841800	5842800	Yellow?
5842800	5843800	Okay.
5843800	5844800	You win.
5844800	5845800	Plaid wins.
5845800	5846800	All right.
5846800	5847800	Well, thank you, guys.
5847800	5850800	If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock
5850800	5852800	tonight, or we're on podcast.
5852800	5854800	You can download it on iTunes.
5854800	5858800	Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, so it should be fun.
5858800	5859800	Yay, Wii.
5859800	5862800	Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but this is the next one.
5862800	5864800	This is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.
5864800	5866800	But we're interviewing people at the Wii.
5866800	5868800	So, Jamie, stop talking to people.
5868800	5869800	What?
5869800	5870800	Okay.
5870800	5872800	State your name, please.
5872800	5875800	DarkSlashTheGreatAndMighty.
5875800	5877800	That was pretty pathetic.
5877800	5878800	Write my act.
5878800	5879800	Literally?
5879800	5880800	Yeah.
5880800	5881800	In public.
5881800	5882800	Okay.
5882800	5884800	And you get to be asked these questions, too.
5884800	5888800	First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
5888800	5889800	I was bored.
5889800	5890800	Okay.
5890800	5893800	Yeah, you're not bad at it.
5893800	5894800	All right.
5894800	5895800	Are you getting a PS3?
5895800	5896800	Yeah.
5896800	5897800	Okay, okay.
5897800	5905800	We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a traitor and preordered one, but right before
5905800	5906800	he clicked GameStop.
5906800	5907800	You guys actually get it?
5907800	5908800	No, we're getting a second shipment.
5908800	5909800	I don't care, because Sony sucks my butt.
5909800	5910800	Here from her.
5910800	5911800	Sony sucks.
5911800	5912800	Your obligatory question.
5912800	5913800	Can you peel potatoes correctly?
5913800	5927800	You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama,
5927800	5931800	and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.
5931800	5935800	Nintendo, please give her money.
5935800	5939800	Better living than Nintendo, I'm now the aluminum chef.
5939800	5940800	Uh-huh.
5940800	5941800	Hey, Jory.
5941800	5944800	Thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.
5944800	5946800	I go on to the next step.
5946800	5951800	Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the Wii line at Target.
5951800	5955800	And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are, or one of them at least, who's apparently
5955800	5958800	a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second.
5958800	5959800	I want to get closer to him.
5959800	5962800	They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.
5962800	5963800	I've lost five of them.
5963800	5964800	Yeah, a lot of them.
5964800	5967800	I just think that that's like old school.
5967800	5968800	Yeah.
5968800	5970800	All right, all right.
5970800	5974800	Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.
5974800	5975800	What's your name?
5975800	5976800	Jory.
5976800	5977800	Jory.
5977800	5978800	What's your name?
5978800	5979800	ratio.
5979800	5980800	Jory started laughing.
5980800	5981800	Jordan.
5981800	5982800	Okay, Jordan.
5982800	5993800	All right, can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at two in the morning?
5993800	5994800	We want the Wii.
5994800	5995800	We want the Wii.
5995800	5996800	We want the Wii.
5996800	5997800	Why do you want the Wii so badly?
5997800	5998800	Twilight Princess.
5998800	5999800	Twilight Princess.
5999800	6000800	And you?
6000800	6001800	Twilight Princess.
6001800	6002800	Twilight Princess.
6002800	6003800	That's right.
6003800	6004800	Cora!
6004800	6005800	Can I get your name?
6005800	6006800	Kristen.
6006800	6007800	Travis?
6007800	6008800	Travis.
6008800	6012800	Why are you out here?
6012800	6017800	Did you get a Wii for his brother?
6017800	6019800	He owe him money?
6019800	6021800	No, I'm just a good friend, and that's broke.
6021800	6044080	I'm going to ask you guys to get a PS3, or planning on getting a PS3?
6044080	6047080	Maybe $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.
6047080	6049080	That's the only game I will be getting today.
6049080	6050080	Now.
6050080	6051080	Now.
6051080	6052080	I'll borrow his metal gear.
6052080	6053080	Yeah, I'll borrow mine.
6053080	6054080	No.
6054080	6055080	No PS3.
6055080	6056080	No.
6056080	6057080	Yeah.
6057080	6058080	Final fantasy is 13.
6058080	6059080	To be 18 to mark.
6059080	6060080	Alright.
6060080	6061080	And here's your biggest question.
6061080	6062080	What's your favorite color?
6062080	6063080	Blue.
6063080	6064080	No.
6064080	6065080	Brown.
6065080	6066080	You fail.
6066080	6067080	You fail.
6067080	6068080	Green.
6068080	6069080	Okay, that's correct.
6069080	6070080	Blue.
6070080	6071080	No, you don't.
6071080	6072080	Fail.
6072080	6073080	Fail.
6073080	6074080	Fail.
6074080	6075080	Fail.

6077080	6078080	Fail.
6078080	6079080	Fail.
6079080	6080080	Fail.
6080080	6081080	Fail.
6081080	6082080	Fail.
6082080	6083080	Black.
6083080	6084080	Ah, that's.
6084080	6085080	Baby blue.
6085080	6086080	No.
6086080	6087080	Oh, I like you.
6087080	6088080	Alright.
6088080	6094360	Alright, I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a dark soccer fanboy
6094360	6095360	apparently.
6095360	6096360	So, I'll be there in a second.
6096360	6097360	Hello, radio listeners.
6097360	6102480	I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized
6102480	6104480	Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.
6104480	6107800	So, can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?
6107800	6110920	Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.
6110920	6111920	You're not in the chat at all?
6111920	6112920	Okay, but you are a listener?
6112920	6113920	Archive listener.
6113920	6114920	Awesome.
6114920	6118920	Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m. for a week?
6118920	6119920	Oh, wait.
6119920	6120920	The we?
6120920	6121920	I thought it was in the PHP line.
6121920	6122920	No, I'm getting a we.
6122920	6123920	Okay, why are you getting a we?
6123920	6124920	Spongebob.
6124920	6125920	Wait, wait.
6125920	6126920	I also hear Zelda's pretty good.
6126920	6127920	Zelda's.
6127920	6128920	Okay.
6128920	6129920	Well, we'll buy that.
6129920	6130920	Alright.
6130920	6131920	Are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?
6131920	6132920	I'll probably buy a PS3.
6132920	6138920	My friends get it all the way but I'm not gonna buy it myself.
6138920	6139920	Okay.
6139920	6140920	I see.
6140920	6141920	What's your favorite color?
6141920	6142920	Brown.
6142920	6143920	Brown, yeah.
6143920	6144920	No, hold on.
6144920	6145920	I put white.
6145920	6146920	Loki is displeased with you.
6146920	6147920	Loki is displeased with you.
6147920	6148920	He's a Microsoft fan.
6148920	6155920	Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.
6155920	6157480	Loki is displeased with you.
6157480	6159080	Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.
6159080	6161240	Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.
6161240	6162840	I like Microsoft.
6162840	6165040	Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?
6165040	6166760	It's amazing.
6166760	6168440	What's your favorite part?
6168440	6170680	I like Epus of the Week.
6170680	6173080	Jamie has just informed us that he came up with that.
6173080	6175160	It's funny because I always talk about the roads
6175160	6175720	of Sacramento.
6175720	6177400	I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.
6177400	6178720	So it's pretty cool.
6178720	6179760	Awesome.
6179760	6183560	Is there anything you can, any advice you'd want to give Rob,
6183560	6185880	Jamie, and Loki?
6185880	6187840	Yeah, I'd love to go snowboarding.
6187840	6190640	Yeah, I'd go snowboarding more often.
6190640	6193760	More snowboarding inside the gaming news.
6193760	6194720	I see.
6194720	6199800	Can I give you a hint of another thing to mention to them?
6199800	6202720	To any of you guys, I would mention more lesbians
6202720	6203200	on the show.
6203200	6206040	Oh, yeah, I'd love to do it now.
6206040	6206960	Aw.
6206960	6208200	All right, we have to move on.
6208200	6210680	I've got another group of people to answer that.
6210680	6213680	More lesbians.
6213680	6214520	Aw, that didn't work.
6214520	6215720	OK.
6215720	6217400	All right, I'll move on to the next group.
6217400	6218080	Thank you, guys.
6218080	6219480	Hello, Orange Land listeners.
6219480	6222400	I am at the front of the line.
6222400	6226520	Somebody just yelled something.
6226520	6227360	That was interesting.
6227360	6229560	Anyway, I am at the front of the line
6229560	6231160	with some people playing monoculars.
6231160	6233680	And I actually haven't gotten an OK to interview all of them,
6233680	6234560	but let's start.
6234560	6236200	Can I interview her?
6236200	6236720	OK.
6236720	6237680	Can I get your name?
6237680	6238680	I'm Nick.
6238680	6240520	Nick, I got some logo t-shirts.
6240520	6242560	Rod.
6242560	6244640	Barnsworth.
6244640	6245840	Hey, Eric.
6245840	6246400	Katie.
6246400	6247360	Katie.
6247360	6248640	I like to go by Eepus.
6248640	6249640	Eepus?
6249640	6250400	Gotcha.
6250400	6254840	Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you
6254840	6259200	to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?
6259200	6261400	We just needed a cool place to play Monopoly.
6261400	6262880	Oh.
6262880	6264440	No, seriously.
6264440	6267360	What's the Wii worth waiting for?
6267360	6270760	Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.
6270760	6272480	I mean, that's all we're really doing.
6272480	6273880	We had nothing else better to do.
6273880	6277280	Just hanging out with friends, playing games,
6277280	6279240	and we really want the Wii, I guess.
6279240	6281120	Why do you really want the Wii?
6281120	6283840	Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.
6283840	6285800	Nothing better to do next weekend.
6285800	6287440	That works.
6287440	6288520	I want to fit in.
6288520	6290360	I want to be in the in crowd.
6290360	6292040	You're not cool unless you have a Wii.
6292040	6292720	Exactly.
6292720	6293240	OK.
6293240	6296920	That's going to be so much fun out of you, Barrett.
6296920	6298040	Do you want to come back?
6298040	6298520	Yeah.
6298520	6299280	OK.
6299280	6301600	I heard it actually increases sexual performance.
6301600	6304440	Yeah.
6304440	6308960	With the wrist movements.
6308960	6310760	No, with the wrist movements.
6310760	6314880	The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.
6317600	6319360	I think that's the most interesting answer
6319360	6320800	I've gotten yet.
6320800	6323440	I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way
6323440	6325760	of innovating the game system.
6325760	6328080	And that's the most intelligent one at the table.
6328080	6330560	OK.
6330560	6331840	All right.
6331840	6333840	Can I ask you guys, is he getting a PS3 at all?
6333840	6335520	Or what do you think about it?
6335520	6339720	If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay $600 on it.
6339720	6341280	The one that goes down in price.
6341280	6342120	Hang on, I'm moving.
6342120	6344440	You mean the piece of shit three that already have glitches?
6344440	6345200	Yeah, pretty much.
6345200	6346880	Oh, whoa.
6346880	6348200	That's what you better bring in.
6348200	6351960	Yeah, I'll be getting one.
6351960	6354600	Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's
6354600	6358120	going to glitch, and $600 for something
6358120	6360360	that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once
6360360	6360840	in a while?
6360840	6361560	Yeah, I don't know.
6361560	6364800	Yeah, that's like getting a hooker downtown
6364800	6368040	than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.
6368040	6368960	OK, I like this table.
6368960	6370280	These people are interesting.
6370280	6372280	OK, you guys get an obligatory question.
6372280	6373400	What's your favorite color?
6373400	6374280	Clear.
6374280	6375680	Fail.
6375680	6376720	Blonde.
6376720	6379360	I'll accept that.
6379360	6381000	Corn yellow.
6381000	6383520	Interesting, I accept.
6383520	6385240	Damn it, you stole mine.
6385240	6386000	Fail.
6386000	6387600	I'll pick.
6387600	6388880	I like pink, OK.
6388880	6392080	Light purple.
6392080	6393200	OK, I'll accept that.
6393200	6396640	All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.
6396640	6398240	Well, thank you guys for being with me.
6398240	6399240	Good luck.
6399240	6400640	All right, that was our last one.
6400640	6402880	They are at the front of the line.
6402880	6406120	And I'll call one more time to tell you
6406120	6409120	how I feel about all this, if anyone really gives a shit.
6409120	6410280	So, all right, thanks.
6410280	6412480	Hello, Orange Toys R' Us, and this is the last one.
6412480	6415840	I'll be making these, because I bet you're just sick of them,
6415840	6416840	and sick of me.
6416840	6419600	But you get one more little tidbit,
6419600	6424360	and that is from Moi, your tokenar lesbian at the show.
6424360	6427760	I'm actually out here because a bunch of people
6427760	6430000	are waiting out in line.
6430000	6432600	And they look cold, and they do not
6432600	6436760	look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.
6436760	6440320	So Jamie and I actually offered to get them a coffee
6440320	6443000	and donuts, and that's pretty much why I'm out here,
6443000	6445240	is because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.
6445240	6446400	That's the only reason.
6446400	6449880	And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too, so whatever.
6449880	6452480	I actually never played Zelda before.
6452480	6455760	I never got to, because my daddy did not let me.
6455760	6457160	I was a deprived child.
6457160	6461120	So anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.
6461120	6462240	Disney Punk.
6462240	6467000	And this is in front of Target, reporting for the Wii line.
6467000	6468440	And just to let you know, there's
6468440	6470240	a Best Buy right across the way.
6470240	6472280	And that line's like 10 times the longer.
6472280	6476440	And that amuses me.
6476440	6478640	But this line's cooler, because they're getting coffee
6478640	6481560	and donuts soon.
6481560	6486880	All right, have fun out there in the ethernet.
6486880	6488360	All right, thank you, Chris.
6488360	6490680	I know some of the folks in the chat room were like,
6490680	6491880	oh, this is long.
6491880	6492480	This is long.
6492480	6493920	You guys are talking to too damn many people.
6493920	6494560	I am so sorry.
6494560	6496640	Don't be sorry, because you know what?
6496640	6498400	Usagi hit the air.
6498400	6499800	Usagi, I say Usagi.
6499800	6502200	Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to help.
6502200	6505600	But no, she's right on here, because the quote here
6505600	6508240	is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all
6508240	6510040	about, the best people on Earth.
6510040	6512040	And that's exactly it.
6512040	6513600	That's what made last night so fun,
6513600	6515120	was just meeting other nerds.
6515120	6516480	It was really amazing.
6516480	6517640	They were so nice.
6517640	6520640	And they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.
6520640	6523160	And it was really important to interview.
6523160	6525760	There weren't that many people in line, considering.
6525760	6527400	And it's like, well, there's not that many people.
6527400	6529700	We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on.
6529700	6531080	And Rob can edit it later.
6531080	6533000	But it was just really fun meeting all of them.
6533000	6533880	They all said thanks.
6533880	6536600	And they all asked, so when is it going to be played?
6536600	6538280	It was like, I think some of them are in here now.
6538280	6539400	I saw Ace Ender earlier.
6539400	6539920	Oh, he's back.
6539920	6542060	So that must have been that whole net split thing came back.
6542060	6543720	And some of those other people said, do you got some votes?
6543720	6544200	Oh, hi.
6544200	6547280	I have to say, too, the group that
6547280	6550320	let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.
6550320	6551720	You guys were infinitely awesome.
6551720	6552480	Thank you so much.
6552480	6555880	Sources of amusement and kept me from passing out.
6555880	6557440	The entire night, the people just
6557440	6559200	that were right next to us and right behind us,
6559200	6561040	they just were so nice.
6561040	6563840	Somebody kept walking up and down, just talking to us.
6563840	6564920	Everybody was so nice.
6564920	6566440	It was like one big block party.
6566440	6567880	It was really cold.
6567880	6571440	It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.
6571440	6572280	Yeah, it was so fun.
6572280	6574400	I was hearing the single best commentary
6574400	6576320	coming from that game of Risk.
6576320	6577320	That was the best.
6577320	6580880	Yeah, every now and then you'd hear that collective, oh!
6580880	6585480	And every so often, I would ask, who took over the world yet?
6585480	6588520	I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday.
6588520	6589320	Oh, man.
6589320	6592320	I just took Australia, motherfucker.
6592320	6595720	The BTF, mate.
6595720	6596680	All right.
6596680	6598520	Now, of course, the chat room is asking.
6598520	6600240	We're running a little long this segment,
6600240	6603200	but the chat room is asking, when do we get to win the damn
6603200	6604160	Wii?
6604160	6605000	All right.
6605000	6606400	Shut up.
6606400	6607880	This just in.
6607880	6610280	We're changing it up on you.
6610280	6612120	Having the net split earlier in the show
6612120	6614300	made us realize that maybe the chat room isn't
6614300	6615680	the best process.
6615680	6617600	So we are going to change it just a little bit.
6617600	6619240	We can do that because, you know what?
6619240	6621760	It's DMN's Wii, and he's giving it away out
6621760	6623040	of the goodness of his heart.
6623040	6624920	This was not something that was given to him.
6624920	6627800	This was not something that he bought this with his own money,
6627800	6629800	and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?
6629800	6630200	Yes.
6630200	6631840	Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners,
6631840	6632620	something like that.
6632620	6634120	So we can do whatever rules we want.
6634120	6636240	So here's the new rules.
6636240	6637640	It's easy, and it's still fair.
6637640	6638600	There's the AP and it's wins.
6638600	6639100	Go.
6639100	6639600	No, no, no.
6639600	6640400	No, I'm just kidding.
6640400	6641280	So here it is.
6641280	6643720	Now, instead of sending me a private message in chat,
6643720	6645020	here's what you're going to do.
6645020	6648040	Remember, this only applies to folks listening live
6648040	6648960	Sunday night.
6648960	6651240	This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast
6651240	6651800	on all games.
6651800	6654400	This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes
6654400	6658120	or whatever program you use to download our audio archive
6658120	6659000	later on.
6659000	6659640	OK, here it is.
6659640	6661280	If you're listening Sunday night and you
6661280	6663280	want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.
6663280	6665780	Send an email, one email.
6665780	6668680	If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.
6668680	6671320	If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP.
6671320	6673940	You will be disqualified, and you don't have much time
6673940	6674760	to pull any tricks.
6674760	6675520	So here it is.
6675520	6682280	Send one email to wiicontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T,
6682280	6687200	at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone
6687200	6689840	number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you
6689840	6692600	on air, or a Skype name will do as well.
6692600	6696120	And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in,
6696120	6698120	and we'll be drawing a very random one
6698120	6701520	when we kick off part B. All right?
6701520	6703680	Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast,
6703680	6705480	you're going to have to wait a day.
6705480	6706720	All right.
6706720	6708080	Sucks for you.
6708080	6711080	All right, so we will be back soon
6711080	6714040	to determine the winner of the Wii contest.
6714040	6716040	And for those of you who got, yep, you do it now.
6716040	6718800	Right now, we're going to have like five minutes
6718800	6719600	to get it in there.
6719600	6720120	Go, hurry.
6720120	6722000	What the hell are you doing listening to us?
6722000	6724000	Open up your email and freaking email us.
