Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream

00:04.760 --> 00:05.760
twice weekly.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.240
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links

00:12.240 --> 00:15.480
to websites with listings of past episodes.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.520
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
of 2006.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.320
And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air, because

00:31.320 --> 00:35.340
it's getting kind of cold now, so I'm a little bit more calmed down, I'm not quite as hyper

00:35.340 --> 00:37.160
as I was during the first segment.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.160
I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.980
But then again at the same time I don't apologize, because that's me.

00:43.980 --> 00:44.980
Take it or leave it.

00:44.980 --> 00:48.600
If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe

00:48.600 --> 00:49.600
to.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.920
And if you don't like what Dark Sakura has to say, mute your podcast now, because here

00:52.920 --> 00:55.360
she goes with another story.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.040
I'm just teasing.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.760
Well we do have a little bit more news regarding the Playstation 3.

01:01.760 --> 01:05.840
They're going to have a universal login.

01:05.840 --> 01:10.160
You'll basically be using the same online ID for every of the online games that you're

01:10.160 --> 01:13.680
going to play.

01:13.680 --> 01:20.360
It's actually going to be not just for the titles that use your, the central buddy list

01:20.360 --> 01:27.560
and the messaging system, it's going to go for all titles.

01:27.560 --> 01:35.240
Basically it's, I suppose to make it easier, more user friendly, so that you don't have

01:35.240 --> 01:40.920
login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.

01:40.920 --> 01:41.920
It's all on there.

01:41.920 --> 01:47.400
But they were basically saying that, they were actually saying that specific to resistance

01:47.400 --> 01:51.280
game coming out that is going to be using the same login.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.040
I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot

01:56.040 --> 02:01.040
about Playstation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind, I don't want

02:01.040 --> 02:06.000
to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, but, because I'm a fanboy of all three, but

02:06.000 --> 02:10.120
I don't, Microsoft seriously has online down.

02:10.120 --> 02:14.480
They're doing it the best and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne

02:14.480 --> 02:16.680
from them this time around.

02:16.680 --> 02:20.800
So I don't know, it gets very little that we know about Sony's Playstation 3 and the

02:20.800 --> 02:22.200
online stuff.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.080
What I've seen so far though still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior

02:26.080 --> 02:27.720
online.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.880
As it was last generation, but I would have thought that this generation, the other two

02:31.880 --> 02:35.620
would have been, but Nintendo's really had to play catch up and I think their friend

02:35.620 --> 02:38.560
code thing kind of hurts them a little bit, I don't know.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.860
The friend code thing in that respect though I think sort of protects.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.440
I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer it doesn't make it any easier, you know.

02:46.440 --> 02:51.440
But then again on Live you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
are your friends.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.440
Right.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.240
And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although

02:56.240 --> 03:00.760
I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's

03:00.760 --> 03:05.080
probably like Super Smash Brothers Trophy Room or like a lot of Nintendo games do is

03:05.080 --> 03:10.160
that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Yay, crap!

03:11.160 --> 03:13.160
I love crap!

03:13.160 --> 03:19.680
Anyway, here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my Playstation 3 when I

03:19.680 --> 03:21.400
finally get one.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.820
There's going to be, oh I'm sorry, well we heard about the converter, right?

03:25.820 --> 03:31.640
You have to convert your old school memory card into what, the USB so that you can save

03:31.640 --> 03:33.960
things on the hard drive itself.

03:33.960 --> 03:39.000
Well, when you're actually playing the Playstation 2 or PS1 games on the Playstation 3, you actually

03:39.000 --> 03:42.560
create an internal memory card on the system.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.480
There's something you create in the cross media bar and there's a memory card utility

03:46.480 --> 03:51.480
and then you can actually create a Playstation 1 card and a Playstation 2 card, name them

03:51.480 --> 03:54.280
and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.160
So it's like you're doing like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.000
So that's how it's going to work on the Playstation 3 if you were curious.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.280
And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.280
Makes sense.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.280
That's pretty cool.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.840
I didn't load my virtual hack to run games on the hard drive.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.920
I don't know, but the internal memory card, well they'll just do some firmware update

04:15.920 --> 04:17.440
if you try that crap.

04:17.440 --> 04:22.000
The internal memory cards will have the same storage space as your typical memory cards,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.160
15 blocks on the PS1, 8 megs on the PS2.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.280
You can create as many of these cards as you want though until you run out of hard drive

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
space.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.280
You can just swap them in and out.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
Hmm.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.280
Interesting.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.580
Well, some other interesting things of course are going to be the next big games coming

04:36.580 --> 04:38.240
out for the Playstation 3.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.160
The ones I'm like, you know, waiting for.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.720
For example, Motorstorm, Lair, and Heavenly Sword.

04:43.720 --> 04:49.180
Well, for example, Motorstorm, which is supposed to be a launch title, is now actually February

04:49.180 --> 04:50.760
2007.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.440
Lair, which is also supposed to be a launch title and delayed.

04:55.440 --> 04:59.800
I believe that one ended up for March 2007 release.

04:59.800 --> 05:06.240
And then of course Heavenly Sword, which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways,

05:06.240 --> 05:11.880
is slated for a 2007 release also in March.

05:11.880 --> 05:17.880
And of course their flagship title, Warhawk, is in the summer now, so that's kind of interesting.

05:17.880 --> 05:24.000
But basically another reason why maybe waiting for Playstation 3 is a good idea because some

05:24.000 --> 05:28.060
of the bigger games are coming out later on.

05:28.060 --> 05:32.360
I'm reading our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.720
Well over 50 people there tonight, thank you guys so much for joining us.

05:35.720 --> 05:42.800
Let's see, I'm looking at, who said this here, ShadowNextGen said ExciteTruck does have achievements.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.040
It may or may not, I mean, yes we've heard it does, I'm not disputing that part, but

05:47.040 --> 05:49.040
we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.920
Like you know, the cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements

05:52.920 --> 05:57.580
my friends have and I can see what their score is, and then these other like fan-created

05:57.580 --> 06:02.560
things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like mygamercard.net, which is a very

06:02.560 --> 06:08.300
cool site, which by the way, we have the OL Army, what do we call it, the OL Army E-Penis

06:08.300 --> 06:11.600
Leaderboard or something like that, where it's tracking all our gamer scores and you're

06:11.600 --> 06:14.900
on there and you're on there and I'm on there, and if you want to join, check out our forums

06:14.900 --> 06:20.640
and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer

06:20.640 --> 06:25.520
Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund, but will the Wii have

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
anything like that?

06:26.520 --> 06:30.000
I don't think so because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.680
Now that's not going to break the system, it's just kind of surprising that they didn't

06:34.680 --> 06:39.560
embrace the online in that way, because I think not being online kind of killed them

06:39.560 --> 06:46.160
last round, but that's just my opinion I suppose, what do I know, I'm just some guy on the internet.

06:46.160 --> 06:54.160
Well back to different PS3 news, and actually a few people have already told me their experiences

06:54.160 --> 07:00.320
with this, you can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk, the game's available

07:00.320 --> 07:07.200
on Motorstorm and NBA 07, but according to one of our listeners, it crashed I think every

07:07.200 --> 07:14.280
what, five minutes, I believe that it was JV Mon mentioned it.

07:14.280 --> 07:18.600
What was it overheating or what was it doing?

07:18.600 --> 07:26.120
Oh, at Best Buy, sorry, it was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes,

07:26.120 --> 07:27.920
but there's the playable kiosks.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.640
Well that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show too, but I guess it was a different environment.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
I'm not surprised.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.040
Interesting, well as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care

07:38.040 --> 07:39.040
about.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.480
Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently

07:41.480 --> 07:43.520
the only way it was staying on.

07:43.520 --> 07:49.520
Anyways, of course like most anything else that's being released nowadays, right as it

07:49.520 --> 07:54.400
comes out, it's going to be upgraded, and of course that's the same with the PlayStation

07:54.400 --> 08:01.640
3, you will be getting a firmware update on launch day, and it will basically allow you

08:01.640 --> 08:11.480
to utilize the PlayStation Network functions, so not a big surprise, but they're doing the

08:11.480 --> 08:16.280
same thing with the Wii when that comes out there, you have to do a firmware update as

08:16.280 --> 08:19.200
well for that.

08:19.200 --> 08:25.260
But I don't know, I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early

08:25.260 --> 08:30.180
and be able to get them manufactured, and if that means adding a firmware update later

08:30.180 --> 08:35.720
on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so

08:35.720 --> 08:36.720
be it.

08:36.720 --> 08:47.040
If they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting 2 PS3s instead of 400,000.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.460
What I think is interesting, something I was talking about during the break, is that one

08:50.460 --> 08:56.240
game I wanted was NBA Live 07 for the PlayStation 3, yes there was a sports title I actually

08:56.240 --> 09:02.180
wanted, well guess what, I'm not going to be able to get it, because EA cancelled it.

09:02.180 --> 09:06.920
They're saying in a statement, quote, we are concentrating our efforts on creating a spectacular

09:06.920 --> 09:13.880
NBA Street home court instead of porting NBA Live 07, and home court will be coming to

09:13.880 --> 09:16.840
the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.

09:16.840 --> 09:23.240
All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live

09:23.240 --> 09:24.240
08.

09:24.240 --> 09:34.520
Home court, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February,

09:34.520 --> 09:41.640
so it shouldn't be too bad.

09:41.640 --> 09:51.520
There was also a lot of other PlayStation 3 delays coming out, pretty much with everything,

09:51.520 --> 09:55.760
as we mentioned earlier we were talking about Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that, so

09:55.760 --> 10:04.520
it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff is being delayed.

10:04.520 --> 10:12.160
But anyways, I gotta note, was it home court January or February for next year I believe,

10:12.160 --> 10:15.400
so that's when we can look forward to that.

10:15.400 --> 10:23.240
Well as for other PS3 related news, and this makes me very, very, very sad.

10:23.240 --> 10:32.840
Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3, in fact in a quote released by IGN, they said

10:32.840 --> 10:37.560
they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3,

10:37.560 --> 10:41.440
unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case when you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're

10:41.440 --> 10:44.860
prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.

10:44.860 --> 10:50.600
They're basically saying that since the controller doesn't have the button, you can't actually

10:50.600 --> 10:57.040
activate it, and you can't swap out the controller to change it in, because you'll need to turn

10:57.040 --> 11:01.300
on the analog, and of course the SG doesn't have analog.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.720
So in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will

11:04.720 --> 11:06.600
not be working on the PlayStation 3.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.480
There is no physical way to make it work.

11:09.480 --> 11:15.880
So would that go the same with say, DDR, BeatMania, anything that uses an additional controller?

11:15.880 --> 11:19.880
Well it's interesting because I have a last minute update here, Bamani Style just posted

11:19.880 --> 11:23.380
a story this evening, because you know the PS3 is out in Japan now, and they're trying

11:23.380 --> 11:29.400
some backwards compatibility there, and they're saying Pop'n Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody

11:29.400 --> 11:34.000
have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds, Pop'n Music Disney has timing issues with

11:34.000 --> 11:40.860
the background music, Pop'n Music 2 is missing some images, and let's see, BeatMania Best

11:40.860 --> 11:46.000
Hits has timing issues, 6Mix and Core has background music, as well as BeatMania The

11:46.000 --> 11:49.880
Sounds of Tokyo, the timings off in Gotta Mix, some of the graphics don't appear in

11:49.880 --> 11:56.700
Gotta Mix 2, and DDR Max 6Mix, the background doesn't always play correctly, which of course

11:56.700 --> 12:00.920
is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time incorrectly, so it pretty

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
much makes the game unplayable.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.280
Are you talking about the background videos though?

12:04.280 --> 12:09.200
No, background music doesn't always play correctly, which is kind of something you need.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.560
Now in BeatMania 2DX 3rd Style and 6th Style, some of the graphics are altered, they're

12:13.560 --> 12:18.200
just not showing up correctly, but I guess the games are still playable, so that's interesting

12:18.200 --> 12:22.660
though because we're just looking at one genre of games, and that's already, that's a huge

12:22.660 --> 12:28.560
list of issues for one very narrow genre of games, so now granted a lot of these, especially

12:28.560 --> 12:32.760
the pop and music titles, a lot of those are PS1 and very old, the BeatMania titles as

12:32.760 --> 12:36.000
well, but still, is that 100% compatibility?

12:36.000 --> 12:42.240
No, and I believe they're talking about 99.9% compatible games, and that's a pretty huge

12:42.240 --> 12:47.120
chunk out of the games right there, and they're saying that those are not compatible, oops,

12:47.120 --> 12:52.160
I guess we forgot to play all the music games, darn, I guess those aren't big name stuff.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.720
This is going to sound really random, but in Phantasy Star Universe, I was laughing

12:56.720 --> 13:03.720
tonight because a character joined my party, and his name was Kootaragi, and I don't think

13:03.720 --> 13:08.960
it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kootaragi, so it's funny because

13:08.960 --> 13:13.120
somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kootaragi's on fire, Kootaragi's on fire,

13:13.120 --> 13:19.680
it was funny to me in that moment.

13:19.680 --> 13:24.280
He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons, but he was on fire, running around

13:24.280 --> 13:25.320
on fire.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.600
So now we have him eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym,

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
and on fire.

13:30.600 --> 13:35.840
Well, someone who thinks Kootaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell, you

13:35.840 --> 13:40.680
might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari, he's the

13:40.680 --> 13:46.120
granddaddy of Pong, he said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in

13:46.120 --> 13:47.120
the foot.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.000
There is a high probability they will fail.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.080
The price point is probably unsustainable.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.200
For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer

13:55.200 --> 13:56.200
standpoint.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.320
They could get away with their arrogance and capriciousness because they had an installed

14:00.320 --> 14:01.320
base.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.360
They have also historically had horrible software tools.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.000
You can compare that to the Xbox 360 with really great authoring tools and additional

14:08.000 --> 14:09.680
revenue streams from Xbox Live.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.640
A first party developer would be an idiot to develop for Sony first and not the 360.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.680
People don't buy hardware, they buy software.

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
P.S.

14:17.680 --> 14:19.800
I'm a big Microsoft fanboy.

14:19.800 --> 14:23.640
Just kidding about the P.S. part, but that's almost what it sounds like there in that little

14:23.640 --> 14:24.640
statement.

14:24.640 --> 14:29.200
Some interesting comments there from one of the granddaddies of gaming.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.520
You know, I saw an interesting comparison on one of the blogs today that talked about

14:33.520 --> 14:39.540
how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast, and everybody said Dreamcast

14:39.540 --> 14:47.120
has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than P.S. 2 can, Dreamcast can

14:47.120 --> 14:52.280
do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed, so people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got

14:52.280 --> 14:57.880
the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online, will history repeat itself?

14:57.880 --> 15:00.160
We have to listen to him because he bought us Pizza Time Theater.

15:00.160 --> 15:04.160
I have to say there's a big difference here, though, something that wasn't considered in

15:04.160 --> 15:05.160
the article.

15:05.160 --> 15:11.120
Dreamcast didn't play DVDs, and at that time DVDs were just breaking, and I think, you

15:11.120 --> 15:16.040
know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray, and

15:16.040 --> 15:18.200
Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.760
I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.

15:20.760 --> 15:25.800
I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD, DVD was already somewhat established

15:25.800 --> 15:27.540
and everybody knew it was the next.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.240
This time you have a split.

15:29.240 --> 15:32.640
People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going

15:32.640 --> 15:33.640
to be the winner.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.240
You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you're going to get a Blu-ray?

15:37.240 --> 15:38.240
They go, what's that?

15:38.240 --> 15:40.040
You're going to get an HD DVD?

15:40.040 --> 15:41.040
What?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.040
I have a DVD player.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
What?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.040
I have an HDTV.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.760
No, you're going to get an HD DVD.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.760
What?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.920
Well, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
Exactly.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.320
If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.

15:55.320 --> 16:00.680
Anyways, other interesting things about, also we were talking about the backwards compatibility

16:00.680 --> 16:03.000
on games and how it's not working.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.580
Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not very, you know, a huge surprise, but Japanese

16:08.580 --> 16:12.880
PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.

16:12.880 --> 16:19.320
Because the games are region coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation

16:19.320 --> 16:27.440
1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions, but that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.

16:27.440 --> 16:33.280
I just want to jump in real quick here and notice that, or note that Travis, who hosts

16:33.280 --> 16:36.600
our show here Saturday Nights on Orange Launch Radio, Travis Donovan Live, just sent me a

16:36.600 --> 16:41.640
link to a story over on IGN where they've been logging all these backward compatibility

16:41.640 --> 16:46.480
issues with PlayStation 3, Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background

16:46.480 --> 16:52.680
music correctly, Xenosaga Episode 2, the opening movie, sometimes stops, Mega Man X7, background

16:52.680 --> 16:56.660
music won't play properly sometimes, Devil May Cry, screen sometimes freezes during the

16:56.660 --> 17:02.440
title demo, Suikoden 3 can't read PlayStation 1 data during the game, Silent Hill 2, when

17:02.440 --> 17:11.280
going from title to demo, the screen may freeze, issues, that sounds like a lot of games, maybe

17:11.280 --> 17:13.800
that's what the day one firmware update's all about, who knows.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.680
Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there,

17:17.680 --> 17:18.680
so oopsie.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.680
Good point, good point.

17:21.680 --> 17:26.040
All right, well anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners

17:26.040 --> 17:29.840
think of all this console mania going on this week.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.120
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and DarkSakura puts

17:34.120 --> 17:38.000
on the rubber gloves and dives in head first into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite

17:38.000 --> 17:39.840
emails to read for you folks.

17:39.840 --> 17:40.840
Don't you DarkSakura?

17:40.840 --> 17:48.720
When I'm ready.

17:48.720 --> 18:00.520
The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.

18:00.520 --> 18:03.280
This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.280
I love that name.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.560
You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game

18:08.560 --> 18:11.640
by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.760
A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing and asked about pre-ordering Halo 3.

18:15.760 --> 18:21.440
The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.500
Here's where the bullshit begins.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.920
He said that the regular edition was just the game.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.600
The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.720
He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons, the assault

18:31.720 --> 18:36.480
rifle 2 and the spike shot, have the first two games on the second disc come with the

18:36.480 --> 18:42.240
making of DVD, every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc, yeah right, and

18:42.240 --> 18:44.620
have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.

18:44.620 --> 18:48.880
Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet

18:48.880 --> 18:53.280
replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie

18:53.280 --> 18:55.520
would include something like that, etc.

18:55.520 --> 18:56.520
My classmate leaves.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.400
I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, sir, I read the

18:59.400 --> 19:03.440
article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.800
He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie, so you should read it more carefully

19:06.800 --> 19:07.800
next time.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.000
Needless to say, I now go to the other GameStop in town.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.080
You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that, and when

19:14.080 --> 19:16.720
I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far, and then I got

19:16.720 --> 19:21.800
to the helmet thing, I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, you can't wear the helmet,

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
stupid.

19:22.800 --> 19:27.880
Unless his head's really tiny, maybe he has a tiny head.

19:27.880 --> 19:31.960
Well okay, this reminds me of something I wanted to talk about tonight.

19:31.960 --> 19:36.040
I now have a new favorite game store, and it's because of things like this.

19:36.040 --> 19:41.840
I am sick of going into a game store where I feel elitism coming from the people behind

19:41.840 --> 19:43.000
the counter.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.400
They don't know who I am.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.700
I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid

19:48.700 --> 19:54.040
video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies, but they assume things about me

19:54.040 --> 19:56.960
because I'm older and I play games.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.720
They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.680
I'm kind of sick of that attitude.

20:01.680 --> 20:07.800
I'm not going into game stores to get told what games I should be buying the guidebook

20:07.800 --> 20:10.160
because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.400
That only worked when Dan was a manager.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
No.

20:13.400 --> 20:14.400
Well, that's different.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.000
Because he actually does know his shit.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.280
That's different, that's different.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.000
I don't know what it's like in your town.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
This is one thing I notice.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.580
I may say that I'm shopping at this particular store, but town to town I notice it's different.

20:26.580 --> 20:30.920
It's totally different, but in this particular town I got fed up with one particular chain,

20:30.920 --> 20:34.920
and now I'm shopping at GameCrazy because I went to GameCrazy, I went to look for a

20:34.920 --> 20:39.680
particular game, and the guy treated me like I was royalty.

20:39.680 --> 20:43.720
I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
stuff.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.720
Instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I

20:46.720 --> 20:48.000
was like, okay, I can do that for you.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.520
He went and got the game, and then I was like, do you have Luminous 2?

20:51.520 --> 20:55.600
The guy was like, no, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.720
Let me make a call.

20:56.720 --> 20:57.720
He called another store.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.120
He was going to have it shipped ordered, and he was like, I won't even charge you a pre-order

21:00.120 --> 21:01.440
because the game already came out.

21:01.440 --> 21:07.000
I'm like, oh my gosh, I just got great customer service at a game store as someone who kind

21:07.000 --> 21:10.920
of met me on a peer level and just was like, hey, you're a gamer, you seem to know what

21:10.920 --> 21:13.560
you want, and didn't try to sell me all this garbage.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.400
It was awesome.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.560
That's funny you mention that because my hubby is starting at GameCrazy.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.080
And again, I don't know your town, people.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.320
I'm just talking about my town.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.920
Maybe in your local town the folks at GameCrazy are dicks and you have to go to Best Buy.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
I don't know what.

21:27.920 --> 21:33.360
I'm talking about right here, right now, I'm totally having it for GameCrazy.

21:33.360 --> 21:37.080
That's where I'm going to be doing my shopping right now because of good customer service

21:37.080 --> 21:38.360
goes so far.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.240
So if you work in a game store, because I know we have folks that work in game stores

21:41.240 --> 21:45.200
that listen to this program, don't treat your customers like dirt because you never know

21:45.200 --> 21:50.840
who you're pissing off, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.480
Can I ask which store you went to?

21:52.480 --> 21:54.320
Which one in particular?

21:54.320 --> 22:06.080
It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's the one that your hubby used

22:06.080 --> 22:08.360
to work at years ago.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.240
I think I know who the manager of that store is.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.240
I don't care anymore.

22:11.240 --> 22:12.240
It doesn't matter.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.240
It's a lost cause now.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.240
No, I mean the GameCrazy.

22:14.240 --> 22:19.280
Oh, oh, oh, no, the GameCrazy I went to was in the...

22:19.280 --> 22:20.280
Okay.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.280
Sorry.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.280
Sorry.

22:22.280 --> 22:27.760
It's because I actually know about four managers of GameCrazies too.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.760
Well, that's a nice guy.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.960
Well, my experience with...

22:31.960 --> 22:33.840
SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.840
He was not hitting on me, you jackass.

22:35.840 --> 22:42.880
My experience with the GameStops, usually it's retardation, talking to people, or they'll

22:42.880 --> 22:45.000
try to carry on small talk.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.560
So what games are you playing right now?

22:46.560 --> 22:49.400
I'm like, I don't want to talk to you, I just want to buy this game.

22:49.400 --> 22:55.840
Or they're trying to sell me Splinter Cell Double Agent on the Wii, I'm like, no, I don't

22:55.840 --> 22:57.960
want that game at all.

22:57.960 --> 22:58.960
I always used to hate...

22:58.960 --> 23:01.960
I would go in there and I'd buy something like Prey, and then they go, do you want to

23:01.960 --> 23:02.960
pre-order Halo 3?

23:02.960 --> 23:05.720
I'm like, if I want to pre-order Halo 3, I would have asked.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.480
Okay, Jamie's pointing at the mailbag going, more emails.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
Okay, sorry.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.480
All right.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.680
Well, the next one comes from Jason says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying

23:14.680 --> 23:17.840
to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.

23:17.840 --> 23:22.360
A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI

23:22.360 --> 23:25.800
connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against

23:25.800 --> 23:27.240
the Xbox in general.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.140
So can you tell me if this is true?

23:30.140 --> 23:34.160
Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?

23:34.160 --> 23:37.760
Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show, I never miss it.

23:37.760 --> 23:38.760
Doesn't matter.

23:38.760 --> 23:43.000
You can do 1080p either with component or with the VGA cable.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.440
The only thing the HDMI is for is because later on when they digitally sign everything,

23:49.440 --> 23:54.640
way later on once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital

23:54.640 --> 24:03.120
broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.

24:03.120 --> 24:06.700
Doesn't HDMI though give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your

24:06.700 --> 24:07.700
regular eyes?

24:07.700 --> 24:19.760
HDMI is basically based on DVI, which is enhanced more over DVI because DVI is just video.

24:19.760 --> 24:25.960
HDMI actually carries a digital video and audio signal on it, but you can get DVI to

24:25.960 --> 24:30.040
HDMI adapters and stuff like that.

24:30.040 --> 24:34.160
In a way you can be able to do it and maybe later on down the line that might be an issue,

24:34.160 --> 24:37.280
but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line they're going to release

24:37.280 --> 24:41.040
some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.600
Who is the emailer that just sent that in?

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
What was their name?

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
Jason.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
Jason.

24:45.600 --> 24:51.280
Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here

24:51.280 --> 24:55.240
and bring your friend into the room and we're going to give a special message to your friend

24:55.240 --> 24:56.240
right here.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.240
Okay, so stop right here.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.240
All right.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.240
Hi, Jason's friend.

24:59.240 --> 25:03.040
This is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you you're wrong.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.320
Hugs and kisses.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.880
We love you.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.080
I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments and I wanted

25:10.080 --> 25:13.320
to read them.

25:13.320 --> 25:18.280
Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.960
Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their

25:20.960 --> 25:21.960
jobs.

25:21.960 --> 25:23.400
No, I just don't want to carry out a stupid conversation with them.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.000
I hate talking to people.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
That's a whole different story.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.640
I will pretend to be better than them.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
That's true.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.640
Loki's just an asshole is what it is.

25:29.640 --> 25:30.640
No, I'm not.

25:30.640 --> 25:31.640
He thinks he's better than you.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.640
He's just a dick.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.280
I'm not an asshole and I do get annoyed when they're giving them wrong information, but

25:35.280 --> 25:39.240
I don't try to correct them because that is annoying.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.200
All I do is I don't want Splinter Cell and they understand that.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.640
They're just trying to upsell and that's fine.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.240
That's what they're supposed to do, but obviously I don't like that and I have to do that at

25:50.240 --> 25:51.800
my work, so I understand.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.640
One more comment, I promise, Jamie, but this is from Brad from Pod Culture and he's cool.

25:55.640 --> 25:56.640
I like Brad.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.640
We got a comment from him.

25:57.640 --> 26:02.200
He was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Fantasy Star Universe.

26:02.200 --> 26:05.800
They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.520
He's 36, he admits.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.760
Their first comment was, this is for your kid?

26:10.760 --> 26:14.400
Dot, dot, dot.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.800
They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee

26:17.800 --> 26:18.800
content in it.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.080
Apparently, you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I got to sell it on eBay.

26:23.080 --> 26:24.320
You know what happens when you assume.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.560
You make an ass out of you and me.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.320
This next email comes from The Afro Guy.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
Hey, O.L.R.

26:30.320 --> 26:34.200
I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled

26:34.200 --> 26:37.480
to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.760
My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.640
Canis Canim ate it because I think he's emailing from overseas.

26:44.640 --> 26:49.280
He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really

26:49.280 --> 26:51.460
does feel like a living, breathing school.

26:51.460 --> 26:55.440
Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for

26:55.440 --> 26:57.320
hours on Grand Theft Auto.

26:57.320 --> 27:01.400
The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried

27:01.400 --> 27:04.200
that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.440
I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw

27:07.440 --> 27:09.080
him on the ground, and spit on him.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.200
His reaction was, oh, never done that before.

27:11.200 --> 27:16.320
However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.

27:16.320 --> 27:21.160
What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.960
And that was in quotes, by the way.

27:22.960 --> 27:27.720
Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly

27:27.720 --> 27:29.040
a shock to our parents.

27:29.040 --> 27:32.840
My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of

27:32.840 --> 27:34.800
harmless teasing.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.200
And there's a footnote on here.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.480
I love emails with footnotes.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.200
So if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap

27:41.200 --> 27:46.240
him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.

27:46.240 --> 27:52.340
To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame and soon it will be on its way

27:52.340 --> 27:54.400
to a pre-owned rack in-game.

27:54.400 --> 27:58.020
Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously

27:58.020 --> 28:01.940
played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place

28:01.940 --> 28:05.720
in his school and those acting violently are around his age.

28:05.720 --> 28:11.360
Therefore Rockstar should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't

28:11.360 --> 28:13.200
interest young teenagers.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.380
I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play Bully, but

28:16.380 --> 28:20.120
perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.

28:20.120 --> 28:24.320
Thanks for the showing, keep up the good work, The Afro Guy.

28:24.320 --> 28:28.200
I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework,

28:28.200 --> 28:31.520
my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know

28:31.520 --> 28:32.520
what she was doing.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.720
She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games, so I had

28:35.720 --> 28:37.060
to do my homework.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.800
I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.

28:39.800 --> 28:44.200
If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting, and it sounds a little bit vague,

28:44.200 --> 28:49.280
sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something

28:49.280 --> 28:52.440
a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.

28:52.440 --> 28:53.760
He needs to be punished.

28:53.760 --> 29:02.740
I do have to say that if it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's

29:02.740 --> 29:06.760
very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.

29:06.760 --> 29:13.640
I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial

29:13.640 --> 29:20.640
evidence that it would be, then removing the game is smart, I think, the agreeable thing

29:20.640 --> 29:21.640
to do.

29:21.640 --> 29:27.240
I absolutely agree in some aspects with the anti-video game stuff because not all kids

29:27.240 --> 29:30.600
should be playing Bully, but that's up to a parent to decide.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.280
A parent knows their kid best, or at least a parent should know their kid better than

29:34.280 --> 29:40.680
anyone else, and it's up to the parent to decide, is this game appropriate for my child?

29:40.680 --> 29:44.760
If the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from

29:44.760 --> 29:48.220
non-fiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.660
Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.080
For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.960
It just depends on the child.

29:56.960 --> 30:03.760
I can also understand that for at least people of a like age in that game, because it's one

30:03.760 --> 30:08.360
thing for a kid, I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference

30:08.360 --> 30:13.440
in a kid playing Grand Theft Auto because technically they're not adults.

30:13.440 --> 30:20.360
It's something that they know they have no real way of doing, but a kid can go into school

30:20.360 --> 30:23.200
and basically be a bully.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.880
Flow Walk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking

30:25.880 --> 30:27.000
about, but I like this.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.720
I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.

30:29.720 --> 30:34.080
I made the kid eat grass, but his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high

30:34.080 --> 30:35.080
heel.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.080
That bitch.

30:36.080 --> 30:42.720
I've been in two fights in school, honestly.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.000
I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me, but one

30:46.000 --> 30:49.040
time there was this guy, he was the school bully.

30:49.040 --> 30:54.920
I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other

30:54.920 --> 30:59.160
kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.

30:59.160 --> 31:04.220
I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks

31:04.220 --> 31:06.520
after school once, but I just didn't go.

31:06.520 --> 31:09.700
I was like, what are they going to do?

31:09.700 --> 31:10.700
Call me names?

31:10.700 --> 31:13.440
Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.440
So I just didn't go.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.620
What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the

31:18.620 --> 31:23.240
year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.240
I can't stand that type of thing.

31:25.240 --> 31:28.480
The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and

31:28.480 --> 31:29.480
punched her in the nose.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.940
Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.

31:32.940 --> 31:33.940
Make it quick.

31:33.940 --> 31:36.480
She was, okay, her name was Myra.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.440
If you're listening, you deserved it.

31:39.440 --> 31:43.840
She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.360
I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.880
Wasn't Myra the chicken tiny toons that was like, I'm going to love him, excuse him.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.880
Oh, Myra.

31:51.880 --> 31:52.880
Oh, sorry, my bad.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.900
But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.

31:57.900 --> 32:01.120
It was my journal and a couple other books.

32:01.120 --> 32:04.000
She even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her and

32:04.000 --> 32:06.800
she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.000
But did you learn that from River City Ransom?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.560
Did I play River City Ransom then?

32:11.560 --> 32:13.000
I don't know, did you?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.040
I was busy playing Tetris.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.640
No, I have my Super Nintendo.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.720
I have my Super Nintendo.

32:19.720 --> 32:22.200
So did the games make you do it?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.840
No.

32:23.840 --> 32:28.400
I was just tired of harassing me.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.320
It sounds like it was almost like a real-life bully there for a minute.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.320
She was.

32:32.320 --> 32:33.320
Oh, my God.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.320
She was horrible to everybody.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.320
All right.

32:35.320 --> 32:39.280
If she left me alone, I didn't care what she did to anyone else.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.760
Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter because that was on the Super Nintendo.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.600
I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
There you go, Shoryuken.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
All right, next email.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
No.

32:47.600 --> 32:53.080
The last email comes from John D. He says, Hey guys, well, yes, this isn't my first email

32:53.080 --> 32:56.120
to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.680
I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting

32:59.680 --> 33:01.760
in that I was actually really good.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.760
I was playing the eight-plus star songs, which made me laugh.

33:04.760 --> 33:08.440
But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters

33:08.440 --> 33:13.480
in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?

33:13.480 --> 33:20.900
Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.

33:20.900 --> 33:24.280
With all due respect to the listener, we're glad we got a new listener and a first email.

33:24.280 --> 33:27.920
I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month, but I'm going

33:27.920 --> 33:30.560
to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.720
So welcome to the show, and I don't mean to tease you.

33:32.720 --> 33:35.360
We do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email.

33:35.360 --> 33:41.440
Okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers.

33:41.440 --> 33:45.240
The fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it

33:45.240 --> 33:46.320
does make a good fit.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.320
Don't grr at me.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.320
Cloud is already in Air Guys.

33:48.320 --> 33:51.940
I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Brothers.

33:51.940 --> 33:52.940
Other characters I'd want to see.

33:52.940 --> 33:55.040
I definitely want to see Tom Nook.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.600
I want to see Tom Nook.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.720
Tom Nook is a bastard.

33:59.720 --> 34:00.720
He'll take all my money.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.800
That'll be a special move.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
I want...

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
Oh.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
Do you have somebody?

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
Little Mac.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.800
Yeah?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.500
That'd be cool.

34:08.500 --> 34:12.440
I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rayman.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.960
Oh, interesting speculation.

34:14.960 --> 34:18.960
Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.

34:18.960 --> 34:27.440
Sonic, which Sega and the GameCube were just best buddies, so of course it makes perfect

34:27.440 --> 34:28.440
sense.

34:28.440 --> 34:35.160
And also to that listener, download some Para Para videos off of YouTube and type Para Para

34:35.160 --> 34:39.480
Girls into YouTube, or whatever it is, Para Para Deluxe or VELFER or whatever.

34:39.480 --> 34:44.680
Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Para Para Para Eyes.

34:44.680 --> 34:57.120
I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it, so that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.240
That was the last email, yes?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.560
That was the last email.

34:59.560 --> 35:02.880
Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can

35:02.880 --> 35:04.280
do that anytime you want.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.280
Just send us an email.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.680
It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.340
We look forward to hearing from you.

35:09.340 --> 35:14.400
We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.

35:14.400 --> 35:21.320
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for

35:21.320 --> 35:22.920
you guys.

35:22.920 --> 35:27.480
Last week we asked, are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3, and are you

35:27.480 --> 35:31.160
going to be camping out for any of them, or what are you going to be doing?

35:31.160 --> 35:36.520
We got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now, one of our voicemails

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
of the week here.

35:37.520 --> 35:43.040
Hey guys, it's DJ Tyron, just calling in about the voicemail of the week.

35:43.040 --> 35:46.600
Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.

35:46.600 --> 35:53.360
I pre-ordered at the electronics boutique that I work at, and I also got a gift card

35:53.360 --> 35:58.320
for Best Buy for my birthday, so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up

35:58.320 --> 36:03.960
my system and Zelda, and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points

36:03.960 --> 36:11.360
card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.

36:11.360 --> 36:19.840
And then for a quick question, I'm wondering what other launch titles I should pick up

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
besides Zelda.

36:20.840 --> 36:25.440
I was thinking possibly Metal Slug or Red Steel.

36:25.440 --> 36:30.040
Anyways, just want to hear your guys' opinion, and hope to hear from you soon.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.040
Keep up the great show, guys.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.040
Thanks.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.040
Thanks for the voicemail.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.040
What do you guys think?

36:34.040 --> 36:35.040
Other launch titles?

36:35.040 --> 36:38.520
Do not touch Metal Slug with a 10-foot pole, and the reason why I say that is because you're

36:38.520 --> 36:43.760
only encouraging SNK to release Metal Slug again and again and again and again.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.520
And to be honest, there's a lot of other games out there.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.080
Dark Soccer, Rebuttal?

36:49.080 --> 36:51.080
I like it.

36:51.080 --> 36:54.280
I love Metal Slug.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.100
Excite Truck, if you can find it.

36:56.100 --> 37:01.320
I would say Excite Truck as well, or Red Steel, or I think the sleeper hit would be Elibits

37:01.320 --> 37:04.340
is actually I think a lot better than a lot of people might be getting.

37:04.340 --> 37:07.880
If you want something right away, Rayman's Raven Rabbids.

37:07.880 --> 37:09.460
It depends what kind of games you're into.

37:09.460 --> 37:13.280
If you're into sports, maybe you ought to be checking out Madden 07.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.760
I say Red Steel all the way.

37:15.760 --> 37:22.280
All right, if you'd like to leave us a voicemail for next week, go ahead and send us a voicemail.

37:22.280 --> 37:26.000
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.720
And what we want to know from you guys is Gears of War.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.720
Today is Emergence Day after all, and I know I'm looking at my friends' list, and I see

37:32.720 --> 37:35.160
tons of freaking people playing Gears of War.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.760
What are your thoughts on Gears of War if you've been playing the game?

37:37.760 --> 37:43.360
Is it the 10 out of 10 game it's being lauded as on blogs and things around the internet?

37:43.360 --> 37:45.800
Or is it just kind of okay?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.140
Or is it maybe crappy?

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
Maybe you think it's crappy.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.000
You're in the minority of folks there.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
Send us a voicemail.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.220
We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.

37:53.220 --> 37:56.600
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.400
Otherwise, we get confused.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.120
Anyway, back to the story.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.060
The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?

38:03.060 --> 38:07.880
And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.

38:07.880 --> 38:12.000
They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Stand.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.360
And some quotes here.

38:14.360 --> 38:20.640
Oh, actually, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, originally this came via some other blog, Random Digital

38:20.640 --> 38:21.640
Musings.

38:21.640 --> 38:22.640
So sorry about that.

38:22.640 --> 38:23.720
I want to give credit where credit's due.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.000
We just saw it on Kotaku first.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
Bullet point.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.840
There's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight

38:30.840 --> 38:33.840
only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.320
So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting

38:36.320 --> 38:37.440
it.

38:37.440 --> 38:41.040
You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you,

38:41.040 --> 38:43.640
know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.

38:43.640 --> 38:48.060
I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.

38:48.060 --> 38:51.520
Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.

38:51.520 --> 38:56.360
Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a Target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring

38:56.360 --> 38:59.200
something to make your $600 less conspicuous?

38:59.200 --> 39:03.740
Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags,

39:03.740 --> 39:07.120
but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous, so maybe you want to bring something to hide

39:07.120 --> 39:11.880
it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000

39:11.880 --> 39:14.440
for that, da da da da da da.

39:14.440 --> 39:15.440
Have fun camping in the lines.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.160
We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.160
Wear deodorant.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.160
Yeah.

39:20.160 --> 39:21.160
Drunami says wear deodorant.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.720
Good idea.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.720
Bring extra.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.720
Just bring extras for others.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.720
Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.

39:26.720 --> 39:39.640
So, other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, better

39:39.640 --> 39:47.920
known for ruining E3, no, but he doesn't want video games to be called video games.

39:47.920 --> 39:52.120
He wants them to be called something better because he believes that video games are kind

39:52.120 --> 39:55.460
of getting this negative stereotype to them.

39:55.460 --> 40:01.280
So he would prefer video games to be referred to as interactive entertainment or entertainment

40:01.280 --> 40:03.280
software.

40:03.280 --> 40:04.280
I don't know.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.320
That's kind of vague to me, but who cares?

40:06.320 --> 40:07.320
They're video games.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.400
That's like saying, let's name the revolution a we.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.760
Are they games?

40:12.760 --> 40:13.880
Yes.

40:13.880 --> 40:18.760
Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?

40:18.760 --> 40:19.920
Yes.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.200
Are they then video games?

40:22.200 --> 40:24.680
I think that's not a bad title.

40:24.680 --> 40:28.200
That's there to not understand.

40:28.200 --> 40:34.160
He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products

40:34.160 --> 40:38.360
were categorized as something more serious than a game.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.880
Because entertainment is a serious business.

40:40.880 --> 40:42.280
Oh, really?

40:42.280 --> 40:46.800
Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying,

40:46.800 --> 40:52.720
how about shut the fuck up?

40:52.720 --> 40:57.840
So if we called, that's kind of retarded because if you think about it, say we called them

40:57.840 --> 41:00.560
interactive entertainment or something like that.

41:00.560 --> 41:05.360
So say for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided

41:05.360 --> 41:11.000
to call rape candy, would that make rape any better?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.280
Oh well, you know, candy's good.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.480
I like candy.

41:14.480 --> 41:18.160
Oh crap, I mean, I don't like rape.

41:18.160 --> 41:19.520
I'm confused.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.840
I like candy only when they say yes.

41:23.840 --> 41:27.400
Candy is delicious.

41:27.400 --> 41:32.520
It's just like interactive entertainment could be masturbation, right?

41:32.520 --> 41:34.680
That's something you have to interact with, right?

41:34.680 --> 41:40.080
They're basically saying the critics of video games always equate games with toys and thus

41:40.080 --> 41:45.800
with children, and so they kind of treat it badly.

41:45.800 --> 41:52.200
Here's my thing, the critics of video games a lot of times don't do their research.

41:52.200 --> 41:57.000
Just like a lot of people coming out talking about Bully hadn't played the game, didn't

41:57.000 --> 42:01.780
know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game, or claimed

42:01.780 --> 42:07.760
to have played it online despite the fact that it's impossible, I think that no matter

42:07.760 --> 42:14.540
what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people, and it doesn't

42:14.540 --> 42:19.880
matter how you dress up a turd, it's still a turd, so that's basically it.

42:19.880 --> 42:20.880
Wow.

42:20.880 --> 42:21.880
Alright.

42:21.880 --> 42:30.880
Well, you know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.840
Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?

42:33.840 --> 42:37.400
Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.

42:37.400 --> 42:44.040
A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo- Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?

42:44.040 --> 42:45.040
Candy is delicious.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.040
Anyway.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.040
Wow.

42:47.040 --> 42:49.520
We're going to get emails on this, I already know.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.880
No, okay, okay, absolutely.

42:50.880 --> 42:57.920
There is an in-joke about candy in one of my circles, so.

42:57.920 --> 43:08.560
Anyway, a 31-year-old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or

43:08.560 --> 43:15.080
Alive was basically sexually harassing her.

43:15.080 --> 43:21.080
The compensation she is looking for- Rob.

43:21.080 --> 43:30.640
Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million- Rob, what the hell?

43:30.640 --> 43:32.520
It's candy, get it?

43:32.520 --> 43:34.960
This candy is not so delicious.

43:34.960 --> 43:41.760
Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843, so that he

43:41.760 --> 43:49.640
started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.

43:49.640 --> 43:55.420
She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become- But he's basically saying

43:55.420 --> 43:58.720
that she wanted it.

43:58.720 --> 44:06.480
But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to

44:06.480 --> 44:12.120
it.

44:12.120 --> 44:15.560
Tara is sitting over in the corner going, I want candy, dude.

44:15.560 --> 44:19.440
Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
Stop laughing.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.840
I'm not laughing, it's a serious matter.

44:24.840 --> 44:34.640
Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was a sexual harassment related

44:34.640 --> 44:41.760
to the man who created DOA, I still like the bounciness, because it's completely against

44:41.760 --> 44:42.760
the laws of physics.

44:42.760 --> 44:46.080
But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.

44:46.080 --> 44:50.320
It's like, hey, babe, you want to model for my next big game?

44:50.320 --> 44:54.920
Dark Knight in our chat room says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.

44:54.920 --> 44:56.440
That's a political joke.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.960
I like that one.

44:58.960 --> 44:59.960
Har.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.200
Well, this is no joke.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.960
Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.

45:05.960 --> 45:09.120
It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.160
Maybe not quite that level.

45:11.160 --> 45:15.440
Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.

45:15.440 --> 45:19.640
There's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?

45:19.640 --> 45:25.560
There's been an ad that ran in Gears of War.

45:25.560 --> 45:31.440
There was a little ad in there and it said, check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer

45:31.440 --> 45:37.080
demo, which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace

45:37.080 --> 45:38.080
soon.

45:38.080 --> 45:39.880
Kind of cool.

45:39.880 --> 45:43.600
So for those folks that are anticipating that game, and I got to say, I played the first

45:43.600 --> 45:46.880
demo and I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
This is boring.

45:47.880 --> 45:50.600
I'm going to be honest, I wasn't into it at all.

45:50.600 --> 45:54.280
It's a pretty game and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish.

45:54.280 --> 45:58.240
No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.

45:58.240 --> 46:01.640
Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo goo gaga over that game, but Lost

46:01.640 --> 46:03.600
Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.920
It's exactly Gears of War.

46:04.920 --> 46:11.040
It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.560
A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.

46:13.560 --> 46:19.640
Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War, just like Prey is Gears

46:19.640 --> 46:20.640
of War.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.040
Except, no, that's a first person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.

46:24.040 --> 46:28.460
But like, you can't die in Prey.

46:28.460 --> 46:29.720
That's the greatest thing about Prey.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.000
Yeah, that's kind of ironic.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.080
You can't die in Prey?

46:32.080 --> 46:35.440
They can't finish Duke Nukem Forever, so it makes sense.

46:35.440 --> 46:43.480
Anyways, so on things that aren't Gears of War, Child's Play 2006 has just finally started

46:43.480 --> 46:48.600
and, of course, this is going to be the fourth annual gaming charity fundraiser that helps

46:48.600 --> 46:53.320
supply children's hospitals around the world with gaming goodness, like Gears of War, and

46:53.320 --> 47:04.060
set up basically to respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.

47:04.060 --> 47:09.160
Seeing them as almost degenerates or scum of the earth.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.600
So yeah, that's pretty cool.

47:10.600 --> 47:14.800
And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, who have been behind this for a while

47:14.800 --> 47:15.800
now.

47:15.800 --> 47:21.800
In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.520
Pretty cool and definitely a good cause.

47:24.520 --> 47:33.400
And if you want to know more information about that, visit pennyarcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.600
Do they take systems as well as financial donation?

47:35.600 --> 47:37.000
Like actual game games?

47:37.000 --> 47:38.840
I know where you're going with this.

47:38.840 --> 47:42.680
Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play

47:42.680 --> 47:46.960
the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity and maybe some money as

47:46.960 --> 47:49.040
well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.

47:49.040 --> 47:52.040
I don't know, I'm not so hot right now, but if I have some extra money, I support this

47:52.040 --> 47:53.040
charity.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.240
You'll have to check out the website.

47:54.240 --> 47:58.160
All right, I will do that right now or I'm sure someone in chat will say, oh, I already

47:58.160 --> 48:05.960
read it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

48:05.960 --> 48:14.860
Anyway, DarkSakura surfs the web up and down and back and forth every week and finds a

48:14.860 --> 48:19.380
website that she likes and she's going to share that website with you right now in her

48:19.380 --> 48:20.380
website of the week.

48:20.380 --> 48:22.280
And you know what I just realized?

48:22.280 --> 48:26.040
You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDRO Hostile.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.040
You know what this song is called?

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
Candy.

48:29.040 --> 48:37.080
Candy is delicious.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.720
My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do

48:40.720 --> 48:44.000
this one last week and I forgot the address.

48:44.000 --> 48:52.360
It's Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different

48:52.360 --> 48:58.960
basically laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass.

48:58.960 --> 49:06.280
People running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships, you can even volunteer

49:06.280 --> 49:14.360
to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org, O-R-G, a very, very, very cool site.

49:14.360 --> 49:16.480
Book market for next year.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.480
Yep.

49:17.480 --> 49:22.880
You can still also look at it regularly though for updates.

49:22.880 --> 49:26.720
You just have that in one window and game politics in the other, you're set.

49:26.720 --> 49:30.640
You're politically of sound mind.

49:30.640 --> 49:34.280
If you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your

49:34.280 --> 49:36.720
favorite gaming companies.

49:36.720 --> 49:44.000
A quote came from the ESA this week, the ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.

49:44.000 --> 49:49.220
His organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for

49:49.220 --> 49:51.760
generating a list of invitees.

49:51.760 --> 49:56.380
The point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings.

49:56.380 --> 49:59.520
That is not for the ESA to say or influence.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.120
Interesting.

50:01.120 --> 50:04.080
If you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can

50:04.080 --> 50:07.400
get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
Who knows?

50:08.400 --> 50:11.680
Are they still wanting to call them invites or is that a negative connotation towards

50:11.680 --> 50:12.680
gamers?

50:12.680 --> 50:13.680
Do they want to call them something else?

50:13.680 --> 50:16.300
I have no idea.

50:16.300 --> 50:19.080
All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.

50:19.080 --> 50:27.680
Well, you know a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.

50:27.680 --> 50:28.680
Good luck.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.680
Good luck.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.440
They don't want to talk to us bastards.

50:32.440 --> 50:35.420
But when you have that attitude, who would?

50:35.420 --> 50:42.580
So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3 that's going to be

50:42.580 --> 50:52.560
taking place in October 07 and they want you to name it because they don't have a name.

50:52.560 --> 50:55.880
So they have a contest.

50:55.880 --> 51:04.420
Basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance

51:04.420 --> 51:10.640
to name the expo and if you win, you will win a prize package including a round trip

51:10.640 --> 51:12.480
airfare for two.

51:12.480 --> 51:18.640
Hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo.

51:18.640 --> 51:22.940
Contest ends on Monday, November 20.

51:22.940 --> 51:24.080
I got a name.

51:24.080 --> 51:28.160
How about Gamer Expo?

51:28.160 --> 51:34.040
How about Big LA Game Place?

51:34.040 --> 51:35.080
How about Thingy?

51:35.080 --> 51:36.760
How about Game Pro Expo?

51:36.760 --> 51:38.960
I mean seriously, just give it a name.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.120
It doesn't have to be that snazzy.

51:41.120 --> 51:43.240
How about, hey, this is an E3.

51:43.240 --> 51:47.480
How about Boobs and Games?

51:47.480 --> 51:48.480
Anyway.

51:48.480 --> 51:56.120
Bitch, what did you say, you're not a bitch, this ain't a cutscene, press A.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.680
I should, I should, that's his tiara today.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.680
That was great.

52:00.680 --> 52:04.080
You don't have time to smoke a bowl.

52:04.080 --> 52:05.080
Anyway.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.080
Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?

52:08.080 --> 52:09.240
Huh?

52:09.240 --> 52:13.680
I, I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.

52:13.680 --> 52:17.640
We have Miklotov playing with Power Rangers toys.

52:17.640 --> 52:18.640
And a Santa hat.

52:18.640 --> 52:21.520
Is that Magic Ranger?

52:21.520 --> 52:22.520
Can we do the show, please?

52:22.520 --> 52:23.520
Can we do the show?

52:23.520 --> 52:24.520
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:24.520 --> 52:28.040
Hey, Dark Tetsuya says call it G3.

52:28.040 --> 52:32.360
Game Pro Gamers Gathering, G3, ha ha ha ha ha ha.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.360
Anyway.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.360
Failed.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.680
Hey, I'm trying to get short here.

52:36.680 --> 52:44.960
So Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal, has

52:44.960 --> 52:48.720
been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California.

52:48.720 --> 52:52.440
He bought four embezzlement and drunken driving.

52:52.440 --> 53:01.400
Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.720
Big expensive car.

53:02.720 --> 53:05.560
He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.520
I liked the Gizmondo.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.200
I liked that Johnny whatever game it was.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.200
One game.

53:11.200 --> 53:15.840
It had one stinkin' game that was kinda neat.

53:15.840 --> 53:18.000
Anyway, he, um.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.520
I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.

53:21.520 --> 53:29.080
Anyway, he, um, basically it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.

53:29.080 --> 53:35.120
So he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.

53:35.120 --> 53:39.840
So Drunami, the people behind the Engage need to go to the chair.

53:39.840 --> 53:44.000
He was trying to basically get out of going to jail, so.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.280
However, he's still in jail.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.440
He's going to be deported.

53:48.440 --> 53:52.560
They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and

53:52.560 --> 53:55.980
restitution to the banks involved.

53:55.980 --> 54:00.440
And basically, there is no more Gizmondo.

54:00.440 --> 54:03.200
Will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?

54:03.200 --> 54:04.800
I don't know.

54:04.800 --> 54:05.800
I hope not.

54:05.800 --> 54:08.240
I just think, I just think he, uh.

54:08.240 --> 54:16.200
I'm just like, I think that he deserves it.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
Engage 2?

54:17.200 --> 54:18.200
God.

54:18.200 --> 54:21.640
I'm glad that he wasn't miked for that.

54:21.640 --> 54:24.720
Engage 2 Electric Boogaloo.

54:24.720 --> 54:25.720
That's fucked.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.000
I'd buy one just for that name.

54:27.000 --> 54:33.040
Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our, uh, geekier fans is

54:33.040 --> 54:38.240
that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game that will be out with the next film, uh, June

54:38.240 --> 54:39.240
2007.

54:39.240 --> 54:45.280
It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes

54:45.280 --> 54:49.180
me very happy because I, I, I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.

54:49.180 --> 54:51.480
They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?

54:51.480 --> 54:52.480
It has Silver Surfer!

54:52.480 --> 54:53.480
Yeah, really.

54:53.480 --> 54:54.880
Which means it might have Galactus.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.080
The search for more losses.

54:57.080 --> 55:00.760
The uh, you know, I'll say that the guy that played the torch guy?

55:00.760 --> 55:03.520
He's smoking.

55:03.520 --> 55:06.840
Hey Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?

55:06.840 --> 55:09.600
You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity claws.

55:09.600 --> 55:10.720
Okay, okay, okay.

55:10.720 --> 55:14.480
Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.800
Okay, then dye her hair.

55:16.800 --> 55:22.880
Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.

55:22.880 --> 55:25.680
Just more, more human torch guy, please.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.440
Then I'll go see the movie.

55:27.440 --> 55:30.280
Thank you, yeah, thank you.

55:30.280 --> 55:35.920
And right on cue, the chat room goes, flame on Skye, flame on, ha ha ha ha.

55:35.920 --> 55:41.000
Oh my God, SSG100 Matt's winner, Galactus voiced by Penn & Teller.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.080
Oh shit.

55:44.080 --> 55:49.140
Call in right now you smartasses so I can yell at you, because our Skype line is open.

55:49.140 --> 55:52.600
If you want to call us, just head on over to orangelaunchradio.com and click on interact

55:52.600 --> 55:53.600
with us.

55:53.600 --> 55:54.640
You can call us live.

55:54.640 --> 55:59.220
The telephone number is 877-GAME-OLR.

55:59.220 --> 56:03.040
That's 877-426-3657.

56:03.040 --> 56:07.920
That toll-free number, FYI, only works toll-free in the U.S. and Canada.

56:07.920 --> 56:08.920
Let's go to the phones.

56:08.920 --> 56:11.400
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

56:11.400 --> 56:12.400
Who dis?

56:12.400 --> 56:14.680
Raven's Dolphin, it's good to hear from you.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.280
Hi, Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?

56:17.280 --> 56:18.800
Flame on, Raven's Dolphin.

56:18.800 --> 56:20.800
Yeah, flame on.

56:20.800 --> 56:25.140
There's only one thing I want to talk to you about is the Xbox 360, and you talked about

56:25.140 --> 56:26.720
it being a Dreamcast.

56:26.720 --> 56:33.160
Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast

56:33.160 --> 56:34.640
system previously.

56:34.640 --> 56:38.940
I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked

56:38.940 --> 56:41.920
all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.

56:41.920 --> 56:45.880
All right, that is our podcast listeners, no good.

56:45.880 --> 56:49.160
Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?

56:49.160 --> 56:51.160
I don't really have it on hand.

56:51.160 --> 56:53.960
I'm just going to post it in there.

56:53.960 --> 56:58.520
All right, what's in this article?

56:58.520 --> 57:06.640
What happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console

57:06.640 --> 57:07.640
out there.

57:07.640 --> 57:11.420
They didn't want to leave the market with the Saturn stink.

57:11.420 --> 57:15.200
They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.680
The Saturn stink.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.640
I like that term.

57:18.640 --> 57:22.440
I'm taking great offense to that, because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.

57:22.440 --> 57:25.920
It's just they had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well, because

57:25.920 --> 57:31.560
Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities

57:31.560 --> 57:35.320
for every employee that worked there, and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM

57:35.320 --> 57:37.000
card out here or all the good games.

57:37.000 --> 57:39.320
We're just going to leave those in Japan.

57:39.320 --> 57:41.040
That's what it said in the article.

57:41.040 --> 57:45.160
Sega stink.

57:45.160 --> 57:49.120
They were losing a lot, a lot of money on everything.

57:49.120 --> 57:52.800
The Saturn and the Dreamcast.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.680
How does this compare to Xbox 360, though?

57:54.680 --> 57:57.080
Because Microsoft's losing on the consoles?

57:57.080 --> 57:58.560
Michael Moore.

57:58.560 --> 57:59.560
What?

57:59.560 --> 58:02.800
You mean Peter Moore?

58:02.800 --> 58:05.600
Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.

58:05.600 --> 58:07.520
Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.

58:07.520 --> 58:08.960
Michael Moore does films.

58:08.960 --> 58:11.740
He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?

58:11.740 --> 58:14.600
Big guy with a beard, harasses congressmen on the street.

58:14.600 --> 58:15.600
Thank you.

58:15.600 --> 58:16.600
Peter Moore.

58:16.600 --> 58:22.320
Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference, where he

58:22.320 --> 58:27.800
came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay,

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
let's get it out of the way.

58:28.800 --> 58:30.800
Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.800
Yay!

58:31.800 --> 58:32.800
Okay.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.800
Cute.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.800
Anyway.

58:34.800 --> 58:35.800
There's other comparisons.

58:35.800 --> 58:36.800
I see.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.000
So, Peter Moore is the comparison here.

58:38.000 --> 58:43.800
Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up is

58:43.800 --> 58:49.560
Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.400
Sega did not have a lot of money.

58:51.400 --> 58:55.160
The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.

58:55.160 --> 59:00.760
Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.

59:00.760 --> 59:04.920
I'll call it Gizmondo 2.

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
Electric Boogaloo.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.200
All right, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.

59:09.200 --> 59:10.200
Have a good night, all right?

59:10.200 --> 59:11.200
You too.

59:11.200 --> 59:12.200
Bye.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.200
Later.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.200
Bye.

59:14.200 --> 59:15.200
Bye.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

59:16.200 --> 59:17.200
Who's this?

59:17.200 --> 59:18.200
Yes, it's NintendoManiac64.

59:18.200 --> 59:19.200
I haven't called in a while.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.200
Hi, NintendoManiac64.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
What's on your mind, buddy?

59:21.200 --> 59:22.200
Okay.

59:22.200 --> 59:27.800
First off, I've got to know, does my quality suck?

59:27.800 --> 59:28.800
You're okay.

59:28.800 --> 59:30.720
You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.

59:30.720 --> 59:34.200
Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.

59:34.200 --> 59:35.200
Okay.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.200
First off...

59:36.200 --> 59:41.200
I forgot what I was going to say.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.320
This is something completely different.

59:43.320 --> 59:47.080
I remember last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was

59:47.080 --> 59:50.080
kind of odd.

59:50.080 --> 59:52.120
There's one that I've been following.

59:52.120 --> 59:53.960
It's actually a fan game.

59:53.960 --> 01:00:00.200
It's basically Zelda for a cell phone, and I don't have a cell phone, and they don't

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.920
try it, even though there's a cell phone emulator.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.680
Link, I'm too lazy to go through that.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.440
This is a homebrew type game, right?

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.560
Somebody made this from scratch.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.240
I seem to remember we had an article on it a few shows ago.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.200
This was a long time ago, so you may have missed it, but yeah, I do remember we talked

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.200
about it previously.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.400
I haven't played it myself, but you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.040
mobile games, right?

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.920
I think they all are creepy.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:25.160
I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.960
Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.400
formula of Luminous.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:36.720
For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors,

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.080
and then sometimes the shapes are different.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.440
They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:44.800
It made it kind of feel a little bit refreshing and different, and for a cell phone, Java

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.640
type game, it actually wasn't bad.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:47.920
I was kind of impressed.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:51.600
Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600
I'm sorry.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.720
I'm sure Zelda on the phone will be cool too.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.960
Is it out?

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.960
When can we get it?

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.760
Well, it's actually a second demo.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:06.280
The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made a forum I hang out at, but

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.120
oddly enough to call it Zelda Fan Game Central, so just gc.com.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.120
I posted the link in chat already if you want to take a look at it.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.120
All right.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.120
Oh, you posted the link in chat.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.120
All right.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120
I'll check it out.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.120
We'll see.

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.560
Hey, tell the guy if he wants to come on the show and plug his product.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.560
We'll do that.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.560
I'm curious.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560
I would love to...

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.560
I guess I'll ask him.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:29.320
But you know the first question I'm going to ask is, why cell phone?

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.320
No, I understand.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.980
Zelda's a beloved game, and to be able to take it with you on your phone wherever you

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.560
go would be pretty cool, I got to admit.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560
Okay.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.400
Second off, Halloween was last week, and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.920
It is gaming related.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.840
Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840
No.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840
All right.

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840
What did you dress up as?

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840
Tell us.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840
Okay.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.640
I'm putting the links in chat.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.960
Okay, there they are.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960
All right.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.400
Let me bring it up.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.040
This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040
Might I remind you here?

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Okay.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040
All right.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.240
Explain the costume for the podcast, listeners.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240
Okay.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.440
My name, Nintendo Maniac 64, kind of shows that I am a big entire lover, and other people

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.520
might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.700
You probably already know this guy.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.960
I do.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.440
And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.440
PlayStation.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440
I went for the irony factor.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.000
I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.160
Of masking tape and permanent marker.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:39.240
Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240
PlayStation hater.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.640
It's a well done logo.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.640
Yeah, you did a pretty good job.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.720
Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.360
You went for the old school PS logo.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.000
Because it's the PlayStation logo.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
All right.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Oh, sorry.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
The PlayStation logo.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
My bad.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.560
It has a PS3 on it.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.720
Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.620
We got to let you go so we can get some more calls though.

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620
Have a good one.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620
Thanks for calling.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.620
All right?

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620
Okay.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620
Later.

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.620
All right.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.620
We're going to get to some more calls.

01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:12.620
Let's go over to this one.

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:13.620
Hi.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:14.620
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.620
Who's this?

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.620
This is Jason.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:17.620
Hi, Jason.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.620
Buddy, our webmaster.

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:19.620
What's up?

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.620
Yay.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:21.620
Yay.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.620
We love you.

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.620
Whee!

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:24.620
How's the 800 number going?

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:29.400
You were the one that was the mastermind behind that whole thing, so we really appreciate that.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.640
I know the listeners do, too, and the folks leaving voicemails, so yay, Jason.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:34.640
I have a certain complaint.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.680
I'd like to think it's working pretty well.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.520
It does seem to be working okay.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.520
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:47.640
When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole low-word participation

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:53.320
numbers and all the fun nonsense, and with the whole Xbox, what's it called, XNA.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320
Hold on a minute.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:56.320
Hold on a minute, buddy.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.920
Put the car in park for a minute there, buddy.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.440
Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number's doing so great and the quality of his call

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.160
right now is kind of crappy, like we're hearing a lot of break-up in there?

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.160
Just the irony factor.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:09.160
Sorry, Jason.

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.560
I don't know what else to tell you.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.560
So E3, yeah?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:20.120
E3 and the whole low-word participation amongst independent developers, no, low-word participation

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:27.480
in general and not just in general masses, but XNA, Xbox, Microsoft, XNA, the independent

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:33.200
development suite can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.520
theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:42.800
So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800
with the XNA?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800
Yeah.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:48.080
I mean, XNA is a launching point.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.320
You can go so much further beyond there, and if you bring together independent developers

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.480
and publishers, I mean, do I really have to go further than that?

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.800
You know, I will say this.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.640
Microsoft seems to be in touch with their underground audience, so to speak, more than

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.160
a lot of other big gaming companies I've seen, and that, you know, obviously Major Nelson

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.440
has a lot to do with that.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.920
You know, you might remember at Gamers Developers Conference, they had like the bloggers' breakfasts

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.360
and things, and they had that bus at E3.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:23.080
They definitely seem to be in touch with the underground media a little more than any other

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.080
company.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:25.080
So thank you for that.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.920
If anyone were to do this, it would probably be them.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
All right.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.600
And the fact of how much that that can help them on their place in general in XBL, in

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.840
the next couple of years, this whole generation is going to be a really big difference.

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.240
It's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.600
It would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.600
I definitely agree.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.720
Jason, the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.800
I'm so sorry.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.640
We love you anyway.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:52.640
We love you, Jason.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.880
Another one.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.880
Good thought.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.880
Yeah.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.880
Watch them start kicking people from chat.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.600
That would be awesome.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600
You what?

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.600
You're going to talk shit about me?

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.800
Who's talking shit about him right there?

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:03.800
Let's see.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:04.800
We have Jason is awesome.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.800
Let's see.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.800
Stop.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.800
You fail at calling.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.760
See, he's going to boot GS68 right there for you fail at calling.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.600
Oh, he just gave him the middle finger.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.600
All right.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:13.600
Let's go to another call.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:14.600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:15.600
Who's this?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.600
Hola.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
Hey, it's DMN.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.600
No, really.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.600
It's Ron.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.600
Hi.

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600
Hi, DMN.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600
Hi.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.600
Hi, DMN, Ronmo.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.600
What's on your mind?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.600
Not much.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.600
I have a quick question for Lokey.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.600
Lokey, I want to ask you...

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.600
Lokey, are you paying attention?

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.600
Yes.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.600
Lokey, boobs.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.600
Boobs, Lokey, boobs.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.600
Yeah, what's on your mind?

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Chose a DNA.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600
What's on your mind?

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600
All right, Lokey.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.920
Have you heard anything about Halo 3?

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:45.480
Because a friend of my orchestra, Gamestop, he just told me last week that Microsoft,

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.080
the press release has coming out on November 2007.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:50.600
Have you heard anything new since that?

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.120
No, I haven't heard anything new.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.600
We still have the date as March.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.920
Has that press release actually come out anywhere?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.380
No, it has not.

01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.380
So your friend...

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.380
I told my friend that.

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:05.140
Well, so your friend who works at this random Gamestop happens to know the inner workings

01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.080
at Microsoft and what they're developing.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.400
You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the Gamestop employees?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.120
I'm thinking we got exhibit A right here.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.880
He might be dead fucking wrong and you might be right.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.160
Your Gamestop kid might be right.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.760
It's November 2007.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.000
But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.640
press release right now.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640
Please.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.040
I trust Lokey more than I do Gamestop.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.760
Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.760
to be in the holiday.

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.160
It's going to be the November title.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.800
So that'd be my guess right there because there you got your two Halo games.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:53.640
You've got one that's just in time for when the PlayStation 3 systems might be available.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.400
Again, their second big push.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.080
More of a reason to not go to the Sony side.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:05.200
And then you have your last Halo game that's probably also going to get like your Fable

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.280
2 and stuff as well also in the holiday season.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.080
So it's perfect timing for that.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.720
And plus, the other thing, March being the end of their financial quarter, it makes their

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.760
numbers look good.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.640
So more people invest in their company.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.860
That's kind of why they would do it that way because they don't really have a big game

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.760
coming out in March right now.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:33.520
I think what they have Forza 2 on the line, Crackdown and probably Shadowrun.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.120
And I think those were all scheduled before June.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.520
So I don't know.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.440
I'm still saying March until I hear otherwise.

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.720
I have a question I think so too.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.520
I mean, because I asked him Wait, DarkSaga has a question for you.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520
No, no, no.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.520
He go ahead and finish what you're saying.

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:57.840
Well, I was saying to him, well, if this is an actual press release, don't you think somebody

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.200
would have leaked it by now?

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.200
Because I had access for proof.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:03.760
He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.960
And I've been checking on the sites, nothing about it.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:12.000
So I think it's just all smoke.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.560
He's breaking up now.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Yeah.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.400
Well, I got to let you go because you're breaking up hella bad.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.320
But thanks so much for the call and tell your friend he's full of shit.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.320
Sorry DarkSaga.

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.320
What were you going to ask?

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320
Maybe he can answer in chat.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:26.320
I forget.

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.160
Let me put it this way.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:30.480
They have November 1st as a date right now.

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:39.540
Like I know we use, for example, November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.560
when we don't have a release date, because it's easy to enter in when you're entering

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.000
items into a database and it's 1111111.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.760
Sorry, I picked up another call.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.520
Hi, you're on our service.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.280
Ah, damn that feedback.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.520
Sorry, I finished your thought.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.440
I won't pick up another call until you're ready.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.320
Anyway, so that would be a default date.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:04.240
So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.400
And that's what they have on their website right now.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.680
It's a default placeholder date.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.080
All right.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.480
Now let's try another call.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480
Sorry.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480
Who's this?

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.160
Hey, it's ShadowNextGen in the chat.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.360
Hi, ShadowNextGen.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.360
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.360
Hey guys, what's going on?

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360
I just had a couple of-

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.000
No, we're just doing a radio show.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.800
How about you?

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.200
About Halo 3, I actually agree with Loki.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.840
And why?

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:39.800
Because that would also be when basically the quote unquote real launch of the PlayStation

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.920
3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.400
So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:51.520
Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.160
or somebody was rumored that Halo 3-

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.040
That Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Yes, exactly.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.760
It took the words right out of my mouth.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.600
So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be what it is.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.420
So in a way, maybe that kind of happens where it's maybe it goes up against the Euro launch

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:12.160
or like, as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.160
That's kind of an interesting perspective.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:23.560
And also at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo and it sucked.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.500
Did you play Johnny Whatever?

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.680
I didn't get to play anything because they were all broken.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.640
I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.200
a bunch on display.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200
And nothing.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:40.920
Did you wash your hands after touching them?

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.920
Yeah.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.240
And I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.400
I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.400
controllers.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.400
Anyway, sorry.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:59.080
Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii because my GameStop had a kiosk.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.160
And what did you think of the Wii?

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.760
I thought it was very awesome.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.360
It was very awesome.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.320
What games did you play?

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.800
I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the photo channel

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.340
and the Mii channel, things like that.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.480
You know, I had some friends get, one of my friends post on LiveJournal about this.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.400
They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400
I'm like, you stupid.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.400
Really?

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.400
Yeah.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.760
Apparently the guy came up behind him and like, you can't do that, you know, that whole

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760
thing.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.760
Yeah.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:32.760
You guys are hella dumb.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.760
Anyway.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.760
Yeah.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.880
And it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:38.880
Hi.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.480
Where are you going to go camp out at?

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:41.480
Uh, nowhere.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.880
I have a pre-order of GameStop.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:44.160
Well, look at you go.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160
Well, congratulations.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.360
You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360
Yeah.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.360
Well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.360
All right.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360
Well, until then, have a good week.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:53.360
Thanks for your call.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:54.360
All right, buddy?

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.360
Yeah.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360
Thanks.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.360
All right.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.360
Good luck with the Wii.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.360
Have fun.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.360
Wii.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.360
Yeah.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.360
This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.360
Hi.

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:04.360
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:05.640
Hi.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.480
This is Did You Lose A Sock.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.480
Hi, Did You Lose A Sock.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:12.500
I, we're getting a little feedback.

01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.500
Get away from the screen.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.500
Is that better?

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.500
A little bit, yes.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.500
What's on your mind?

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500
What's on your mind?

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:02.180
Um, which is a better game, Pen

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:22.740
Fears of Wars or Vivapinata?

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.680
I can't say because I haven't played Vivapinata.

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:33.680
Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?

01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.680
I'm going to write to Glaad and tell them to ban Viva Pinata.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680
One more call.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680
Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Hi, Paradox Vincent. What's on your mind?

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:18.680
I was just thinking. A while ago, I was watching this thing.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.680
And it was somebody at Microsoft. I want to say Peter Moore.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.680
Ah, yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:34.680
Yeah. And he was talking about how he wanted to take a more unified stance.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:41.680
This is before the Xbox 360 was even kind of. This is back, you know, last generation.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:46.680
I was taking more of a unified stance towards gaming.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:55.680
And how this has been the most competitive cycle yet.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:02.680
Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:12.680
Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony. They didn't want to attack Nintendo.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:22.680
Yeah, but this cycle is so competitive. I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:29.680
Hasn't Peter Jackson been the source of comments against Sony at some point?

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:33.680
Didn't Peter Pan do that?

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:36.680
I don't remember that.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:42.680
In all seriousness, it was just recently campaign season.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.680
It kind of reminds me of campaign season.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:49.680
Where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.680
And we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.680
And then suddenly a month later,

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:58.680
Drew Nami is running for Congress.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:04.680
And did you know, when he was younger, he really liked candy?

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:06.680
Do not elect Drew Nami.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.680
Paid for by Rob Roberts for President campaign.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:12.680
You see all those negative ads all over.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.680
They always start off like, oh yeah, it's going to be a clean fight.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.680
Because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:24.680
But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.680
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.680
I know what I mean, too.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.680
Thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent. We appreciate it.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.680
Anything else you want to say to our listeners?

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.680
No, not really.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.680
All right, well have a good one.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:43.680
Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.680
Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.680
All right, have fun with your Wii.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.680
All right.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.680
Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight. We appreciate it.

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.680
And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.680
Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:11.680
Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.680
But it is fan made, just so that nobody freaks out.

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.680
I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:24.680
Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:31.680
The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.680
So you guys won't have to wait for much longer. Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.680
I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:41.680
Your free time's almost up.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.680
So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.680
Start off here with Saints Rogue getting an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.680
And it's only going to cost you 80 Microsoft points, or $1.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.680
So for a couple maps, that's a pretty good price.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.680
So I'm glad of that.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:05.680
We mentioned the ESRB leaked some titles for the Virtual Console.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.680
There's actually a little bit more than what we mentioned.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:14.680
Including Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Brothers, Ice Hockey, and Soccer.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:18.680
And for the Super Nintendo Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.680
That's hot.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680
Fuck yeah.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.680
Kirby Super Star, Super Metroid, and Kirby's Dream Land 3.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.680
For the Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, and Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.680
Sweet, Toad's Highway.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.680
So that is pretty sweet right there.

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:40.680
Of course, there was some estimates on the Playstation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.680
Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:51.680
And they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the Playstation 3 launch.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.680
That's a lot of money.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.680
It's Toad's Turnpike, I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680
Sorry.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:11.680
Anyways, you might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entus of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:20.680
While he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the Playstation 3.

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.680
But in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.680
It's all about physics.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.680
Did he see the same trailer I did?

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.680
He's an idiot.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:41.680
Let's see here, there was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W. S. Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:43.680
Yeah, it looked very boring.

01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.680
Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:56.680
Anyways, we know that November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Snake King.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:59.680
Most anticipated games of the year.

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:02.680
Yes, but that's not where it stops.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:10.680
In fact, Kellogg's, Cereal, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:18.680
And apparently you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.680
Froot Loops the game!

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.680
So that's kind of interesting.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:34.680
As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well they have PTV for the Playstation download service where you're going to be able to download videos and stuff.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:42.680
Right now they don't currently have any extra content on there, but you can download some free trailers including stuff for like Underworld Evolution and that kind of thing.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.680
So that's kind of neat.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.680
And then finally...

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.680
Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:58.680
The last bit of information of course comes for the Playstation 3, and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:05.680
In fact, you can actually get the binaries now for a Linux version that you can put on your Playstation 3.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:13.680
And that's all available actually on Playstation's website on www.playstation.com slash ps3 dash open platform.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.680
So that's kind of neat.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.680
That's it.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Two scoops of raisins in this Xbox 360 game.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:30.680
Scoop King. Poop Scoop King.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.680
What else can we put in the cereal?

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:39.680
On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar coated cereal and end the program.

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.680
This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.680
Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight. What's your final thought?

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:51.680
Pie.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.680
And Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.680
And I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.680
Any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.680
War is over, if you want it.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.680
Aww, I like that.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:11.680
Loki, my final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:16.680
Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:24.680
My final thought is reject false icons.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.680
I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:37.680
My final thought is I heart you, Jamie. Heart, heart, heart, love, love.

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:44.680
Your final thought, Dark Sakura?

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.680
Gwar.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680
Gwar? I love Gwar.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.680
Gwar!

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:51.680
She's holding a grudge.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:57.680
Shut up, okay? You! No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Drew Nami.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:00.680
You have to go make them in the bathroom.

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:02.680
He said I was holding a grudge.

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:06.680
I'll show you a grudge. I'll beat you with a ferret.

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.680
Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.680

We appreciate you sticking by us.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:18.680
Have a great week.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.680
Hey, next week, crazy system launches.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.680
John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.680
and since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other,

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.680
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their excite truck on,

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.680
so it's sure to be a clusterfuck event,

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.680
which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.680
Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.680
We'll talk more about that next week.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.680
Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.680
