Orange Lounge Radio
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
This is episode number 207.
And let's get right back into it.
We've got more gaming news for you guys.
I'm going to start it off with a story about the Xbox update.
The much-anticipated Fall 360 update did roll out on October 31st, just like it was speculated last week.
We talked about that on this program.
And...
What's interesting about the update is that it bricked some consoles.
And when we say brick the console, that means that basically it crashes it, causes the three red lights of Doom to appear, and now you effectively have a giant paperweight or a system that cannot play games.
It was said, though, that less than 1% of the consoles were affected.
But I know we had a listener, I want to say it was Alex, who was in our chat room earlier, saying he was one of the lucky less than 1% that got affected by this and tried to call Microsoft and they wanted the money to fix it.
And I'm thinking, that is messed up.
That's not what I read.
I read people were actually being able to send them back, but that's pretty fucked up if they wanted money.
I asked him to call in later in the show and give his perspective there.
The official quote from Microsoft did come from this.
We are hearing from a small number of customers, less than 1%, that are having issues with the fall console update.
I've been told that the team should have an updated version in the next 12 to 24 hours.
We'll let you know when the issue is resolved.
If you're having problems with the update for any reason, please call Xbox Support.
We're working with those affected to get them back up and running and we're committed to making sure the update doesn't cause problems for anyone else.
So don't take that $140 for an answer.
No, you did not have the choice to download this update, so they should fix the damn thing for you.
They bricked your console, so they need to fix it.
Especially since they're aware of the problem.
That's just, there's no excuse for that.
Blackboy in our chatroom did the math and said that would be about 60,000 consoles that got bricked.
Good job.
That's still a big number.
Wow, that's something else.
They need to figure out how to unbrick them and fast.
And I guess next time they need to test on more consoles.
I don't know.
That's kind of weird that an update could brick your console like that.
But I don't know the technical end of it.
Speaking of things that are unacceptable, well, at least the book was.
Eragon, the demo for that is available on Xbox Live.
It's a 415 megabyte download.
So you can check it out.
My problem with the book is that the book, as far as I've gotten through it, is so very poorly written.
It reads like it was written by a 12-year-old.
So hopefully the game is better than how poorly written the book is.
The demo's not better at all.
It's absolutely crap.
So the demo is like it was written by a 12-year-old?
Yeah, and I'm not sure if you've played it, but if you've played Konami's King Arthur, it's about the same level of crap, and that's really bad.
It's boring hack and slash.
That sounds pathetic.
I don't even know what this game is about.
I know there's a movie, but... Okay, Eragon is about a boy who finds out that he's a dragon rider and gets pulled into all the dragon riding nonsense and everything, but... Well, to defend the writer of the book, I did hear that he did start it in his teens, but that's what beta readers are for.
Use them.
Which the entirety of the fanfiction writing community should also know that, too.
But, um...
I don't see why the book got all this attention and why they're making a movie of it.
I saw the posters for it at the Metreon a couple weeks ago.
Yeah, I saw them recently also.
It's sad.
So the game is just hack and slash?
That's as far as I got in the demo before I decided it should be deleted.
It wasn't fun.
It looked like a PS2 game and not even like a current...
Generation of PS2 games.
It looks like a step back.
Well, it's developed by Stormfront, and Stormfront did those Lord of the Rings ones, and they were all hack-and-slashy, too.
I don't know.
It didn't look that bad.
The screenshots I've seen look pretty good, but I haven't played the demo yet.
Screenshots aren't playing.
Oh, snap.
Oh, no.
Um, anyways.
That's actually NVIDIA's big game for, um... Well, actually, no, I guess Fury would be the big game for November.
Anywho, um...
So that fall update for the 360, it did some good.
And what that would be is actually, well, it's helping ban some of the modders that have their firmware for the DVD drives modded to play backed up games.
And so actually they've started banning some of these people that supposedly have modded systems.
The funny part about it, though, is they're also banning some people that don't have modded systems but are saying that they are modded.
So they don't really have their system down pat yet, but it is at least a start to try to stop some of those people from pirating stuff.
Because pirating is bad.
Totally.
I feel so weird saying that.
Anyway, I wanted to move on to a story about something that those players will not probably be downloading anytime soon, and that would be some new maps for Perfect Dark Zero.
Some brand new maps came out for free if you're an Xbox Live Gold member.
Hmm, interesting.
Another perk about being a Gold member.
You get some maps there for Perfect Dark Zero, and get this.
They are updated version of GoldenEye 64 maps.
Facility and Temple, those maps are now available in Perfect Dark Zero.
That's kind of cool.
if I liked Perfect Dark Zero.
I sold my Perfect Dark Zero because I didn't like it.
I just couldn't get into it.
It felt weird.
No next-gen game should have a first-person shooter where you cannot jump.
That's my opinion.
But GoldenEye was a good game.
I don't know.
I still play Doom.
And GoldenEye was good.
Perfect Dark Zero I just could not get into at all.
At all.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
It just wasn't good for me.
DarkTetsuya is happy.
He says Facility was awesome.
So some good reception there in our chat room to the maps that are coming out.
You know what they need?
What?
They need to put out a goddamn TimeSplitters game.
That was awesome.
Make your own maps.
Well, at any rate, there's been a bit more information about the Halo 3 multiplayer mode.
Basically, there is Ninja Ball, which is basically carrying a ball around.
Tank Flag, where a tank carries the flag.
And Elimination, on that one you're supposed to kill off five opposing team members.
With a 16 player limit.
They also mention more about the Spartan Laser.
It's saying that the weapons application will be offset by a need to lock onto the target for about three seconds.
So it's sort of like lock targeting computer fire.
the man cannon funny it will be used to fire explosive barrels and vehicles in looping arcs over the battlefield and there's also saying that they'll be able to fire or you can be shot down while you're in air there's also with the warthog and ghost vehicles they are going to control similarly to how they do in Halo 2 um
But they're not saying what the X button is going to be used for.
It's a secret.
The rumor for the X button was steel weapons.
Because apparently you're going to be carrying your unused weapon over your shoulder or in a pistol mount or something like that.
Oh, to stop people who whore certain weapons during the whole game?
That would be interesting.
Yeah, I've heard that you're going to be able to see the weapons on people.
That's kind of cool.
Interesting.
That is kind of cool.
By the way, I want to say in response to the whole not being able to jump in a first-person shooter, JeremyTodd1 says, In Gears of War, you can't jump, and that's one of the best games coming out.
It's a little stupid.
I don't care.
Even if it has high production values, it's still retarded that you cannot jump.
I mean, come on now.
We're in the next gen.
We need to have jumping technology.
That's what we need.
Anywho, so some things that are also ridiculous out there is, and we talk about this every week, it's not a huge surprise.
Another EA game comes out and, you know, more microtransactions.
Well, you know, EA is actually trying to charge another $50 for their microtransactions.
One of those charges you can actually purchase for $10 is the upgrade to basically make yours the collector's edition.
So you can get the extra cars.
and whatnot, extra tracks.
And of course, they're going to have some unlockables that you can buy.
Pretty much the same deal as all the other EA games that they've been charging microtransactions for.
So this is just going to be something that we're going to see going forward, I'm thinking.
So if you don't like them, don't buy them.
That's what I say.
That's exactly what it boils down to.
If you don't like this, don't buy it.
Don't encourage other people to buy it either.
So...
It's time to rise up against all this microtransaction stuff.
I don't know.
They can be cool sometimes.
I mean, new maps, new songs.
I mean, that's kind of neat, but...
I don't know about this whole buying something that you're going to get in the game later.
And doesn't that just seem... I still can't get over the whole thing that we talked about.
I know this was last week, but the Godfather and the fact that the cheat codes are in the other games that will give you money, but in this one you have to buy it.
That just seems... I don't know.
Just because I know so many people that rely on cheat codes to get through their games, and that's how they want to do it.
And that's how they have fun doing it.
Especially in a sandbox game, you know, maybe they don't want the challenge.
They just want to have fun going around and blowing people up.
Like I...
I knew somebody that did this on Destroy All Humans.
Just put in all the cheat codes and just ran around and blew things up.
And that's fun.
No, I'm not talking about you, actually, although you probably did this, too.
Yes, I did.
So, I don't know.
It just kind of seems like it's taking advantage of those people.
It's taking candy from a baby.
Well, it's just like, you know, for example, I put in cheat codes when I play Saints Row at lunch because we're not actually saving the game or doing any progress.
We're just running around blowing shit up.
And that's how we spend our lunches.
Because, you know,
Saints Row is very much like Grand Theft Auto.
The week goes towards the Jehovah's Witness that knocked on the door to Kristen's house before I left today.
I'm hiding behind the corner because I know I'm going to have choice words for this one.
But she's like, she's coming to the door and Kristen's like, Hi, can I help you?
And she's like, Oh, I have very important information for you.
Here's your own personal copy of things to help you understand what's going on in the world.
Is this religious?
No, it's from the Bible!
Excuse me!
And then she proceeds to go on and explain, and I understand, this is not me getting down on anybody who is Christian or believes in God or anything like that.
It's, first of all, the woman tries to lie about her purpose for being there, which is very unchristian-like.
Then again, we've had this for centuries.
Oh, the Crusades, the Witch Hunts, how about that?
But anyway, she goes on trying to use the Bible to explain to a pagan the difference.
And the thing is, is that you cannot use your belief as valid proof to someone who does not believe the same thing that you do.
It doesn't work.
And finally, I'm like, and Kristen's like, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie, come here!
I'm like, shh.
So, I said, okay, here's my take on this.
The Bible was written by human beings.
God did not write it.
God told them what to put in it.
Therefore, when God comes to Earth and says, here's a book that I wrote by myself.
I hope you like it.
Then I will take the Bible literally.
And then I said, thank you very much, goodbye, and shut the door.
She gave me this look like, utter disbelief, like, oh my God, nobody's ever pointed that out to me before.
and turned around and left in stunned silence.
And all I could say was, oh my god, I'm so hardcore.
This reminds me of the time that I was living in Chico and remember Prop 22 here in California, which was the one that said they were going to write marriage is only between a man and a woman in the state constitution or whatever, right?
And this woman came to my door and was like, yes, I was going around talking to folks today about Proposition 22.
How do you feel about the fact that marriage should only be between a man and a woman?
And I'm like,
Honey, I am gay, so you might as well turn right around.
And she did.
But she was embarrassed.
She was like, oh, oh, I see.
I'm like, you're not going to catch it.
But run.
I'm a very open-minded person.
I grew up Southern Baptist.
I mean, jeez.
If I could escape that with an open mind.
Me too.
Me too.
If I could escape growing up Southern Baptist in Alabama with an open mind, then I'm fairly tolerant.
of people's religious, you know, preferences.
But when you come to me with such a closed-minded argument, when you follow so blindly that you cannot even accept logic, which is a gift that God apparently gave to you, when you ignore this gift, I have no respect for you.
We've got to be careful not to turn this into a religious show.
I know, but I really, I really, I especially dislike, with any argument, anyone coming into something with a, oh, well, I just think it's because, you know, you should.
I think we can kind of end on the note and say, you know, if you are totally religious, then, like, that's cool.
We totally respect that.
Like, you know, one of my best friends is a very religious person, and I totally respect that because, you know,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We gotta move on.
Anyways, I have to read this in chat.
RPGKing7 says, No, what's better is these two fairly hot Jehovah's Witnesses came to my house and I used the line, If God loves me, then you'll show me your tits.
That's disgusting.
Come on, let's keep it moving.
Anyways, F you to Comcast.
Because I upgraded to Comcast's HD service, and first off, there aren't that many channels anyways, but second off, this
and DarkSakura.
My F.U.
goes to my taste buds because I'm constantly craving junk food all week.
Like right now, I'm craving pie.
That's it.
Miggletop, do you have anything?
I have two short ones.
I'm doing a preemptive F.U.
to Endemiro for not including Lizanka and the new Pump It Up mix that's going to be announced this month because I know it won't be there because they don't like me enough.
And then F.U.
to myself.
for not trying to jump on Taco Bell Boy today.
He's still really hot.
Hey, Rob, I have one more.
What?
This is on behalf of several friends of mine.
When... Okay, men, remember this.
If you try to hit on somebody while they're at work and say, I'm sorry, I'm a lesbian, don't say, oh, that's okay, and smile at them like you can suddenly fix them.
They don't want your cock pissed off.
They want pussy.
Thank you for that blunt explanation.
Well, you have to be blunt because the majority of straight men out there only think, I say majority, most that I've encountered, only think with one piece of their anatomy and it's not their brain.
Now, now, there are women out there that think they can turn a gay man straight because that is very true.
That's true, but I hear more about men pulling this off than women.
Men just want to watch.
You know what?
Yesterday I had two women tell me they wanted to sleep with me.
I'm like, um, sweeties, you know, it doesn't really work that way.
I'm not programmed for that.
Anyway.
Anyway, we're getting into TMI, so let's get into some game releases.
Hey, upcoming game releases that are coming out on various systems.
In Japan, I've got the Japanese release dates for you guys.
Gears of War is making its way to the Xbox 360 in certain Asian regions this week, so be on the lookout for that.
We also have coming out on the PlayStation 2 this week in Japan, Area 51 is coming out.
My Kinoto Hime is coming out as well on the PlayStation 2 in Japan, which...

Which one?
The one you said before, Hinotori?
Oh, God.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
It's separated.
It's Hinotori-hen.
Okay, that means firebird.
Oh, that's what it is.
And then we have this one as well.
This should be interesting on the DS.
It's...
Mizas, Shoujo Manga Ka, Chao Manga School So this is how to be a shoujo manga artist?
Pretty much, it looks like, no, it looks like it actually takes place like in a school I'm looking at some of the screenshots Manga Ka is a manga writer Oh yeah, look, see Shoujo is girl See, look, it teaches you how to draw Basically it's going to teach you how to draw Sailor Moon Yeah, see, look, there it is Yeah Coming out from TDK Mediactive I actually think I'll get that game That might be kind of fun
The Importers are winning $48.90 for it.
Dude, I'll get it.
Gotta love those import games and their high, high prices.
Well, hey, if you do doujinshi or you're an artist, that's a good game for you.
I need to give PSP a little love real quick as well.
They're also getting some games, mostly Koei Entertainment's bringing out some stuff into their Best series.
Nobunaga no Yabu is going into the Best series as well as La Corte d'Oro.
Looks like this one's a new game that's coming.
No, it's just going into Koei Selection.
Harukanaru Jikunouchi Day 2 Enjoy if you're in Japan and have access to those games.
Well, speaking of games that aren't in Japan, how about our friends over in Europe?
So let's see what is coming out in the upcoming week, shall we?
Coming out on the 6th, we have Football Manager 2007 on 360 and PSP.
Medieval 2, Total War, Phantasy Star Universe Sega Genesis Collection Capcom Classic Collection Reloaded, Delta Force Black Hawk Down, Team Saber Mario Slam Basketball, Point Blank for the DS
Anywho.
Of course, the U.S.
is going to be seeing one hell of a week for releases.
Starting off, of course, with the portable stuff, we've got Elite Beat Agents coming out on the DS, Digimon World DS, My Frogger Toy Trials, crap, and let's see here, Winx Club, The Quest for Codex, also crap, and let's see.
Wait, wait, I thought Miklatov was a fan of the Winx games.
I just work on them.
I'm not really a fan.
Never mind.
I better not grill you further or you might get in trouble.
Game Boy Advance.
Final Fantasy V Advance is coming out and Polarium Advance as well.
Polarium is one of the worst puzzlers I've ever played.
I would not be interested in it on the Advance.
On the PC we've got Final Fantasy XI Vanadil Collection 2007 in case you're not a member of Final Fantasy XI yet.
Left Behind Eternal Forces.
The Godly Grand Theft Auto Game The Sims 2 Happy Holiday Stuff And of course if you have a Microsoft Flight Simulator The Aircraft Power Pack will be coming out Then on a lot of systems Call of Duty 3 is going to be coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the 360 We've got Tony Hawk's Project 8 coming out on PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox, and Xbox 360 Luminous 2 on the PSP

and of course, one of my favorites to sell at least, the History Channel, American Civil War, Nation Divided on PS2 and 360.
Another budget Activision game for you.
And Blitz Elite.
That's it.
Lots of stuff.
Alright, should be a fun week, but not for my wallet, that's for sure.
Oh my god, yeah, seriously.
It's like I want Gears of War, but I kind of am getting poorer.
Well, the two games I wanted this week were Gears of War and Call of Duty 3.
Call of Duty 3 is awesome for multiplayer split-screen.
Alright, changing topics completely to something that's already out, but maybe we didn't know about that's in stores.
One of our listeners, actually, I recognize this guy, El Mullet, made a recent post recently on DDRFreak.com about something he spotted.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But what's interesting about this is that, you know, some folks have also been bringing up, well, this is a way for maybe folks who can't really afford the whole system and the more expensive game and everything, a way to at least learn without maybe having the embarrassment of the game telling them they suck.
I don't know.
And also, if you don't have a dance mat and you don't have the game, dropping $70 or, you know, $49.99 or whatever for the game and dance mats a little much.
So, I don't know, maybe $20 for a DVD.
It's not so bad.
I'm kind of surprised it's not even one of the plug-and-play games like the Strawberry Shortcake DDR or what have you.
So, well, we'll see.
Anyway, this guy, El Mullitz, searches the stores up and down for strange products to share with the Internet.
DarkSakura surfs the web up and down to find strange and exciting websites to share with all of you guys.
And it's called the Website of the Week.
And DarkSakura is going to tell you what her browser is looking at right now.
Well, the website of the week after lots of looking is thecatsite.com.
Yes, it's a site all about cats and how to take care of them.
It has things about kittens.
It has things about cat toys, cat furniture, and cat behavior, hairball care.
I recommend going to thecatsite.com.
Yes, I have a cat.
There is Shermie, and Shermie has benefited from this site.
So go to thecatsite.com I have to admit, I prefer dailykitten.com for my cat needs, my cat-loving needs.
Daily Kitten is cute, but I was trying to give something practical.
Or stuffonmycat.com I've already done stuff on my cat, remember?
That's right, you did, a long time ago.
They need stuffonmybaby.com
I think that'd be funny, because people put weird things on their babies.
I don't know if you should encourage that.
Is there one already?
Oh, I'm worried I'm going to get porn or something.
Let's try this.
www.stuffonmybaby.com Oh, this page is parked free, courtesy of godaddy.com, just like half the other websites on the internet.
How nice.
All right.
So I guess there's no stuff on my baby yet, but GoDaddy says there's one coming soon, as soon as someone buys the domain from him.
I'm telling you, the stuff on my cat, you know, the new stuff on my baby, because people dress up their kids really stupidly.
They have a stuff on my cat calendar now.
All right, how about stuff on my politician?
I don't know, lame transition, but I wanted to point this out.
Game Politics ran an interesting story this week about Rick Santorium, who has a campaign commercial going on, and it's basically, he's this ultra-conservative guy,
and he's bragging about his support of video game violence initiatives.
Taking a stand against video game violence.
But what should be noted about this commercial that Game Politics points out is that in the commercial Santorum delivers to the face of one of the wrestlers towards the end of the commercial an elbow.
He elbows this wrestler in the face.
So this whole commercial is about being anti-video game violence and then he
is violent against a wrestler in the commercial.
Hypocrite much?
Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
I'm liking this guy.
Yeah, that's this guy's platform.
Anti-video game violence, pro-real violence.
So why simulate it when you can go do it?
You know what the conservatives want?
They want you to put down the video games and they want you to go fight in the real war.
Well, you know, it's hard to... It's kind of not just conservatives in my mind.
It's kind of, you know, because it was Hillary Clinton's thing, too.
It's kind of all across the board.
I think there's just a general ignorance among politicians in general, no matter what party they're with.
So, we need to re-educate them by voting them out of office.
Because if you're over the age of 18 and playing video games, then you should be doing your research on which legislator...
is wasting their time trying to support all this stupid legislation that's not going to go through or anything.
So do your research.
Election Day is coming up.
Yeah, there's actually... I want to change my website.
Okay.
Because this one... Wait, wait.
Do we need the... We don't need the music again.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Are you sure you're sure?
Alright, fine.
I'm trying to verify the name of the site because I've been there before.
I think it's like votesmart.com or smartvote or something like that.
I have the website saved at my home address, unfortunately.
You know what's funny, though, is because this part usually goes up on Wednesdays.
Election Day will have already passed, so maybe it's kind of a move point now.
Maybe we should have done this story in part A. Oops.
Oh, well.
Well, at any rate, people should be going there anyway.
Okay.
Alex in our chatroom says, I nominate Rob for the Gamers Party ticket with Jamie as his vice president.
That's nice, except I'm not 35.
Almost, but not quite.
Well, if anyone at least is Democrat, moveon.org has a lot of good stuff on the issues, too.
Anyways, so the last fall update, not only is it making it hard for people to have modded consoles, but it's also making it harder for people that cheat on their gamer scores.
That's right, the people that are using game saves to unlock achievement points are going to have some trouble, because apparently the last update they did has brand new ways on locking game saves, including this brand new hybrid locking mechanism that will prevent players from trading game saves so that they can inflate their gamer scores, or e-penis.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then of course certain arcade titles and some of the launch games are also profile locked and only on those profiles can you play them so people are cheating that as well.
Very interesting but I'm sure people are going to find a way around it because they always do.
Moving on, we want to take a minute to travel around the world a little bit and talk to you guys about some upcoming festivals in various places.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and they've got sponsors including Nintendo, Microsoft and Ubisoft.
The website says Arcadia is an interactive experience that will awaken your senses and emotions in a fantastic world of multimedia projections.
Does that mean everyone's getting high?
I don't know.
Anyway, tickets are $20 Canadian for all three days and there is a service fee with that though so hopefully no more than $25 Canadian.
That's about $22 US by the way.
and Montreal is not that far for a lot of folks who might be in the northeastern states who might want to take a trip to Canada to check out some gaming festivals.
Have fun.
Well, also traveling around the world, Australia has a very interesting point of view now.
Basically, they're bringing in virtual taxation.
You know, if you've earned money, you have to pay taxes, so they are...
For anyone doing profits online or playing games like Second Life and World of Warcraft, the quote by a spokesperson for the ATO says, if you're getting a monetary benefit, then it's not treated any differently.
Normal rules apply.
Your income will not be treated any differently than if you earned it working 9 to 5 in an office.
So basically for anyone who earns money via their...
Internet Addictions, then you're going to get taxed.
Okay, here's where I have a problem with this.
If they're going to count that as earnings, then I want to be able to count my losses.
And I want, you know, restitution for that.
That's what I think would be fair.
If you want to go one way, you got to do both.
You can't have, you know, the cake without paying the money.
I don't know.
That's a bad analogy.
Whatever.
I had nothing.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and unfortunately none of those will enhance the PSP in any way other than making them aesthetically pleasing except for maybe the pink one which looks stupid and yeah should you spend your money on this?
probably not if you already have one but if you were really waiting for a silver or possibly pink PSP then now's the time I don't know hooray I want a pink PSP not
Um, would you buy a... Wait, you're the... Miklatov's the one that's the color whore when it comes to systems.
Like, you've totally, like, taken systems back and traded it just to get, like, a blue DS and stuff.
Yep.
So, any of these new color PSPs interest you?
The blue one.
Of course.
I honestly really want it.
I saw the picture and I was like, wow, it's a blue PSP.
I need it back.
When I was at YaliCon, there was...
There were three guys sitting in a row and each of them were playing a different color DS.
That's cute.
I have a pink GBA.
For like $20 you can buy replacement cases that are different colors.
In fact, they have additional colors other than G3.
You do not need to actually buy an official Sony system to get a different color.
They're available out there in almost any color of the rainbow.
Why people do this is beyond me, but they do.
You know what I thought was interesting is that I was at the mall today and I didn't notice how many, like, freaking kiosks they have in the mall that are dedicated to, like, pip my iPod.
Like, they had all these, you know, places that sold the iPod stickers or whatever the little encasings they have that, you know, you can put Spongebob on your iPod and stuff and, you know, you can pretty much do the same thing with a PSP.
You know what I haven't seen this year?
What?
The knockoff Nintendos.

Supposedly, it's going to launch around November 22nd, and 1,100 hours of video would be available to rent or purchase through an Xbox 360 connected to Xbox Live.
Rentals would be $4 for a 24-hour viewing period, and purchases would be from $10 to $15, very similar to Pay-Per-View and iTunes.
I don't know if I'd buy this, though, because to me, this kind of nerfs the HD DVD player if they're going to move this direction.
Not necessarily, because you can still get
You're only going to have so much room on your hard drive to fit movies.
Yeah, that's the other thing.
There's no room.
How would I purchase movies permanently with a 20 gigabyte drive?
Well, I don't know.
But here's the other thing, too.
The last update, the fall update, does have content expiration built into it.
So they could do this if they wanted to.
That's one of the things that they just added.
So it kind of seems a little...
Look, coincidental if they're going to be implementing this pretty soon, that they just added a feature to be able to cause your content to expire.
I don't know.
It just seems a little soon for this.
I still think you're kind of nerfing the HD DVDs if you do this.
Well, they've got to compete with the PlayStation 3, and the PlayStation 3 is all about the e-distribution stuff.
We'll see.
DMN in our chat thinks this is going to fail as the DivX format did back in the late 90s.
I don't know, because you can buy them.
Now it's a bigger hard drive is what they're going to have to do.
What are you going to do when you're done with a movie?
You delete it and you can just re-download it again later or something and it's still yours?
Because I'm thinking the drives are not big enough.
Possibly.
I mean, I guess there was a screenshot leaked a while ago that proves that there's a 60 gig thing on the way, but still, most of us are stuck with 20s.
You know?
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.
Justin thinks they can stream the movies.
They can keep a database of which ones you bought and stream them when you watch them.
I don't know.
That wouldn't necessarily work depending on how bad your service is.
It really depends on how good your connection is or how not good your connection is.
We'll see.
And of course, Bandit wants to know, when does the Wizard get released for the 360?
I don't think it would because it was a Nintendo commercial.
So they don't want it.
DarkSakura is going to read some of her favorite emails right now.
Well, um...
We've got quite a number of emails, and they're all going to be read by the ferret, so here's the first one.
Okay, never mind.
First email comes from Wolf.
Actually, it's two emails, so I'm just going to read them together, because actually I sort of am happy about one.
So this goes out to Jamie.
I have a lot of respect for your taking a moral stance about the whole selling a game system for two to three times the value when someone who can't enjoy it has to pay that much.
Okay.
Actually, that makes me feel very good, because I believe that morals are becoming slowly corroded over time, and I think somebody's gotta have them, so thank you.
One for Rob.
I think you were the one who plays Final Fantasy XI, right?
Did you quit before or after the whole Chocobo raising update?
I did a little resurgence back into Final Fantasy XI right when they did the Chocobo, but it only lasted about a month.
Miklatovka was the one that kind of suckered me back into Final Fantasy XI, but I quit really late.
I think I got Corsair to like level 14, if that, and then quit.
I did get a Chocobo, and I raised it, but like not past baby stage.
What was it called?
Oh, Fatty Bon Bon was the name of my Chocobo, Fatty Bon Bon.
But then I quit, and now I'm... I remember you had a little Ken back in the day.
That was actually my mule.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hey guys, AZHP again reporting back from Stonetown's Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol dealie.
Everyone at the competition sucked and no one got more than 10k points out of like 100,000.
But anyway, my thoughts on the game.
Better song selection than the previous Karaoke Revolutions that I've played, but the whole American Idol thing is...
The whole American Idol thing is neat, but not very well implemented.
I got sick of hearing the three judges say the same comments for every single person because there were only a few sound bites for each judge.
Also, since it's on PS2, the character models are funky and disproportionate and not in a good way.
And when they talk, the lips don't sync up.
Also, the pitch recognition still needs work.
Judges a little too harshly, just like all the previous games.
A decent party game, but not great.
Yeah, it's not surprising.
Well, I think it's not done yet either.
No, well, no, isn't it?
Were they talking about the little tour they're doing?
I don't think that's a final build.
No, so I wouldn't totally base your opinions on that build, but it's going to give you the general feel of the game at least.
Well, we got an email coming from Brandon from Texas.
Knowing how much you all seem to be bugged by Mr. Kutaragi, here is a reason for the Nintendo hardcore to hate this guy.
People say he's bad to the customers, eh?
He was the person who convinced Nintendo to make a CD attachment for the NES with Sony.
When Nintendo went with Philips after getting angry over the Sony contract, Sony stole the technology that Nintendo worked on for it and made the PlayStation with it.
So everyone has a reason to hate this guy.
Thought it might interest you all.
Um, yeah, Sony was supposed to be working on the CD drive for the SNES at the time, but yeah, there was a bunch of big fallout over that.
I think there were even, I remember back in the day, didn't they have image prototypes?
Well, images of the prototypes that Sony was working on back in the day?
I seem to remember in, like, Nintendo Power years ago, there was some type of prototype picture, but, you know, this is so long ago.
Yeah.
but that's still an interesting point one not everyone is aware of got an email from Alex it says hey OLR Alex from chat here I suspect I'm too late for mailbag 207 and or that the story I'm going to touch on hasn't come up on the show yet but oh well I'm going to talk anyway I'm pretty sure that last week you reported on the fall update for Xbox 360 being on Halloween which it was however nobody knew how bad this update was a lot of people were having trouble with the thing not installing
This is now fixed, but there's another problem.
The update effectively bricked consoles.
Yeah, we had actually brought that up in Part A. But I thought it was... This is right at the top of this part, but that's all right.
Actually, that listener's in chat tonight.
Yeah.
So he's the same guy who said he had a bricked console.
But I still think it was interesting that we've got people who do have more thoughts on that one.
it was the final comment on here that made me really think about it it's way too close to the PS3 we launched for things like that to be happening good point another email comes but wait a minute though, at the same time at least the rumor or whatever is that part of the reason Microsoft did this now was to put out their 1080p support so Sony couldn't say any longer that they're the only console that can do the true HD how well did they test it?
Well, maybe they rushed it, and this wasn't the time to be rushing things, so I'll buy into that.
We have an email from Warrior Bob.
Warrior Bob is cool.
Hey guys, I heard the discussion this last week about Konami's acquisition of the In The Groove franchise.
I figured you probably will get a million emails with reactions to this, so I'll leave my opinions aside as to whether I think this is a good or bad thing.
I did feel, however, that the situation wasn't portrayed entirely accurately.
Rob seemed to categorize In the Groove as a fan tribute, but I think what he was thinking of was Step Mania, the open source fan game that emulates DDR very closely.
In the Groove is a commercial game from Rockstar Red Octane and not a tribute of any sort, although some resources are shared between the project, some code, and I believe some staff were involved in both In the Groove and Step Mania.
The fan tribute remains free of both charge and litigation as far as I know.
Please let me admit my bias here for the sake of fairness.
At one point, I worked with the Stepmania team on a very small level, helped write a manual, check out the
in the Groove One Arcade credits as they used part of it, but I do feel I have an interest in seeing their work represented correctly, hence this email.
Small corrections aside, I do continue to love your show and look forward to the next one.
With all due respect, no, I meant fan tribute, and I still feel that that's how I feel the game is, is because...
If you look at the folks that developed In The Groove, half of them were posters on DDR Seattle before In The Groove ever came out.
So, you know, maybe it wasn't called a fan tribute like Step Mania was, but in my mind, it was that fandom of DDR and, you know, they probably all met each other on this forum, you know, and stuff that caused them to make the game.
I think it was love of DDR that spawned it, but in the end, it's all about the dollar.
They did...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
Until the dollar came into play and I think Groxor stepped in and all this stuff.
But then again, we had Renee here last week who says she's had interaction with these folks and they're a little bit uppity.
I don't know.
I'm not going to speak because I don't really know these folks.
But I will say this.
I do remember that they would post on their forums years ago.
Folks used to ask, what is your legal angle on this?
How is this game legal?
And they would just say, don't talk about it.
We've got it covered.
And now it's kind of like, you know what?
You got served.
Why were you so huffy and certain and full of yourselves?
I mean, that's kind of the one part I do see where maybe there was a little bit of ego there.
They should have been a little more humble in dealing with that side of it.
I still think that the project was well-deserved.
You don't take somebody else's idea and try to make money on it.
It's like how I would feel if someone had taken my art and traced over it to make any picture.
I would feel, oh, but we love your style.
That doesn't matter to me.
You stole my art.
That's how I would feel.
Um, anyway, we have an email from, uh, Schwalt, uh, 120- I'm sorry, is that-
Okay, I'm trying to look at this.
I think this... My font is very strange on the email, so I apologize.
I think it's Schwall22.
Yeah, I think that's not... You know what?
This is funny.
This is somebody who I met on Xbox Live.
I think we randomly played a game of Scramble?
I think was the game.
And now he listens to the show.
So it's kind of cool.
That's pretty cool.
Yeah.
No, just to explain, my L's and my 1's look the same in this font, so... Hey folks, love the show and the info.
I just have a few questions about the Wii before its launch.
I read today, Friday, on a site that starts with ko and ends with taku, lol.
Anyway, I heard that the classic controller will not be able to play GameCube games, but IGN's Matt Kasamasina... Sorry, I'm getting tongue-tied.
Thank you for watching!
I was going to say that...
The Xbox Live Arcade does not have... You can't trade the games with other people and bring them over.
You can bring over a demo or something like that, but you can't actually bring your full game with them.
That's why your profile is linked to basically your console, so you're only going to be able to download them there.
You know what's interesting?
I was listening to Bobby's show earlier tonight, and he was talking about... Because he just got a replacement console, and it screwed up his arcade games because...
It was tied to the old console.
But apparently if you're signed in, if you're the one signed in on the console and you bought the game, it will work.
Yeah.
So that's how you can take it.
Like you put it on a memory card and you can take it to somebody else's house.
Sign in, but it's still linked to your account.
Right.
So you have to sign in.
If you copy the game over, it won't work for them.
Is that what I'm hearing?
It sounds like it's going to happen over the Wii.
I'm thinking what you might be able to do, though, with that is you might be able to sign in your account.
Maybe if you bring your Wii controller and that might work.
But right now they're saying you can't just bring your memory card over.
You have to bring the whole console with you.
Which I don't know about that.
I think you can probably bring your profile.
I think that WiiCon is going to have... Yeah, I think the WiiCon has... Because they say that has internal storage in it.
So it certainly could have your Nintendo version of game or card in it.
So... There's that.
And then, of course, what was the other thing?
Vandalist in our chatroom says it sounds like a Steam distribution system.
Yeah, so I don't think that's really going to be an issue at all.
As far as the classic controller, though, you're not going to be able to play GameCube games with that.
Not at all.
Personally, I'd recommend just buying a GameCube controller.
You'll probably find one used right now for dirt cheap, and it would be a lot cheaper than buying the classic controller, I would think.
Especially third-party ones.
Exactly.
Well, if we're ready to move on to the next email, we have two left
This one comes from Chris.
Hi OLR, when my family and I were taking care of my sister's little terrier puppy Molly, when we took her outside to do her business.
She saw someone walking across the street and bolted after the person to see who it was.
Upon reaching the highway that we live on, she was struck by a car and was killed.
This being the first death in the family, I was really upset, but listening to your show helped cheer me up.
I'd just like to say what a wonderful group of people you are and how happy you made me feel.
and how you've made my life a little happier.
God bless you all and I hope you keep doing this show as long as you can.
Wow, that's amazing.
Thank you.
I'm sorry about the puppy, but I don't know what to say really.
I mean, thank you.
We do our best.
Difficult.
Sorry to hear it.
We are crazy people.
Last email comes from Mr. Wonderful.
Hey guys and gal, thanks for keeping all your listeners in the loop about the latest and greatest in gaming.
Just a few quick questions and a brief rant for you all.
First off, I know that there's all the new swirling around about next gen systems and all that, and I'm still desperately hunting down a Wii order.
But there seems to be a real glut of fantastic DS titles coming out in the next week or two.
I wanted to know what portable titles you guys think are worth our time.
I just bought Phoenix Wright Justice for All, the import, and Contact last week, and I'm really loving both of them.
Contact's got a very 16-bit style, great humor, and neat gameplay.
And the instruction book is done up like a live journal, complete with surveys and color bars.
And a surprising lack of emo.
Phoenix Wright is more of the same, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
I saw what the new attorney looks like.
You know, you actually, I think your first suspect is Phoenix himself.
We're talking about Phoenix Wright?
Yeah.
Mikhail Dov asked if we were talking about Phoenix Wright.
Yeah.
Okay.
The DS is having one of its best seasons ever with games like Magical Star Sign, Final Fantasy III, Children of Mana, Elite Beat Agents, which IGN gave a 9.52.
Scourge the Hive.
Yeah, but when does IGN give a score below a 7?
Any information or recommendations or any of those you recommend passing on?
So what games would you guys recommend?
I've heard really good things about Contact.
I actually want to check out this game myself, but it's just too busy of a season for me to pick up games I don't know much about.
Elite Beat Agents, obviously, is going to be a good one, just because, you know, I love Owen Don, so I'm sure Elite Beat Agents is going to be good.
Final Fantasy III looks very promising, but of course, as I've admitted in part A, I'm a whore for all things Final Fantasy.
Yes, it is.
Final Fantasy V, too, because, you know, Game Boy Advance.
And do it in the Advance port as well.
Miglatov, anything you can think of there for the DS?
or PSP.
Well, Luminous 2 for PSP and then you're done.
What about Every Extend Extra or Work Time Fun?
I never played any of those, so I'll play Luminous 2.
I almost bought Work Time Fun today.
Gun Pay is going to be coming out, which is good.
Especially if you're a fan of Luminous.
For PSP, Tony Hawk's Project 8.
That's going to be coming out.
Pimp My Ride, if you like that kind of stuff.
DMN in our chatroom recommends Magical Star Sign
Alex in our chatroom nominates Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team for DS and Zappy says I heard WTF is horrible I don't know I like the demo D3 it was kind of cute well honestly graphically it's a crap game but play wise the things that were in there were just so crazy and out there I mean it seriously looks like somebody just programmed in their spare time but it is so funny also Pokemon Ranger is coming out or actually came out right plenty of suggestions for you my friend
Well, there's not too much.
Given the upcoming busy schedule I'm going to have when I start school in January, I've been trying not to get into too many handheld games because I'm not going to have free time outside of work, school, and my house to play them.
But I am getting Final Fantasy III.
I've planned on that.
I do want Children of Mana, but I'm thinking about borrowing it from my friends when she's done with it.
And I'm definitely getting Elite Beat Agents.
That I'm definitely getting.
Oh yeah, am I getting it?
But keep in mind, we here at OLR have a history of being music game whores.
So if you like your music games, I'm sure you'll like it.
Right now though, I did just pick up the... God, I forgot the name of it again.
Surgery game.
Oh, Trauma Center.
Trauma Center, yeah.
I remembered Under the Knife and I was like... Oh yeah, Trauma Center.
And I'm going to be starting that coming up.
So I'm looking forward to that.
And I have to eventually steal...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
To end things on a happy note, what are your guys' favorite alcoholic drinks?
I really enjoy a nice glass of divorce, 12-year scotch, and pale ales, Oktoberfest, and other tasty specialty beers.
Keep on rockin', Mr. Wonderful.
I've been getting into wine lately.
I know, aren't I weird?
I'm getting snooty.
If I feel like drinking something a little foo-foo, I'll have a lemon drop.
But if I'm going for hardcore, I want to get messed up, I would drink an Irish Car Bomb.
If I want to get messed up, I will drink an Adios, motherfucker.
That's what it's called.
No, no, I, yeah.
I will make them use Patron and not cheap-ass well tequila or I will be throwing up all over everybody.
That's the one problem I have with an adios is I don't like tequila, but otherwise it's a good drink.
I like good tequila.
I had actually, okay, Olive Garden has this, if you like foo-foo drinks, Olive Garden has like the tastiest mixed berry daiquiri.
Oh, Sangria, that's the other thing I've been hooked on lately.
Oh, God, yeah, that's my ultimate foo-foo drink.
I would say for wines, I'm a very big fan of sweet wines.
So I like Umeshu, which is a plum wine.
It's actually real plum wine with the plums in the bottom of it.
Oh, so good.
And I like Honey Runs.
It's elderberry honey wine.
It's basically a fruit mead.
I actually drink mead at Ren Faire.
That's the only time I actually have mead.
Don't drink until you're 21.
or 19 in Canada or whatever it is.
Or whatever country you're in.
But as far as hard alcohol goes, just give me a good Glenfiddich.
Here's our moral thing.
And we do believe this.
We never drive when we drink.
Always have a responsible driver.
And just drink responsibly.
And don't get drunk every night at home by yourself because that's
That's a sign of depression, I think.
I'm not going to say anything.
All right.
I like to have a good beer before I go to bed.
Look, as long as you're not letting your life turn into a Lifetime movie of the week, that's all.
Or an NBC Monday Night movie.
We got a last minute email.
All right.
Apparently DMN thinks that this guy is gay.
Jamie's evil.
Loki is stupid for hating Max.
Love DMN.
Yeah, you gotta love the hate mail.
Wait, we didn't get the favorite alcoholic drinks out of Loki and Miklatov.
Miklatov, do you have a favorite alcoholic drink?
I don't drink anymore.
Why not?
Because I think, well, I won't say why it has to do with some time I shouldn't have drunk, possibly while I was getting paid to do something.
I see, I see, yes.
But if I was still drinking, I really, really liked all the fruity drinks they had at Dave & Buster's.
I don't even remember what they were called, but they were so good.
Ooh, chocolate martini.
No, the grasshopper.
The grasshopper.
The frozen grasshopper's so good.
Actually, Dave & Buster's has a really good lemon drop.
All right, Loki, make it quick.
We've got to get back to games.
Screwdriver.
All right.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your emails.
And maybe we'll get off topic for ten minutes talking about booze.
Let's get back into some news!
A brand new SimCity game and Lord of the Rings Crisis and Army of Two were reported to be delayed into the spring And of course, some other new IPs, or I should say returning IPs A brand new Road Rash game for next gen And of course, Burnout 5, it's been announced for a while now Dude, new Road Rash?
Yeah
Ghost Rider Ghost Rider
have not been arranged in cooperation with Sony or anyone related to Sony.
The statement itself says such offers are not done with any cooperation from SCEA or its parent company.
SCEA strongly recommends against consumers pursuing such offers as their legitimacy cannot be confirmed.
We recommend consumers purchase PlayStation products only from authorized SCEA retailers and resellers.
Which is a big duh anyway.
You know, especially if you're dealing with something that's got a limited shipment.
Don't order them in bulk when no bulk exists to order.
All right.
That's it.
All right, I wanted to fit in just a quick last-minute story because we're about to move into the Skype line and the other last-minute stories.
TigerClaw sent me a link to this talking about Best Buy pre-orders, kind of talking about pre-ordering the PlayStation 3.
Apparently, at a certain point earlier this weekend, Best Buy customers were able to fill out pre-order forms on BestBuy.com, and it looked legit and everything.
And what happened, I guess, is that some folks actually filled out like 12 to 15 of these pre-orders using different accounts.
Very interesting.
This site that ran the story here, PS3 Land, actually called a Best Buy sales rep via the public number and were assured that the pre-order process was a system glitch.
Best Buy is not doing pre-orders and everyone will have to wait.
And everybody that tried to do a pre-order is going to get a refund.
So if you want one from Best Buy, you've got to camp out for it.
We have a new 800 number here, or actually I should say 877, or a toll-free number here at Orange Lawn Radio.
And because of that reason, we've opened up our voicemails of the week again.
I guess word hasn't gotten out because we really only got one voicemail this past week.
But it was pretty good, so we want to play it for you guys right now.
So here it is, a voicemail of the week.
Hey, LLR, it's Paradox Benson.
Yeah, now on...
IndieGuru versus DDR and how fair Konami is.
I agree with DarkSakura.
They just totally stole it.
And on that note, I just think that Session, Damani, rocked them both.
And also, I wanted to know if there's any reason...
and so on.
It says, oh goody, we can play with Japanese players, but some of them can't speak English.
So I don't really see the point in this.
And they're just kind of losing a bigger server base, and I really just don't see the point in this.
So yeah, just keep it up with the show, guys, and I'll be listening for a while.
All right, thank you very much for the voicemail of the week.
We appreciate it.
Mikotov, you're a PSU whore.
What did you think of the voicemail?
So, because I've been playing Phoenix, right?
Objection!
Because you're doing false testimony.
If you've been following PSU for months and months, you'd have known a long time ago that the Xbox 360 and the PC, PS2 servers were separate.
So, you are wrong, and you should not lie on both.
But why?
Why can't they be on the same server?
because Microsoft likes to have their own separate servers for everything.
Final Fantasy was an exception because it was a Squeenix game.
I always thought it was voice chat.
It came down to the fact that 360 supported voice chat within parties.
But you know what?
Who cares?
Have them buy a 360 or you buy a 360.
Problem solved.
Everyone play on PC.
Yeah, play on PC.
I'm going to be playing both.
You're going to play both?
I'm playing both.
That's crazy hard to do.
You're crazy.
You are crazy.
Hey, you don't get misset in that game.
I couldn't support more than one character on one system.
Well, no.
A friend of mine is paying for me to play on the PC with her.
Oh.
So I was like, well, okay.
It's $10 a month.
It's like, what, two burritos?
Yeah.
I said, okay, I'll play on the PC.
And it's something I can do while I'm doing my live journal or doing other stuff.
That's how I did PSO.
And I can carry it around on my laptop.
Tell me how it is on PC, like how it controls.
I'm actually looking for it because if I get my iMac, I'm planning on dual formatting it so I can run Windows on my iMac.
Alright, well we are looking forward to getting more voicemails of the week.
The phone number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, 1-877-426-3657.
That's toll free in the US and Canada.
Hey, we'll take just about any topic, but what we really want to know is, because we only really have next week to be able to play your stories on this.
We want to know if you are going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3 or a Wii.
And try to keep it under two minutes, but what we want to know is which system are you camping out for and why?
And what are your plans for camping out?
What store are you going to go to?
Are you going with a big group of friends?
We want to know what your campout plans are for.
Even if you're not camping out, we want to know why you're not camping out and sitting this one out.
So we welcome your voicemails.
We'll play some of our favorites next week.
1-877-GAME-OLR
1-877-426-3657.
Now we're going to open up the Skype line and take some calls here on Orange Lounge Radio.
And it's that same number, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username is Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who is this?
It's Ranma.
No, I'm just kidding.
It's DMN.
Hi DMN, what's on your mind, buddy?
DMN!
Not much.
I picked up Elite Beat Agents and Magical Stars sign over the weekend here, and I'd like to share my opinion of them.
He's a dirty cheater for giving Elite Beat Agents early.
I know, you get it.
I really want it.
What's your opinion on them?
Elite Beat Agents is under the Touch Generations label, which makes me a little more understanding of the questionable song list, as most people have been questionable of it.
The gameplay is exactly like Owen Don.
It has the same comic book feel to it.
It's freaking hilarious.
And surprisingly, a lot of the songs are a lot of fun to play.
The game gets a little ridiculously hard on the medium setting on the last three or four songs.
Avril Lavigne
The Skaterboy stage is about a guy driving a taxi across town because some lady's about to have a baby.
What about Canned Heat?
What's that stage like?
The Canned Heat stage is basically a guy at the Japanese motor company.
His son goes through the rival motor company who's stolen the plans, dressed up as a ninja.
That makes a lot of sense.
It does.
It does.
What about the other game you picked up quickly?
Magical Star Sign is a very, very good RPG.
I would recommend it as more so of a beginning RPG.
I enjoyed it.
My only beef with it was it felt very linear.
Basically, it said, go here, go here.
It didn't really make it fun.
I haven't had a chance to try the multiplayer mode on it, unfortunately, so I can't give any information on that.
I'd recommend it.
It's a fun RPG.
It's got a lot of fun little blurbs of text in it.
It keeps up with the times.
I would highly recommend it.
Alright, sounds good.
Well, that can go back to that emailer who emailed us earlier looking for good DS and portable games.
Any other thoughts you want to share with our listeners tonight?
No.
Alright, then we're going to another call.
Hey, we'll see you pretty soon, okay?
All right, take care.
Later.
All right, we're going to go to another call here on the Skype line.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
That's 1-877-426-3657.
So let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hi, Jeremy Todd 1.
Hey, Jeremy Todd 1.
What's on your mind?
Um...
I got Luminous for cell phone a couple days ago.
Oh yeah, I remember Jamie was telling us about that last week.
How was it?
It's pretty good so far.
I think they did a pretty good job on it.
I'm not sure what to say about it.
Okay.
I'm doing a good job on this.
Isn't it really surprising?
What?
Isn't it really surprising just how well it turned out?
Yeah, I...
I'm glad I bought it.
It's only five bucks and it's pretty good.
Jamie, I've got to play you sometime.
Can you play that one to Cell Network?
I don't know, Jamie.
I can, actually.
Really?
That's kind of cool.
Like with Jules, you could do that.
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah, I've played a few matches with online and there's no lag either.
Gears of War Tuesday, Boop
I think that was an endorsement of Gears of War.
All right, take care, buddy.
Have a good one.
Bye.
Yep, you too.
Thanks.
Bye.
All right, we're going to go to another call here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Well, hello.
How are you guys?
I'm good.
Who is this?
You know who the fuck this is, Rob.
If I'm not mistaking from the caller ID, it is the one and only Travis Donovan, who we announced in Part A is going to be having a show on Orange Lounge Radio pretty soon, yes?
Yes, I've crossed over to the dark side.
That's right.
I think years when we started Orange Lounge Radio, you said you'll never do anything with us, and yet hell has apparently frozen over.
And to go back to something way back in the U.S.
old times, I tried to get over the rainbow, and I couldn't.
That's an in-joke, folks, between Rob and I. That's all right.
Folks who may have been following the Understation Live for years might follow it.
You know, we do have some folks here.
Still every other year, right?
What was that?
Still every other year?
What, did we do a USL?
No, the old, old joke about being gay every other year.
Oh, that's right.
It's an even year.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
That means I'll be gay next year.
Oh, looking forward to that.
All right, what can folks who tune in on Saturday and listen to the Travis Donovan experience, what do they have to look forward to?
You mean you couldn't tell by the promo?
Yeah, it was a little geeky.
Somebody had to fill me in that it was a Doctor Who reference because I didn't get it.
I'm out there.
It's the trailer.
It's fantastic.
It is from the season one teaser that they used for the ninth Doctor.
Yeah, the ninth Doctor.
Which I think is fantastic.
I'm big.
I'm, you know, out there.
Now, you're going to be doing call-ins on your program as well and doing the chat and everything so folks can interact with your program just like they can with us.
So, right?
Yeah, definitely.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I will be games that I'm currently playing which is not a lot but there are games that I'm out there playing but we will be talking sci-fi and geek like I will be going on a tirade of why Battlestar Galactica is the best goddamn show on television excellent
and stuff like that.
Current events, geek shit, stuff that I find funny and with my twisted brain everybody else should find just as funny.
Now, I know you play music on your program, but at any point will you be offering a podcast version of your program that has the music taken out or anything like that?
I am looking into that.
Basically, it depends on how fucking lazy I am.
Alright, well,
Everybody tune in on Saturday.
Come and chat.
Support Travis.
And then he'll see he has to offer his show up in MP3 downloadable format.
Yes, definitely show up.
Let me know what's going on.
Be interactive with the show because when one person does the show by themselves, you'll see how it can turn out if you listen and nobody participates.
Also, I'm going to be putting some links up in the chat room of some of Rob's greater moments in USL history.
Jesus.
All right.
I guess just...
Encouragement to listen live to the various OLR programming.
Get Rob Blackmail.
That's nice.
Yeah, and I'll have my hate mail section, which I love it because unlike Jamie, who has a sense of decency and politeness, it's oh so small.
It's a small percentage of her being.
I, on the other hand, will give out your email address.
No, no, I was actually, I actually was going to do that to that one person that emailed twice, but he only emailed back with yawn, so that means I owned him majorly in the email.
But I think I still might post it, though, because it was pretty funny.
All right, should be fun.
All right, well, good luck on Saturday, Travis, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio Collective.
You have been assimilated.
No, in all seriousness, we're very excited to have you on board and look forward to what you're going to do for Orange Lounge on Saturday.
Well, thank you.
Thank you for having me.
I'm glad to have an opportunity to continue my train wreck that I call my show.
No problem.
And I guarantee controversy for geeks out there on the first show.
My main topic will be why Stargate SG-1 deserves to be canceled and pull off the air.
Ooh, sounds good.
Actually, given what I've heard about Season 9, yeah, sadly.
I love Stargate, but yeah.
What was I going to say?
Something about, oh, forget it.
I can't remember because I'm old.
Tune in Saturday.
Yes.
That's all.
That's Rob.
Gay Alzheimer's.
Shut up.
I'm hanging up on you now because I can do that now.
Yes.
All right.
Have a good one, Travis.
You too.
Bye.
Oh, God.
Did we make a mistake inviting him on?
I don't know.
No, but sadly, I'm not going to be able to call in and argue SG-1 with him.
I don't know.
I might call in and debate some sci-fi.
But for right now, we've got to go to another call that maybe we can debate with.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, guys.
This is Foodie Monster.
Hi, Foodie Monster.
What's on your mind?
It's pretty late, man.
I'll tell you that.
This whole East Coast, West Coast thing is hiring me up the roof, seriously.
You guys are a brave lot, the ones that stay up in the other time zones and other countries even that stay up very late.
You guys are hardcore.
You've earned your OLR badge of honor.
Just every other night.
What's on your mind, buddy?
I just wanted to share something that popped out of my mind a few weeks ago and I wanted to write about, but I just figured I would call.
What's that?
I remember the one time you guys were talking about how mainstream games are, but you've got to think about it.
Games are not going to be mainstream until all the markets in the world are tapped.
And that's not just United States, Europe, and Japan.
That's South America.
That's Central America, that's Africa, those places also needed to be tapped for this segment, this industry that we love to be really mainstream.
I mean, movies are everywhere.
You can go to a movie theater in Africa if you want, but you won't find too much gaming in Africa.
That's an interesting perspective.
I've kind of never thought about it that way, but I know a lot of folks were joking about how, oh, Sony is doing this worldwide launch, but apparently the world doesn't include Europe.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and certain South American countries as well.
It goes beyond that.
There's no official distribution of games or consoles in South America, for instance.
Not in my country, not in Brazil, not in any country in South America has official distributions of games.
Nintendo, I think 10 or 15 years ago, had an official distributor or licensing here in Argentina, but
and so on.
Yeah, but it's double the price.
I thought you said the PS3, and I was like, wait a minute.
So gaming is more expensive, generally, in the other countries.
Do you think it would get cheaper if they were to open up a Nintendo of Argentina or whatever?
Well, I mean, they should at least have a Nintendo of or a Sony of at least one continent to make things cheaper for all the markets.
Is there enough of a demand?
I mean, we have like, I think, five gaming magazines in this country, and we have 35 million people.
I would say yes.
Interesting.
I mean, sure, I mean, it's not as much, probably that's why they don't do it, because there's not much market, you know.
I mean, if you consider with the numbers of the United States or Japan or Europe in general, it's not enough market, I guess.
Hmm.
Well, we appreciate the perspective from, you know, Argentina.
We appreciate that.
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight?
No, but I have a quick review of my magic die, so now I can't play my backups, which has me very sad.
Sorry to hear it.
All right, have a good one, buddy.
Thanks for calling.
Okay, you too, guys.
Later.
See ya.
See ya.
Let's go to one more call.
What, Miklatov?
Okay, let's go to one more call here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Hey, this is Paradox Vincent.
Hi, Paradox Vincent.
Hey, you left us the voicemail.
Yes.
Ah, what's on your mind?
Oh, did it get played?
Yeah, we actually played your voicemail and Miklatov called you a liar because he said if you've been following the Phantasy Star Universe thing like you said in your voicemail, then you would have known that the servers were separate.
Well, I just kind of want to be the advocate to the Luminous Live kind of ordeal.
Yeah, what's on your mind?
Well, I actually really liked playing it just on the TV because of
I don't know, it was just kind of nice to get it off of my PSP.
So you have a PSP and you have Luminous on the PSP?
Yes.
And you didn't feel like the Xbox was a lesser value?
You felt that the value of being able to play it on your TV kind of offset all that microtransaction crap aside?
Yeah, kind of.
Because I didn't really see it being so overblown.
Kind of like the Gran Turismo HD game.
Okay, so they have it at least somewhat in check.
I guess that's true.
Now we're starting to see even the EA, like Need for Speed and Gran Turismo certainly kind of outdo it in the microtransactions department.
I suppose that's true.
So what else is it that you like about the Luminous?
What does the Xbox give you that the PSP doesn't?
Or is it just the TV plop on the couch and be overcome with all the Luminous around you that kind of gets you into it?
Yeah, it's kind of that, because I just have a really bad CRT screen, but I can still see just like a giant leap in the resolution.
You know what, though?
Now, Mikotov, was that you that was telling me that you thought the increased resolution was sometimes a problem in Lumis?
Yeah, I think that it gets too bright, and it's a little too sharp for constantly staring at it,
Over and over and over.
Hours on hours.
I don't usually have a problem playing video games, but some of those luminous stages make me want to have a seizure.
Yeah, that one in the basic pack, that's...
I think it's like blue and pink, but it's neon blue and neon pink.
That hurts my eyes.
It's the stage of the light green and dark green that messes with me.
I hate that one.
The one from the stupid first game.
What other extras will you be downloading, you think, for Luminous Live?
Are you going to get the artist pack and the CPU pack?
What else do you think you're going to buy?
It kind of depends on the artist pack.
because if they're having Beck and Kenny Shee, then I'm definitely downloading it from what I've heard.
I think it was maybe Luminous 2 for the PSP that had them because I'm a giant fan of those.
Right on.
But if it's like Madonna, Gwen Stefani, and Fergie, then no thank you?
Yeah, kind of.
Yeah.
I am a big fan of the Barbie mode in my games.
But I think that that could really work if they added a ton of microtransactions
but made them very small and very kind of typecasted.
Okay.
Do you think they had a charge per skin?
Charge per skin?
In Luminous?
That would be awesome because then you could get rid of those crappy songs that you don't like, like that bird one that's green and white.
I hate that stage so much.
All right.
Well, Paradox Vincent, thanks so much for calling in.
We've got to move on.
Do you have any other quick final thoughts for our listeners?
Um, not really kind of a final thought.
But, uh, yeah, alright.
Okay.
Have a good one, buddy.
Thanks for calling in.
Alright, you too, guys.
Bye.
Sometimes it's hard to be under the gun and get that pressure at the last minute.
Think of something clever to say.
Maybe if he wasn't lying earlier, he could have... Oh, he admitted you pwned him.
I know, because I'm awesome.
What a nice guy.
I would have tried to fight you.
And I would have found inconsistency with your testimony then, too.
Do you want to do one more call?
One more call.
We're running a little long.
We have time for one more call?
One more?
What do you guys think?
One more?
All right, one more.
Sure, let's do it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
It's Zach from the chat room.
It's who?
and Zappy from the chat room.
Zappy!
Hi, what's on your mind, Zappy?
I've been playing Medal of Honor for the PSP for like a week, past week and a half, and it's actually pretty decent.
Like, I don't find the missing second analog actually hurts the gameplay at all.
Wait, which game was this again?
Because you're cutting out a little bit.
Oh, sorry.
Medal of Honor for the PSP.
Ah.
So, and you're saying that it's not as bad as people are saying, or what?
Yes.
You just have to use the left analog instead of having both of them and actually controlling pretty well.
I actually find the controllers better than the ones on consoles because I'm used to playing PC first person shooters.
Now, Zappy, these usually aren't the type of video games that I play.
So, you know, knowing that I'm not usually into the war type of games, but I do like occasional first-person shooters.
Like, you know, I kind of like Prey, and I really like my old-school Doom and, you know, Quake 3 and stuff.
Try to sell me on this game.
What's in this game that I might enjoy?
Well, probably the best part of it is the three-player multiplayer.
It has all the modes, and you can just play anywhere that has a Wi-Fi connection, so that's a pretty good selling point.
You don't see a lot of PSP games with Wi-Fi.
That's kind of cool.
Okay.
I like.
Even SOCOM only has 16 players in it.
All right.
Well, thank you for the review of the game.
Any other thoughts for our listeners tonight, Zappy?
Well, I'm probably going to go to the Arcadia convention next week, and I'll give you some hands-on on how it is.
Are you not far from Montreal?
No.
I'm in Montreal.
Oh, right on.
What other kinds of stuff?
Have they been advertising this around town or was this the first you heard of it or what?
Well, I heard from some friends and I also saw it on Joystick.
Although I haven't seen any real advertisements like on Billboard.
No, not Billboard, but like the pamphlets or anything.
I haven't actually seen anything physically advertising it.
That's a little bit worrisome, but hopefully they've had a really strong online campaign or maybe, you know, flyers in the local game stores or something, I would hope.
Well, this is the second year doing it.
I didn't go last year, but they're going to have the Wii, like, an update change early, so I just want to try it out.
Yeah, that's true, because Nintendo's one of the sponsors, so you better believe you're going to see the Wii.
That's pretty cool.
Well, yeah, definitely go to Arcadia.
We want to report and spread the word of Orange Launch Radio to your fellow Canadians.
We love Canada here at Orange Launch Radio.
Great to hear.
All right.
Have a good one, Zappy.
We've got to let you go and get the show over with.
But have a good one.
Thanks for calling in.
All right.
Have fun at Arcadia.
Later.
All right.
Oh, that was a hang-up noise.
All right.
Thank you guys so much for calling in.
We got hammered tonight, that 800 number.
It's given us some new folks on the line, and now some of the folks who used to get through every week are getting frustrated.
But surely you guys can understand.
We want to get as many different perspectives as we can.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Okay, well anyways, I was going to say, if you're looking for a PS3 or a Nintendo Wii, there's a couple websites you might want to check out.
First, ps3seeker.com.
You can check it out.
They actually are kind of tied in with Google Maps, and you can pull up pretty much all the target locations and what they're getting as far as allocations for the Wii, or PS3.
And then, of course, the Wii would be ps3seeker.com.
So check that out as well for...
The Wii, and then some other things.
Of course, if you happen to be a fan of Sony, this is probably not going to make you too happy, but the PS3 is going to be pushing Sony into the red by $1.7 billion.
That's how much money they're going to lose on the launch, which is kind of nuts.
You might want to check your Best Buy here pretty soon because apparently Gears of War is in their store right now.
or at least at some Best Buys.
Uh-oh, broken street date.
Oopsie.
Oh, well.
So you might want to check and see if you can score or copy early because that would be pretty cool.
And, of course, there's a few other things coming to the portable systems.
Geometry Wars is coming to cell phones, which looks interesting.
I'm not sure how well that would play.
And then PSP is getting pumped up in Korea, so that's kind of interesting.
And also something that I thought was interesting,
Very strange.
The Blu-ray, since the Blu-ray drives are going to be first generation for the PS3, they're going to be kind of slow, so a lot of the games are actually having you install a good portion of it onto the hard drive, which is going to eat up lots of the hard drives.
For example, Ridge Racer is going to have you install 5 gigs of the game onto your hard drive.
Imagine all these other games doing the same thing.
That's going to eat up your 20 gigs or 60 gigs pretty quick.
And, um,
Finally, with the fall update for the 360 adding 1080p support, unfortunately some of the Sony LCD and Plasma TVs are not supported.
Isn't that ironic?
Isn't it?
Don't you think?
It's like Ray Yane.
Hey, hey, no Alanis.
Alright.
There was a story that Loki pointed to me earlier.
It was on Dick.com, but I found actually...
A bit more about it on magazine.com.
You can find pictures of it by looking for Lego Pinball Machine.
It's a working Lego pinball machine.
Yes, made out of 20,000 Lego bricks and 13 RCX units.
So that's so freaking cool.
I had one last story here real quick, and this is a juicy one.
There's a rumor going around that Zelda and Twilight Princess might be two-player.
and the rumors coming from both IGN.com and a pre-order ticket from Toys R Us that both state that Zelda is one of the two players.
So, that's kind of interesting.
I guess we'll have to find out.
Hmm.
Sure enough, it's just not a misprint or something?
It could be, but it's two different places, so... Who knows?
Alright, well, um...
DJ Tyrant's Birthday
Happy Birthday to all our listeners that have a birthday right around this period.
Maybe we should have a birthday list.
Right at the end of every show we'll say, happy birthday to these listeners.
We'll see.
Anyway, seriously though, we've got to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Miklatov, thank you for your rare input as always, but thanks for being the moral support you are for this program.
Actually, you hate this show, don't you?
So I'm not sure why you come on it.
But what's your final thought anyway?
I don't want to go to work tomorrow.
And don't.
Okay.
Loki, what's your final thought?
Motorstorm looks sexy, despite the fact that it sucked at E3.
All right.
DarkSakura.
Apart from the obvious reject false icons, I want to go home and play with my toys.
And my final thought is, God, I really want some pie right now.
Like, pumpkin pie would be awesome.
Oh well, I'll have to wait until next week.
And so will you for more Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks so much for tuning in to us and supporting Independent Radio.
You guys are awesome.
We couldn't do this without you.
Have a great week.
We'll see you next time.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
