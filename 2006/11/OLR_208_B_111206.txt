Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.
To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th of 2006.
And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air because it's getting kind of cold now.
So I'm a little bit more calmed down.
I'm not quite as hyper as I was during the first segment.
I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.
But then again, at the same time, I don't apologize because that's me.
Take it or leave it.
If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe to.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The Central Buddy List and the Messaging System.
It's going to go for all titles.
Basically, it's... I suppose to make it easier, more user-friendly, so that you don't have login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.
It's all on there.
But they were basically saying that... They were actually saying that specific to Resistance, the game coming out that...
is going to be using the same login.
I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot about PlayStation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind.
I don't want to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, because I'm a fanboy of all three.
But Microsoft seriously has online down.
They're doing it the best, and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne from them this time around.
So, I don't know.
It's very little that we know about Sony's PlayStation 3 and the online stuff.
What I've seen so far, though, still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior online.
As it was last generation.
But I would have thought that this generation, the other two would have been... But Nintendo's really had to play catch-up, and I think their friend code thing kind of hurts them a little bit.
I don't know.
The friend code thing, in that respect, though, I think sort of protects...
I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer, it doesn't make it any easier.
But then again, on live, you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know are your friends.
Right.
And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's probably like Super Smash Bros.
Trophy Room, or like a lot of Nintendo games do, is that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.
Yay, crap!
I love crap!
Alright.
Anyway.
Here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my PlayStation 3 when I finally get one.
There's going to be...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's something you create in the cross-media bar, and there's a memory card utility, and then you can actually create a PlayStation 1 card and a PlayStation 2 card, name them, and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.
So it's like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.
So that's how it's going to work on the PlayStation 3, if you were curious.
And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.
Makes sense.
That's pretty cool.
I wonder if I can load my virtual...
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Heavenly Sword
which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways is slated for a 2007 release also in March and of course their flagship title Warhawk is in the summer now so that's kind of interesting but basically another reason why maybe waiting for a PlayStation 3 is a good idea because some of the bigger games are coming out later on.
ShadowNextGen said, Excite Truck does have achievements.
It may or may not.
Yes, we've heard it does.
I'm not disputing that part.
But we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.
The cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements my friends have and I can see what their score is.
And then these other fan-created things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like MyGamerCard.net, which is a very cool site.
Which, by the way, we have the OL Army site.
Gamers... What do we call it?
The OL Army E-Penis Leaderboard or something like that?
Where it's tracking all our gamer scores.
And you're on there, and you're on there, and I'm on there.
And if you want to join, check out our forums and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund.
But will the Wii have anything like that?
I don't think so, because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.
Now, that's not going to break the system.
It's just kind of surprising that they didn't
Embrace the online in that way.
Because I think not being online kind of killed them last round.
But that's just my opinion, I suppose.
What do I know?
I'm just some guy on the internet.
Well, back to different PS3 news.
And actually a few people have already told me their experiences with this.
You can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk.
The game's available on MotorStorm and NBA 07.
But according to one of our listeners, it crashed, I think, every, what, five minutes?
I believe that it was JVmon mentioned it.
What, was it overheating or what was it doing?
Probably overheating.
Oh, at Best Buy, sorry.
It was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes.
But, um, but there's the playable kiosks at, uh... Well, that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show, too.
But, I guess it was a different environment.
I'm not surprised!
Interesting.
Well, as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care about.
Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently the only way it was staying on.
No, but, uh, anyways.
Um, of course, like most anything else that's being released nowadays, you know, right as it comes out,
It's going to be upgraded.
And of course, that's the same with the PlayStation 3.
You will be getting a firmware update on launch day.
And it will basically allow you to utilize the PlayStation Network functions.
So, you know, not a big surprise, but they're doing the same thing with the Wii when that comes out there.
You have to do a firmware update as well for that.
But
I don't know.
I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early and be able to get them manufactured.
And if that means adding a firmware update later on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so be it.
Because if they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting two PS3s instead of 400,000.
All right.
Well...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
NBA Street HomeCourt instead of porting NBA Live 07.
And HomeCourt will be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.
All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live 08.
And HomeCourt, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February.
So it shouldn't be too bad.
Anyways, um... There is also a lot of other, uh, you know, PlayStation 3 delays, you know, coming out.
Um... You know, pretty much, you know, with everything, just, you know, as we mentioned earlier, we're talking about, you know, Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that.
So, um, you know, it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff's being delayed.
But, um... Anyways, um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
And this makes me very, very, very sad.
Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3.
In fact, in a quote released by IGN, they said they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3.
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.
When you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.
They're basically saying that since the
The controller doesn't have the button.
You can't actually activate it and you can't swap out the controller to change it in.
because you'll need to turn on the analog and, of course, the SG doesn't have analog, so... So, in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will not be working on the PlayStation 3.
There is no physical way to make it work.
So, would that go the same with, like, say, DDR, Beatmania, anything that uses an additional controller?
Well, it's interesting because I have a last-minute update here.
BomaniStyle just posted a story this evening because, you know, the PS3's out in Japan now and they're trying some backwards compatibility there and they're saying...
Poppin' Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds.
Poppin' Music Disney has timing issues with the background music.
Poppin' Music 2 is missing some images.
And let's see, Beatmania Best Hits has timing issues.
6 Mix and Core has background music as well as Beatmania The Sounds of Tokyo.
The timing's off in Godamix.
Some of the graphics don't appear in Godamix 2.
And Disney...
DDR Max 6 Mix.
The background doesn't always play correctly, which of course is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time and correctly, so it pretty much makes the game unplayable.
Are you talking about the background videos, though?
No, background music doesn't always play correctly.
Beatmania 2DX
Is that 100% compatibility?
Not quite.
I don't think it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kutaragi.
So it's funny because somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kutaragi's on fire!
Kutaragi's on fire!
It was funny to me in that moment.
He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons.
But he was on fire, running around on fire.
So now we have him...
Eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym, and on fire.
Well, someone who thinks Kutaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell.
You might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari.
You know, he's the granddaddy of Pong.
He said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in the foot.
There is a high probability they will fail.
The price point is probably unsustainable.
For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer standpoint.
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
on one of the blogs today that talked about how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast and everybody said Dreamcast has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than PS2 can, Dreamcast can do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed.
So people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online.
Will history repeat itself?
We have to listen to him because he brought us Pizza Time Theater.
Dreamcast didn't play DVDs.
and at that time, DVDs were just breaking.
And I think, you know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray and Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.
I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.
I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD.
DVD was already somewhat established and everybody knew it was the next.
This time you have a split.
People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going to be the winner.
You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you gonna get a Blu-ray?
They go, what's that?
You gonna get an HD DVD?
What?
I have a DVD player.
What?
I have an HD TV.
No, you're gonna get an HD DVD.
What?
So, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.
Exactly.
If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.
Anyways, other interesting things about, also, we were talking about the backwards compatibility on games and how it's not working.
Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not a huge surprise, but Japanese PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.
Because the games are region-coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions.
But that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.
Thanks for watching!
Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background music correctly Xena Saga Episode 2, the opening movie sometimes stops Mega Man X7, background music won't play properly sometimes Devil May Cry, screen sometimes freezes during the title demo Suikoden 3, can't read PlayStation 1 data during the game Silent Hill 2, when going from title to demo, the screen may freeze Issues... That sounds like a lot of games
Oh, maybe that's what the day one firmware update's all about.
Who knows?
Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there, so... Oh, ouch.
Oopsie.
Good point, good point.
All right, well, anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners think of all this console mania going on this week.
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelawnradio.com, and DarkSakura puts on the rubber gloves and dives in headfirst into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails to read for you folks.
Don't you, DarkSakura?
When I'm ready.
The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.
Alright.
This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.
I love that name.
You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.
A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing...
And that's about pre-ordering Halo 3 The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game Here's where the bullshit begins He said that the regular edition was just the game The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons The assault rifle 2 and the spike shot Have the first two games on the second disc come with the making of DVD Every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc Yeah, right
and have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.
Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie would include something like that, etc.
My classmate leaves, I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, Sir, I read the article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.
He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie so you should read it more carefully next time.
Needless to say, I now go to the other game shop in town.
You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that.
And when I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far.
And then it got to the helmet thing.
I'm like, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You can't wear the helmet, stupid.
Unless his head's really tiny.
He has a tiny head.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
They don't know who I am.
I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies.
But they assume things about me because I'm older and I play games.
They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.
I'm kind of sick of that attitude.
I'm not going into game stores to get told what games or that I should be buying the guidebook because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.
That only worked when Dan was a manager.
Well,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and, um, they, the guy treated me like I was royalty.
I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition stuff.
And instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I was like, okay, I can do that for you.
And he went and got the game, and I was like, do you have Luminous 2?
And the guy was like, um, no, not, you know, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.
Let me make a call.
And he called another store, he was gonna have it shipped ordered, and he's like, I won't even charge you a pre-order because the game already came out.
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Don't treat your customers like dirt, because you never know who you're pissing off, you know, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.
Can I ask which store you went to?
Which one in particular?
It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's... Oh, that's not the one then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's the one that your hubby used to work at years ago.
I think I know who the manager of that store is.
I don't care anymore.
It doesn't matter.
It's a lost cause now.
No, I mean the GameCrazy.
Oh, the GameCrazy I went to was in the... Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I actually know about four managers of Game Crazies, too.
Well, he's a nice guy.
He's a nice guy.
Well, my experience with... SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.
He was not hitting on me, you jackass.
My experience with the Game Stops, you know, usually it's...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Alright, well, the next one comes from Jason.
It says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.
A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against the Xbox in general.
So can you tell me if this is true?
Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?
Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show.
I never miss it.
and DarkSakura.com
Way later on, once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.
Doesn't HDMI, though, give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your regular eyes?
Unless you have, like, Borg vision or something.
HDMI is basically, it's like kind of...
Thanks for watching!
In a way, you can be able to do it, and maybe later on down the line, that might be an issue, but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line, they're going to release some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.
Who was the emailer that just sent that in?
What was their name?
Jason.
Jason.
Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here and bring your friend into the room, and we're going to give a special message to your friend right here.
Okay, so stop right here.
All right.
Hi Jason's friend, this is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you, you're wrong.
Hugs and kisses.
We love ya.
I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments, and I wanted to read them.
Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.
Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their jobs.
No, I just don't want to carry on a stupid conversation with them.
I hate talking to people.
That's a whole different story.
I will pretend to be better than them.
That's true.
Loki's just an asshole, is what it is.
It's not that he thinks he's better than you.
He's just a dick.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
at my work, so I understand.
One more comment, I promise, Jamie.
But this is from Brad from PodCulture, and he's cool.
I like Brad.
We got a comment from him.
But he was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Phantasy Star Universe.
They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.
He's 36, he admits.
Their first comment was, this is for your kid?
Dot, dot, dot.
They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee content in it.
Apparently you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I gotta sell it on eBay.
You know what happens when you assume, you make an asset out of you and me.
Well, this next email comes from TheAfroGuy.
Hey, OLR, I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.
My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully, um, Canis Canem ate it, because I think he's emailing from overseas.
He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really does feel like a living, breathing school.
Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for hours on Grand Theft Auto.
The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.
I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw him on the ground, and spit on him.
His reaction was, oh, never done that before.
However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.
What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.
And that was in quotes, by the way.
Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly a shock to our parents.
My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of harmless teasing.
And there's a footnote on here.
I love emails with footnotes.
said, if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.
To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame, and soon it will be on its way to a pre-owned rack in-game.
Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place in a school, and those acting violently are around his age.
Therefore, Rockstar should...
I'm sorry, should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't interest young teenagers.
I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play bully, but perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.
Thanks for the showing.
Keep up the good work, the Afro guy.
I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework, my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know what she was doing.
She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games so I had to do my own work.
I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.
If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting and it sounds a little bit vague, sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.
He needs to be punished.
I do have to say that if
If it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.
I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial evidence that it would be, then removing the game, it's smart, I think.
DarkSakura.com
is this game appropriate for my child?
And if the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from nonfiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.
Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.
For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.
It just depends on the child.
I can also understand that for at least...
People of a like age in that game Because it's one thing for a kid I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference In a kid playing Grand Theft Auto Because technically they're not adults It's something that they know they have no real way of doing
But a kid can go into school and basically be a bully.
FloWalk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking about, but I like this.
I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.
I made the kid eat grass.
But his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high heel, that bitch.
You got your ass kicked by a girl.
I've been in two fights in school, honestly.
Well, I've had like...
I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me.
One time there was this guy, he was the school bully.
I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.
I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks after school once, but I just didn't go.
I was like, what are they going to do?
CallMeNames.
Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.
So I just didn't go.
What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.
Because I just, I can't stand that type of thing.
The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and punched her in the nose.
Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.
Make it quick.
We've got to get back to the game.
Okay, her name was Myra.
And if you're listening, you deserved it.
She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.
I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.
Wasn't Myra the chick in Tiny Toons that was like, I'm gonna love it, it's squeezing?
Oh, sorry, my bad.
But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.
It was my journal and a couple other books.
And she even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her, and she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.
But did you learn that from River City Ransom?
River City Ransom
Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter.
I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.
The last email comes from John D.,
Hey guys, well yes, this is my first email to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.
I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting in that I was actually really good.
I was playing the 8 plus star songs which made me laugh.
But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters in Super Smash Bros.
Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?
Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.
with all due respect to the listener we're glad we got a new listener in a first email I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month but I'm going to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener so welcome to the show and I don't mean to tease you we do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers I
You know, the fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it does make a good fit.
Don't gur at me, Drew Nami.
That was already in Air Guys.
I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Bros.
Other characters I want to see, I definitely want to see Tom Nook.
I want to see Tom Nook.
Tom Nook is a bastard.
He'll take all my money.
That'll be a special move.
I want... Do you have somebody?
Little Mac.
Yeah, that'd be cool.
I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rain Man.
Oh, interesting speculation.
Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.
Sonic, which, you know, Sega and, you know, the GameCube were just, like, best buddies.
So, of course, makes perfect sense.
And also to that listener...
Download some Parapara videos off of YouTube and type Parapara Girls into YouTube or whatever it is, Parapara Deluxe or Velfair or whatever.
Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Parapara Paras.
I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it.
That's random.
So that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.
All right.
That was the last email, yes?
That was the last email.
Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can do that anytime you want.
Just send us an email.
It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
We look forward to hearing from you.
We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
And we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for you guys.
And last week we asked...
Are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3?
Are you going to be camping out for any of them?
Or what are you going to be doing?
And we got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now.
One of our voicemails of the week here.
Hey guys, it's DJ Tyrant.
Just calling in about the voicemail of the week.
Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.
I pre-ordered it at the electronics boutique that I work at.
and I also got a gift card for Best Buy for my birthday so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up my system and Zelda and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.
Calling in for a quick question.
Wondering what other launch titles I should pick up besides Zelda.
DarkSakura, Rebuttal
I say Red Steel all the way.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Or is it maybe crappy?
Maybe you think it's crappy.
You're in the minority of folks there.
Send us a voicemail.
We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.
Otherwise, we get confused.
Anyway, back to the story.
The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?
And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.
They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line Stand.
And some quotes here.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Bullet point, there's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.
So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting it.
You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you, know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.
I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.
Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.
Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring something to make your $600 less conspicuous?
Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags, but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous.
So maybe you want to bring something to hide it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000 for that, da-da-da-da-da-da.
Have fun camping in the lines.
We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.
Yeah, Drunami says wear deodorant.
Good idea.
Bring extra.
Just bring extras for others.
Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.
All right.
Anyways, so other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, you know, better known for ruining E3.
But, um,
Are they games?
Yes.
Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?
Yes.
Are they then video games?
I think that's not a bad title.
What's there to not understand?
He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products were categorized as something more serious than a game.
Because entertainment is a serious business!
Oh, really?
Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying, how about shut the fuck up?
So, if we called, like, that, I mean, that's kind of retarded, because if you think about it, okay, say we called them interactive entertainment or something like that.
So, say, for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided to call rape candy, would, I mean, would...
Oh, well, you know, candy's good.
I like candy.
Oh, oh, crap.
I mean, I don't like rape.
I'm confused.
I like candy only when they say yes.
Candy is delicious.
So we're smoothies.
Hadn't played the game.
Didn't know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game.
Or, like, you know, claim to have played it online, despite the fact that's impossible.
I think that no matter what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people.
And it doesn't matter how you dress up turd, it's still a turd.
You know, that's basically it.
Wow.
Alright.
Well...
You know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.
Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?
Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.
A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo... Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?
Candy is delicious.
Anyway... Wow, we're gonna get emails on this, I already know.
No, okay, okay, I have to tell you, there is an in-joke about candy.
in one of my circles.
Anyway, a 31 year old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or Alive was basically sexually harassing her.
The compensation she is looking for Rob
Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million... Rob, what the hell?
It's candy, get it?
This candy is not so delicious.
Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843.
said that he started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.
She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become.
But he's basically saying that she wanted it.
But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to it.
Tiara's sitting over in the corner going, I want candy.
Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.
Stop laughing!
I'm not laughing!
It's a serious matter!
Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was sexual harassment related to the man who created DOA, I still like the bouncing...
The Bounciness, because it's like completely against the laws of physics.
But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.
It's like, hey baby, you want to model for my next big game?
Dark Knight in our chatroom says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.
That was a political joke.
I like that one.
Harr.
Well, this is no joke.
Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.
It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.
Maybe not quite that level.
Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.
And there's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?
There's been an ad that ran in... what was this?
Gears of War.
I'm sorry, it was in Gears of War.
There was a little ad in there, and it said...
Check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer demo Which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace soon Kind of cool So for those folks that are anticipating that game And I gotta say, I played the first demo And I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?
This is boring I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't into it at all It's a pretty game, and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish
No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.
Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo-goo-ga-ga over that game.
Lost Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.
It's exactly Gears of War.
It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.
A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.
Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War.
Just like Prey is Gears of War.
Except, no, that's a first-person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.
But, like,
You can't die in Prey.
Respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.
You know, seeing them as almost like degenerates or scum of the earth.
So yeah, that's pretty cool.
And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, you know, who have been behind this for a while now.
In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.
So pretty cool and definitely a good cost.
And if you want to know more information about that, visit PennyArcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org Did they take systems as well as financial donation?
Like actual game games?
I know where you're going with this.
Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity.
And maybe some money as well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.
I don't know.
I'm not so hot right now.
But if I have some extra money, I support this charity.
DarkSakura.com
You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDR Oha Style.
You know what this song's called?
Candy.
Candy is delicious.
My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do this one last week and I forgot the address.
It's...
Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass, people running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships.
You can even volunteer to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org Very, very, very cool site.
Bookmark it for next year.
Yep.
You can still also look at it regularly, though, for updates.
You just have that in one window and game politics in the other?
You're set.
You're politically of sound mind.
Well, if you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your favorite gaming companies.
A quote came from the ESA this week.
The ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.
his organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for generating a list of invitees the point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings that is not for the ESA to say or influence interesting
So if you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.
Are they still wanting to call them invites, or is that a negative connotation towards gamers?
Do they want to call them something else?
I have no idea.
All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.
Well, you know, a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.
Good luck.
Good luck.
They don't want to talk to us, bastards.
But when you have that attitude, who would?
So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3.
That's going to be taking place in October 07.
And they want you to name it because they don't have a name.
So they have a contest.
basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance to name the expo and if you win you will win a prize package including a round trip airfare for two hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo contest ends though on Monday November 20th I got a name
How about Gamer Expo?
How about... How about Big LA Game Place?
How about Thingy?
How about GamePro Expo?
I mean, seriously, just give it a name.
It doesn't have to be that snazzy.
How about... Hey, this is an E3!
How about... Boobs and Games?
Anyway...
What'd you say, Drew?
Don't be a bitch to say in a cutscene, per se.
I should.
That's his tiara today.
That was great.
You don't have time to smoke a bowl!
Anyway.
Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?
Huh?
I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.
We have Miklatov playing with Power Ranger toys.
And a Santa hat.
Is that Magic Ranger?
It's his...
DarkTetsuya says call it G3, GamePro Gamers Gathering, G3!
Anyway, hey, I'm trying to do a short here.
So, Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal,
has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California for embezzlement and drunken driving.
Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.
Big, expensive car.
He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.
I liked the Gizmondo.
I liked that Johnny Whatever game.
One game.
It had one...
Stinkin' game that was kinda neat.
Anyway, he, um... I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.
Anyway, he, um... Basically, it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.
So, he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.
No, Drew Nami, the people behind the N-Gage need to go to the chair.
Yes, thank you.
He was trying to basically get out of going to jail.
So... However, he's still in jail.
He's going to be deported.
They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and restitution to the banks involved.
And, uh, basically, there is no more Gizmondo.
Uh, will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?
I don't know.
I hope not.
I just think, I just think he, uh, I'm just like, think that he deserves it.
So...
N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo Fuck, I'd buy one just for that name Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our geekier fans is that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game
That will be out with the next film June 2007.
It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes me very happy because I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.
They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?
It has Silver Surfer!
Yeah, really.
Which means it might have Galactus.
The search for more losses.
You know, I'll say the guy that played the torch guy?
Smokin'.
Hey, Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?
You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity clause.
Okay, okay, okay.
Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.
Okay, then dye her hair.
Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.
Just more human torch guy, please.
Then I'll go see the movie.
Thank you, yeah, thank you.
And right on cue, the chat room goes,
Flame on, Sky!
Flame on!
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh my god!
SSJ100 Matt's winner, Galactus, voiced by Penn & Teller.
Oh, shit!
Call in right now, you smartasses, so I can yell at you.
Because our Skype line is open.
If you want to call us, just head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.
You can call us live.
The telephone number is 877-GAME-OLR.
That's 877-426-3657.
That toll-free number, FYI, only works toll-free in the U.S.
and Canada.
Let's go to the phones.
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who dis?
Raven's Dolphin!
It's good to hear from you.
Hi, Raven's Dolphin.
What's on your mind?
Flame on, Raven's Dolphin.
Yeah, flame on.
There's only one thing I want to talk to you about.
It's the Xbox 360, and you talked about it being a Dreamcast.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast system previously.
I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.
All right, that is our podcast listeners no good.
Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?
I don't really have it on hand.
I'm just going to post it in there.
All right, well, what's in this article?
All right, what happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console out there.
They didn't want to leave the market.
with the Saturn Stink.
They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.
The Saturn Stink.
I like that term.
I'm taking great offense to that because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.
It's just it had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well because Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities for every employee that worked there and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM card out here or all the good games.
We're just going to leave those in Japan.
Sega Stink Michael Moore He was in Sega
Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.
Peter Moore.
Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.
Michael Moore does films.
He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?
Big guy with the beard harasses congressmen on the street.
Thank you.
Peter Moore.
Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference where he came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay, let's get it out of the way.
Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.
Yay!
Okay.
There's other comparisons.
I see, so Peter Moore is the comparison here.
Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up.
Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.
Sega did not have a lot of money.
The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.
Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.
I'll call it Gizmondo 2.
Electric Boogaloo.
Alright, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.
Have a good night, alright?
You too, bye.
Later.
Michael Moore, head of Microsoft.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
Yes, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.
I haven't called in a while.
Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Okay, first off, I gotta know, does my quality suck?
You're okay.
You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.
Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.
Okay.
First off... I forgot what I was going to say.
Anyway, it's something completely different.
I remember, what was it, last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was kind of odd.
There's one I've been following.
It's actually a fan game.
It's actually...
Thanks for watching!
But you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate mobile games, right?
And I think they all are poopy.
I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.
Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic formula of Luminous.
For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors, and then sometimes the shapes are different.
They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.
It made it kind of...
feel a little bit refreshing and different.
And for cell phone, Java-type game, it actually wasn't bad.
I was kind of impressed.
Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure Zelda on the phone would be cool, too.
Well, is it out?
When can we get it?
Well, it's actually a second demo.
The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made for him a hangout at, oddly enough, it's called Zelda Fan Game Central, so this, gc.com.
I posted a link in chat already.
If you want to take a look at it.
Okay, second off,
Halloween was last week and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.
It is gaming related.
Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?
No.
Alright, what did you dress up as?
Tell us.
Okay.
I'm putting the links in chat.
Okay, there they are.
Alright, let me bring it up.
This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.
Might I remind you here.
Alright, explain the costume for the podcast listeners.
Okay.
My name, TimmanX64, kind of shows that I am a big Nintendo lover, and other people might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.
You probably already know this guy.
I do.
And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on PlayStation.
I went for the irony factor.
I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made up.
of masking tape and permanent marker.
Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the PlayStation hater.
It's a well-done logo.
Yeah, you did a pretty good job.
Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?
You went for the old-school PS logo.
Because it's the PlayStation logo.
Oh, sorry, the PlayStation logo.
My bad.
I have a PS3 on it.
Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.
We've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, though.
Have a good one.
Thanks for calling, all right?
Okay.
Later.
All right, we're going to get to some more calls.
Let's go over to this one.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Jason.
Hi, Jason, buddy, our webmaster.
Yay!
I haven't heard any complaints, but I like to think it's working pretty well.
When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole, you know, lowered participation numbers and all this other nonsense.
and with the whole Xbox SMA Hold on a minute, buddy.
Hold on, put the car apart for a minute there, buddy.
Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number is doing so great and the quality of his call right now is kind of crappy?
Like we're hearing a lot of breakup in there.
Just the irony factor.
Sorry, Jason.
I don't know what else to tell you.
So E3, yeah?
E3 and the whole lower participation amongst independent developers
No, Lorde participation in general and not just in general masses.
But XNA, Xbox, Microsoft's XNA, the development suite, can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.
So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work with the XNA?
XMA is a launching point.
You can go so much further beyond there.
If you bring together independent developers and publishers...
Do I really have to go further than that?
underground media a little more than any other company so I'll give them credit for that if anyone were to do this it would probably be them and the fact of how much that can help them in general in XBL in the next couple of years this whole generation is going to be a really big difference it's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out it would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof I definitely agree Jason the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality I'm so sorry we love you anyway
We love you Jason, have a good one.
Hey, it's DMN.
No, really, it's Ranma.
Hi, DMN Ranma.
What's on your mind?
Not much.
I have a quick question for Loki.
Let me see if he's paying attention.
Loki, are you paying attention?
Yes.
Loki, boobs.
Boobs, Loki, boobs.
Yeah, what's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
All right, Loki, have you heard anything about Halo 3?
Because a friend of mine works for GameStop, he just told me last week that Microsoft, the press release that's coming out on November 2007.
Have you heard anything new since that?
No, I haven't heard anything new.
We still have the date as March.
Has that press release actually come out anywhere?
No, it has not.
I have told my friend that.
So your friend who works at this random GameStop...
It happens to know the inner workings at Microsoft and what they're developing.
You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the GameStop employees?
I'm thinking we got Exhibit A right here.
Look, Loki might be dead fucking wrong, and you might be right.
Your GameStop kid might be right.
It's November 07.
But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft, and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a press release right now.
Please.
I trust Loki more than I do GameStop.
Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going to be in the holiday.
It's going to be the November title.
That would be my guess right there because...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'm still saying March.
Until I hear otherwise.
I have a question for you.
I think so too.
I mean, because I asked him.
Wait, DarkSakura has a question for you.
No, no, no.
Go ahead and finish what you were saying.
Well, I was saying to him, well, this is an actual press release.
Don't you think somebody would have leaked it by now?
Because I had asked him for proof.
He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.
And I've been checking.
Nothing about it.
So I think it's just all smoke and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system when we don't have a release date because it's easy to enter in when you're entering items into a database.
Sorry, I picked up another call.
Damn that feedback.
Alright, finish your thought.
I won't pick up another call until you're ready.
Anyway, so that would be a default date.
So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.
Shadow Next Gen Halo 3 I agree with Loki
And why?
Because that would also be when basically the quote-unquote real launch of the PlayStation 3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.
So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.
Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said it, or somebody was rumored that Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.
Yes, exactly.
Took the words right out of my mouth.
So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be when it is.
So in a way, maybe that kind of happens, where maybe it goes up against the Euro launch, or as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.
That's kind of an interesting perspective.
And also, at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo, and it sucked.
Did you play Johnny Whatever?
I didn't get to play anything, because they were all broken.
I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had a bunch on display and nothing.
What, Drew Nami?
Did you wash your hands after touching them?
Yeah.
I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.
I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those controllers.
Anyway, sorry.
Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii
My GameStop had a key off.
And what did you think of the Wii?
And I thought it was very awesome.
It was very awesome.
What games did you play?
I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the Photo Channel and the Mii Channel, things like that.
You know, I had some friends get... One of my friends posted on LiveJournal about this.
They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.
I'm like, you stupids.
Really?
Apparently the guy came up behind him and was like, you can't do that, you know, that whole thing.
I'm like, you guys are hella dumb.
Anyway.
Yeah, and it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.
Ah, where are you going to go camp out at?
Nowhere.
I have a pre-order at GameStop.
Well, look at you go.
Well, congratulations.
You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?
Yeah, well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.
All right.
Well, until then, have a good week.
Thanks for your call.
All right, buddy?
Yeah, thanks.
All right.
Good luck with the Wii.
Have fun.
Alright, I'm going to try this caller again.
This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
This is Did You Lose a Sock.
Hi, Did You Lose a Sock.
We're getting a little feedback.
Is that better?
A little bit, yes.
What's on your mind?
Which is a better game?
Fears of Wars or Viva Pinata?
I can't say because I haven't played Viva Pinata.
Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?
I didn't even hear that.
Do I think Viva Pinata promotes violence against... Sorry, did you lose the sock?
I can't deal with the feedback going on right now.
Viva Pinata promotes violence against animals?
I think it promotes gay bashing.
It promotes violence against flamboyant animals.
That's not cool.
I'm going to write to GLAAD, tell them to ban Viva Pinata.
One more call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.
Hi, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?
I was just thinking, a while ago I was watching this thing, and it was somebody at Microsoft, I want to say Peter Moore.
Ah yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah?
This has been the most competitive cycle yet.
Did you...
Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?
It was... Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony.
They didn't want to attack Nintendo.
I don't know.
But it's just this cycle is so...
I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.
I don't remember that.
I don't know.
In all seriousness, since this was just recently campaign season, it kind of reminds me of campaign season where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight and we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.
And then suddenly a month later, Drew Nami is running for Congress.
And did you know when he was younger, he really liked candy.
Do not elect Drew Nami.
paid for by Rob Roberts for President Campaign.
You know, like, you see all those negative ads all over.
So, I don't know.
They always start off like, oh, hey, yeah, it's going to be a clean fight because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.
But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
All right.
I know what I mean, too.
All right, no, thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent.
We appreciate it.
Anything else you want to say to our listeners?
Um, no, not really.
Alright, well have a good one.
Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.
Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.
Alright, have fun with your Wii.
Alright.
Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight.
We appreciate it.
And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.
Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?
Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan-made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool, but it is fan-made, so just so that nobody freaks out.
I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.
Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.
The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.
So you guys won't have to wait for much longer.
Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.
I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.
Your free time's almost up.
So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.
Start off here with Saints of Rokideen, an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.
Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Bros., Ice, Hockey, Soccer
Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
Of course, there was some estimates on the PlayStation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.
Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3, and they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the PlayStation 3 launch.
That's a lot of money.
Oh, it's Toad's Turnpike.
I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.
Sorry.
Anyways...
You might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entis of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how that there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.
Well, he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the PlayStation 3, but in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.
It's all about physics.
Did he see the same trailer I did?
He's an idiot.
Um,
There was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W.S.
Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.
Yeah, it looked very boring.
Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!
Now, anyways, we know that, of course, November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Sneak King, which I'm sure... Most anticipated games of the year.
Yes, but that's not where it stops.
In fact, Kellogg's, Serial, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.
Apparently, you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.
Fruit Loops the game!
So that's kind of interesting.
As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well, they have PTV for...
Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!
The last bit of information, of course, comes for the PlayStation 3 and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.
Scoop King
Poop Scoop King.
What else can we put in the cereal?
On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar-coated cereal and end the program.
This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.
Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight.
What's your final thought?
Pie.
and Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun and I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.
Any final thoughts for our listeners?
War is over, if you want it.
Aw, I like that.
Loki?
My final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.
Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.
My final thought is reject False Icons.
I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.
And a heart.
No, my final thought is I heart you, Jamie.
Heart, heart, heart, love, love.
Your final thought, DarkSakura.
Rawr.
Gwar?
I love gwar.
Rawr!
Shut up, okay?
You!
No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Junami.
You have to go make them in the bathroom.
He said I was holding a grudge.
I'll show you a grudge.
I'll beat you with a ferret.
Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting as always, even on strange nights like this one.
We appreciate you sticking by us.
Have a great week.
Hey, next week,
and Crazy System Launches.
John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us.
And since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their Excite Truck on.
So it's sure to be a clusterfuck event, which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.
Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.
We'll talk more about that next week.
Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
