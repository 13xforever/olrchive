7000	8000	Who's your hosts?
8000	10000	Dark Sakura,
10000	11000	Sky,
11000	13000	and Loco.
14000	17000	Tonight, November 12th, 2006.
17000	20000	Microsoft unveils movie and television downloads,
20000	24000	PlayStation 3 games get some new dates and some postponed dates,
24000	27000	and can you Willy install Linux on the Wii?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	34000	Hello boys and girls on the internet.
34000	37000	Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
37000	41000	We are that video game show dedicated to video games,
41000	44000	gamer lifestyle, gamer culture, and all that other stuff.
44000	48000	You know, it's about two and a half to three hours of just chat.
48000	52000	We like to think of ourselves as sitting around the table at the local diner
52000	55000	just bitching about video games while we're waiting for our food.
55000	59000	And the service is very slow tonight, hence why the show is about two and a half hours long.
59000	61000	Yeah, lamest comparison ever, sorry.
61000	63000	But it's kind of what the show is like a little bit.
63000	66000	Like, remember back in the day when we would all go play DDR
66000	71000	and then we'd go to the local diner and have soup and just talk and BS and stuff, right?
71000	73000	Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, local co-host?
73000	74000	Yes, sometimes.
74000	75000	Sometimes?
75000	76000	Sometimes.
76000	77000	Rawr.
77000	79000	Would you say that was a fair comparison, Mr. Loki?
79000	80000	Techmaster Loki?
80000	83000	I'm sorry, I didn't hear most of that.
83000	86000	Well, maybe if you were listening to the show and not playing on your computer
86000	88000	while we're trying to get things started here,
88000	91000	maybe you would have heard my really bad comparison.
91000	95000	I was just trying to look up to see if anyone had commented on a certain story
95000	99000	that ran earlier this week and, you know.
99000	102000	Well, I think you should be focusing on the show now.
102000	104000	It is on the show. It's show related.
104000	108000	I need your full attention, Mr. Loki.
108000	111000	Joining us tonight are some special guests,
111000	114000	and hopefully I can get through the show tonight without berating.
114000	118000	Say hello to someone who hasn't been on the show in several years, actually,
118000	122000	but one of Jamie's good buddies from Alabama, right?
122000	124000	You guys used to live there together?
124000	126000	Actually, I left and she moved there.
126000	127000	Okay.
127000	130000	Well, say hello, nevertheless, to Tiara.
130000	131000	Hello.
131000	132000	How are you?
132000	133000	I'm well, thank you.
133000	134000	All right.
134000	138000	And also say hello to our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Drew Nami.
138000	141000	If I don't get my French toast soon, I'm going to go kick someone's ass.
141000	142000	What?
142000	144000	Bad service.
144000	146000	Oh, I get it. Hello.
146000	150000	Someone needs to pay attention to the show, Mr. Sky.
150000	152000	All right, shut up.
152000	156000	Anyway, here we are, and another week.
156000	159000	We're sitting just before the brink of madness.
159000	163000	Video game system releases, PlayStation 3 and Wii.
163000	165000	Really quickly, who's getting what?
165000	167000	Who's getting what system?
167000	170000	I'm getting a Wii, but not a PlayStation 3 just yet.
170000	171000	Dark Sakura.
171000	172000	I'm getting a Wii and a PlayStation 3.
172000	173000	Loki.
173000	174000	I'm getting a Wii.
174000	177000	Uh, Tiara.
177000	179000	I'm getting nothing because I am poor.
179000	180000	Aw, sorry to hear it.
180000	181000	Drew Nami?
181000	182000	I'm getting a Wii when I get the chance.
182000	186000	All right, so that's, let's see, one, two, three, four Wiis and one PS3.
186000	188000	Not my choice.
188000	194000	And one, you know, one cup of coffee, I guess.
194000	196000	I could send you a Game Boy.
196000	198000	We have lots of love for Tiara.
198000	203000	She can watch us all unpack them on YouTube because apparently that makes for riveting
203000	208000	game news this week is, you know, watch me play my Wii and rub it in your face that you
208000	209000	don't have one.
209000	212000	It is such horrible blogging news.
212000	216000	Seriously, like every single blog I visited this week, I guess Nintendo loves everyone
216000	217000	else more than us.
217000	218000	Whatever, I don't care.
218000	219000	I'm over it.
219000	223000	But every other website is like, hey, look, here's a video on YouTube of us taking the
223000	227000	Wii out of the box and showing it all in front of the camera.
227000	230000	And then here's me playing Excite Truck.
230000	231000	I don't know.
231000	234000	It's kind of like I'm reading the same thing on every single blog.
234000	236000	I'm like, isn't there like real news this week?
236000	239000	I know it's still early in the week, though.
239000	243000	But as far as I'm aware, Jessica Chobert has not licked the Wii.
243000	245000	I may be able to beat her to that.
245000	252000	Actually, we might have to get Dark Sakura, maybe our own lovely gaming babe here to lick
252000	253000	some various devices.
253000	254000	How does it sound?
254000	260000	If by lick you remove the L and put a K there, then I'll do that to the PS3.
260000	266000	It would be hilarious if we could get like some porn star to, you know, with a Wii.
266000	268000	Do we know a porn star?
268000	270000	To like maybe put the Wii remote someplace.
270000	274000	Actually, I have a friend who works for a gay porn company.
274000	276000	We could get a gay porn star.
276000	279000	Close enough, I guess.
279000	282000	I don't know if the whole internet will be into that.
282000	283000	Maybe we'll get posted on Gay Gamer.
283000	284000	I don't know.
284000	285000	Maybe something.
285000	286000	I don't know.
286000	287000	All right.
287000	289000	Anyway, seriously though, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.
289000	290000	I'm sorry.
290000	292000	First, how was your gaming week?
292000	296000	I swear this Fiji water is not spiked tonight.
296000	298000	You were publicly endorsing a brand of water.
298000	299000	Well, whatever.
299000	300000	I don't care.
300000	301000	Actually, that's the water I drink.
301000	303000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
303000	306000	Played Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit last night.
306000	310000	In fact, quite a bit last night.
310000	314000	We played all the way through Easy and then through a bunch of Medium,
314000	320000	and I will let the almighty unlocker of Trogdor tell you about that later.
320000	325000	And then I got inspired and left the room so that I could make the preshow
325000	328000	with a bunch of, you know, stuff that was in Guitar Hero 2.
328000	332000	I was going to put Thunder Horse from Venture Brothers.
332000	333000	What was the band?
333000	335000	Death Lock.
335000	340000	And I was going to put that in the show, but I decided not to.
340000	344000	And if you want to hear Trogdor, you have to stay and listen to the entire show.
344000	346000	Of course, if you're on the podcast, it won't do you any good
346000	347000	because it's copyrighted.
347000	348000	Sorry, kids.
348000	354000	And then I looked at Trauma Center and haven't played it yet,
354000	357000	and then Dan started playing Final Fantasy XII for me.
357000	367000	So I'm a little bit upset at him, and I played some more PSU.
367000	370000	I'm only level 3.
370000	372000	Slowly but surely, making your way.
372000	374000	Leveling is slow in PSU.
374000	378000	I played religiously for several days, and I'm only like level 12.
378000	381000	So it ain't going to get any quicker, I'm sorry to say.
381000	384000	I just solo through all the missions.
384000	386000	Seriously, play single player.
386000	388000	You level up so much faster.
388000	390000	Just skip all the cut scenes and play single player.
390000	393000	It doesn't level your online character.
393000	394000	Yeah, sadly, no, it doesn't.
394000	395000	Okay, then.
395000	396000	I want to level my online character.
396000	398000	If you're just going to play by yourself.
398000	401000	I got PSU to play through the online missions.
401000	404000	I just wanted to start leveling my stuff.
404000	406000	All right.
406000	410000	Anything else, Ms. Dark Sakura?
410000	411000	No.
411000	414000	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
414000	417000	It was full of stuff, actually.
417000	420000	Of course, I picked up two big 360 games this week.
420000	425000	Gears of War, which I've played for not very long, actually, so far.
425000	427000	I haven't really played much through it.
427000	430000	I tried a little bit of the single player, got past the first mission,
430000	434000	and played a little bit of the multiplayer on one console.
434000	439000	So, I mean, not a real good indicator of what the multiplayer is, but it's okay.
439000	444000	I don't know, to be honest, I don't think the multiplayer is that great,
444000	448000	at least from what I've seen so far, unless online is just totally phenomenal.
448000	451000	But it seems to be just a race for the chainsaw,
451000	455000	who can pull out the chainsaw the fastest is the winner.
455000	456000	So I guess that's kind of neat.
456000	460000	And then the game itself is not like, I mean, it's pretty cool,
460000	464000	but it's not like, oh, my God, this is so amazing.
464000	467000	It's just a pretty game, and I think it's a pretty game
467000	471000	that's going to get forgotten pretty quick, but whatever.
471000	472000	Really?
472000	473000	Yeah, really.
473000	475000	Even despite all the praise that's being lavished upon it.
475000	477000	Well, look at the people there giving the praise for it.
477000	480000	They're saying, oh, my God, it's so phenomenal.
480000	481000	Oh, my God, it's so innovative.
481000	482000	What's so innovative about it?
482000	484000	Okay, wow, it has a cover system.
484000	485000	Hooray.
485000	489000	You know, and it's got, you know, it's really intense.
489000	490000	Do you work for EA?
490000	492000	I don't work for EA.
492000	494000	But you're wearing a Call of Duty shirt.
494000	495000	Exactly.
495000	496000	Oh, wait, that's Activision.
496000	498000	I have two Call of Duty shirts.
498000	499000	Never mind.
499000	500000	And this was on the top of the hamper.
500000	504000	So, anyways, so, yeah, I'll play through it.
504000	506000	I'm sure it's going to be a pretty cool game.
506000	509000	And there is one good thing about it, though, the co-op is amazing.
509000	511000	So at least they've got that going for it,
511000	514000	because there aren't that many good co-op games nowadays.
514000	517000	And it's almost like Contra, I should say.
517000	519000	You know, that's kind of what it reminds me of, you know,
519000	522000	two people playing through the game, which also leads me to Contra,
522000	524000	which I played a little bit this week.
524000	526000	You know, Contra is Contra, so it's pretty cool.
526000	529000	Then, of course, Call of Duty 3 I bought.
529000	531000	That one is really cool.
531000	535000	Personally, I like the multiplayer in Call of Duty 3 a lot better.
535000	540000	I've been playing it, you know, locally with a few of my friends at work,
540000	541000	and it's just fun.
541000	544000	It's definitely improved over to the last one.
544000	546000	The only thing I don't like about the multiplayer in it, though,
546000	550000	is that your little kind of HUD radar thing that they have,
550000	555000	they do not show the gunshots going off like they used to in the first one.
555000	558000	So, I mean, playing like a 10-minute game,
558000	561000	it might be hard to find people.
561000	564000	Also, since the maps don't say how many people they're meant for,
564000	566000	which, you know, the old one did,
566000	569000	so you kind of get an idea which map is large, which one's smaller,
569000	570000	and that type of thing.
570000	572000	This one's kind of flying blind.
572000	575000	But the game's pretty cool, though, because you get to drive vehicles and stuff,
575000	579000	and I got a lot of my kills running over people with Jeeps,
579000	582000	so that's pretty cool, and I do like that.
582000	585000	And the game looks a lot better, so that'll be pretty cool.
585000	591000	Grand Theft Auto's Vice City story has been playing a little bit more, of course.
591000	594000	Really playing more of this, I'm starting to like the game a little bit more,
594000	598000	but also at the same time I'm frustrated with how lazy their programming is.
598000	603000	For example, when you're playing certain spawn areas on the second island,
603000	607000	you can actually see there's a barrier
607000	610000	blocking you from going to the first island again,
610000	613000	and when you pass that barrier, you die.
613000	617000	So they do have the technology to be able to create a barrier
617000	619000	around a certain section of the map,
619000	624000	which they should have done anyways to make the maps a lot smaller,
624000	627000	but they didn't because they're too fucking lazy, so whatever.
627000	631000	But the game is fun, kind of figuring out the nuances of it,
631000	633000	but still Grand Theft Auto.
633000	639000	It's a little bit more realistic as far as some of the vehicle damage and stuff.
639000	644000	And then, other than that, Elder of Scrolls Oblivion,
644000	646000	I've played through about half of that now,
646000	648000	and hopefully I'm going to finish the other half.
648000	651000	I've got to grind through it so I can sell it back, that type of thing.
651000	655000	And yeah, cheating all the way.
655000	659000	All right. Hooray for cheating, I guess.
659000	662000	Let's see, my gaming week.
662000	663000	Let's see, what have I played this week?
663000	665000	I played Gears of War as well, but I'm not ready to review it yet
665000	668000	because I won't give it a review until I try out co-op,
668000	671000	because if co-op is everything everyone says it is,
671000	672000	then I really need to look at it.
672000	674000	So we'll wait until next week for me to talk about Gears of War.
674000	676000	But I am ready to talk about two other games I picked up this week,
676000	678000	and one of them is Elite Beat Agents,
678000	681000	which of course is the English version of Oh and Don,
681000	683000	which is available on the Nintendo DS.
683000	688000	Elite Beat Agents is quite possibly the best music-based game ever
688000	690000	for the casual player.
690000	695000	I don't know so much about those that are totally sucked into music games.
695000	699000	They might find the game to be a little bit easy on some of the earlier modes,
699000	701000	and yeah, there are some challenging modes that come up later on,
701000	703000	and you know, whatever.
703000	708000	But for most people, for those folks that are too afraid to get on a DDR machine
708000	710000	because they're afraid of looking like an ass,
710000	713000	or those folks that are too afraid to touch a BeatMania controller
713000	717000	because it's like turntables, buttons, I don't do this.
717000	720000	This could be quite possibly the best casual music game.
720000	724000	I put it right up there with Guitar Hero in the ease of just pick it up and go.
724000	726000	And even some people don't want to play Guitar Hero
726000	727000	because they're like, that's kind of weird.
727000	729000	But Elite Beat Agents is easy.
729000	730000	No one else can see because it's on the DS,
730000	732000	and it's just you pick up the pen and go.
732000	735000	And the song list is surprisingly really good.
735000	738000	I know a lot of people were like, ugh, it's got a weird combination of songs.
738000	742000	But dude, if a game can make Ashley Simpson's Lala kind of fun,
742000	744000	I think it deserves a lot of credit.
744000	746000	So I give Elite Beat Agents a lot of credit.
746000	747000	It's funny.
747000	748000	It cracked me up.
748000	750000	Even one stage is kind of sad and a little bit sniffly,
750000	755000	but I wouldn't cry because I'm a man.
755000	757000	But no, the game's a lot of fun.
757000	759000	Basically, for those that don't know,
759000	761000	the essential element of the game is that you tap.
761000	764000	You tap on the bottom screen, but you follow these patterns,
764000	766000	and you tap like in the beat of the music.
766000	768000	For instance, if you're playing Material Girl,
768000	770000	your tapping might go along with the words,
770000	772000	like doo doo doo doo doo doo,
772000	775000	and you kind of drag the stylus in some parts too and follow a little ball.
775000	777000	So it's a lot more fun than it sounds
777000	780000	because the animations and things really kind of keep you involved.
780000	783000	The only small complaint I have with the game is that, you know,
783000	785000	for the hardcore music game fan,
785000	787000	they're going to breeze through it in like a day,
787000	789000	at least play all the songs.
789000	792000	At least there's harder difficulties than there was in the Japanese Oh and Don
792000	797000	to kind of keep the hardcore music fan base interested in the game.
797000	801000	But I definitely highly, highly, highly recommend Elite Beat Agents
801000	805000	to anyone who is slightly interested in the music genre of games.
805000	807000	Also, the other cool thing about Elite Beat Agents,
807000	809000	multiplayer mode is kind of fun,
809000	811000	and you can do it with just one cartridge.
811000	813000	You can play most of the songs just off of one cartridge.
813000	815000	It takes forever to download the game,
815000	816000	but, you know, it works out.
816000	819000	You know, small price to pay for not having everybody to have the same game.
819000	823000	And then, of course, it has this very similar type of functionality
823000	825000	for when both people have the cartridge.
825000	829000	It just runs even smoothly, so it's great.
829000	833000	Other game I picked up this week and played is Luminous 2,
833000	835000	which is out on the PSP.
835000	840000	And, you know, Luminous was my absolute favorite game that was released this year,
840000	842000	and so I still have a lot of love for Luminous 2
842000	844000	because they didn't really change anything.
844000	847000	But that's also kind of my biggest problem with Luminous 2
847000	851000	is that half of the skins were Luminous 1 skins.
851000	853000	And I don't think a lot of people picked up on this
853000	856000	because maybe people played Luminous 1 and then forgot about it.
856000	859000	But seriously, if you think, for instance,
859000	861000	those folks that follow music-based games,
861000	864000	if you think DDR repeats are bad, Luminous puts it to shame.
864000	867000	Luminous repeats damn near every single skin from the first game
867000	869000	that wasn't a licensed song.
869000	871000	It's kind of sad.
871000	873000	But on the bright side now, the good stuff about the game
873000	875000	is that Luminous 2 appears to,
875000	877000	and I haven't played with this mode a whole lot yet,
877000	880000	but it appears to let you do your own music, which is kind of rad.
880000	882000	It comes with a lot of new skins.
882000	883000	Some have music videos.
883000	885000	Some are, you know, in-house made.
885000	888000	You see a lot of them on the Xbox Live version of the game.
888000	891000	There's mission mode involved and versus involved,
891000	893000	and there's a demo of every extent extra.
893000	896000	There's a lot of new modes that keep it fresh.
896000	899000	So if you don't own the original Luminous,
899000	901000	there's a lot for you.
901000	903000	And if you like puzzle games at all,
903000	905000	you definitely need to have Luminous 2.
905000	908000	It's a must-own game if you don't have the original Luminous.
908000	910000	If you do have the original Luminous,
910000	914000	then I would ask you how important are these new modes to you?
914000	917000	Do you really want to be able to use your own music?
917000	919000	Do you really want to be able to do this other stuff?
919000	922000	Do you really want to play to holla back, girl?
922000	924000	How much of a necessity is that to you?
924000	929000	And if the answer is, I must, then sure, go get the game.
929000	930000	You know, it's only 30 bucks.
930000	932000	It's not a bad value.
932000	935000	But I don't know if you would want this and the Xbox Live one
935000	939000	unless you are just really crazy about your puzzle games
939000	940000	or your Luminous.
940000	942000	And that was my gaming week.
942000	944000	Besides a lot of Phantasy Star Universe,
944000	947000	I've been playing a hell of a lot of Phantasy Star Universe single-player mode.
947000	948000	I don't know what it is.
948000	951000	The story was really cliche and the voice acting is horrific,
951000	953000	especially in the first couple chapters.
953000	956000	But now that I'm past that and I'm in about Chapter 8 now,
956000	958000	the story has kind of gotten a little bit interesting.
958000	959000	It's like watching an anime.
959000	960000	It's like I'm playing an anime.
960000	962000	Seriously, if you're into anime,
962000	964000	you've got to check out Phantasy Star Universe
964000	965000	and give it a fair shot,
965000	970000	because, I mean, it copies it to a T.
970000	971000	It's crazy.
971000	975000	Speaking of T, Tiara, would you like to share your gaming week with us?
975000	978000	What kind of stuff you've been playing?
978000	984000	As Soy said, we played Guitar Heroes 2 last night.
984000	987000	She was around long enough to beat Easy Mode
987000	990000	and then I played through Medium or whatever you call it,
990000	994000	Normal Mode, long enough to unlock Trogdor.
994000	998000	And then we played Trogdor and then we went to sleep.
998000	1003000	But before that, I played Tetris on my phone for a million hours
1003000	1008000	while we waited for A Nightmare Before Christmas to start.
1008000	1012000	Because somebody bought tickets for the 1230 show
1012000	1014000	and we actually got there at like 1030,
1014000	1016000	so it was like two hours of Tetris joy.
1016000	1019000	I thought I was going to get lost.
1019000	1021000	She got lost everywhere else, that's all.
1021000	1022000	But I got lost in a cool way,
1022000	1024000	because we found underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.
1024000	1026000	Yeah, under.
1026000	1029000	But that's it. Excitement. The end.
1029000	1031000	Now, actually, I want to interview you for a little bit,
1031000	1033000	because you haven't been on the show in a long time,
1033000	1034000	and last time you were on the show
1034000	1037000	was when we were still exclusively talking about music-based games.
1037000	1038000	So now we have a whole new world
1038000	1041000	and more people listen to the show thanks to iTunes and XB Stream
1041000	1043000	and all games and all that stuff.
1043000	1045000	What kind of games do you enjoy?
1045000	1048000	Are you a computer gamer? Are you a console gamer?
1048000	1051000	What would you say is your favorite way of playing games?
1051000	1056000	Actually, my outside of the home life has been so busy lately
1056000	1058000	that I haven't really done a lot of gaming.
1058000	1061000	I actually gave up WoW, which was amazing,
1061000	1063000	because I never thought I would do that.
1063000	1065000	Seriously, I was so addicted,
1065000	1069000	and I was like main healer in my guild and everything,
1069000	1071000	and one day I was just like, you know what?
1071000	1074000	I think outside is nice, too.
1074000	1076000	I'm going to go outdoors and play today.
1076000	1078000	Where are you from, so our listeners know?
1078000	1079000	I'm from Las Vegas.
1079000	1080000	Las Vegas.
1080000	1082000	I know we have some listeners in Vegas, so very cool.
1082000	1085000	All right, so you were kind of a PC gamer
1085000	1086000	back before you found The Great Outdoors,
1086000	1087000	because it sounds like you played WoW,
1087000	1089000	and I know, didn't you play Ragnarok for a little bit,
1089000	1090000	some of that other stuff?
1090000	1091000	Yeah, I did play Ragnarok online.
1091000	1093000	Do you own any consoles?
1093000	1099000	I own a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, a Game Gear, and a DS.
1099000	1100000	So you're a classic gamer.
1100000	1101000	Yeah.
1101000	1102000	All right.
1102000	1103000	Hey, nothing wrong with that.
1103000	1104000	The classics are awesome.
1104000	1105000	You ever played The Guardian Legend?
1105000	1107000	Best 8-bit game ever.
1107000	1108000	Find it.
1108000	1109000	Seriously, it's the best.
1109000	1111000	It's the most underrated title ever.
1111000	1113000	I will not shut up about this game
1113000	1116000	until I get my sequel on one of the next-gen consoles.
1116000	1120000	I don't care if the rights are somewhere in a black hole right now.
1120000	1122000	Fucking find those rights.
1122000	1124000	Give me a sequel to The Guardian Legend.
1124000	1125000	It's not that much to ask.
1125000	1126000	Please.
1126000	1128000	Just write your congressman.
1128000	1132000	I'm going to write Feinstein tonight and say,
1132000	1136000	I want a bill passed that will make them make A Guardian Legend 2.
1136000	1137000	P.S., I'm crazy.
1137000	1140000	Junami, how was your gaming week?
1140000	1143000	Well, similar to Yarrarar, I sort of gave up WoW for a bit,
1143000	1146000	even though I'm still freaking paying for it.
1146000	1151000	I was playing Guitar Hero 2 for most of the week,
1151000	1157000	unlocked everything, everything, beat hard mode, that kind of stuff.
1157000	1159000	I was just really enjoying it.
1159000	1162000	Played a little bit of Tales of the Abyss and a little bit of Final Fantasy XII.
1162000	1165000	Didn't really get anywhere on either of those.
1165000	1170000	Other than that, I've been enjoying the great outdoors myself.
1170000	1172000	What's up with you people and going outdoors?
1172000	1173000	It's winter.
1173000	1175000	It's cold out.
1175000	1177000	It's like right before winter.
1177000	1180000	It's like the most wonderful time of the year.
1180000	1182000	I haven't been going outdoors.
1182000	1184000	I've been going bar-doors.
1184000	1186000	I was going to say, you live in Vegas.
1186000	1187000	There's nothing to do.
1187000	1188000	I've been to Vegas.
1188000	1192000	There's nothing to do outdoors in Vegas except make things out of dirt.
1192000	1196000	Everything you do in Vegas is indoors and pretty and lights and all that stuff.
1196000	1199000	Although, when you live in Vegas, you hate the casinos, don't you?
1199000	1200000	Yeah.
1200000	1201000	That's what I hear.
1201000	1205000	We've just passed the law for no smoking in restaurants and stuff,
1205000	1206000	so that should be nice.
1206000	1207000	Wow.
1207000	1209000	That's going to be crazy.
1209000	1211000	We didn't pass the law for smoking marijuana, though,
1211000	1215000	because all of those stupid stoners were too stoned to go vote.
1215000	1216000	Right.
1216000	1218000	Well, before we get into a political show,
1218000	1220000	I might be in Vegas for a Consumer Electronics Show.
1220000	1221000	I'm currently toying with two ideas.
1221000	1223000	I'm either going to go to Consumer Electronics Show
1223000	1224000	or I'm going to go to Disneyland.
1224000	1225000	It depends how much money I have.
1225000	1226000	So, one or the other.
1226000	1227000	We'll see.
1227000	1229000	Anyway, let's go to our chat room,
1229000	1232000	which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com
1232000	1236000	and get some comments from our chat room because the folks over there,
1236000	1238000	we have quite a big crowd there tonight.
1238000	1241000	We're making some good comments there, except now I can't find any.
1241000	1244000	We have a lot of people that are listening tonight that say they live in Vegas.
1244000	1249000	DJ Jenai, Gilder, both live in Vegas, saying hello.
1249000	1253000	And then, of course, too, that press start says does not live in Vegas.
1253000	1257000	Jeremy Todd, one is shocked that Drew Nami is giving up World of Warcraft.
1257000	1259000	Actually, I have something to share with everybody.
1259000	1260000	What's that?
1260000	1268000	Foodie Monster on our chat room right now put up the best you-know-who parody
1268000	1270000	for our little video game caption thing.
1270000	1272000	Ah, Tak Jomsom.
1272000	1273000	Tak Jomsom.
1273000	1274000	Yes.
1274000	1276000	No, yeah, for those that didn't hear,
1276000	1282000	I put out a call the other week because remember when Tak Jomsom decided to sue Midway
1282000	1285000	or, I don't know, wrote a nasty letter to Midway or whatever he did
1285000	1288000	over the fact that there was create a character and somebody made his likeness?
1288000	1293000	So I put out a challenge to our listeners to create Tak Jomsom
1293000	1296000	in as many different likenesses as you could in different games.
1296000	1298000	Like I was hoping to see one in Oblivion.
1298000	1300000	Well, Foodie Monster put one up from what?
1300000	1301000	What was it, City of Heroes?
1301000	1302000	I believe so.
1302000	1303000	City of Villains.
1303000	1304000	City of Villains.
1304000	1305000	Oh, well, how appropriate, City of Villains.
1305000	1307000	Yeah, City of Villains.
1307000	1309000	Awesome.
1309000	1311000	The O.L. Army salutes you, Foodie Monster.
1311000	1312000	Good job.
1312000	1313000	I want to see more.
1313000	1314000	You know what else we need to do?
1314000	1315000	Huh?
1315000	1322000	We need to give our special foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis a shout-out.
1322000	1324000	It is Puppy's birthday.
1324000	1325000	Ah.
1325000	1326000	So happy birthday to Puppy.
1326000	1328000	Happy birthday, Puppy.
1328000	1332000	And in dog years he's going to fall over and die any moment now.
1332000	1333000	Let's see.
1333000	1335000	What else do I want to say regarding chat comments?
1335000	1338000	Jeremy Todd 1 asked me in regards to my gaming week, which game is better?
1338000	1344000	Luminous Live, Luminous 1, or Luminous 2?
1344000	1345000	It depends.
1345000	1351000	I would say if you don't own any of them, but you have a PSP, Luminous 2 is probably
1351000	1353000	the best one.
1353000	1355000	Just because it practically has all of Luminous 1 in it.
1355000	1359000	But if you already own Luminous 1, the question is are these little upgrades and the fact
1359000	1363000	that they're going to recycle half of what you already have, is that enough for you to
1363000	1364000	upgrade the game?
1364000	1365000	Question mark.
1365000	1366000	I don't know.
1366000	1367000	It depends how addicted you are to the game.
1367000	1371000	I do think Luminous Live is pretty cool too, though, for those that don't have a PSP.
1371000	1374000	Don't go out and buy a PSP just for Luminous like I did.
1374000	1376000	The Xbox Live one is fine.
1376000	1378000	It's just that the Xbox needs a better D-pad.
1378000	1380000	It needs a better D-pad.
1380000	1383000	Please, some third party, I don't know.
1383000	1386000	Maybe there's Microsoft issues why nobody's done this yet.
1386000	1388000	But seriously, somebody needs to put out a better D-pad.
1388000	1393000	Get a better D-pad for the Xbox 360.
1393000	1394000	Somebody.
1394000	1398000	And then, you know, Luminous Live has Xbox Live and all that stuff, which is kind of
1398000	1399000	cool.
1399000	1401000	So, I'll say that's cool.
1401000	1403000	Housekeeping and things that are going on.
1403000	1405000	We don't have a whole lot of announcements tonight.
1405000	1410000	Next week, we're going to be joined by John, also known as DMN, who is a frequent caller
1410000	1411000	of the program.
1411000	1413000	And he's going to be joining us for some Wii madness next week.
1413000	1415000	That should be exciting.
1415000	1417000	And I guess what else could we say?
1417000	1418000	It's Emergence Day.
1418000	1420000	It's November 12th, which is Emergence Day.
1420000	1423000	Oh, I should also say Happy Birthday to Rice Princess, if she's listening, because it is
1423000	1424000	her B-Day.
1424000	1429000	Let's get into some gaming news, since there was no housekeeping.
1429000	1432000	I will say this.
1432000	1433000	I got served.
1433000	1438000	If you listen to Part B of last week's show, I said, we were talking about a rumor at that
1438000	1442000	time that Microsoft was going to be offering movies and TV downloads.
1442000	1444000	And I said, no way.
1444000	1445000	They won't do it.
1445000	1451000	If they sold HD downloads, it would totally nerf the sales of the HD DVD.
1451000	1453000	So, what did Microsoft announce on Tuesday?
1453000	1458000	Oh, that they're going to be offering movie and TV downloads in HD format.
1458000	1461000	Yeah, I got told.
1461000	1468000	Well, anyway, they announced that various shows from MTV, CBS, movies from such places
1468000	1470000	like Paramount Pictures, all this stuff would be available.
1470000	1474000	In fact, there's some screenshots circulating, and you can see some downloads include V for
1474000	1479000	Vendetta, Poseidon, Cradle to the Grave, Lethal Weapon 4.
1479000	1486000	I know the TV stuff they're offering, old school Star Trek, but the redone special effects,
1486000	1492000	that one, and Survivor and Pimp My Ride, because you really want to have that on the Microsoft
1492000	1494000	360.
1494000	1502000	Basically, in a recent story that was on Joystiq, Scott Henson from Microsoft talked a little
1502000	1504000	bit about how things would work.
1504000	1508000	Henson mentioned that the files that you download, they will be stored on the 360's hard drive
1508000	1513000	unit, and there's not going to be an option to stream videos from the Windows computer,
1513000	1518000	because you can kind of already do that if they're in WMV, and the other formats have
1518000	1522000	those licensing issues that go with them, hence why you can't play Divx movies on your
1522000	1523000	360.
1523000	1526000	You can if you have the media extender for some stuff.
1526000	1529000	Is that because that has the licenses or whatever?
1529000	1530000	Maybe.
1530000	1532000	I don't think that plays everything.
1532000	1537000	Your average 22 minute high definition TV show will be about 1 gigabyte, and the standard
1537000	1539000	definition version will be 300 megabytes.
1539000	1542000	720p is what all the high def stuff is going to be encoded in.
1542000	1544000	They're not going to go up to 1080.
1544000	1546000	I would imagine that's because of space concerns.
1546000	1548000	720p is really not that bad.
1548000	1552000	If you have the eye to distinguish between the two, then maybe you ought to just get
1552000	1554000	an HD DVD drive into it that way.
1554000	1556000	I don't know.
1556000	1561000	The way the rentals work is that once you buy the thing, you'll have two weeks to start
1561000	1566000	the download movie, and then you have 24 hours to finish it, and inside that 24 hour window,
1566000	1569000	you can watch the movie as much as you want.
1569000	1575000	The television shows, though, are basically download to keep, just like it is on iTunes.
1575000	1577000	No word yet about price.
1577000	1578000	I don't know.
1578000	1579000	Does this sound interesting to you guys?
1579000	1582000	Is this something you guys are looking into doing with your Xbox 360?
1582000	1584000	Do you think you'll actually download some stuff?
1584000	1585000	It's kind of neat.
1585000	1586000	There's a lot of good content on there.
1586000	1594000	I mean, they've got South Park, Robot Chicken, just like a Chappelle show, if you're into
1594000	1595000	that kind of stuff.
1595000	1597000	Lots of Pimp My Ride.
1597000	1602000	It just shows that I think people that play the Xbox 360 would be interested in it.
1602000	1603000	Dr. Suckra?
1603000	1604000	I have the internet.
1604000	1606000	I don't need this.
1606000	1612000	So are you endorsing underground schemes such as BitTorrent?
1612000	1614000	I'm making a secret of it.
1614000	1623000	I think that it's a good idea, in theory, for people who maybe aren't so computer savvy,
1623000	1624000	maybe.
1624000	1633000	Or people who are slaves to MTV's programming content and can't live without the same mindless
1633000	1636000	stuff that they throw out at everybody on their regular station.
1636000	1639000	They have to infect Xbox Live as well.
1639000	1641000	So, more power to them.
1641000	1644000	But I have YouTube.
1644000	1645000	Alright, fair enough.
1645000	1648000	Well, technically YouTube is not supposed to have a lot of that content on there anyways
1648000	1651000	and they've gotten in trouble for that.
1651000	1654000	But I have DVDs as well.
1654000	1659000	Being an HD TV owner, I'm kind of excited about the fact that you can get HD content.
1659000	1661000	And the movies do interest me.
1661000	1666000	Because I was looking at what's available on HD DVD the other night because I was considering
1666000	1668000	getting the Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.
1668000	1670000	And honestly, I have to be honest.
1670000	1674000	I looked side-by-side at what was available on HD DVD and what was available on Blu-ray,
1674000	1678000	and I gotta say, there's way more on Blu-ray than I want, as opposed to HD DVD.
1678000	1681000	But, really what's stopping me is that the kind of movies I actually like to watch, I
1681000	1684000	know I'm going to sound like a total snob, but I like to watch indie movies and foreign
1684000	1685000	films and that kind of stuff.
1685000	1687000	And none of that is available on either platform.
1687000	1689000	Very, very little.
1689000	1695000	Unfortunately, the Blu-ray version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Special Edition,
1695000	1701000	which is going to have cut-out scenes and stuff like that, that's only on Blu-ray.
1701000	1702000	Duh!
1702000	1707000	We'll rip that sucker in HD and stream it to the 360.
1707000	1710000	To be honest, I would rather do my HD movies this way.
1710000	1712000	I just am concerned about space.
1712000	1715000	TV shows, though, if they're non-HD, no way.
1715000	1718000	I think iPods got the better setup for that.
1718000	1722000	Granted, I don't have an iPod right now, but I'm hoping I'll get some gift certificates
1722000	1725000	for Christmas or something and I might be able to get one after the holiday season or
1725000	1726000	what-have-you.
1726000	1730600	So, I like the idea of being able to hook it up into the iPod where there's an 80-gigabyte
1730600	1735200	drive and I can just get that little cable and take the TV shows anywhere.
1735200	1739240	The ones that are standard deaf anyway, like if I actually, heaven forbid, bought Pimp
1739240	1744400	My Ride, I'd obviously have to be smoking marijuana, not Nevada, but somewhere, to be
1744400	1750040	wanting to download that, but no, no, no, that show is, I like the show, I just wouldn't
1750040	1754400	pay for the show.
1754400	1755400	It's a fun show.
1755400	1756400	It's just like Mythbusters.
1756400	1757520	I love watching.
1757520	1759080	That's something that they didn't have on there.
1759080	1763760	They should have episodes of Mythbusters because that's an awesome show, but, you know, hey,
1763760	1764980	I noticed something, though.
1764980	1768720	I noticed that G4 shows weren't on there and that's kind of surprising, too.
1768720	1772540	I mean, you'd think that a cable network like that would want to, I don't know, sell their
1772540	1775760	shows to make any sorts of money that they can possibly make.
1775760	1777800	Good riddance, I say.
1777800	1783360	I think it's interesting, though, that Microsoft is not embracing yet the online, the huge
1783360	1789760	resource online there is of free videos and free audio streams such as podcasts and vodcasts
1789760	1797280	and that whole thing, or I'm sorry, blogcasts and vlogcasts, if you are an Xbox 360 only
1797280	1803760	type person that won't call them podcasts, so, God, retarded, whatever, I don't care,
1803760	1804760	whatever.
1804760	1805760	It's just a word.
1805760	1806760	Well, okay, I'm curious.
1806760	1810560	Real quick, Drew, is this something that interests you?
1810560	1814640	Not really considering I don't even have a 360.
1814640	1815640	All right, then, enough said.
1815640	1816640	I guess I asked the wrong person.
1816640	1818520	I won't bother asking Tiara, then.
1818520	1820000	Let me think.
1820000	1824080	Oh, what do you think about this, though, the Trojan horse aspect of this?
1824080	1825840	Didn't we, I mean, a lot of people were saying this.
1825840	1828920	It wasn't just us, but a year ago when these next-gen systems were first being formed,
1828920	1831440	a lot of us said, oh, these are Trojan horses.
1831440	1834480	They're going to be put in your living room under the guise of a game system, but they're
1834480	1838920	going to be all this entertainment in a box, and look at it, it's coming to life.
1838920	1844040	I would also like to point out that the Xbox 360 demo thing that they had where you sat
1844040	1848760	on the floor and the thing rumbled under your butt, the big speaker thing, that they said
1848760	1851480	all this.
1851480	1858040	It was part of their thing when they had the Xbox 360 at E3 years ago.
1858040	1861320	Oh, so like something that they teased a long time ago.
1861320	1862320	Yes.
1862320	1863320	Ah, very interesting.
1863320	1864320	Of course they want to do that.
1864320	1865320	Of course.
1865320	1868600	Their media center PCs aren't selling that great, so they got to sell something that's
1868600	1869600	like a media center.
1869600	1872080	So how long before the PlayStation 3 follows?
1872080	1873080	Instantly.
1873080	1875880	I mean, seriously, instantly.
1875880	1878480	As soon as it comes out, it's there.
1878480	1880840	Where will Nintendo fit into all this, or do they care?
1880840	1881840	They don't care.
1881840	1882840	All right.
1882840	1885240	Nintendo doesn't really have to care.
1885240	1886240	They're Nintendo.
1886240	1887560	They don't have to care yet.
1887560	1892880	I mean, after all, they're not even jumping on the, what is it, online bandwagon yet.
1892880	1900720	But so anyways, with most everything that's released nowadays or announced for Microsoft,
1900720	1903760	Sony always has to make a counterpoint to anything.
1903760	1908800	And their big thing was, oh yeah, this download service sucks.
1908800	1915280	And you know, in that case, I do have to agree with Sony because, well, you have to, your
1915280	1919080	hard drive's not really going to be able to accommodate the volume you'll be downloading.
1919080	1923400	In fact, Microsoft's even pretty much said the same thing.
1923400	1929720	It was Aaron Greenberg, who was the group product marketing manager, actually said that
1929720	1934320	they aren't ready to bring out a larger hard drive yet so that basically you can use your
1934320	1940520	memory card and get your own hard drive and use it to download stuff.
1940520	1945120	So in other words, because we're too lazy to put out an 80 gig hard drive right now,
1945120	1949160	you should just buy four 20 gigs to store all this shit.
1949160	1954600	Yeah, and that's basically kind of the same thing that Sony was saying about their content.
1954600	1958840	Basically PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box,
1958840	1962880	which is bullshit anyways because you have to buy special cables if you want that nice
1962880	1963880	HD.
1963880	1968200	No matter what configuration you purchase, we would never segregate or shut out any of
1968200	1971880	our consumers from our entertainment experience because they didn't have the top of the line
1971880	1973200	system.
1973200	1977320	Both PlayStation 3 versions are available on November 17th, including hard drives for
1977320	1983520	downloading content and also installing your games onto them so that they can stream faster
1983520	1985920	because your Blu-ray drive is slow.
1985920	1989600	But the thing though that is really awesome about the PlayStation 3 though, at least you
1989600	1993760	can add larger hard drives and thank God for that.
1993760	1996920	That is at least one thing that they did right.
1996920	2003240	You could do that with the PS2 as well though, with their HD unit, I'm sorry the hard drive
2003240	2004240	thing.
2004240	2008040	Because we put like 150 gig on ours.
2008040	2016360	Yeah, for non-online Sony game related stuff.
2016360	2021720	But also a lot of games, especially in Japan, made big use of the hard drive because you
2021720	2023840	would load a good portion of your game.
2023840	2030320	Like for example, on TDX6 style, with the hard drive you could load all the songs into
2030320	2036640	the hard drive and then play the, what was that mode called?
2036640	2039080	The marathon mode.
2039080	2040080	Non-stop or whatever it is.
2040080	2041080	Yeah, the non-stop.
2041080	2042080	Endless.
2042080	2045880	Yeah, you could just play endless until you lost.
2045880	2049240	They even had some games where I believe, wasn't it Final Fantasy XII you could load
2049240	2050780	onto the hard drive too?
2050780	2055500	The 2DX Nazis in our chat room are correcting you, it's 5th style, not 6th style.
2055500	2058840	It was one of those, I was close.
2058840	2061840	This style was better than 6th style, so yeah.
2061840	2066320	10 of them available, no, 9 or whatever, I lost count.
2066320	2067320	A lot.
2067320	2068320	There's a lot.
2068320	2072200	I gave up after 8th style, which was the last good one, thank you.
2072200	2073200	I want to make a comment on this.
2073200	2075440	Who is this guy that said I need to buy multiple hard drives?
2075440	2077800	Who was it that said that?
2077800	2079280	Aaron somebody.
2079280	2084720	Aaron somebody, fuck a whole lot of you, okay, because look, when your two biggest competitors
2084720	2089040	are offering something better already, you got no room to be making this statement about
2089040	2091760	how I should be buying additional 100 gig hard drives.
2091760	2097240	Don't get me wrong, 360, I still love you, but right now, look, I can get an 80 gig hard
2097240	2100840	drive in the size of my hand with the iPod, take it wherever I want, and then with the
2100840	2104400	Sony department, you're going to be able to put whatever hard drive you want in it.
2104400	2109240	Laptop hard drives are not $100, especially a 20 gig hard drive for a laptop is dirt cheap.
2109240	2117080	And the fact that you can buy, you know, 150 gig, you know, laptop drive for probably less
2117080	2120960	than you're going to be spending on whatever their next hard drive that they come out for
2120960	2124480	the 360, which is probably going to be like 60 or something.
2124480	2127720	So I don't know, it's just retarded.
2127720	2129600	All right.
2129600	2132800	Anyway, let's move on to another topic.
2132800	2136680	Sticking with Xbox, because I do, you know, even if I think this whole lack of a larger
2136680	2140880	hard drive thing is a little bit silly, Xbox does do a lot of things right, and one of
2140880	2143580	them is the Xbox Live Arcade.
2143580	2150720	Despite the fact that Contra is kind of broken, there are some new games coming out for Xbox
2150720	2158400	Live Arcade, including, before the end of the year, Assault Heroes, Heavy Weapon, Novadrome,
2158400	2162360	and yes, Loki, just for you, Small Arms, all coming out before the end of the year.
2162360	2167640	By the way, Microsoft also this week announced a partnership with Atari to bring some classic
2167640	2172600	Atari games to Xbox Live in 2007, as if they didn't have enough retro titles.
2172600	2174240	I've seen pictures of them, too.
2174240	2175240	Yeah?
2175240	2176240	They look pretty good.
2176240	2179040	Well, they've got, you know, kind of like the Konami titles on there.
2179040	2183960	They have their retro mode and their, you know, kind of remastered mode, I guess.
2183960	2189000	Well, the games you'll be able to get Warlords, Tempest, Missile Command, Centipede and Millipede,
2189000	2192160	Battlezone and Asteroids slash Asteroids Deluxe.
2192160	2196200	And yeah, they're going to have like the evolved mode is what they're calling it in the Atari
2196200	2197200	games.
2197200	2199880	Supposedly, you can play games like Warlords online, which I guess is kind of cool, but
2199880	2205160	I think like most retro games, it will be thrilling for about 20 minutes, and then you'll
2205160	2207680	be, why did I spend 400 points on this?
2207680	2210920	Yeah, that's pretty much a lot of the games.
2210920	2214140	Or if you're Loki, you'll say, are the achievements easy?
2214140	2217760	Because I need to boost my score, because I'm a stats whore.
2217760	2220960	Hey, that is true.
2220960	2224000	So anyways, another thing with the 360, their last...
2224000	2227920	Hey, would you say when it comes to gamer score that you're a total size queen?
2227920	2231920	No, I would not use the word queen.
2231920	2234000	A size king.
2234000	2235000	Whatever.
2235000	2242680	Anyways, so for the 360, the last update that they did with 1080p blocked out some of the
2242680	2248000	wonderful 1080p televisions out there, and there's also been other issues with it just
2248000	2250480	not being very well, very good.
2250480	2255720	So of course they are working on a fix right now on it, and it is being addressed, and
2255720	2259000	hopefully it will be fixed relatively soon.
2259000	2261340	So I don't know.
2261340	2265980	Why do people release updates for their systems when they know that they're broken?
2265980	2270160	Or you know, release games, like for example Call of Duty 3.
2270160	2272080	Call of Duty 2, okay, perfect example.
2272080	2278160	The game was released, multiplayer was lagged and bugged, and yeah, it wasn't working correctly.
2278160	2279720	Call of Duty 3 comes out.
2279720	2282480	The online is lagged, bugged, and doesn't work correctly.
2282480	2285760	Didn't you learn from the first one?
2285760	2287520	Fix the game before it comes out.
2287520	2290600	Or did you just say, oh fuck, we need to get it out before Christmas.
2290600	2292080	Oh, who cares if it's not finished.
2292080	2295320	No one's gonna care, we'll just release a patch later on, they'll be angry, but they'll
2295320	2296640	buy the next one.
2296640	2300640	So you know, seriously, finish the game before you release it.
2300640	2303560	Well at least the boss monster shows up in level 30, right?
2303560	2305560	Oh yeah.
2305560	2307240	Well at least they didn't fuck that up.
2307240	2309620	At least, you know.
2309620	2313200	That's gonna be my forever question I'm always gonna ask when you tell me a game's broken.
2313200	2316200	I'm gonna say, does the boss monster show up in level 30?
2316200	2319120	Because if so, at least they didn't, you know, at least they didn't fuck up as bad as somebody
2319120	2321600	else I can think of.
2321600	2322600	That's just crazy.
2322600	2326600	Hey, you know what, maybe they took a, you know, took a page from Rockstar and just didn't
2326600	2329680	play the multiplayer mode and just released the game as is.
2329680	2333600	Oh, do you know what the very first thing I did was when I played Gears of War?
2333600	2334600	What?
2334600	2335600	I downloaded a patch.
2335600	2337800	Yeah, me too.
2337800	2341240	Non-stop excitement from the moment I hit the power button.
2341240	2345000	Gears of War is currently sitting on the desk in my living room.
2345000	2347440	I don't know if it's been played yet.
2347440	2351080	Gears of War is like a visual orgasm.
2351080	2352760	It really is.
2352760	2356000	But I'll have more to say on it next week, because the gameplay I'm starting to question
2356000	2357560	a little bit, but we'll get to that next week.
2357560	2360640	I don't play games for how pretty they are, I play them for how well they play.
2360640	2363320	But, oh, you need to give this one a shot.
2363320	2366560	I mean it really is, like when they say it's pretty, they fucking mean it.
2366560	2368560	It's really pretty.
2368560	2369960	Okay.
2369960	2376720	Well, speaking of things that I guess some people might think are pretty, like, I don't
2376720	2380720	know, we actually have one person who plays this game in the room right now.
2380720	2386280	There's news for Second Life as Junami raises his hand.
2386280	2387280	Sup?
2387280	2397840	Well, at any rate, you'll be able to sit around with your virtual friends watching TV in Second
2397840	2398840	Life.
2398840	2403080	This is the kind of thing that I go into Second Life to get away from?
2403080	2410520	Well, they're working with a company called Rivers Run Red that is going to be producing
2410520	2421600	a TV channel for VirtualLife.tv, and you can install it in your virtual home and watch
2421600	2425280	the sci-fi channel and other TV.
2425280	2426280	What?
2426280	2428160	I'm laughing because this is stupid!
2428160	2430280	This is so stupid!
2430280	2433080	I mean, what are you going to do?
2433080	2438320	Hey, man, want to come over to my virtual pad and hang out?
2438320	2441680	We'll watch Pimp My Ride.
2441680	2442680	I mean...
2442680	2446560	Why, do you think I was doing in the, and you can do this?
2446560	2452780	I'm not blaming you, but this is, I mean, I get the technological, wow, that's kind
2452780	2458020	of neat end of it, like, hey, I can watch TV online, but, okay, seriously, if you're
2458020	2463760	meeting up with other people online to just sit down and watch TV, you can do that in
2463760	2464760	real life.
2464760	2466280	Is that being twice as lazy?
2466280	2470320	I mean, seriously, because if I'm sitting down playing a game where I'm watching TV
2470320	2474640	in the game, is that, like, twice as, you know, twice as lazy?
2474640	2479320	Speaking of which, you can actually do that also in Darkness, which is coming out, they're
2479320	2483160	having streaming video and stuff in their TV shows, so you can actually stop in the
2483160	2487600	game and watch TV, which I don't know why you would, but...
2487600	2490600	Funny Dale in our chat wants to know, since when was Second Life a game?
2490600	2491600	Seriously.
2491600	2497120	Well, just to say so, that it is launching in November.
2497120	2503080	What would really be insane would be if your Second Life avatar would log into his virtual
2503080	2506020	computer and then play Second Life as an item.
2506020	2508160	Do they have to pay for a virtual cable bill?
2508160	2510160	Because that would just suck.
2510160	2514960	I mean, just because you can do something in the game doesn't mean you should.
2514960	2519840	Well, the virtual police come to my house and bust me because I have a black box installed
2519840	2521720	on my Second Life TV.
2521720	2526520	Now, here's the thing with Second Life, can you, like, you know, murder other avatars
2526520	2531060	and stuff and get away with that, or can you, like, you know, abort your own baby or something?
2531060	2533320	Can you do, like, pretty much anything you want in this game?
2533320	2538560	Because that would be kind of cool.
2538560	2542560	I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, and I'm really going to anger some fans
2542560	2544800	of this game, I'm sorry, but take it in good stride, okay?
2544800	2547920	I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, alright?
2547920	2551840	Attention, everyone, you should come over to my house tonight, because we're going to
2551840	2556840	be watching on my 62-inch Blasma fake screen on Second Life, we're going to be watching
2556840	2559400	Battlestar Galactica, see you at 7.
2559400	2561840	Okay, 62-inch screen.
2561840	2565360	You can go straight to hell, but Punchin' Pie, Punchin' Pie, okay.
2565360	2566360	Fuck that.
2566360	2571440	If this is a virtual game, I'm making a TV that's the size of, like, 60 miles, you know,
2571440	2577120	wide, you know, 40 miles tall, and we'll just, you know, watch TV on that sucker.
2577120	2579800	You'll be able to see that TV anywhere in this world.
2579800	2583520	That's the way you got to do it, you know, if this is a fucking virtual world, then fucking
2583520	2586720	the sky should be a TV, I mean, seriously.
2586720	2587720	What's the point?
2587720	2590480	I'm just going to make the walls of my house a giant television that plays pornography
2590480	2591480	for all the neighbors.
2591480	2592480	There you go.
2592480	2599040	Now you're thinking, that's the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
2599040	2600040	So dumb.
2600040	2605040	Well, I find it doubly dumb since I don't actually watch TV, so, you know, if I want
2605040	2608040	to watch TV, I have the internet.
2608040	2611800	Not for watching virtual TV, I download it and watch it at my convenience.
2611800	2612800	Wait a second.
2612800	2613800	Wait a second.
2613800	2619200	Could in this game, could I, say, have my character watch TV of another character watching
2619200	2621780	his TV of another character watching his TV?
2621780	2623840	Like reality shows in Second Life?
2623840	2624840	Yeah.
2624840	2626440	Second Life Survivor?
2626440	2631920	So we can watch somebody in Second Life on the Second Life TV watching their Second Life
2631920	2634080	TV is the ultimate in boring.
2634080	2639080	I am positive it can be done.
2639080	2643320	All we have to do is find out how.
2643320	2647000	Moving on to the topics before we get all the hate mail from the Second Life fans.
2647000	2652120	Look, you know, I'll give you this.
2652120	2658760	If the goal of Second Life is to, like, recreate life, then having the ability to just kind
2658760	2664920	of go somewhere and hang out, watch TV, is a big step, is one small step for man.
2664920	2668240	One giant leap for virtual man.
2668240	2670360	Forget it.
2670360	2676040	Wii component cables, hey, the Nintendo Wii's coming out and remember the component cables.
2676040	2679080	There's this whole back and forth where Perry and Kaplan said, yes, you're going to be able
2679080	2683360	to get the components cables in stores, but then the internet's like, but you lied to
2683360	2686840	us before, lady, when you said that the thing would be region free.
2686840	2692360	Well, this is what's up is that there's actually only going to be three retailers that you
2692360	2694240	can get it at for now.
2694240	2696480	Circuit City, GameStop, and Best Buy.
2696480	2699120	And I'm assuming when they say GameStop, they mean EB Games as well.
2699120	2702080	So those will be the places that you can get the component cables.
2702080	2706760	So if you're getting your Wii somewhere else, like Toys R Us, I didn't see them on the list,
2706760	2711080	you may have to go to one of the other retailers to get your component cables if you are a
2711080	2712640	480p whore.
2712640	2713640	Not surprised.
2713640	2714640	And why?
2714640	2719800	Because they're running in the shortages on everything for the Nintendo Wii.
2719800	2725560	Accessories, Zelda, Excite Truck, they cannot produce them fast enough.
2725560	2729960	And I'm wondering if they just spent all this time trying to produce the units and cut back
2729960	2735360	on the accessories and other stuff because that's where, I mean, as far as my company,
2735360	2742360	that's what we're running into, allocations on everything, accessories and games and you
2742360	2743360	name it.
2743360	2749200	So eliminating it down to three different stores, which I'm sure they paid a fat little
2749200	2756520	bonus to Nintendo for that privilege, makes perfect sense to me.
2756520	2759520	The chat room's still fixated on the Second Life thing and there's a good comment here
2759520	2760520	so I want to read it.
2760520	2764540	Footy Monster says, Second Life does open a way of people who cannot be physically together
2764540	2765880	to actually hang out.
2765880	2767040	I'll give you that.
2767040	2771120	And that's kind of cool and World of Warcraft is very similar and a lot of these MMOs are
2771120	2775760	very similar but, like, you're going to hang out and watch TV.
2775760	2776760	That's what you're going to do.
2776760	2777760	Let me put it this way.
2777760	2783080	That'd be like, you know, the equivalent of, okay, I'm flying, okay, to the other side
2783080	2788000	of the world to meet a pen pal or whatever and once I get there, what do I do?
2788000	2792120	I've spent all this money, all this time, you know, building up for this moment.
2792120	2794000	Hey man, you want to watch some TV?
2794000	2795000	Yeah, sure, let's watch.
2795000	2798200	I mean, that's like a big, like, waste of time.
2798200	2799200	What did you say, Tiara?
2799200	2800200	What did you say?
2800200	2802960	I said that just described my trip here.
2802960	2809560	Look, if you're going to spend all that money to fly out and meet your pen pal, at least
2809560	2811560	do some fucking because that's...
2811560	2815080	Actually, actually, actually, actually, actually.
2815080	2818200	Because you know that expectation is there somewhere.
2818200	2820360	We did share a bad chance for Cisco.
2820360	2822360	It was really, yeah.
2822360	2825280	Well Chris and Megsy met...
2825280	2827920	And what do you think they do when they meet up in real life?
2827920	2831400	Do you think they read the Bible and, you know, pray together?
2831400	2833120	No, they're doing some fucking.
2833120	2834120	Here's the better one.
2834120	2840080	When you have friends that come over and both are on the computer, like, you know, Rob,
2840080	2842920	if you and Shane are over here, you'll be playing, you know, Phantasy Star Universe
2842920	2844280	or something like that.
2844280	2849200	Both of you playing Second Life and watching TV in Second Life together, you're in the
2849200	2855540	same room, not communicating to each other, but you're still watching the TV in the game.
2855540	2856700	That's awesome.
2856700	2859320	My mind has just been blown.
2859320	2862360	Anyways, back to actual, you know...
2862360	2867320	So I just wanted to say, if you can't afford the whole plane ticket thing because you can't
2867320	2871560	get out there and have sex with the person that you've been talking to online, the least
2871560	2877240	you can do instead of watching TV in Second Life is do some cyber fucking, because that's
2877240	2879120	as close as you can get.
2879120	2880120	Damn straight.
2880120	2886920	So anyways, on to actual real uses for your TV.
2886920	2888480	Nintendo Virtual Console.
2888480	2894200	It's definitely a big thing and right now it's speculated that you're not going to be
2894200	2897320	able to have rumble in your Nintendo 64 games.
2897320	2898320	Why?
2898320	2903720	Because your Nintendo 64 games are going to be using the classic controller and there
2903720	2905280	is no rumble for that.
2905280	2907240	Now that's interesting.
2907240	2911200	I mean, also when you think about the Nintendo 64, not all the controllers had rumbles.
2911200	2914560	You had to basically buy the rumble pack for it.
2914560	2915800	So I don't know if that's a huge thing.
2915800	2920760	I guess like in games like Ocarina of Time where that was important because they rumble
2920760	2923680	for hidden treasure and stuff.
2923680	2924880	I don't know.
2924880	2929700	But I remember reading somewhere that it's speculated that you're still going to have
2929700	2933760	rumble in the games because apparently on the back of the classic controller you'll
2933760	2939600	be able to snap the Wii remote to it and it will use the Wii remote to rumble.
2939600	2943660	So I don't know if this is something that's coming later on or if, you know, right now
2943660	2949440	of course nobody that has their Wii can check that out because, well, the online service
2949440	2955360	for both the Virtual Console and anything else, the news, weather, etc. is not available
2955360	2956920	so they can't try it yet.
2956920	2963040	But I guess we'll find out on the 19th when all that launches and, I don't know, is that
2963040	2967760	a deal breaker you think for the Nintendo 64 games and not having any rumble?
2967760	2970520	I personally don't care.
2970520	2972120	I don't think it's the end of the world.
2972120	2975800	I seem to recall most games that make use of the rumble feature will also do the exclamation
2975800	2977600	points or whatever the hell it is.
2977600	2980880	So I don't think it's going to be a deal breaker.
2980880	2985240	I think it just goes to show though that emulation will only go so far and if you want to play
2985240	2987600	the real deal, go play the real deal.
2987600	2991520	Dig out your Nintendo 64 out of the trash if you're Loki.
2991520	2995120	And ask him what he did with his Nintendo 64.
2995120	2996120	Ask him.
2996120	2999120	I could have given it to somebody.
2999120	3000120	Exactly.
3000120	3003120	I could have, but I didn't.
3003120	3004120	I'm allowed.
3004120	3007200	You know why I threw it away too, because I'm just going to buy the games on the Virtual
3007200	3010200	Console?
3010200	3016900	Mario Kart cannot come out faster on the Wii.
3016900	3021760	I still think nothing is as cool as playing it on the system it was made for, which is
3021760	3029420	why I have 40-something video game systems taking up a whole room in my house, which
3029420	3030420	is true.
3030420	3035720	Well, of course, that's no secret to anybody because I'm a big nerd, but what is a secret
3035720	3040600	is, well, actually, no, that's not a secret either because there are no more Wii secrets.
3040600	3046260	If anyone thinks that Nintendo is holding something, no, Reggie says so himself.
3046260	3049660	So saith Reggie, so be it.
3049660	3052520	So my Wii isn't going to be able to secretly print money?
3052520	3053520	No.
3053520	3056360	Because I was really hoping to have this reaction on launch day.
3056360	3057360	50-dollar bill!
3057360	3058360	50-dollar bill!
3058360	3059360	50-dollar bill!
3059360	3060360	50-dollar bill!
3060360	3061360	God!
3061360	3062360	50-dollar bill!
3062360	3063360	50-dollar bill!
3063360	3069160	Because, you know, I heard the Wii was going to print money, so I was excited.
3069160	3070160	Only for Nintendo.
3070160	3072880	We have a story later on that might be true.
3072880	3075080	What, that the Wii prints money?
3075080	3077080	You might be able to make it print money.
3077080	3078080	Awesome!
3078080	3084160	And also, of course, there's the plan about the four million unit launch, which, what
3084160	3087480	is, is that the biggest unit launch, do you think?
3087480	3088800	The biggest launch?
3088800	3089800	Yeah.
3089800	3091480	I don't, I have no idea.
3091480	3093880	That's pretty crazy.
3093880	3095960	That's a big unit.
3095960	3097760	That is.
3097760	3099560	It's a powerful Wii.
3099560	3101760	What a mighty, mighty Wii.
3101760	3103560	Would you say it was a big unit?
3103560	3104560	Dark Sakura?
3104560	3106280	I'm not interested in the big unit.
3106280	3110760	One of the biggest units you've ever seen?
3110760	3117680	Let's see, speaking of big units that will cost you big money, GameStop is putting together
3117680	3120440	this big bundle of Wii.
3120440	3126240	It's a 700-dollar Wii mega bundle, and basically, this is the only way that you can get a Wii
3126240	3129520	through their website early, because remember, this is the same shit they pulled with the
3129520	3133720	Xbox 360, is that, you know, hey, you want to have the Xbox 360 right now?
3133720	3138400	Okay, buy our 1,000-dollar bundle that has all these games with it.
3138400	3139400	Sold out.
3139400	3140400	Yeah, I know.
3140400	3141400	I was getting to that.
3141400	3143440	God damn it, stop ruining the punchline.
3143440	3149560	So the Wii is 250, you get the SD card, which is 60 bucks, an additional Wiimote for 40,
3149560	3156560	six games totaling $300, a 12-month product replacement plan, and, whoopty shit, a GameInformer
3156560	3157560	gift subscription.
3157560	3162080	So, you know, the talk online was, don't support this bullshit!
3162080	3165120	This is extortion, in a way.
3165120	3166120	Right?
3166120	3170440	They know people want this system, so this is how they're doing it.
3170440	3175080	So don't support it, and then the damn thing sells out in like five minutes.
3175080	3180980	We were going to band together as gamers and teach these corporate dickheads a lesson that
3180980	3188360	they can't make me buy Super Monkey Banana Ball Blitz whatever shit Wii game that I don't
3188360	3191720	really want.
3191720	3192720	That'll last.
3192720	3193720	It sold out in an hour.
3193720	3197000	You know, I almost bought Super Monkey Banana Blitz.
3197000	3198160	Well, whatever.
3198160	3200240	I'm sure there's lots of Super Monkey Ball fans out there.
3200240	3202480	I'm just picking on your game for no particular reason.
3202480	3203480	I'm in the mood tonight.
3203480	3207960	You know the 1GB SD memory card for $59.99?
3207960	3213200	You can get one for about 20 bucks at, I believe, Newegg or something like that.
3213200	3220560	Definitely not $60 for a 1GB SD memory card, so that's a ripoff right there.
3220560	3228560	In the 12 month Game Informer gift subscription, lame, trust me.
3228560	3231800	That's $15 right there.
3231800	3235480	Going to the chatroom and reading some comments, Raven's Dolphin says, well look at the PlayStation
3235480	3236480	3 sky.
3236480	3237480	Ooh, zing.
3237480	3241720	Because of the whole fact that maybe I don't want a freaking Blu-ray player.
3241720	3244240	But then again, that's kind of a necessary component, right, because the games are going
3244240	3245240	to be Blu-ray.
3245240	3248240	Let's see.
3248240	3252040	Jeremy Todd 1 says, but not everyone likes the same games as you, Rob.
3252040	3255520	Maybe those people wanted all the games packaged in, and so they bought this bundle so they
3255520	3256640	would save money.
3256640	3257640	You know what?
3257640	3258640	I beg to differ.
3258640	3260160	They don't save any money.
3260160	3261400	Look at the games you're getting.
3261400	3265800	Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, Red Steel, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Super Monkey Ball
3265800	3268360	Banana Blitz, and Madden NFL 2007.
3268360	3272000	You mean to tell me the same person that's going to buy Red Steel is going to buy Monkey
3272000	3277660	Ball Banana Blitz and Madden 2007 is interested in all those games together?
3277660	3283600	There's not one Poopy game in that list, depending on who you are?
3283600	3285440	Madden is Poopy.
3285440	3288600	Madden for the Wii is not exactly Poopy.
3288600	3292760	Madden is not Poopy at all, if you like football games.
3292760	3296820	But I'm saying that I don't think you like every single one of those genres.
3296820	3297820	Maybe it's the opposite.
3297820	3300920	Maybe you're a Madden fan, and that's the game you want, because throwing the football
3300920	3304800	with a controller is kind of fucking cool, even for somebody who may not be into football
3304800	3305800	games.
3305800	3306800	But do I really want Monkey Ball?
3306800	3309160	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is pretty awesome.
3309160	3314040	They've got tons of cool mini-games, and apparently it's both for kids and people that are really
3314040	3315720	hardcore into that game.
3315720	3318360	I think we've overlooked, though, the main selling point.
3318360	3320680	It's the Family Pack.
3320680	3322680	No.
3322680	3325880	Jeremy Todd 1 seems to agree with you.
3325880	3329840	Well, the Wii is marketed towards the whole family, so the kids would like the child games
3329840	3332560	and the older people would like the Red Steel Madden.
3332560	3333560	I'll give you that.
3333560	3337640	And then again, all six, and of course JV Mon says, I preordered Monkey Ball and Red
3337640	3338640	Steel.
3338640	3339640	Okay.
3339640	3340640	But did you preorder Madden?
3340640	3341640	Is that game interesting you too?
3341640	3344960	Would you say all six of those games are something that interests you?
3344960	3347520	Footy Monster says they are good games in general.
3347520	3348520	No, I don't.
3348520	3349840	I haven't played them yet.
3349840	3352360	Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just a shitty port.
3352360	3353360	That's all it is.
3353360	3357240	So the game itself is good, but I mean, it's just a port.
3357240	3359240	So whatever.
3359240	3360800	Alright.
3360800	3368480	Anyway, all this forced extortion of money and forcing me to buy Monkey Ball when I don't
3368480	3372560	really want it, it ruffles my feathers and it makes me very angry.
3372560	3374760	And as you can already tell, I'm in a bit of a mood tonight.
3374760	3375760	I don't know why.
3375760	3377000	There's no particular reason for it.
3377000	3382520	I think Tiara brings some type of energy with her that makes me more, I don't know.
3382520	3384960	I think it's gas from your lunch.
3384960	3386040	Maybe.
3386040	3387040	From that yummy pumpkin cheesecake.
3387040	3388680	We went to the Cheesecake Factory today.
3388680	3389680	Good stuff.
3389680	3392920	Wait, you're going to put me in a good mood, and that's not the time to be in a good mood.
3392920	3393920	Rob, they're out of cheesecake.
3393920	3394920	People die.
3394920	3411800	It's time, of course, for the FUs of the week, and I have one, and one that's the size of
3411800	3413800	an entire city.
3413800	3420320	FU to most of the drivers in San Francisco for being retarded, and the whole town for
3420320	3424160	being laid out so funny and getting me lost.
3424160	3428720	Even the power of the double horns did not make the people move out of my way, or almost
3428720	3434040	run into me, or stop in the middle of the damn, not in the middle of the lane I was
3434040	3436800	in, but between two lanes.
3436800	3438800	Oh, God.
3438800	3444800	Just when I think my road rage might have subsided a bit, I drive in San Francisco,
3444800	3450800	and then it comes back, and then I want to kill.
3450800	3456800	I imagine how I'm going to kill them in slow, painful ways, like using a cheese grater and
3456800	3457800	lemon juice.
3457800	3458800	I'm good.
3458800	3470320	Okay, FU to game blog sites that posting pictures of the Wii in play, or posting, I don't know,
3470320	3475480	stupid details like, it comes in a box, with cords, and stuff.
3475480	3476480	That is not news.
3476480	3478120	Please stop reporting it.
3478120	3479120	I mean, my God.
3479120	3483620	I know everyone's excited for this console launch, but I do not need to see stop motion
3483620	3486560	of you pulling the damn console out of a box.
3486560	3491400	You know what, though, I'm exempting Kotaku from this, FU, because the video of his kid
3491400	3496320	playing the system was so fucking adorable, I went to go, oh, they're so cute, they're
3496320	3497360	so cute.
3497360	3498840	So I'm exempting Kotaku from this.
3498840	3503120	At least that's a creative way of doing it, but it, I mean, we had news stories about
3503120	3504840	how the Wii can be used as a whiteboard.
3504840	3506640	I mean, come on.
3506640	3512560	Just because it's shiny, you can put dry erase pens on it, big deal, but it's not news.
3512560	3513560	Pooeater agrees with you.
3513560	3515120	I don't give a shit about you playing the Wii.
3515120	3517120	I care about me playing the Wii.
3517120	3518120	Exactly.
3518120	3519120	Alright.
3519120	3528800	My FU of the week goes to Baskin-Robbins, because the way they scoop their ice cream,
3528800	3533380	like all the ice cream comes up at the top, and none of it ever falls into the cone.
3533380	3536080	So it's like, you know, by the time I eat my ice cream, because they eat my ice cream
3536080	3540760	fast, there's no ice cream left in the cone, so it's like I have this empty cone with nothing
3540760	3542480	to do with, and it's kind of sad.
3542480	3545280	That was seriously the best thing I could come up with tonight.
3545280	3546480	Eat the cone.
3546480	3550360	I'm not that angry all these, okay, no, then I'll give them this.
3550360	3554580	FU to the fact that, still with Baskin-Robbins, when you rip off the paper, sometimes like
3554580	3558240	some of the paper gets stuck to the cone, and it's like, I have to eat paper?
3558240	3560240	You need to eat the glue.
3560240	3561240	Ew.
3561240	3562240	Ew.
3562240	3563240	FU to paper cone things.
3563240	3564240	T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.
3564240	3565240	Do you have a FU?
3565240	3572240	I would just like to say FU to Marvel for taking so freaking long to finish Ultimate
3572240	3573240	Wars Volume 2.
3573240	3578160	The last issue came out last month, and the next issue that will wrap it up, which only
3578160	3582360	needed probably about five pages to finish the entire series, will come out December
3582360	3583360	20th.
3583360	3585360	So that kind of sucks.
3585360	3586360	Hi.
3586360	3587360	Drew Nami.
3587360	3591360	All right, first of all, shared FU for everyone.
3591360	3594980	FU to MySpace, your site design sucks ass.
3594980	3598000	Your members don't know web design were shit.
3598000	3601400	Give them a quiz before they're allowed to make a profile, please.
3601400	3605160	And FU to people who verb nouns.
3605160	3606440	Verbing nouns suck.
3606440	3609800	Stop verbing nouns.
3609800	3617960	And on that note, let's move on to our next story because, oh, our next story is Join
3617960	3619540	Our MySpace.
3619540	3624660	We have a MySpace profile over at www.myspace.com slash orange lounge radio.
3624660	3625660	Hear clips from the show.
3625660	3629380	Add us to your friends list.
3629380	3637420	Comment on our profile with cute little YouTube videos because that's what people do on MySpace.
3637420	3639920	Let's talk about upcoming release dates.
3639920	3644480	Hey, Loki, I heard Full Auto 2 on the PSPs coming out.
3644480	3649200	I was really surprised to hear that because I had no idea it was in development.
3649200	3650200	That was a real surprise.
3650200	3651680	Yeah, that's a complete shocker to me.
3651680	3656960	I'm glad someone came out and said that because if not, I would have had to have said it on
3656960	3659600	every single show for a long time now.
3659600	3665000	Well, thank God 1UP reported on it because now it's true because nothing is true until
3665000	3666000	1UP reports on it.
3666000	3667600	It's not necessarily just 1UP.
3667600	3671220	Everybody reported on it because they finally put out a press release about it.
3671220	3676080	But my God, how many fucking weeks do I need to tell you guys something's coming out and
3676080	3680180	no one picks up on the story until, oh, look, hey, guess what?
3680180	3683480	Some other website posted about this, so now it's true.
3683480	3685040	Well, poopy on you.
3685040	3686040	You know what?
3686040	3689120	This is a show special, so the people who listen to this show, you're like a special
3689120	3690120	club.
3690120	3691120	You get to know this first.
3691120	3692120	Fine.
3692120	3698160	Anyways, so some other special stuff you get to know first, Full Auto 2 Battle Lines for
3698160	3699160	the PS3.
3699160	3702040	If you're waiting for that as a launch title, guess what?
3702040	3703400	It's not coming out at launch.
3703400	3710160	It'll be coming out December 13th instead, so ha, that's karma for you, Sega.
3710160	3714120	Also along the same lines, Blazing Angels for the PlayStation 3, also not coming out
3714120	3716760	until December 13th.
3716760	3717760	Not a big surprise.
3717760	3724040	Rainbow Six Vegas, also another game being delayed until January 31st for the PlayStation
3724040	3726720	3, so that's very interesting.
3726720	3733680	Now for the 360, you've seen the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 pack come out back
3733680	3734680	in September.
3734680	3740400	Well, now they're starting to do a brand new thing, kind of like the old PlayStation 2
3740400	3745320	demo discs that they released, their jam-packed discs.
3745320	3749320	Well now they have this brand new thing called Xbox 360 Exhibition.
3749320	3756160	It's going to be $5.99 retail and it'll feature six demos, including Madden NFL 07, Dead Rising,
3756160	3762960	F.E.A.R., Fusion Frenzy 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and also six HD videos, including Halo
3762960	3768280	3, Splinter Cell Double Agent, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc.
3768280	3773280	And this is meant for someone, of course, that does not have Xbox Live, so they wouldn't
3773280	3779120	have access to this, or they just didn't want to buy the Xbox official magazine.
3779120	3781400	Or you just really want to pay for demos.
3781400	3782400	Apparently.
3782400	3786440	So it is out there, it's coming out on the 22nd, the one year anniversary.
3786440	3790200	I have $6 to spend and I just don't know what to do with it.
3790200	3793680	Not really interested in a combo meal from a local fast food restaurant.
3793680	3800560	I can tell you what you would spend this money on, and it's goddamn not a 360 Exhibition,
3800560	3801560	Sneak King.
3801560	3805200	Sneak King is what you can spend your money on Sneak King and hell, you have enough money
3805200	3807240	for some fries and a Coke, there you go.
3807240	3808240	So...
3808240	3809240	No, you're wrong.
3809240	3811960	Wrong, because you have to get a combo meal to get the game, so you actually need more
3811960	3812960	than $6.
3812960	3813960	Whatever.
3813960	3817800	You just got served, you got BK served.
3817800	3821440	You're still hungry, you would spend the money on lunch anyways, it's just, you know, whatever.
3821440	3823040	Now you get Sneak King.
3823040	3828200	No, this is what I'll do, I'll get Drew, I'll say, Drew, don't you want to go out to eat
3828200	3831160	and make him buy the meal, and then I'll buy the game.
3831160	3833440	Money saved.
3833440	3835200	Don't you want some chicken fries?
3835200	3836800	Don't you want some chicken fries?
3836800	3838520	Yeah, I do.
3838520	3846480	Anyways, so, you know, getting back into the swing of things here, now, this week actually
3846480	3851000	for games is probably the largest week of the entire year, and that said, there's not
3851000	3857400	a lot of good stuff coming out actually, which is really sad, but for the 360 though, there
3857400	3862840	are some pretty interesting things, Dead or Alive Extreme 2 is finally making its way
3862840	3868840	out into the market, so if you're looking for a lot of TNA, well, you won't have to
3868840	3870480	wait much longer.
3870480	3872200	Also Rainbow Six Vegas for the 360.
3872200	3878640	That's the way to get some chicken fries and some TNA.
3878640	3886000	Aragon is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and then the portable systems.
3886000	3891560	Pimp My Ride on PlayStation 2, actually, no, I forgot that one got delayed a week.
3891560	3897040	But anyways, what were you going to say there, Rob?
3897040	3902640	Something really sarcastic about Pimp My Ride the game, but I really need to shut up tonight,
3902640	3908760	because we're going to get angry emails, you know, Rob talks too much on the program.
3908760	3914280	I downloaded this podcast having no idea that Rob would talk so much, I mean, his fucking
3914280	3917960	picture is on the little album art, but I never knew he would talk so much.
3917960	3918960	More lesbians!
3918960	3919960	More lesbians!
3919960	3925520	Okay, let's see, lots of PlayStation 3 games, of course, all the launch stuff, Mobile Suit,
3925520	3936960	Gundam, Crossfire, NHL 2K7, NBA 2K7, Ridge Racer 7, then of course a bunch of Wii titles,
3936960	3944080	you know, Avatar Last Airbender, Red Steel, Excite Truck, Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess,
3944080	3948480	pretty much everything that you want for the Wii is coming out Red Steel.
3948480	3954200	Other than all that stuff, Bionicle Heroes is coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube 360,
3954200	3959280	the DS, Game Boy Advance, Tomb Raider is finally coming out on the Nintendo systems, Capcom
3959280	3965320	Classics Collection Volume 2 is on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, the Sega Genesis Collection finally
3965320	3974680	coming out, Guitar Man Lives on the PSP, Final Fantasy III on the DS, Gunpei on PlayStation
3974680	3984400	2 and the DS, and then of course, there's just so much crap coming out, it's amazing.
3984400	3988440	Yeah, more than I would even want to list.
3988440	3992400	All your PlayStation 3 launch titles, all your Wii launch titles, a lot of other stuff
3992400	3999420	mixed in there, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 07, this is just too much shit.

4042120	4043120	Uh huh.
4043120	4044120	Was that all for our US release dates?
4044120	4049120	Yeah, there's too much for me to list, I mean honestly, Polarium Advanced, I mean if you
4049120	4051040	really want to buy that.

4106040	4111960	Instead of have fun, wouldn't that be, have a jolly old time, have a jolly old time, I'm
4111960	4114240	just kidding.
4114240	4118160	The chat room's asking who fed me sugar before the show, Jamie actually, she brought me a
4118160	4119160	cookie.
4119160	4120160	I brought cookies.
4120160	4124200	It was like a coffee cookie, so it was sugar and caffeine and apparently it was laced with
4124200	4125200	crack.
4125200	4126200	Apparently.
4126200	4127200	Yeah.
4127200	4130720	That's right, I had Tiara's Latte Cheesecake too.
4130720	4131720	It all comes together.
4131720	4133920	Hey Japan, how about some release dates?
4133920	4138880	You guys have the PS3 now, so you're getting some games this week, including Majang Kakuto
4138880	4144200	Club which comes out November 16th, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on November 17th, and Need
4144200	4146680	for Speed Carbon on November 20th.
4146680	4150120	You've got to wait until December 2nd for the Wii though, sorry kids.
4150120	4153880	You do get a lot of PlayStation 2 releases coming out this week.
4153880	4157920	You get Rhapsodia, which is going into the Konami The Best series, it's actually getting
4157920	4164200	a little bit of a price cut, and let's see, White Princess II is coming out on the 16th
4164200	4165200	as well.
4165200	4168100	That also appears to be going into a collection.
4168100	4173160	This game is also going into a collection, and this might be my import title of the week.
4173160	4175480	It's Kashi Mashi Girl Meets Girl.
4175480	4177440	Hey, I want that one.
4177440	4181640	I'll bet it does.
4181640	4184680	Girl Meets Girl, and much Kashi Mashi ensues.
4184680	4191600	Let's see, we also have on the Nintendo DS Puzzle Series Volumes 5, 6, and 7 from Hudson,
4191600	4198400	Magic Taizen and Akumajo Dracula, that's just a bundle there, Gallery of Labyrinth comes
4198400	4199400	out.
4199400	4202100	Oh, that's the Portrait of Ruin title, that's what they're calling it over in Japan.
4202100	4204520	That's not a bundle, sorry kids, that's just that game.
4204520	4208840	If you're a PSP player, Metal Gear Acid 2 is going into the best this week on the 16th.
4208840	4214280	You get a Sudoku game from Hudson on the 16th, and Gunpei, oh wait, that's the 20th, sorry,
4214280	4218240	you've got to wait a little while longer for that one.
4218240	4220080	And that's all I've got for you.
4220080	4221080	Excellent.
4221080	4226760	Well, with the Wii coming out here pretty soon, and of course Virtual Console also launching
4226760	4232760	relatively soon, there's lots of titles coming out, and more of course being leaked by the
4232760	4242720	ESRB, including some gun games, Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure,
4242720	4247080	Pilot Wings, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, and Wild Gunman.
4247080	4250880	In other words, seriously, the games I really want.
4250880	4254520	I mean, that's what this pack is right here.
4254520	4255520	The games I really want.
4255520	4256520	It's the Rob pack.
4256520	4260520	As opposed to the first pack, which was like games I kind of will buy if I have extra money.
4260520	4264040	These are the games that are like Kid Icarus, Hogan's Alley, they used to have that game
4264040	4267720	at, what was that place called, that Burger Joint, Flaky Jake's, remember that place?
4267720	4269480	That's what FUD Records used to be years ago.
4269480	4272400	They had a freaking, yeah, somebody who's lived here a long time knows what I'm talking
4272400	4273400	about.
4273400	4277000	They had a Hogan's Alley machine back in the day, and Wild Gunman is like the most simple
4277000	4278200	game ever made.
4278200	4279440	Have you ever played Wild Gunman?
4279440	4280440	No.
4280440	4281660	That's the concept of Wild Gunman.
4281660	4287000	The person goes, draw, and you fire the zapper gun as fast as you can.
4287000	4288000	That's all it is.
4288000	4293000	It's basically, they could re-release this game as push the button fast, and that's exactly
4293000	4294000	what it is.
4294000	4298200	It was in Back to the Future, Loki, if you remember Back to the Future.
4298200	4299660	Yeah, I remember that.
4299660	4301840	That's the game that was there.
4301840	4303360	Was it also in the Karate Kid?
4303360	4305000	No, I might be on crack.
4305000	4306400	No, that was skeet shooting.
4306400	4307400	Never mind.
4307400	4308400	I'm on crack.
4308400	4312040	Well, it's kind of stupid, though, that they have Dunk Hunt coming out anyways, because
4312040	4315200	I mean, was it that Wii Play game was pretty much Duck Hunt anyways?
4315200	4322680	Of course, we're not getting Wii Play, because we're the United States, and the fucking UK
4322680	4323680	gets it.
4323680	4324680	Bastards.
4324680	4329240	It would be nice if they would rename Hogan's Alley Hogan Knows Best's Alley, because then
4329240	4333800	I could zap Brooke, and that would bring me endless days of excitement.
4333800	4335920	Hogan's Heroes Alley.
4335920	4337780	Hogan!
4337780	4339680	The Hogan Family Alley.
4339680	4342400	I just killed Sandy Duncan.
4342400	4347260	And if you caught that reference, you totally are an 80s child.
4347260	4348680	Even Matt's laughing at that one.
4348680	4349680	Wow.
4349680	4350680	I don't even know why.
4350680	4353880	I don't even know what you're talking about.
4353880	4355800	Don't you remember The Hogan Family?
4355800	4356800	Never mind, forget it.
4356800	4357800	No.
4357800	4360000	I remember The Hogan Family.
4360000	4361000	Thank you.
4361000	4363080	You know what else I remember?
4363080	4364380	What?
4364380	4365840	When this show was good?
4365840	4366840	Yeah.
4366840	4368840	I remember when we were in episode 2.
4368840	4369840	Was it Mike?
4369840	4370840	Yeah, yeah.
4370840	4371840	Yeah?
4371840	4372840	Yeah.
4372840	4373840	I asked off mic.
4373840	4374840	Oh.
4374840	4375840	Yep.
4375840	4378840	Yes, it's your turn to read a story, Jamie.
4378840	4380680	Tell us a story!
4380680	4382440	Tell us a story, Jamie.
4382440	4383440	Okay.
4383440	4385800	In other news, the ferret is on fire.
4385800	4386800	Good.
4386800	4387800	Whatever.
4387800	4390960	Yeah, guess what?
4390960	4396720	Namco has registered new Katamari Damacy trademarks, so we can get more ball rolling
4396720	4397720	in.
4397720	4404400	We have beautiful Katamari Damacy, Katamari Damacy Trybian, and there was an application
4404400	4408840	filed for Katamari Damacy-kun.
4408840	4409840	Ball rolling.
4409840	4411520	And to think I skipped the PSP version of Katamari.
4411520	4418360	Hey, we talked about man cannons the other week.
4418360	4420080	Can you roll a Katamari into a man cannon?
4420080	4421080	What would happen?
4421080	4422080	That would be a...
4422080	4424960	A big black cock.
4424960	4425960	Wow.
4425960	4432560	That reference is about 150 episodes old, and people aren't going to get it, and they're
4432560	4435240	going to go, what the fuck is wrong with Jamie?
4435240	4438280	29, look it up.
4438280	4440680	Oh, Drunami knows what episode number.
4440680	4441680	You are sad.
4441680	4442680	You're adored.
4442680	4443680	You are sad.
4443680	4445680	It was my first time in the studio.
4445680	4446680	29.
4446680	4447680	29, he says.
4447680	4448680	All right.
4448680	4449680	Anyway, sorry.
4449680	4454080	Oh, my turn.
4454080	4458280	Xbox Live is getting another new game very soon, and this is one I know that's near and
4458280	4462560	dear to at least one person's heart in this room, Worms.
4462560	4463560	You remember Worms?
4463560	4464560	Yeah.
4464560	4467440	Worms HD is coming.
4467440	4470600	Right now, plans for announcements are being discussed with Microsoft right now.
4470600	4474400	The game is in final certification stages, so maybe we'll get this by the end of the
4474400	4475400	year.
4475400	4476400	That would be rad.
4476400	4477400	Hopefully.
4477400	4478400	But I don't know.
4478400	4482080	Rumor is that the release calendar is full for the year, so this might have to wait until
4482080	4483080	next year.
4483080	4484080	Oh!
4484080	4485080	Here's my thought.
4485080	4486080	Are we getting another UNO pack?
4486080	4487080	Ooh, ooh, ooh!
4487080	4488080	God, that's...
4488080	4492400	You know, if another game gets delayed, I really can't fucking wait for the Viva Pinata
4492400	4493400	UNO pack.
4493400	4494400	I just...
4494400	4497480	God, I'm on pins and fucking needles waiting for that.
4497480	4501920	I have 100 points saved just so I can buy the Viva Pinata UNO pack.
4501920	4502920	I hope one of these games...
4502920	4503920	No!
4503920	4505720	Of course I'm lying!
4505720	4509440	This game could be put in when some other game gets delayed if it's ready to go.
4509440	4512080	You know one of those other games is going to get delayed because they're going to go,
4512080	4516240	gee, when we do the upscrolling level, it looks completely different on two different
4516240	4517240	screens.
4517240	4518920	Anyway, Worms is the game, of course.
4518920	4521280	It's like scorched earth!
4521280	4524040	It's scorched earth in wormy form.
4524040	4528560	And you know, you fire bombs and blast them and you know, all that stuff.
4528560	4529560	Banana bombs.
4529560	4530560	Holy hand grenades!
4530560	4531560	Yes!
4531560	4532560	Super sheep!
4532560	4538220	I've actually been quoting lines from Monty Python all weekend, and I was quoting the
4538220	4540720	holy hand grenade thing at the Metreon.
4540720	4546680	Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that it might blow thine enemies to tiny bits,
4546680	4547680	in thy mercy.
4547680	4553280	Oh, at the wax museum, that's right.
4553280	4555160	Something completely different, you say?
4555160	4557600	How about Linux on the Wii?
4557600	4559280	I was going to say Wii on Linux.
4559280	4560280	That'd be a little weird.
4560280	4566000	No, but anyways, yes, Wii and Linux.
4566000	4571920	WEE-lee, you say, yes, that's actually what it's called, WEE-lee, and it's being done.
4571920	4574080	I see what you did there.
4574080	4583160	Yeah, okay, anyways, so it's actually being worked on, and supposedly they're going to
4583160	4587560	start beta testing this thing as soon as the Wii comes out, because it's based on the GameCube
4587560	4589480	Linux as well.
4589480	4594320	Some things that they're aiming to be able to do with this, surfing the internet using,
4594320	4598040	you know, the control, of course, as a mouse pointer, even though you can do that anyways.
4598040	4605960	Wii media extender, to stream movies and music and stuff from your PC to the Wii and to your
4605960	4606960	TV.
4606960	4611360	They said, basically, think Apple ITV for free.
4611360	4616560	Write document with a regular USB keyboard and print with any USB printer.
4616560	4624160	So you could print money, huh, huh, see?
4624160	4625840	Email and chat with your friends.
4625840	4638880	50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, guys, 50 dollar bill, sorry I was late.
4638880	4645740	Play classic games using the MAME console emulator, that'd be an irony right there.
4645740	4653220	Develop your own programs and games, control WEE-lee from your PC using a Wi-Fi connection,
4653220	4661600	and use WEE-lee and the Wii as a network attached storage by connecting it to an external USB
4661600	4663240	hard drive.
4663240	4665280	And pretty much anything else you can do on a PC.
4665280	4667200	So I don't know, that's pretty cool.
4667200	4673320	I've signed up to, hopefully, beta test this, so probably more of the come as the Wii gets
4673320	4674320	launched.
4674320	4675320	Oh, WEE-lee.
4675320	4676320	WEE-lee.
4676320	4679240	I'm waiting for the picture of the owl.
4679240	4681760	And now that I've said, oh, is there, oh, there it is.
4681760	4684160	Oh, no, that's the Linux penguin, that's not an owl.
4684160	4685280	But it's dressed up like Mario.
4685280	4686280	I know, that's cute.
4686280	4689600	No, I'm waiting for the, you know, the famous owl that says, oh, really, I'm waiting for
4689600	4691600	the, oh, WEE-lee one.
4691600	4692600	Oh.
4692600	4693600	All right.
4693600	4696640	Anyway, sorry to encourage that behavior on the internet.
4696640	4700880	Oh, come on, you know you like to encourage mass hysteria.
4700880	4707300	Speaking of mass hysteria, this won't really encourage any of it, but it's kind of cool.
4707300	4712200	For those five people still playing Animal Crossing DS, which I need to actually clean
4712200	4716560	out my village and start doing that because this is pretty cool, with the launch of Twilight
4716560	4722860	Princess on 19th November, Nintendo will be giving away a very special and rare gift in
4722860	4729020	Animal Crossing according to their press release.
4729020	4735160	If you connect via Nintendo Wi-Fi during the week of November 17th through 24th, you'll
4735160	4741200	receive a letter from Nintendo, which will show up in your mailbox, and you will receive
4741200	4744320	an attached item.
4744320	4747440	So it could be anything.
4747440	4752320	Accompanied with the letter will be a corrupt item that will erase your save and say, go
4752320	4754640	buy a Wii, stop playing the DS.
4754640	4758560	No, it'll be a flower that you put in your house and then you can't put anything in that
4758560	4759560	corner of your house.
4759560	4761160	Oh, wait, they already did that.
4761160	4766560	I actually went to NintendoWifi.com just to prove Jamie wrong because I like to do that,
4766560	4771360	and it shows 20 random Wi-Fi players, and look at that, six people are playing Animal
4771360	4773900	Crossing Wild World right now.
4773900	4780480	We have Danny Boy is playing, and Phil is playing, and IJ, and Mike, and Christina with
4780480	4785760	a lowercase c because she's poetic, and look at this, Rob is playing Animal Crossing right
4785760	4786760	now.
4786760	4790400	Hey, Rob, this is just for you.
4790400	4799200	There may only be six people in the world playing Animal Crossing Wild World right this
4799200	4804320	moment, but 1.5 million people are playing Final Fantasy XII.
4804320	4807680	At least that's what Square Enix will have you believe because they sent out a press
4807680	4812960	release earlier this week saying that Final Fantasy XII has 1.5 million units on shelves.
4812960	4817240	Okay, well, I guess 1.5 million people aren't really playing it, but yet there's that many
4817240	4820880	copies in circulation, so soon 1.5 million people will be playing it.
4820880	4826720	Final Fantasy XII, by the way, for the records, did 2.4 million copies in Japan, so it will
4826720	4827720	be interesting to see.
4827720	4830880	Wouldn't it be interesting if it sold more here than it did in Japan?
4830880	4834760	Well, we all know Dragon Quest is the bigger game in Japan, so I don't know.
4834760	4838880	By the way, Final Fantasy XII, brand new record for the total number of units shipped for
4838880	4839880	the franchise.
4839880	4841680	Good job, Squeenix.
4841680	4843020	Good job.
4843020	4844360	Some other interesting stuff.
4844360	4848760	Now next time make the graphics less pixelated, thank you.
4848760	4854800	Some interesting stuff for fans of Guitar Hero.
4854800	4860080	Guitar Hero 2, of course, you may remember with the demo, it actually blocked the Ant
4860080	4866120	Commandos controllers from working with it, and apparently that's the case also if you
4866120	4872860	have purchased your Guitar Hero controller from them before October 1st.
4872860	4878840	If you have, then it will not work with Guitar Hero 2 unless you purchase an adapter, which
4878840	4883560	I believe is free, but don't hold me to that.
4883560	4888120	Once you get the adapter, I guess everything's...
4888120	4893520	Oh, I'm sorry, the adapter is $6.99, so yeah, if you want to play with that controller,
4893520	4896120	you're going to have to pay another $7.
4896120	4902100	But the other controllers beyond that will work with Guitar Hero 2.
4902100	4907720	Apparently anything that did circumvent third-party controllers has been broken already.
4907720	4909380	We kind of knew that would be coming, though.
4909380	4912640	I mean, that's the Ant Commandos business right there, so they had to get around it
4912640	4913640	somehow, right?
4913640	4914640	Yeah.
4914640	4917840	Drew, you've been playing Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit, right?
4917840	4919860	I see you posting about it.
4919860	4924120	Are you interested at all in these third-party controllers or any of that?
4924120	4926840	Not really, I just don't really see any interest in them.
4926840	4933840	I've got my SG controller from the first game, and I don't really need another one.
4933840	4938720	If I feel like I'm kind of over Guitar Hero, like seriously, the hype around Guitar Hero
4938720	4941680	has seriously ruined Guitar Hero for me for some weird reason?
4941680	4942680	I don't know.
4942680	4946040	Like, you know how when you were the only person that listened to this band, and then
4946040	4949960	suddenly everybody's listening to the band, and you're like, it's just not so special
4949960	4950960	anymore?
4950960	4952280	Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about Guitar Hero.
4952280	4958320	I mean, call me an elitist, whatever, but am I doing myself a disservice by not checking
4958320	4959880	out Guitar Hero 2?
4959880	4960880	Yes.
4960880	4963720	Yes, absolutely yes, yes, very yes.
4963720	4964720	Oh!
4964720	4965720	Oh!
4965720	4966720	Tiara says no.
4966720	4968720	Why is that?
4968720	4973240	Because if you spent all the time that you spend playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero
4973240	4978200	2 learning to play an actual guitar, think of all the amazing songs you could play.
4978200	4982840	Wait, weren't you telling me a story earlier today about somebody that was in a guitar
4982840	4983840	class?
4983840	4985440	Tell me the story about the girl in the guitar class.
4985440	4989680	Okay, this involves my boyfriend, Adam.
4989680	4994480	He's taking a guitar class at the community college, and there's a girl in his class
4994480	4999880	who was asking him, you know, do you believe in psychics, and explaining something about
4999880	5001560	this one particular psychic.
5001560	5007760	Anyways, Adam told her, the only psychic I believe in is Professor Charles Xavier.
5007760	5011640	And so her response was, does he teach at this campus?
5011640	5017680	That doesn't have anything to do with Guitar Hero.
5017680	5023440	Wait, but you were telling me, okay, yeah, okay, haha, she's stupid.
5023440	5027920	But the other part about this was, wait, what was this, she asked him if he knew Boston,
5027920	5028920	or what was this?
5028920	5034480	Oh yeah, apparently all she plays is Guitar Hero because she asked him if he had ever
5034480	5037480	heard of a band called Boston.
5037480	5041480	And the song that she mentioned was the song on the original Guitar Hero.
5041480	5047800	And every time that she says that she likes a band, and he asks what songs that she likes
5047800	5051760	from that band, it's the song that's on Guitar Heroes, and she doesn't know any
5051760	5053400	of the other songs.
5053400	5058240	Hey, you know what, I give her credit though for at least taking Tiara's advice and going
5058240	5062800	to take a real guitar class instead of playing Guitar Hero 2.
5062800	5067160	No, I'm sure it's a great game, I just, there's other games I wanted more.
5067160	5068160	I'll get it now.
5068160	5069760	I'll get the 360 version.
5069760	5072880	I swear to you I will buy the 360 one, like launch day.
5072880	5073880	What?
5073880	5074880	Rob.
5074880	5075880	Rob.
5075880	5076880	What?
5076880	5077880	Rob.
5077880	5078880	I will shove this mic up your butt.
5078880	5079880	Rob!
5079880	5080880	What?
5080880	5081880	You can come to my house and play.
5081880	5082880	I just might.
5082880	5083880	Okay.
5083880	5084880	I heard on a Bobby show tonight that it supports Progressive Scan, that's kinda cool.
5084880	5085880	It looks really nice on my TV.
5085880	5086880	Rob, that's special.
5086880	5087880	What?
5087880	5093560	I'll get a copy for you, and I'll put it on my Playstation 2, and you can play on
5093560	5094560	that.
5094560	5095560	Okay, sounds good.
5095560	5096560	No, I'll get the 360 version.
5096560	5097560	That's what I said earlier.
5097560	5101440	I don't see the point in getting the Playstation 2 one when we know the 360 one will be better
5101440	5104080	because of its expandability.
5104080	5106000	So I can wait.
5106000	5107920	Can you?
5107920	5109960	I sold mine, so yes.
5109960	5114200	Alright, on that note, we're going to go to a little bit of a break because obviously
5114200	5118480	I need a sedative, so I'm gonna go take some Tylenol PM during this break, and we'll
5118480	5123320	be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a little bit of a break.
5123320	5133040	Thank you, everybody, for being with us, and we'll see you in the next one.
