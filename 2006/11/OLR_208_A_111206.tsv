14321	26074	Tonight, November 12, 2006, Microsoft unveils movie and television downloads, PlayStation 3 games get some new dates and some postponed dates, and can you really install Linux on the Wii?
32338	34400	Hello boys and girls on the internet.
34440	37603	Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
37643	44729	We are that video game show dedicated to video games, gamer lifestyle, gamer culture, and all that other stuff.
44789	48072	You know, it's about two and a half to three hours of just chat.
48112	55258	We like to think of ourselves as sitting around the table at the local diner, just bitching about video games while we're waiting for our food.
55718	59021	And the service is very slow tonight, hence why the show is about two and a half hours long.
59557	61118	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, ROAR
79286	80087	Techmaster Loki.
80367	82949	I'm sorry, I didn't hear most of that.
83109	90595	Well, maybe if you were listening to the show and not playing on your computer while we're trying to get things started here, maybe you would have heard my really bad comparison.
90835	97300	I was just trying to look up to see if anyone had commented on a certain story that ran earlier this week.
98981	102384	Well, I think you should be focusing on the show now.
102424	103084	It is on the show.
103124	103885	It's show related.
104265	106367	I need your full attention, Mr. Loki.
108430	109291	Thank you for watching!
133323	137207	and also say hello to our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Drew Nami.
137747	140550	Hey, if I don't get my French toast soon, I'm going to go kick someone's ass.
141151	141371	What?
142272	142993	Bad service.
143773	144294	Oh, I get it.
145835	146396	I left the comparison.
146416	149359	Someone needs to pay attention to the show, Mr. Sky.
149959	150520	All right, shut up.
152382	155525	Anyway, here we are and another week.
156260	158722	We're sitting just before the brink of madness.
158882	160403	Video game system releases.
160743	162725	PlayStation 3 and Wii.
163105	165006	Really quickly, who's getting what?
165306	166327	Who's getting what system?
166667	169670	Alright, I'm getting a Wii but not a PlayStation 3 just yet.
169910	170410	DarkSakura?
170530	171971	I'm getting a Wii and a PlayStation 3.
172071	172392	Loki?
172552	173132	I'm getting a Wii.
174033	175554	Uh, Tiara?
176775	178436	I'm getting nothing because I am poor.
179176	179637	Aw, sorry to hear it.
179657	179797	Junami?
179817	179977	Junami?
180285	180906	I can send you a Game Boy.
196394	197535	We have lots of love for Tiara.
198436	209285	She can watch us all unpack them on YouTube because apparently that makes for riveting game news this week is, you know, watch me play my Wii and rub it in your face that you don't have one.
209405	211827	It is such horrible blogging news.
212107	217231	Seriously, like every single blog I visited this week, I guess Nintendo loves everyone else more than us.
217291	217591	Whatever.
217631	217992	I don't care.
218032	218432	I'm over it.
218752	226914	But every other website is like, hey, look, here's a video on YouTube of us taking the Wii out of the box and showing it all in front of the camera.
227214	229354	And then here's me playing Excite Truck.
230394	230874	I don't know.
230954	234175	It's like I'm reading the same thing on every single blog.
234215	236675	I'm like, isn't there like Real News this week?
237015	238636	I know it's still early in the week, though.
238996	242917	But as far as I'm aware, Jessica Chobert has not licked the Wii.
243357	244997	I may be able to beat her to that.
246041	247942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
275891	278473	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
302609	305791	I played Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit last night.
307192	308554	In fact, quite a bit last night.
310515	313757	We played all the way through Easy and then through a bunch of Medium.
314958	318441	I will let the almighty unlocker of Trogdor tell you about that later.
320602	327668	And then I got inspired and left the room so that I could make the pre-show with a bunch of stuff that was in Guitar Hero 2.
327968	330550	I was going to put Thunder Horse from...
331417	331997	Venture Brothers.
332658	333178	What was the band?
333198	333619	Deathlock.
335680	340143	And I was going to put that in the show, but I decided not to.
340283	343566	And if you want to hear Trogdor, you have to stay and listen to the entire show.
344066	345847	Of course, if you're on the podcast, it won't do you any good.
345867	346928	Because it's copyrighted.
347628	348069	Sorry, kids.
351051	354413	And then I looked at Trauma Center and haven't played it yet.
354814	356815	And then Dan started playing Final Fantasy XII for me.
358056	358916	So I'm a little bit upset at him.
359837	360598	And I played some more...
361952	389226	Samora, PSU I'm only level 3 Slowly but surely, making your way That's right, leveling is slow in PSU I played religiously for several days And I'm only like level 12 So it ain't gonna get any quicker I'm sorry to say I just solo through all the missions Seriously, play single player You level up so much faster Just skip all the cutscenes and play single player
390447	392368	It doesn't level your online character.
392928	394009	Yeah, sadly, no, it doesn't.
394229	394689	Okay, then.
395049	396070	I want to level my online character.
396150	397730	If you're just going to play by yourself.
398531	400872	I got PSU to play through the online missions.
400952	402953	I just want to start leveling my stuff.
404614	404894	All right.
406474	408095	Anything else, Miss DarkSakura?
410216	410336	No.
411337	412637	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
414498	416299	It was full of stuff, actually.
417132	419694	Of course, I picked up two big 360 games this week.
420354	425237	Gears of War, which I've played for not very long, actually, so far.
425257	426598	I haven't really played much through it.
426898	433922	I tried a little bit of the single player, got past the first mission, and played a little bit of the multiplayer on one console.
433962	438824	So, I mean, not a real good indicator of what the multiplayer is, but it's okay.
439025	439425	I don't know.
441006	443287	To be honest, I don't think the multiplayer is that great.
443769	444909	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
471053	473254	But you're wearing a Call of Duty shirt
494642	495783	Oh wait, that's Activision.
495803	496303	Never mind.
496523	497843	I have two Call of Duty shirts.
497863	498324	Never mind.
498584	499864	And this was on the top of the hamper.
500244	503846	So anyways, so yeah, I'll play through it.
503946	505327	I'm sure it's going to be a pretty cool game.
505647	507388	And there is one good thing about it, though.
507408	508648	The co-op is amazing.
508768	513310	So at least they've got that going for it, because there aren't that many good co-op games nowadays.
513690	516812	And it's almost like Contra, I should say.
517132	519693	That kind of reminds me of two people playing through the game.
520492	523274	Which also leads me to Contra, which I played a little bit this week.
523675	525936	And, you know, Contra's Contra, so it's pretty cool.
526777	528839	Then, of course, Call of Duty 3 I bought.
529639	530780	That one is really cool.
532041	534623	Personally, I like the multiplayer in Call of Duty 3 a lot better.
535644	541429	I've been playing it locally with a few of my friends at work, and it's just fun.
541529	543711	It's definitely improved over the last one.
544171	547414	The only thing I don't like about the multiplayer in it, though, is that the...
548426	555209	Your little HUD radar thing that they have, they do not show the gunshots going off like they used to in the first one.
555289	560511	So, playing a 10 minute game, it might be hard to find people.
561451	570554	Also, since the maps don't say how many people they're meant for, which the old one did, so you kind of get an idea of which map is large, which one's smaller, and that type of thing.
570614	572195	This one's kind of flying blind.
572817	580519	The game's pretty cool, though, because you get to drive vehicles and stuff, and I got a lot of my kills running over people with Jeeps, so that's pretty cool.
581060	581780	I do like that.
582440	584901	And the game looks a lot better, so that'll be pretty cool.
585541	588782	Grand Theft Auto's Vice City Story has been playing a little bit more, of course.
591043	597425	Really, playing more of this, I'm starting to like the game a little bit more, but also at the same time, I'm frustrated with how lazy their programming is.
598205	598805	For example...
599793	600413	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
624577	651885	but they didn't because they're too fucking lazy so whatever but the game is fun um just kind of figuring out the nuances of it but still Grand Theft Auto and um I don't know it's a little bit more realistic as far as you know some of the vehicle damage and stuff and then um other than that really uh Elder Scrolls Oblivion I've played through about half of that now and hopefully gonna finish the other half I gotta grind through it so I can sell it back you know that type of thing and um
653134	654475	Gears of War Elite Beat Agents
678752	681695	Elite Beat Agents is the best music-based game ever for the casual player.
702332	703492	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
724341	726903	and even some people don't want to play Guitar Hero because they're like, that's kind of weird.
727203	728804	But Elite Beat Agents is easy.
728864	731385	No one else can see because it's on the DS and it's just, you pick up the pen and go.
731746	734607	And the song list is surprisingly really good.
734647	738089	I know a lot of people were like, oh, it's got a weird combination of songs.
738410	743893	But dude, if a game can make Ashley Simpson's La La kind of fun, I think it deserves a lot of credit.
744273	745934	So I give Elite Beat Agents a lot of credit.
745954	747415	It's funny, it cracked me up.
747535	753058	Even one stage is kind of sad and a little bit sniffly, but you know, I wouldn't cry because I'm a man.
753719	753819	Um...
754912	756533	But no, the game's a lot of fun.
756573	761015	Basically, for those that don't know, the essential element of the game is that you tap.
761095	766018	You tap on the bottom screen, but you follow these patterns, and you tap, like, in the beat of the music.
766058	775603	For instance, if you're playing Material Girl, your tapping might go along with the words, like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, and you kind of drag the stylus in some parts, too, and follow a little ball.
775663	780005	So it's a lot more fun than it sounds, because the animations and things really kind of keep you involved.
780285	783207	The only small complaint I have with the game is that, you know...
783607	784488	Thank you for watching!
800017	801078	It just runs even smoothly, so it's great
830105	834710	Other game I picked up this week and played is Luminous 2, which is out on the PSP.
837296	840117	You know, Luminous was my absolute favorite game that was released this year.
840157	844258	And so I still have a lot of love for Luminous 2 because they didn't really change anything.
844558	850899	But that's also kind of my biggest problem with Luminous 2 is that half of the skins were Luminous 1 skins.
851219	855541	And I don't think a lot of people picked up on this because maybe people played Luminous 1 and then forgot about it.
855821	864283	But seriously, if you think... For instance, those folks that follow music-based games, if you think DDR repeats are bad, Luminous puts it to shame.
864383	865343	Luminous repeats...
865823	866603	Thanks for watching!
888629	893333	There's mission mode involved, and versus involved, and there's a demo of every extent extra.
893593	896075	There's a lot of new modes that keep it fresh.
896515	900898	So if you don't own the original Luminous, there's a lot for you.
901078	904941	And if you like puzzle games at all, you definitely need to have Luminous 2.
905181	908223	It's a must-own game if you don't have the original Luminous.
908563	911005	If you do have the original Luminous, then I would ask you...
911685	914767	How important are these new modes to you?
914887	917509	Do you really want to be able to use your own music?
917549	919410	Do you really want to be able to do this other stuff?
920230	922852	Do you really want to play the Hollaback Girl?
922892	924573	How much of a necessity is that to you?
924993	928676	And if the answer is, I must, then sure, go get the game.
929576	930417	It's only $30.
930717	931597	It's not a bad value.
933198	940443	But I don't know if you would want this and the Xbox Live one unless you are just really crazy about your puzzle games or you're luminous.
941112	942033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
971204	975067	Speaking of tea, Tiara, would you like to share your gaming week with us?
975147	976148	What kind of stuff you've been playing?
978589	982772	As Soy said, we played Guitar Heroes 2 last night.
984494	993640	She was around long enough to beat easy mode, and then I played through medium, or whatever you call it, normal mode, long enough to unlock Trogdor.
994541	997443	And then we played Trogdor, and then we went to sleep.
998203	999104	But before that...
999617	1028922	I played Tetris on my phone for a million hours while we waited for A Nightmare Before Christmas to start because somebody bought tickets for the 12.30 show and we actually got there at like 10.30 so it was like two hours of Tetris joy I thought I was going to get lost she got lost everywhere else, that's all but I got lost in a cool way because we found underneath the Golden Gate Bridge yeah, under but that's it, excitement, the end
1029830	1033172	Now, actually, I want to interview you for a little bit because you haven't been on the show in a long time.
1033212	1037114	And last time you were on the show was when we were still exclusively talking about music-based games.
1037154	1042356	So now we have a whole new world and more people listen to the show thanks to iTunes and XBStream and all games and all that stuff.
1043957	1045498	What kind of games do you enjoy?
1045578	1047019	Are you a computer gamer?
1047179	1048539	Are you a console gamer?
1048599	1050681	What would you say is your favorite way of playing games?
1051981	1058084	Actually, my outside of the home life has been so busy lately that I haven't really done a lot of gaming.
1058204	1059345	I actually gave up WoW.
1060475	1062837	which was amazing because I never thought I would do that.
1063337	1073563	Seriously, I was so addicted and I was like main healer in my guild and everything and one day I was just like, you know what, I think outside is nice too.
1073583	1076305	I'm going to go outdoors and play today.
1076705	1078226	Where are you from so our listeners know?
1078527	1079387	I'm from Las Vegas.
1079587	1080228	Las Vegas.
1080268	1082169	I know we have some listeners in Vegas so very cool.
1082779	1083139	GuardianLegend
1106024	1107485	Best 8-bit game ever.
1107625	1108045	Find it.
1108125	1108605	Seriously.
1108645	1109245	It's the best.
1109525	1111186	It's the most underrated title ever.
1111286	1116228	I will not shut up about this game until I get my sequel on one of the next-gen consoles.
1116568	1120270	I don't care if, like, the rights are somewhere in a black hole right now.
1120650	1121890	Fucking find those rights.
1122270	1123891	Give me a sequel to The Guardian Legend.
1123931	1125251	It's not that much to ask.
1125411	1125812	Please.
1126912	1128553	Just write your congressman.
1128633	1131574	I'm going to write Feinstein tonight and say...
1132359	1135580	I want a bill passed that will make them make a Guardian Legend 2.
1136300	1136580	P.S.
1136620	1137021	I'm crazy.
1137821	1139401	Junami, how was your gaming week?
1139941	1145923	Well, similar to Yarrarar, I sort of gave up WoW for a bit even though I'm still freaking paying for it.
1147544	1157127	I was playing Guitar Hero 2 for most of the week, unlocked everything, everything, beat hard mode, that kind of stuff.
1157711	1158951	I haven't been going outdoors.
1158971	1159472	I've been going bar doors.
1184446	1186847	I was going to say, you live in Vegas.
1187087	1188107	I've been to Vegas.
1188127	1191669	There's nothing to do outdoors in Vegas except make things out of dirt.
1192069	1196471	Everything you do in Vegas is indoors and pretty and lights and all that stuff.
1196751	1198971	Although, when you live in Vegas, you hate the casinos, don't you?
1199612	1199972	Yeah.
1200132	1200612	That's what I hear.
1201112	1206154	We've just passed the law for no smoking in restaurants and stuff, so that should be nice.
1206194	1206754	Wow.
1207255	1208375	That's going to be crazy.
1209079	1214482	We didn't pass the law for smoking marijuana, though, because all of those stupid stoners were too stoned to go vote!
1228403	1238670	Anyway, let's go to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and get some comments from our chat room, because the folks over there, we have quite a big crowd there tonight.
1239290	1241431	We're making some good comments there, except now I can't find any.
1241471	1244333	We have a lot of people that are listening tonight that say they live in Vegas.
1244533	1249216	DJ Janai, Gilder, both live in Vegas, saying hello.
1249236	1252298	And then, of course, to that press start, says, does not live in Vegas.
1253899	1256621	Jeremy Todd 1 is shocked that Adrenami is giving up World of Warcraft.
1257478	1258599	Thank you for watching!
1274833	1288640	No, yeah, for those that didn't hear, I put out a call the other week because remember when Tack Johnson decided to sue Midway or, I don't know, wrote a nasty letter to Midway or whatever he did over the fact that there was create a character and somebody made his likeness?
1289040	1296423	So I put out a challenge to our listeners to create Tack Johnson in as many different likenesses as you could in different games.
1296443	1298104	Like, I was hoping to see one in Oblivion.
1298384	1300245	Well, FootyMonster put one up from what?
1300285	1301265	What was it, City of Heroes?
1301726	1302246	I believe so.
1303291	1303831	City of Villains.
1303992	1305052	Oh, well, how appropriate.
1305092	1305653	City of Villains.
1307194	1307574	Awesome.
1309155	1311597	The OL Army salutes you, footy monster.
1311657	1312077	Good job.
1312177	1312758	I want to see more.
1313018	1314059	You know what else we need to do?
1314379	1314579	Huh?
1314779	1321684	We need to give our special foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis a shout-out.
1322745	1323806	It is Puppy's birthday.
1324386	1324526	Ah.
1324946	1326027	So, happy birthday to Puppy.
1326207	1327148	Happy birthday, Puppy.
1328149	1331151	And in dog years, he's, like, going to fall over and die any moment now.
1332191	1332651	Let's see.
1333192	1335254	What else do I want to say regarding chat comments?
1335715	1340500	JeremyTodd1 asked me in regards to my gaming week, which game is better, Luminous Live, Luminous 1, or Luminous 2?
1344164	1344745	It depends.
1344945	1347388	I would say if you don't own any of them...
1348965	1352228	But you have a PSP, Luminous 2 is probably the best one.
1352848	1355510	Just because it practically has all of Luminous 1 in it.
1355750	1364537	But if you already own Luminous 1, the question is, are these little upgrades and the fact that they're going to recycle half of what you already have, is that enough for you to upgrade the game?
1364918	1365638	I don't know.
1365818	1366919	It depends how addicted you are to the game.
1367260	1371143	I do think Luminous Live is pretty cool too, though, for those that don't have a PSP.
1371443	1373945	Don't go out and buy a PSP just for Luminous like I did.
1375253	1378636	The Xbox Live one is fine, it's just that the Xbox needs a better D-pad.
1378696	1380597	It needs a better D-pad.
1380998	1390045	Please, some third party, I don't know, maybe there's Microsoft issues why nobody's done this yet, but seriously, somebody needs to put out a better D-pad for the Xbox 360.
1393028	1393508	Somebody.
1394329	1399593	And then, you know, Luminous Live has Xbox Live and all that stuff, which is kind of cool, so I'll say that's cool.
1400578	1401678	Housekeeping!
1430145	1433448	I will say this, I got served.
1433648	1444655	If you listen to part B of last week's show, I said, we were talking about a rumor at that time that Microsoft was going to be offering movies and TV downloads, and I said, no way, they won't do it.
1444775	1450879	If they sold HD downloads, it would totally nerf the sales of the HD DVD.
1451319	1453160	So what did Microsoft announce on Tuesday?
1453561	1457343	Oh, that they're going to be offering a movie and TV downloads in HD formats.
1458588	1460649	Yeah, I got told.
1461569	1470351	Well, anyway, they announced that various shows from MTV, CBS, movies from such places like Paramount Pictures, all this stuff would be available.
1470371	1478733	In fact, there's some screenshots circulating, and you can see some downloads include V for Vendetta, Poseidon, Cradle to the Grave, Lethal Weapon 4.
1480033	1484795	I know the TV stuff they're offering, old school Star Trek, but the redone special effects, that one.
1486542	1491995	and Survivor and Pimp My Ride because you really wanted to have that on the Microsoft 360.
1494340	1503728	So basically in a recent story that was on Joystick, Scott Henson from Microsoft talked a little bit about how things would work.
1504468	1516619	Henson mentioned that the files that you download, they will be stored on the 360's hard drive unit and there's not going to be an option to stream videos from the Windows computer because you can kind of already do that if they're in WMV.
1517139	1517800	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1532336	1539864	Your average 22-minute high-definition TV show will be about 1 gigabyte, and the standard definition version will be 300 megabytes.
1539944	1542287	720p is what all the high-def stuff is going to be encoded in.
1542307	1543108	They're not going to go up to 1080.
1543428	1546171	I would imagine that's because of space concerns.
1546231	1548073	And 720p is really not that bad.
1548133	1553659	If you have the eye to distinguish between the two, then maybe you ought to just get an HD-DVD drive and do it that way.
1553699	1554039	I don't know.
1555566	1556827	DarkSakura.com
1577578	1577798	DarkSakura?
1577838	1578579	I have the internet.
1578599	1579379	I don't need this.
1606544	1610326	So are you endorsing underground schemes such as BitTorrent?
1612027	1613028	I make no secret of it.
1613228	1623794	I mean, I think that it's a good idea in theory for people who maybe aren't so computer savvy, maybe.
1624375	1631979	Or people who, you know, are slaves to MTV's programming content and can't live without, you know,
1632691	1636633	The same mindless stuff that they throw out at everybody on their regular station.
1636673	1638454	They have to infect Xbox Live as well.
1639055	1641396	So more power to them.
1641596	1643297	But I have YouTube.
1644278	1644858	Alright, fair enough.
1645458	1650301	Well technically YouTube's not supposed to have a lot of that content on there anyways and they've gotten in trouble for that.
1651682	1653603	But I have DVDs as well.
1654806	1655206	Thanks for watching!
1675313	1676094	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1702473	1703134	Thanks for watching!
1720585	1721746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1744276	1751018	to be wanting to download that, but, no, no, no, that show is, it's, I like the show, I just wouldn't pay for the show.
1754339	1769624	It's a fun show, it's just like Mythbusters, I'd love watching, that's something that they didn't have on there, they should have episodes of Mythbusters, because that's an awesome show, but, you know, hey, I noticed something though, I noticed that G4 shows weren't on there, and that's kind of surprising too, I mean, you'd think that
1770188	1775210	A cable network like that would want to, I don't know, sell their shows to make any sorts of money that they can possibly make?
1775370	1777091	Good riddance, I say.
1777691	1790756	But I think it's interesting, though, that Microsoft is not embracing yet the online, the huge resource online there is of free videos and free audio streams, such as podcasts and vodcasts and that whole thing.
1790796	1799420	Or, I'm sorry, blogcasts and vlogcasts, if you are an Xbox 360-only type person that won't call them podcasts.
1800363	1801525	God, retarded.
1802326	1803989	Whatever, I don't care, whatever.
1804730	1805350	It's just a word.
1805611	1807113	Well, okay, I'm curious, real quick.
1807253	1808675	Drew, is this something that interests you?
1810398	1812100	Not really, considering I don't even have a 360.
1814625	1815446	All right, then, enough said.
1815466	1816527	I guess I asked the wrong person.
1816767	1818129	I won't bother asking Tiara, then.
1818709	1819550	Let me think.
1820651	1823954	Oh, what do you think about this, though, the Trojan horse aspect of this?
1823994	1825816	Didn't we – I mean, a lot of people were saying this.
1825856	1831041	It wasn't just us, but a year ago when these next-gen systems were first being formed, a lot of us said, oh, these are Trojan horses.
1831362	1836327	They're going to be put in your living room under the guise of a game system, but they're going to be all this entertainment in a box.
1836667	1837107	And look at it.
1837268	1837928	It's coming to life.
1839189	1849072	I would also like to point out that at the Xbox 360 demo thing that they had where you sat on the floor and the thing rumbled on your butt, the big speaker thing, that they said all this.
1851492	1858654	It was part of their thing when they had the Xbox 360 at E3 years ago.
1858754	1861035	Oh, so like something that they teased a long time ago.
1861055	1861955	Yes.
1861975	1862735	Ah, very interesting.
1862755	1863636	Of course they want to do that.
1863776	1864536	I mean, it's
1865131	1869354	Their media center PCs aren't selling that great, so they gotta sell something that's like a media center.
1869454	1871236	So how long before the PlayStation 3 follows?
1872337	1872857	Instantly.
1873838	1875519	I mean, seriously, instantly.
1875859	1878101	As soon as it comes out, it's there.
1878381	1880543	Where will Nintendo fit into all this, or do they care?
1880823	1881344	They don't care.
1883105	1884966	Nintendo doesn't really have to care.
1885166	1885887	They're Nintendo.
1886147	1887048	They don't have to care yet.
1888009	1892172	I mean, after all, they're not even jumping on the online bandwagon yet.
1892683	1903006	But, so anyways, with most everything that's released nowadays or announced for Microsoft, Sony always has to make a counterpoint to anything.
1903606	1907127	And their big thing was, oh yeah, this download service sucks.
1909447	1913048	In that case, I do have to agree with Sony, because, well...
1915173	1918615	Your hard drive is not really going to be able to accommodate the volume you'll be downloading.
1919075	1923338	In fact, Microsoft's even pretty much said the same thing.
1923378	1938008	It was Aaron Greenberg, who was the group product marketing manager, actually said that they aren't ready to bring out a larger hard drive yet so that basically you can use your memory card and get your own hard drive and use it to...
1940458	1948362	So in other words, because we're too lazy to put out an 80 gig hard drive right now, you should just buy four 20 gigs to store all this shit.
1949503	1953626	Yeah, and that's basically kind of the same thing that Sony was saying about their content.
1954146	1959049	Basically, PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box, which is...
1959690	1960290	Thanks for watching!
1980302	1983164	I think you could do that with the PS2 as well though.
1983224	1983744	With their HD unit.
1983764	1985345	I'm sorry, the hard drive thing that
2005406	2007727	We put like 150 gig on ours.
2008187	2016030	Yeah, for non-online Sony game related stuff.
2016270	2023713	But also a lot of games, especially in Japan, made big use of the hard drive because you would load a good portion of a game.
2023753	2032617	Like, for example, on, what was it, 6th style, 2DX 6th style, you could, with the hard drive, you could load all the songs into the hard drive and then play the...
2035373	2036354	What was that mode called?
2036594	2038595	The marathon mode?
2038636	2039736	Non-stop or whatever it is.
2039976	2040297	Endless.
2040877	2045761	Yeah, you could just play endless until you lost.
2045841	2048923	They even had some games where, I believe, wasn't it Final Fantasy XII?
2048943	2050124	You could load onto the hard drive too?
2050744	2053807	The 2DX Nazis in our chat room are correcting you.
2053847	2055208	It's 5th style, not 6th style.
2055508	2056569	It was one of those.
2056589	2057489	I was close.
2058930	2061052	When you consider there's like, what, like,
2064166	2071610	I gave up after 8th style, which was the last good one, thank you.
2071750	2073111	Wait, I want to make a comment on this.
2073131	2075172	Who's this guy that said I need to buy multiple hard drives?
2075612	2076433	Who was it that said that?
2077453	2079215	Um, Aaron somebody.
2079235	2081297	Aaron somebody, fuck a whole lot of you, okay?
2081357	2091626	Because, look, when your two biggest competitors are offering something better already, you got no room to be making this statement about how I should be buying additional 100 gig hard drives.
2092046	2103256	Don't get me wrong, 360, I still love ya, but right now, look, I can get an 80 gig hard drive in the size of my hand with the iPod, take it wherever I want, and then with the Sony department, you're gonna be able to put whatever hard drive you want in it.
2103356	2103436	It's
2103996	2109340	Laptop hard drives are not $100, especially a 20 gig hard drive for a laptop is dirt cheap.
2110081	2123811	And the fact that you can buy a 150 gig laptop drive for probably less than you're going to be spending on whatever their next hard drive that they come out for the 360, which is probably going to be like 60 or something.
2124412	2126714	So, I don't know, it's just retarded.
2128355	2128655	All right.
2130080	2145992	Anyway, let's move on to another topic, sticking with Xbox, because I do, you know, even if I think this whole lack of a larger hard drive thing is a little bit silly, Xbox does do a lot of things right, and one of them is the Xbox Live Arcade, despite the fact that Contra is kind of broken.
2148553	2161901	There are some new games coming out for Xbox Live Arcade, including, before the end of the year, Assault Heroes, Heavy Weapon, Novadrome, and yes, Loki, just for you, Small Arms, all coming out before the end of the year.
2162321	2172587	By the way, Microsoft also this week announced a partnership with Atari to bring some classic Atari games to Xbox Live in 2007, as if they didn't have enough retro titles.
2172647	2173988	I've seen pictures of them, too.
2174128	2174288	Yeah?
2174308	2174388	Yeah.
2174788	2175588	They look pretty good.
2175648	2178989	Well, they've got, you know, kind of like the Konami titles on there.
2179009	2183710	They have their retro mode and their, you know, kind of remastered mode, I guess.
2184170	2191492	Well, the games you'll be able to get, Warlords, Tempest, Missile Command, Centipede and Millipede, Battlezone, and Asteroids slash Asteroids Deluxe.
2191992	2196313	And, yeah, they're going to have, like, the evolved mode is what they're calling it in the Atari games.
2196573	2201634	Supposedly, you can play games like Warlords online, which I guess is kind of cool, but I think like most retro games...
2202611	2206833	It will be thrilling for about 20 minutes, and then you'll be, why did I spend 400 points on this?
2207913	2210955	Yeah, that's pretty much a lot of the games.
2210975	2213956	Or if you're Loki, you'll say, are the achievements easy?
2213976	2216817	Because I need to boost my score, because I'm a stats whore.
2217777	2219278	Hey, that is true.
2220899	2226941	So anyways, another thing with the 360, their last... Hey, would you say when it comes to gamer score that you're a total size queen?
2229522	2231223	No, I would not use the word queen.
2231954	2232674	A size king.
2233675	2234055	Whatever.
2234815	2235295	Anyways.
2236636	2249900	So, for the 360, the last update they did with 1080p blocked out some of the wonderful 1080p televisions out there, and there's also been other issues with it just not being very good.
2250440	2258683	So, of course, they are working on a fix right now on it, and it is being addressed, and hopefully it will be fixed relatively soon.
2258943	2259163	So...
2260319	2261460	CallDuty3 comes out.
2261500	2263622	The online is lagged, bugged, and doesn't work correctly.
2263682	2264963	Didn't you learn from the first one? !
2285492	2287333	Fix the game before it comes out.
2287493	2290394	Or did you just say, oh, fuck, we need to get it out before Christmas.
2290754	2292015	Oh, who cares if it's not finished?
2292275	2293115	No one's going to care.
2293175	2294576	We'll just release a patch later on.
2294616	2296036	They'll be angry, but they'll buy the next one.
2296577	2300518	So, you know, seriously, finish the game before you release it.
2300538	2302999	Well, at least the boss monster shows up in level 30, right?
2303220	2303640	Oh, yeah.
2305481	2306841	Well, at least they didn't fuck that up.
2308182	2308922	At least, you know.
2309465	2313186	That's going to be my forever question I'm always going to ask when you tell me a game's broken.
2313226	2315747	I'm going to say, does the boss monster show up in level 30?
2316067	2319988	Because if so, at least they didn't fuck up as bad as somebody else I can think of.
2321428	2322288	That's just crazy.
2323048	2323629	Hey, you know what?
2323649	2329570	Maybe they took a page from Rockstar and just didn't play the multiplayer mode and just released the game as is.
2330110	2333631	Oh, do you know what the very first thing I did was when I played Gears of War?
2333971	2334171	What?
2334271	2335272	I downloaded a patch.
2335932	2336592	Yeah, me too.
2337816	2340197	Non-stop excitement from the moment I hit the power button.
2341117	2343357	Gears of War is currently sitting on the desk in my living room.
2345038	2346238	I don't know if it's been played yet.
2347258	2350819	Gears of War is like a visual orgasm.
2351079	2351719	It really is.
2352700	2354060	But I'll have more to say on it next week.
2354080	2356380	Because the gameplay, I'm starting to question a little bit.
2356400	2357561	But we'll get to that next week.
2357661	2359201	I don't play games for how pretty they are.
2359221	2360501	I play them for how well they play.
2360541	2363282	But, oh, you need to give this one a shot.
2363322	2364162	I mean, it really is.
2364202	2366223	Like, when they say it's pretty, they fucking mean it.
2366503	2367263	It's really pretty.
2368064	2368324	Okay.
2371845	2379566	Well, speaking of things that I guess some people might think are pretty, I don't know, we actually have one person who plays this game in the room right now.
2380526	2381886	There's news for Second Life.
2383667	2385587	As Junami raises his hand.
2387307	2387627	Sup?
2388087	2396689	Well, at any rate, you will be able to sit around with your virtual friends watching TV in
2398655	2402317	This is the kind of thing that I go into Second Life to get away from.
2417890	2427979	I'm laughing because this is stupid!
2428039	2429901	This is so stupid!
2430441	2432503	I mean, what are you gonna do?
2433284	2438068	Hey, man, wanna come over to my virtual pad and hang out?
2438769	2440450	We'll watch Pimp My Ride?
2441852	2442152	I mean...
2443116	2446517	Why do you think I was doing in the, and you can do this.
2446657	2453700	I'm not blaming you, but this is, I mean, I get the like technological, wow, that's kind of neat end of it.
2453740	2464683	Like, hey, I can watch TV online, but okay, seriously, like if you're meeting up with other people online to just sit down and watch TV, you can do that in real life.
2464943	2466304	Is that being twice as lazy?
2466564	2472306	I mean, seriously, because if I'm sitting down playing a game where I'm watching TV in the game, is that like twice as, you know,
2472964	2473624	Twice as lazy.
2474625	2479208	Speaking of which, you can actually do that also in Darkness, which is coming out.
2479228	2485271	They're having a streaming video and stuff in their TV shows, so you can actually stop in the game and watch TV, which I don't know why you would.
2486992	2490214	Now, Funnydale in our chat room wants to know, since when was Second Life a game?
2490874	2491194	Seriously.
2491535	2492855	It's an experience.
2492995	2493516	It's a way of life.
2493556	2495957	Just to say so, that it is launching in November.
2497058	2501080	What would really be insane would be if your Second Life avatar would...
2501630	2505778	Login to his virtual computer and then play Second Life.
2505998	2507801	Do they have to pay for a virtual cable bill?
2507962	2509044	Because that would just suck.
2512388	2513308	Just find the second box.
2538684	2541126	I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now.
2541166	2543047	And I'm really going to anger some fans of this game.
2543107	2544668	I'm sorry, but take it in good stride, okay?
2545008	2547329	I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, alright?
2548170	2549150	Attention, everyone.
2549190	2556134	You should come over to my house tonight because we're going to be watching on my 62-inch plasma fake screen on Second Life.
2556154	2558035	We're going to be watching Battlestar Galactica.
2558075	2558395	See you at 7.
2558455	2558615	Okay.
2559936	2560737	PUNCH AND PIE
2586581	2587662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2607862	2609383	Not for watching virtual TV.
2609824	2611665	I download it and watch it at my convenience.
2611825	2612145	Wait a second.
2612366	2621673	Could in this game, could I say have my character watch TV of another character watching his TV of another character watching his TV?
2621713	2623374	Like reality shows in Second Life?
2623594	2624115	Yeah.
2624555	2625616	Second Life Survivor?
2626416	2632381	So we can watch somebody in Second Life on the Second Life TV watching their Second Life TV.
2632801	2634042	It's the ultimate in boring.
2634202	2636324	I am positive it can be done.
2639011	2640412	All we have to do is find out how.
2643273	2646974	Moving on to topics before we get all the hate mail from the Second Life fans.
2647094	2650236	Look, you know, I'll give you... I just got the finger from Doonami.
2650596	2651376	Look, I'll give you this.
2652076	2662581	If the goal of Second Life is to, like, recreate life, then having the ability to just kind of go somewhere and hang out, watch TV, is a big step.
2662641	2664441	It's one small step for man.
2664881	2668583	One giant leap for virtual man... Forget it.
2669279	2686213	Um, Wii Component Cables, hey, the Nintendo Wii's coming out, and remember the Component Cables, uh, there's this whole back and forth where Perrin Kaplan said, yes, you're gonna be able to get the Component Cables in stores, but then the internet's like, but you lied to us before, lady, when you said that the thing would be region-free.
2686753	2693519	Well, this is what's up is that there's actually only going to be three retailers that you can get it at for now.
2694179	2696181	Circuit City, GameStop, and Best Buy.
2696421	2699003	And I'm assuming when they say GameStop, they mean EB Games as well.
2699083	2702005	So those will be the places that you can get the component cables.
2702065	2712113	So if you're getting your Wii somewhere else, like Toys R Us, I didn't see them on the list, you may have to go to one of the other retailers to get your component cables if you are a 480p whore.
2712574	2713034	Not surprised.
2713796	2714016	Why?
2714076	2718977	Because they're running in the shortages on everything for the Nintendo Wii.
2719937	2725618	Accessories, Zelda, Excite Truck, they cannot produce them fast enough.
2726359	2731740	I'm wondering if they just spent all this time trying to produce the units and cut back on the accessories and other stuff.
2732460	2736261	As far as my company, that's what we're running into.
2736281	2738421	Allocations on everything.
2738441	2742882	Accessories and games and you name it.
2742982	2743282	It's just
2744187	2755233	So, you know, limiting it down to three different stores, which I'm sure they paid a fat little bonus to Nintendo for that privilege, makes perfect sense to me.
2756514	2760136	The chatroom's still fixated on the Second Life thing, and there's a good comment here, so I want to read it.
2760156	2765639	FootyMonster says, Second Life does open a way of people who cannot be physically together to actually hang out.
2766079	2772022	I'll give you that, and that's kind of cool, and like World of Warcraft is very similar, and a lot of these MMOs are very similar, but...
2772719	2776582	Like, you're gonna hang out and watch TV, that's what you're gonna do?
2776602	2788011	Let me put it this way, that'd be like, you know, the equivalent of, okay, I'm flying, okay, to the other side of the world to meet a pen pal or whatever, and once I get there, what do I do?
2788031	2792135	I've spent all this money, all this time, you know, building up for this moment.
2792735	2793816	Hey man, you wanna watch some TV?
2793976	2794737	Yeah, sure, let's watch.
2795077	2797119	I mean, that's like a big, like, waste of time.
2798080	2799040	What'd you say, Tiara?
2799180	2799621	What'd you say?
2800569	2802350	I said that just described my trip here.
2803651	2818639	Look, if you're going to spend all that money to fly out and meet your pen pal, at least do some fucking, because that's... Actually, actually, actually, actually, actually... Because you know that expectation is there somewhere.
2820200	2823282	It was really... Well, Chris and Megsie met...
2825197	2827798	And what do you think they do when they meet up in real life?
2827858	2831378	Do you think they read the Bible and pray together?
2831418	2834019	No, they're doing some fucking... Here's the better one.
2834279	2843361	When you have friends that come over and both are on the computer, like Rob, if you and Shane are over here, you'll be playing Phantasy Star Universe or something like that.
2844101	2848583	Both of you playing Second Life and watching TV in Second Life together.
2848843	2854564	You're in the same room, not communicating to each other, but you're still watching the TV in the game.
2855421	2855961	That's awesome.
2856661	2858302	My mind has just been blown.
2860122	2862683	Anyways, back to actual, you know.
2862923	2878067	So I just wanted to say, if you can't afford the whole plane ticket thing because you can't get out there and have sex with the person that you've been talking to online, the least you can do instead of watching TV in Second Life is do some cyber fucking because that's as close as you can get.
2878927	2879567	Damn straight.
2880240	2885703	So anyways, on to actual real uses for your TV.
2886604	2887884	Nintendo Virtual Console.
2888405	2890226	It's definitely a big thing.
2890426	2896989	Right now, it's speculated that you're not going to be able to have Rumble in your Nintendo 64 games.
2897289	2897550	Why?
2897650	2904653	Because your Nintendo 64 games are going to be using the classic controller, and there is no Rumble for that.
2905274	2905494	Now...
2906331	2907151	That's interesting.
2907171	2911133	I mean, also when you think about the Nintendo 64, not all the controllers had rumbles.
2911173	2913354	You had to, you know, basically buy the rumble pack for it.
2914534	2915795	So I don't know if that's a huge thing.
2915895	2922677	I guess, like, in games like Ocarina of Time where that was, you know, important because they rumble for, like, you know, hidden treasure and stuff.
2923758	2924058	I don't know.
2924738	2934682	But, you know, I remember reading somewhere that it's speculated that you're still going to have rumble in the games because apparently on the back of the classic controller you'll be able to snap the...
2936508	2939130	Wii Remote to it, and it will use the Wii Remote to rumble.
2939570	2956622	So I don't know if this is something that's coming later on, or if, you know, right now, of course, nobody that has their Wii can check that out, because, well, the online service for both the Virtual Console and, you know, anything else, the news, weather, etc., is not available, so they can't try it yet.
2956822	2961825	But I guess we'll find out on the 19th when all that launches, and I don't know.
2962846	2964007	Is that a deal-breaker, you think?
2964520	2965163	I personally don't care.
2970267	2970887	Hucked in a Dumpster
2999497	3000177	Exactly.
3000438	3001318	I could have, but I didn't.
3003159	3003720	I'm allowed.
3004600	3005761	You know why I threw it away, too?
3005841	3007582	Because I'm just going to buy the games on the virtual console.
3010844	3013266	I still think nothing is as cool as playing on the original system.
3013306	3016608	Mario Kart cannot come out faster on the Wii.
3017088	3020811	I still think nothing is as cool as playing it on the system it was made for.
3021551	3027055	Which is why I have 40-something video game systems taking up a whole room in my house.
3029335	3029775	Which is true.
3031156	3034438	Well, of course, that's no secret to anybody because I'm a big nerd.
3034558	3040642	But what is a secret is, well, actually, that's not a secret either because there are no more Wii secrets.
3041203	3045665	If anyone thinks that Nintendo is holding something, no, Reggie says so himself.
3046226	3047887	So saith Reggie, so be it.
3049628	3052069	So my Wii isn't going to be able to secretly print money?
3052990	3053130	No.
3053550	3056032	Because I was really hoping to have this reaction on launch day.
3056676	3057076	$50 bill?
3057377	3058837	$50 bill?
3058857	3059137	$50 bill!
3060058	3062780	God!
3062980	3064561	$50 bill!
3064801	3068823	Because, you know, I heard the Wii was going to print money, so I was excited.
3068843	3069844	Yeah, only for Nintendo.
3069864	3072605	Well, we have a story later on that might be true.
3073285	3074326	What, that the Wii prints money?
3075066	3076187	You might be able to make it print money.
3076647	3077028	Awesome!
3079089	3082791	And also, of course, there's the plan about the 4 million unit launch, which...
3084045	3086387	What is... Is that the biggest unit launch, do you think?
3087468	3088348	The biggest launch?
3088408	3088809	Yeah.
3089509	3090770	I don't... I have no idea.
3092471	3093232	That's pretty crazy.
3094753	3095554	That's a big unit.
3096534	3096895	That is.
3097675	3098616	It's a powerful Wii.
3099477	3101098	What a mighty, mighty Wii.
3101678	3104120	Would you say it was a big unit, DarkSakura?
3104901	3105861	I'm not interested in the big unit.
3105881	3107723	Would you say it's one of the biggest units you've ever seen?
3110465	3111746	Uh, let's see, um...
3112415	3119858	Speaking of big units that will cost you big money, GameStop is putting together this big bundle of Wii.
3120398	3123159	It's a $700 Wii Mega Bundle.
3123639	3127381	And basically, this is the only way that you can get a Wii through their website early.
3127401	3133643	Because remember, this is the same shit they pulled with the Xbox 360, is that, you know, hey, you want to have the Xbox 360 right now?
3133763	3137925	Okay, buy our $1,000 bundle that has all these games with it.
3138165	3138645	It's sold out.
3139477	3140978	Yeah, I know, I was getting to that.
3141218	3142639	Goddammit, stop ruining the punchline.
3143399	3157548	So, the Wii is $2.50, you get the SD card, which is $60, an additional Wiimote for $40, six games, totaling $300, a 12-month product replacement plan, and, whoopty-shit, a Game Informer gift subscription.
3157948	3161190	So, you know, the talk online was, don't support this bullshit!
3161971	3164632	This is extortion, in a way.
3165473	3165793	Right?
3165813	3169135	They know people want this system, so this is how they're doing it.
3170396	3173779	So don't support it and then the damn thing sells out in like five minutes.
3175060	3189011	We were going to band together as gamers and teach these corporate dickheads a lesson that they can't make me buy Super Monkey Banana Ball Blitz whatever shit Wii game that I don't really want.
3191673	3192974	But alas, it sold out in an hour.
3194535	3196677	You know, I almost bought Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.
3197711	3198151	Well, whatever.
3198191	3200212	I'm sure there's lots of Super Monkey Ball fans out there.
3200252	3202493	I'm just picking on your game for no particular reason.
3202553	3203354	I'm in a mood tonight.
3203514	3206415	You know the 1GB Wii SD memory card for $59.99?
3207896	3212579	You can get one for about $20 at, I believe, New Egg or something like that.
3212919	3217561	Definitely not $60 for a 1GB SD memory card.
3217661	3219502	So, that's a rip-off right there.
3220503	3224965	And the 12-month Game Informer gift subscription...
3226863	3227083	Lame.
3227263	3227644	Trust me.
3228384	3229746	That's $15 right there.
3231627	3233489	Going to the chat room and reading some comments.
3233529	3236091	RavensDolphin says, Well, look at the PlayStation 3, Sky.
3236592	3237193	Ooh, zing.
3238053	3240796	Because the whole fact that maybe I don't want a freaking Blu-ray player.
3241637	3243578	But then again, that's kind of a necessary component, right?
3243598	3246721	Because the games are going to be Blu-ray, so... Let's see...
3248280	3251841	JeremyTodd1 says, but not everyone likes the same games as you, Rob.
3251861	3256302	Maybe those people wanted all the games packaged in, and so they bought this bundle so they would save money.
3256602	3257182	You know what?
3257202	3258242	I beg to differ.
3258262	3259482	They don't save any money.
3259642	3261343	Look at the games you're getting.
3261423	3267284	Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, Red Steel, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, and Madden NFL 2007.
3267324	3275066	You mean to tell me the same person that's going to buy Red Steel is going to buy Monkey Ball Banana Blitz and Madden 2007?
3275286	3277186	Is interested in all those games together?
3277526	3306419	Madden is poopy Madden for the Wii is not exactly poopy Madden's not poopy Madden's not poopy at all if you like football games but I'm saying that I don't think you like every single one of those genres maybe it's the opposite maybe you're a Madden fan and that's the game you want because throwing the football with a controller is kind of fucking cool even for somebody who may not be into football games but do I really want Monkey Ball?
3307447	3309068	Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is pretty awesome.
3309088	3315250	They've got tons of cool mini-games, and apparently it's both for kids and people that are really hardcore into that game.
3315770	3318011	I think we've overlooked, though, the main selling point.
3318271	3319292	It's the family pack.
3321233	3322553	Uh, no.
3322833	3325754	You know, JeremyTodd1 seems to agree with you.
3325875	3331817	Well, the Wii is marketed towards the whole family, so the kids would like the child games, and the older people would like the Red Steel Madden.
3332788	3333368	I'll give you that.
3333408	3337930	But then again, all six, and of course, JV Mon says, I pre-ordered Monkey Ball and Red Steel.
3337990	3340171	Okay, but did you pre-order Madden?
3340231	3341251	Is that game interesting to you too?
3341271	3343812	Would you say all six of those games are something that interests you?
3344932	3347573	Footy Monster says they are good games in general.
3348634	3349114	No, I don't.
3349134	3349894	I haven't played them yet.
3349934	3352155	Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just a shitty port.
3352215	3352915	That's all it is.
3353555	3356797	The game itself is good, but, I mean, it's just a port.
3357197	3358097	So, whatever.
3360278	3360498	All right.
3362058	3369221	Anyway, all this forced extortion of money and forcing me to buy Monkey Ball when I don't really want it.
3369781	3372442	It ruffles my feathers and it makes me very angry.
3372502	3374743	And as you can already tell, I'm in a bit of a mood tonight.
3374783	3375283	I don't know why.
3375323	3376764	There's no particular reason for it.
3377264	3382346	I think Tiara brings some type of energy with her that makes me more, I don't know.
3382606	3383967	I think it's gas from your lunch.
3384167	3384507	Maybe.
3384527	3384627	Maybe.
3385951	3387312	from that yummy pumpkin cheesecake.
3387332	3388652	We went to the Cheesecake Factory today.
3388752	3389233	Good stuff.
3389253	3391554	But wait, wait, you're going to put me in a good mood and that's not the time.
3391734	3392854	This is not the time to be in a good mood.
3392874	3393754	Rob, they're out of cheesecake.
3395915	3396716	People die.
3406120	3408461	It's time, of course, for the FUs of the week.
3409101	3410142	And I have one.
3410602	3412883	And one that's the size of an entire city.
3414458	3422123	F you to most of the drivers in San Francisco for being retarded and the whole town for being laid out so funny and getting me lost.
3424005	3436333	Even the power of the double horns did not make the people move out of my way or almost run into me or stop in the middle of the damn, not in the middle of the lane I was in, but between two lanes.
3437481	3438122	Oh, God!
3438622	3443845	Just when I think my road rage might have subsided a bit, I drive in San Francisco.
3444726	3447147	And then, it comes back.
3448208	3449409	And then I want to kill.
3450449	3452330	I imagine how I'm going to kill them.
3452831	3456833	In slow, painful ways, like using a cheese grater and lemon juice.
3458334	3458734	I'm done.
3458874	3461016	Oh, God.
3461136	3461356	Okay.
3462717	3472924	After you do game blog sites that think posting pictures of the Wii in play or posting, I don't know, stupid details like, It comes in a box!
3473124	3473804	With cords!
3474145	3474885	And stuff!
3475385	3476386	That is not news.
3477007	3477967	Please stop reporting it.
3478187	3478948	I mean, my god.
3479088	3482070	I know everyone's excited for this console launch, but I do not need to see...
3482734	3486075	Like, stop motion of you pulling the damn console out of a box.
3486515	3487015	You know what, though?
3487175	3495317	I'm exempting Kotaku from this FU because the video of his kid playing the system was so fucking adorable, I wanted to go, Oh, they're so cute!
3495497	3496877	It was so cute.
3497317	3498718	So I'm exempting Kotaku from this.
3499038	3505139	At least that's a creative way of doing it, but it... I mean, we had news stories about how the Wii can be used as a whiteboard.
3505179	3505959	I mean, come on.
3506539	3509280	Just because it's shiny, you can put, you know, dry erase pens on it.
3509320	3509940	Big deal, but...
3511670	3512150	It's not news.
3512591	3513572	PooEater agrees with you.
3513632	3515113	I don't give a shit about you playing the Wii.
3515153	3516474	I care about me playing the Wii.
3516694	3517314	Exactly!
3520217	3520537	Alright.
3522799	3532987	My FU of the week goes to Baskin Robbins because the way they scoop their ice cream, like, all the ice cream comes up at the top and none of it ever falls into the cone.
3533347	3537090	So it's like, you know, by the time I eat my ice cream, because they eat my ice cream fast, um,
3537489	3542110	There's no ice cream left in the cone, so it's like I have this empty cone with nothing to do with, and it's kind of sad.
3542750	3545230	That was seriously the best thing I could come up with tonight.
3545330	3545970	I'm not that angry.
3545990	3546351	Eat the cone.
3546571	3547931	I'm not that angry.
3548211	3549811	Okay, no, then I'll give him this.
3550551	3556192	F you to the fact that still with Baskin Robbins, when you rip off the paper, sometimes, like, some of the paper gets stuck to the cone.
3556352	3557652	And it's like, I have to eat paper?
3558153	3558993	You need the glue.
3559673	3559833	Ew.
3560673	3560793	Ew.
3561133	3563493	F you to paper cone things.
3564414	3565434	T-R-R-R-R-R.
3565474	3566714	You have a F you.
3567543	3573045	I would just like to say FU to Marvel for taking so freaking long to finish Ultimates Volume 2.
3573685	3583408	The last issue came out last month, and the next issue that will wrap it up, which only needed probably about five pages to finish the entire series, will come out December 20th.
3583688	3584509	So that kind of sucks.
3586149	3587150	Hi, Drew Nami.
3587890	3590891	All right, first of all, shared FU for everyone.
3591531	3594452	FU to MySpace, your site design sucks ass.
3594932	3597053	Your members don't know web design works shit.
3597918	3600519	Give them a quiz before they're allowed to make a profile, please.
3600959	3601459	Please.
3602639	3604820	And F you to people who verb nouns.
3604900	3606020	Verbing nouns suck.
3606260	3607160	Stop verbing nouns.
3609681	3619003	And on that note, let's move on to our next story because... Oh, our next story is join our MySpace.
3619503	3624325	We have a MySpace profile over at www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3624565	3625465	Hear clips from the show.
3626738	3627699	Add us to your friends list.
3629099	3631461	Comment on our profile with cute little YouTube videos.
3631881	3633282	Because that's what people do on MySpace.
3637284	3639766	Let's talk about upcoming release dates.
3639906	3643328	Hey, Loki, I heard Full Auto 2 on the PSP is coming out.
3643408	3649051	I was really surprised to hear that because I had no idea it was in development.
3649151	3649971	That was a real surprise.
3649991	3651672	Yeah, that's a complete shocker to me.
3651712	3652553	I'm glad you know...
3653013	3675422	Someone came out and said that because if not I would have had to have said it on every single show for a long time now Well thank god 1UP reported on it because now it's true Because nothing is true until 1UP reports on it It's not necessarily just 1UP, everybody reported on it because they finally put out a press release about it But my god, how many fucking weeks do I need to tell you guys something's coming out
3676022	3679584	and no one picks up on the story until, oh, look, hey, guess what?
3680064	3683186	Some other website posted about this, so now it's true.
3683306	3685007	Well, poopy on you.
3685027	3685347	You know what?
3685407	3686688	It just makes this show special.
3686888	3689410	So the people that listen to this show, you're like a special club.
3689650	3690590	You get to know this first.
3690970	3691251	Fine.
3691571	3694893	Anyways, so some other special stuff you get to know first.
3695833	3698595	Full Isle 2 Battle Lines for the PS3.
3699758	3701920	If you're waiting for that as a launch title, guess what?
3701960	3703321	It's not coming out at launch.
3703381	3705483	It'll be coming out December 13th instead.
3705643	3706444	So, ha!
3706784	3709626	That's karma for you, Sega.
3709946	3715651	Also, along the same lines, Blazing Angels for the PlayStation 3, also not coming out until December 13th.
3716692	3717513	Not a big surprise.
3717713	3724098	Rainbow Six Vegas, also another game being delayed until January 31st for the PlayStation 3.
3724879	3726060	So that's very interesting.
3726678	3729861	Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 Pack PlayStation 2 Demo Disks
3744110	3745010	Jampactus.
3745210	3748912	Well, now they have this brand new thing called Xbox 360 Exhibition.
3749272	3750652	It's going to be $5.99 retail.
3750832	3767558	It'll feature six demos, including Madden NFL 07, Dead Rising, Fear, Fusion Frenzy 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and also six HD videos, including Halo 3, Splinter Cell Double Agent, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc.
3768119	3768719	And, um...
3769375	3778781	No, this is meant for someone, of course, that does not have Xbox Live, so they wouldn't have access to this, or they just didn't want to buy the Xbox official magazine.
3779081	3780702	Or you just really want to pay for demos.
3781302	3781782	Apparently.
3782343	3783664	So it is out there.
3783724	3786285	It's coming out on the 22nd, the one-year anniversary.
3786565	3789307	I have $6 to spend, and I just don't know what to do with it.
3789487	3793289	I'm not really interested in a combo meal from a local fast food restaurant.
3794130	3797772	I can tell you what you would spend this money on, and it's goddamn not...
3799113	3800973	360 Exhibition, Sneak King.
3801434	3806256	Sneak King is which you can spend your money on Sneak King and hell, you have enough money for some fries and a Coke.
3806276	3807516	There you go.
3807856	3808717	No, you're wrong.
3808797	3810878	Wrong because you have to get a combo meal to get the game.
3810898	3812999	So you actually need more than six dollars.
3813079	3813479	Whatever.
3813519	3814439	You just got served.
3814459	3815600	You got BK served.
3817701	3818401	You're still hungry.
3818461	3820062	You would spend the money on lunch anyways.
3820142	3821342	It's just, you know, whatever.
3821402	3823083	Now you get Sneak King.
3823447	3824887	No, this is what I'll do.
3825027	3826208	I'll get Drew.
3826588	3830169	I'll say, Drew, don't you want to go out to eat and make him buy the meal and then I'll buy the game?
3831049	3831589	Money saved.
3833290	3834790	Don't you want some chicken fries?
3835050	3836450	Don't you want some chicken fries?
3837891	3842432	Anyways, so getting back into the swing of things here.
3844776	3849558	Now, this week actually for games is probably the largest week of the entire year.
3849658	3853980	And that said, there's not a lot of good stuff coming out actually, which is really sad.
3854540	3858942	But for the 360 though, there are some pretty interesting things.
3859462	3864645	Dead or Alive Extreme 2 is finally making its way out into the market.
3864725	3869627	So if you're looking for a lot of T&A, well, you won't have to wait much longer.
3870321	3871862	Also, Rainbow Six Vegas for the 360.
3871902	3874523	I guess I'll have to get some chicken fries and some TNA.
3878765	3884927	Eragon is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and then the portable systems.
3886008	3887629	Pimp My Ride on PlayStation 2.
3888249	3889489	Actually, no, I forgot that one.
3889509	3890470	I got delayed a week.
3891470	3895432	But anyways, what were you going to say there, Rob?
3896793	3903957	Something really sarcastic about Pimp My Ride the game, but I really need to shut up tonight because we're going to get angry emails.
3903997	3905117	Rob talks too much.
3905277	3907158	Rob talks too much on the program.
3908879	3913181	I downloaded this podcast having no idea that Rob would talk so much.
3913261	3917543	I mean, his fucking picture is on the little album art, but I never knew he would talk so much.
3917843	3918764	More lesbians.
3919004	3919764	More lesbians.
3920585	3920825	Okay.
3922008	3924850	Let's see, lots of PlayStation 3 games, of course, all the launch stuff.
3924910	3931534	Mobile Suit Gundam, Crossfire, NHL 2K7, NBA 2K7, Ridge Racer 7.
3934096	3934836	Ridge Racer.
3935177	3937298	Then, of course, a bunch of Wii titles, you know.
3938139	3943102	Avatar Last Airbender, Red Steel, Excite Truck, Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.
3944003	3946544	Pretty much everything that you want for the Wii is coming out Red Steel.
3946564	3947545	Yeah.
3948371	3975502	Other than all that stuff, Bionicle Heroes is coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube 360, the DS, Game Boy Advance, Tomb Raider is finally coming out on the Nintendo systems, Capcom Classics Collection Volume 2 is on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, the Sega Genesis Collection is finally coming out, Guitar Man Lives on the PSP, Final Fantasy 3 on the DS, Gunpei on PlayStation 2 and the DS,
3976840	3982964	And then, of course, there's just so much crap coming out, it's amazing.
3983744	3986966	And, yeah, more than I would even want to list.
3988407	3993030	All your PlayStation 3 launch titles, all your Wii launch titles, a lot of other stuff mixed in there.
3993210	3995171	WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 07.
3996812	3998053	This is just too much shit.
3999394	4001375	You know the commercial Nintendo should have aired?
4002896	4006238	This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, come on down and get your Nintendo Wii!
4007563	4008984	We've got Big Twilight Princess!
4009024	4010705	We've got Super Wookiee Ballin' in a Bits!

4016787	4019169	Oh, and Sonic the Hedgehog Excite Truck!
4019649	4020229	And Chicken Fries.
4020449	4022770	Sonic the Hedgehog on the 360 is also coming out this week.
4023751	4024111	Pass.
4027132	4029714	Well, how about a little bit different release news?
4029794	4030854	Did you play the demo?
4030914	4031755	I mean, it was poopy.
4031955	4032715	I mean, it was very poopy.
4032735	4033335	Sonic the Hedgehog 360?
4033435	4033876	Yes.
4034256	4035276	Yeah, it was poop.
4035336	4036417	I talked about that last week.
4036457	4036857	I know you did.
4039836	4040577	Were that all for our U.S.
4040677	4041137	release dates?
4041197	4042277	I'm done.
4042497	4043377	Was that all for our U.S.
4043397	4043918	release dates?
4044018	4045458	Yeah, there's too much for me to list.
4045578	4050239	I mean, honestly, Polarium Advanced, I mean, if you really want to buy that.
4051920	4054641	Well, we've got a few releases coming up for the U.K.
4056061	4061403	14th November, we have EverQuest 2, Echoes of Thadeware for PC.
4061783	4065824	17th, a good number, Asterix Noble XXXL2, Mission Las Vegas.
4066881	4067882	on PSP and DS.
4068402	4069724	Did I miss Asterix and Obelix?
4069744	4071925	I used to read those comics back in the day.
4073046	4089920	Gears of War on the 17th, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Premium Edition on Xbox 360, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Hammers of Fate, Lumen S2 on PSP, Mind Quiz on PSP, Superman Returns the Video Game on DS, Sims 2 Pets on GBA.
4090621	4092883	So, have fun!
4094749	4104512	Just a little bit of other stuff to look forward to within the month is Rule of Rose, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Guitar Hero 2 on the 24th.
4106052	4108593	Instead of have fun, wouldn't that be have a jolly old time?
4109093	4109833	Have a jolly old time.
4111914	4112474	I'm just kidding.
4114236	4116699	The Chyram's asking who fed me sugar before the show.
4116779	4118581	Jamie, actually, she brought me a cookie.
4118922	4120103	I brought cookies.
4120223	4124529	It was like a coffee cookie, so it was sugar and caffeine, and apparently it was laced with crack.
4125169	4125610	Apparently.
4125750	4127312	Yeah.
4127332	4129695	That's right, I had Tiara's Latte Cheesecake, too.
4130703	4131484	It all comes together.
4131864	4133846	Hey, Japan, how about some release dates?
4133886	4146417	You guys have the PS3 now, so you're getting some games this week, including Mahjong Cocktail Club, which comes out November 16th, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on November 17th, and Need for Speed Carbon on November 20th.
4147596	4149457	You gotta wait till December 2nd for the Wii, though.
4149497	4150017	Sorry, kids.
4150057	4153318	You do get a lot of PlayStation 2 releases coming out this week.
4153798	4157379	You get Rhapsodia, which is going into the Konami The Best series.
4157439	4158959	It's actually getting a little bit of a price cut.
4160599	4164560	And let's see, White Princess II is coming out on the 16th as well.
4165080	4167021	That also appears to be going into a collection.
4167961	4172122	This game is also going into a collection, and this might be my import title of the week.
4173062	4175363	It's Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl.
4176246	4177246	Hey, I want that one.
4177627	4178347	I'll bet it does.
4181468	4184210	Girl meets girl and much kashimashi ensues.
4185530	4185951	Let's see.
4186031	4190973	We also have on the Nintendo DS Puzzle Series Volumes 5, 6, and 7 from Hudson.
4191573	4194515	Magic Taizen and Akumajo Dracula.
4195055	4196295	That's just a bundle there.
4196616	4198416	Gallery of Labyrinth comes out.
4198597	4200397	Oh, that's the Portrait of Ruin title.
4200417	4201598	That's what they're calling it over in Japan.
4201991	4203032	That's not a bundle, sorry kids.
4203332	4204012	That's just that game.
4204492	4208954	If you're a PSP player, Metal Gear Acid 2 is going into the best this week on the 16th.
4209315	4211316	You get a Sudoku game from Hudson on the 16th.
4211796	4213677	And Gunpei, oh wait, that's the 20th.
4213877	4216678	Sorry, you gotta wait a little while longer for that one.
4218119	4219380	And that's all I got for you.
4220120	4220440	Excellent.
4221000	4227724	Well, with the Wii coming out here pretty soon, and of course the Virtual Console also launching relatively soon...
4231127	4246585	Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, and Wild Gunman.
4247165	4249448	In other words, seriously, the games I really want.
4250976	4253256	Wild Gunman is like the most simple game ever made.
4253276	4254217	Have you ever played Wild Gunman?
4280013	4281294	Here's the concept of wild gumming.
4281614	4286016	The person goes, draw, and you fire the zapper gun as fast as you can.
4286576	4287316	That's all it is.
4287396	4291378	It's basically, they could re-release this game as push the button fast.
4292018	4293439	And that's exactly what it is.
4295280	4297060	It was in Back to the Future, Loki.
4297621	4299041	Yeah, I remember that.
4299501	4300322	That's the game that was there.
4301742	4303063	Was it also in The Karate Kid?
4304223	4304944	No, I might be on crack.
4304984	4305944	No, that was skeet shooting.
4306084	4306404	Never mind.
4307785	4308205	I'm on crack.
4309042	4315128	Well, it's kind of stupid, though, that they have Duck Hunt coming out anyways, because, I mean, was it that Wii Play game was pretty much Duck Hunt anyways?
4316149	4316389	So.
4317370	4322955	Of course, we're not getting Wii Play, because we're the United States, and fucking UK gets it.
4323535	4323936	Bastards.
4324396	4333525	It would be nice if they would rename Hogan's Alley Hogan Knows Best's Alley, because then I could zap Brook, and that would bring me endless days of excitement.
4333565	4334826	Hogan's Heroes Alley.
4336567	4337307	Hogan!
4337748	4339068	The Hogan Family Alley.
4339788	4341229	I just killed Sandy Duncan.
4342350	4345711	And if you caught that reference, you totally are an 80s child.
4347132	4348552	Even Matt's laughing at that one.
4348572	4348752	Wow.
4348932	4349953	I don't even know why.
4350573	4352054	I don't even know what you're talking about.
4353775	4355235	Don't you remember the Hogan Family?
4355635	4356696	Never mind, forget it.
4357076	4359397	I remember the Hogan Family.
4359757	4360377	Thank you.
4360938	4362338	You know what else I remember?
4362939	4363199	What?
4364299	4365340	When this show was good?
4365360	4365560	Yeah.
4369383	4371725	Yeah, guess what?
4372025	4378370	Namco has registered new Katamari Damacy trademarks, so we can get more ball rolling in.
4397463	4407108	We have beautiful Katamari Damacy, Katamari Damacy Tribian, and there was an application filed for Katamari Damacy-kun.
4408629	4411651	Ball rolling, and to think I skipped the PSP version of Katamari.
4411671	4414132	Hey, we talked about man cannons the other week.
4418275	4419996	Can you roll a Katamari into a man cannon?
4420016	4420556	What would happen?
4420596	4424038	That would be a... A big black hawk.
4424995	4435683	Wow, that reference is about 150 episodes old, and people aren't going to get it, and they're going to go, what the fuck is wrong with Jamie?
4438364	4442867	Oh, Drunami knows what episode number, you are sad, you are sad.
4442887	4444288	29, 29 he says, alright, anyway, sorry.
4444348	4444849	Oh, my turn.
4444929	4444989	Um...
4454062	4460267	Xbox Live is getting another new game very soon, and this is one I know that's near and dear to at least one person's heart in this room.
4461007	4461588	Worms!
4462488	4463289	You remember Worms?
4463349	4463809	Yeah!
4464049	4466671	Worms HD is coming.
4467372	4470274	Right now, plans for announcements are being discussed with Microsoft right now.
4470594	4474477	The game is in final certification stages, so maybe we'll get this by the end of the year.
4474777	4475458	That would be rad.
4475718	4476158	Hopefully.
4476518	4477159	But I don't know.
4477259	4482723	Rumor is that the release calendar is full for the year, so this might have to wait until next year, but...
4483323	4484525	Oh, here's my thought.
4484545	4486048	Are we getting another UNO pack?
4487249	4493098	God, that's, you know, if another game gets delayed, I really can't fucking wait for the Viva Pinata UNO pack.
4493219	4496564	I just, God, I'm on pins and fucking needles waiting for that.
4497766	4501627	I have 100 points saved just so I can buy the Viva Pinata Uno pack.
4501988	4503028	I hope one of these games... No!
4503108	4503988	Of course I'm lying!
4505569	4508870	This game could be put in when some other game gets delayed if it's ready to go.
4509390	4516333	You know one of those other games is going to get delayed because they're going to go, oh, gee, when we do the upscrolling level, it looks completely different on two different screens.
4517273	4518793	Anyway, Worms is the game, of course.
4518853	4520614	It's like Scorched Earth.
4521194	4523195	It's Scorched Earth in wormy form.
4523915	4526316	And, you know, you fire bombs and
4531688	4539770	I've actually been quoting lines from Monty Python all weekend, and I was quoting the holy hand grenade thing at the Metreon.
4540931	4547353	Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that it might blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.
4547793	4548953	Oh, at the wax museum, that's right.
4552634	4554555	Anyways, something completely different, you say?
4555117	4557678	How about Linux on the Wii?
4557799	4559059	I was going to say Wii on Linux.
4559159	4560200	That would be a little weird.
4560660	4565563	No, but anyways, yes, Wii and Linux.
4565923	4566944	Wheelie, you say?
4567264	4569185	Yes, that's actually what it's called, Wheelie.
4569925	4572007	And it's being done.
4572027	4572887	I see what you did there.
4576109	4576829	Yeah, okay.
4577310	4581092	Anyways, so it's actually being worked on, and...
4582210	4588876	Supposedly, they're going to start beta testing this thing as soon as the Wii comes out because it's based on the GameCube Linux as well.
4589396	4597343	Some things that they're aiming to be able to do with this, surfing the internet using the control, of course, as a mouse pointer, even though you can do that anyways.
4598004	4606291	Wii Media Extender to stream movies and music and stuff from your PC to the Wii and to your TV.
4606311	4607832	Okay.
4608271	4610532	They said basically think Apple ITV for free.
4611232	4615433	Write document with a regular USB keyboard and print with any USB printer.
4616513	4617613	So you could print money.
4617973	4618173	Huh?
4618394	4618574	Huh?
4618814	4619034	See?
4621434	4623855	And let's see.
4623995	4625255	Email and chat with your friends.
4625275	4627516	$50 bill?
4627536	4627716	$50 bill?
4627736	4627876	$50 bill!
4627896	4628116	God!
4628136	4628416	$50 bill!
4628956	4630056	Sorry, I was late.
4638030	4638370	Let's see.
4638731	4642452	Play classic games using the MAME console emulator.
4643132	4644273	That'd be irony right there.
4645393	4647294	Develop your own programs and games.
4647374	4664820	Control Wheelie from your PC using a Wi-Fi connection and use Wheelie and the Wii as a network attached storage by connecting it to an external USB hard drive and pretty much anything else you can do on a PC.
4665240	4665400	So,
4666354	4667114	I don't know, that's pretty cool.
4667394	4673475	I've signed up to hopefully beta test this, so probably more of the come as the Wii gets launched.
4673776	4674316	Oh, wheelie.
4674956	4675296	Wheelie.
4676436	4678056	I'm waiting for the picture of the owl.
4679197	4681277	And now that I've said, oh, is there already, oh, there it is.
4682337	4683437	Oh, no, that's a Linux penguin.
4683457	4684058	That's not an owl.
4684098	4685278	But it's dressed up like Mario.
4685318	4685958	I know, that's cute.
4686018	4689219	No, I'm waiting for the, you know, the famous owl that says, oh, really?
4689239	4691279	I'm waiting for the oh, wheelie one.
4691479	4691599	Oh.
4692459	4692779	All right.
4693219	4696200	Anyway, sorry to encourage that behavior on the internet.
4697193	4697733	Oh, come on.
4698734	4700874	You know you like to encourage mass hysteria.
4701495	4705196	Speaking of mass hysteria, this won't really encourage any of it, but it's kind of cool.
4707257	4714719	For those five people still playing Animal Crossing DS, which I need to actually clean out my village and start doing that because this is pretty cool.
4715440	4724603	With the launch of Twilight Princess on 19th November, Nintendo will be giving away a very special and rare gift in Animal Crossing, according to their...
4729017	4742387	If you connect via Nintendo Wi-Fi during the week of November 17th through 24th, you'll receive a letter from Nintendo, which will show up in your mailbox, and you will receive an attached item.
4744249	4746871	So, it could be anything.
4747491	4754117	Accompanied with the letter will be a corrupt item that will erase your save and say, Go buy a Wii, stop playing the DS!
4755194	4759398	No, it'll be a flower that you put in your house and then you can't put anything in that corner of your house.
4759878	4760959	Oh, wait, they already did that.
4761519	4766043	I actually went to NintendoWiFi.com just to prove Jamie wrong because I like to do that.
4766503	4768785	And it shows 20 random Wi-Fi players.
4768825	4769226	And look at that.
4769726	4773209	Six people are playing Animal Crossing Wild World right now.
4773869	4774170	We have...
4775034	4782538	Danny Boy is playing and Phil is playing and IJ and Mike and Christina with a lowercase c because she's poetic.
4782898	4783338	And look at this.
4783658	4785939	Rob is playing Animal Crossing right now.
4788861	4794383	Hey, Rob, this is just for you.
4795024	4803588	There may only be six people in the world playing Animal Crossing Wild World right this moment, but 1.5 million people are playing Final Fantasy XII.
4804284	4813189	At least that's what Square Enix will have you believe, because they sent out a press release earlier this week saying that Final Fantasy XII has 1.5 million units on shelves.
4813430	4820414	Okay, well, I guess 1.5 million people aren't really playing it, but yet there's that many copies in circulation, so soon 1.5 million people will be playing it.
4821514	4827458	Final Fantasy XII, by the way, for the record, did 2.4 million copies in Japan, so it'll be interesting to see.
4827798	4830480	Wouldn't it be interesting if it sold more here than it did in Japan?
4831260	4833962	Well, we all know Dragon Quest is the bigger game in Japan, so I don't know.
4834745	4839548	By the way, Final Fantasy XII, brand new record for the total number of units shipped for the franchise.
4839988	4840989	Good job, Squeenix!
4841609	4842030	Good job.
4842950	4846673	Some other interesting stuff... Now, next time, make the graphics less pixelated.
4846713	4846973	Thank you.
4848674	4853417	Some interesting stuff for fans of Guitar Hero.
4854538	4863143	Guitar Hero 2, of course, you may remember with the demo, it actually blocked the Ant Commando's controllers from working with it.
4863638	4884792	and apparently that's the case also if you have purchased your Guitar Hero controller from them before October 1st if you have then it will not work with Guitar Hero 2 unless you purchase an adapter which I believe is free but don't hold me to that and
4885459	4890420	So once you get the adapter, I guess everything's... Oh, I'm sorry, the adapter's $6.99.
4890560	4894821	So yeah, if you want to play with that controller, you're going to have to pay another $7.
4896041	4900182	But the other controllers beyond that will work with Guitar Hero 2.
4900642	4906363	So apparently anything that did circumvent third-party controllers has been broken already.
4907663	4908943	We kind of knew that would be coming, though.
4909483	4913284	I mean, you know, that's the Ancommando's business right there, so they had to get around it somehow, right?
4913504	4913704	Yeah.
4913944	4914064	Yeah.
4915805	4917827	Drew, you've been playing Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit, right?
4917867	4918929	I see you posting about it.
4919870	4922674	Are you interested at all in these third-party controllers or any of that?
4923996	4924457	Not really.
4924477	4926059	I just don't really see any interest in them.
4926920	4931126	I've got my SG controller from the first game, and I don't really need another one.
4933792	4941494	If I feel like I'm kind of over Guitar Hero, like seriously, the hype around Guitar Hero has seriously ruined Guitar Hero for me for some weird reason.
4941794	4950256	I don't know, like you know how like when you were the only person that listened to this band and then suddenly everybody's listening to the band and you're like, it's just not so special anymore.
4950316	4952336	Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about Guitar Hero.
4952516	4958938	I mean, call me an elitist, whatever, but am I doing myself a disservice by not checking out Guitar Hero 2?
4959978	4960178	Yes.
4960778	4962219	Yes, absolutely yes.
4962319	4963199	Yes, very yes.
4964830	4966071	Oh, Tiara says no.
4966191	4966751	Why is that?
4968512	4978079	Because if you spend all the time that you spend playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2, learning to play an actual guitar, think of all the amazing songs you could play.
4978999	4983082	Wait, weren't you telling me a story earlier today about somebody that was in a guitar class?
4983102	4984843	Tell me the story about the girl in the guitar class.
4985704	4989366	Okay, this involves my boyfriend, Adam.
4989466	4992308	He's taking a guitar class at the community college.
4993015	5001220	and there's a girl in his class who was asking him, you know, do you believe in psychics and explaining something about this one particular psychic.
5001760	5006503	Anyways, Adam told her, the only psychic I believe in is Professor Charles Xavier.
5007643	5011186	And so her response was, does he teach at this campus?
5015848	5017509	That doesn't have anything to do with Guitar Hero.
5018990	5020351	Wait, but you were telling me, okay, yeah.
5021261	5022742	Okay, haha, she's stupid.
5023062	5028244	But the other part about this was, wait, what was this, she asked him if he knew Boston or what was this?
5028284	5036407	Oh yeah, apparently all she plays is Guitar Hero because she asked him if he had ever heard of a band called Boston.
5037362	5052651	and the song that she mentioned was the song on the original Guitar Hero and every time that she says that she likes a band and he asks what songs that she likes from that band, it's the song that's on Guitar Heroes and she doesn't know any of the other songs.
5054392	5054993	Hey, you know what?
5055073	5062177	I give her credit though for at least taking Tiara's advice and going to take a real guitar class instead of playing Guitar Hero 2.
5063633	5064874	No, I'm sure it's a great game.
5064934	5067116	I just, there's other games I wanted more.
5067136	5068476	I'll get it next week.
5068496	5069157	I'll get the 361.
5069877	5072519	I swear to you I will buy the 361, like launch day.
5072759	5073360	What?
5074040	5075281	What?
5075441	5077002	I will shove this mic up your butt.
5077162	5077423	What?
5077823	5078804	You can come to my house and play.
5079384	5079884	I just might.
5080365	5080645	Okay.
5081305	5083707	I heard on a Bobby show tonight that it supports progressive scan.
5083727	5084307	That's kind of cool.
5084888	5085908	It looks really nice on my TV.
5086108	5086589	Not special.
5086689	5086829	What?
5088504	5093586	I'll get a copy for you and I'll put it on my PlayStation 2 and you can play on that.
5093847	5094547	Okay, sounds good.
5094927	5096328	No, I'll get the 360 version.
5096388	5097088	That's what I said earlier.
5097589	5102952	I don't see the point in getting the PlayStation 2 one when we know the 360 one will be better because of its expandability.
5104032	5105373	So, I can wait.
5105913	5106293	Can you?
5107994	5109055	I sold mine, so yes.
5110783	5122606	Alright, on that note, we're going to go to a little bit of a break because obviously I need a sedative, so I'm going to go take some Tylenol PM during this break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a little bit of a break.
5123266	5128247	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
