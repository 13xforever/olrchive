00:00:00,487 --> 00:00:05,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly.

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:14,743
[SPEAKER_01]: To listen to the first half of this episode, visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes.

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:19,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:25,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th of 2006.

5
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,220
[SPEAKER_10]: And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air because it's getting kind of cold now.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm a little bit more calmed down.

7
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:36,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not quite as hyper as I was during the first segment.

8
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:40,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.

9
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,724
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, at the same time, I don't apologize because that's me.

10
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:44,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it or leave it.

11
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:47,846
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe to.

12
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:52,755
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

13
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,517
[SPEAKER_06]: The Central Buddy List and the Messaging System.

14
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:23,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to go for all titles.

15
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:39,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's... I suppose to make it easier, more user-friendly, so that you don't have login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.

16
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:41,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all on there.

17
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:48,405
[SPEAKER_06]: But they were basically saying that... They were actually saying that specific to Resistance, the game coming out that...

18
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,703
[SPEAKER_06]: is going to be using the same login.

19
00:01:51,403 --> 00:02:00,706
[SPEAKER_10]: I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot about PlayStation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind.

20
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:04,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, because I'm a fanboy of all three.

21
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:09,768
[SPEAKER_10]: But Microsoft seriously has online down.

22
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:15,869
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing it the best, and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne from them this time around.

23
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,351
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

24
00:02:18,232 --> 00:02:21,795
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very little that we know about Sony's PlayStation 3 and the online stuff.

25
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:27,520
[SPEAKER_06]: What I've seen so far, though, still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior online.

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,061
[SPEAKER_10]: As it was last generation.

27
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:37,408
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would have thought that this generation, the other two would have been... But Nintendo's really had to play catch-up, and I think their friend code thing kind of hurts them a little bit.

28
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

29
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,552
[SPEAKER_06]: The friend code thing, in that respect, though, I think sort of protects...

30
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:46,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer, it doesn't make it any easier.

31
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:52,169
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, on live, you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know are your friends.

32
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:52,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

33
00:02:53,029 --> 00:03:02,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's probably like Super Smash Bros.

34
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:09,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Trophy Room, or like a lot of Nintendo games do, is that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.

35
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:10,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, crap!

36
00:03:11,437 --> 00:03:12,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I love crap!

37
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:13,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

38
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:14,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

39
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:20,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my PlayStation 3 when I finally get one.

40
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:22,170
[SPEAKER_10]: There's going to be...

41
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:23,567
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

42
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:54,167
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something you create in the cross-media bar, and there's a memory card utility, and then you can actually create a PlayStation 1 card and a PlayStation 2 card, name them, and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.

43
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:57,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.

44
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how it's going to work on the PlayStation 3, if you were curious.

45
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:04,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.

46
00:04:05,114 --> 00:04:05,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes sense.

47
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:06,515
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty cool.

48
00:04:06,796 --> 00:04:08,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if I can load my virtual...

49
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:11,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

50
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:33,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Heavenly Sword

51
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:25,759
[SPEAKER_11]: which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways is slated for a 2007 release also in March and of course their flagship title Warhawk is in the summer now so that's kind of interesting but basically another reason why maybe waiting for a PlayStation 3 is a good idea because some of the bigger games are coming out later on.

52
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,026
[SPEAKER_10]: ShadowNextGen said, Excite Truck does have achievements.

53
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:43,530
[SPEAKER_10]: It may or may not.

54
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:45,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we've heard it does.

55
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:46,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not disputing that part.

56
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:49,054
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.

57
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:54,758
[SPEAKER_10]: The cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements my friends have and I can see what their score is.

58
00:05:55,078 --> 00:06:03,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And then these other fan-created things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like MyGamerCard.net, which is a very cool site.

59
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:04,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, by the way, we have the OL Army site.

60
00:06:05,325 --> 00:06:07,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamers... What do we call it?

61
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:09,468
[SPEAKER_10]: The OL Army E-Penis Leaderboard or something like that?

62
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:11,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Where it's tracking all our gamer scores.

63
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're on there, and you're on there, and I'm on there.

64
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:23,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you want to join, check out our forums and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund.

65
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,419
[SPEAKER_10]: But will the Wii have anything like that?

66
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:29,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so, because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.

67
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:31,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, that's not going to break the system.

68
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:34,104
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of surprising that they didn't

69
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:37,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Embrace the online in that way.

70
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think not being online kind of killed them last round.

71
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:42,567
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's just my opinion, I suppose.

72
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:43,068
[SPEAKER_10]: What do I know?

73
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:44,009
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just some guy on the internet.

74
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, back to different PS3 news.

75
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:54,581
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually a few people have already told me their experiences with this.

76
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:59,250
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk.

77
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,311
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's available on MotorStorm and NBA 07.

78
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:08,353
[SPEAKER_06]: But according to one of our listeners, it crashed, I think, every, what, five minutes?

79
00:07:09,874 --> 00:07:12,835
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that it was JVmon mentioned it.

80
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:16,817
[SPEAKER_10]: What, was it overheating or what was it doing?

81
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:18,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably overheating.

82
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:22,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, at Best Buy, sorry.

83
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes.

84
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:31,237
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, but there's the playable kiosks at, uh... Well, that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show, too.

85
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I guess it was a different environment.

86
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised!

87
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:34,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

88
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care about.

89
00:07:38,362 --> 00:07:42,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently the only way it was staying on.

90
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,607
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but, uh, anyways.

91
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:50,031
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, of course, like most anything else that's being released nowadays, you know, right as it comes out,

92
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,435
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be upgraded.

93
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:54,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, that's the same with the PlayStation 3.

94
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:57,678
[SPEAKER_11]: You will be getting a firmware update on launch day.

95
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:04,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And it will basically allow you to utilize the PlayStation Network functions.

96
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:15,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, not a big surprise, but they're doing the same thing with the Wii when that comes out there.

97
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:17,511
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to do a firmware update as well for that.

98
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:17,691
[SPEAKER_11]: But

99
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:20,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

100
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:27,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early and be able to get them manufactured.

101
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:36,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And if that means adding a firmware update later on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so be it.

102
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:42,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting two PS3s instead of 400,000.

103
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:42,845
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

104
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:42,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Well...

105
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:47,804
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

106
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:11,930
[SPEAKER_10]: NBA Street HomeCourt instead of porting NBA Live 07.

107
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:16,353
[SPEAKER_10]: And HomeCourt will be coming to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.

108
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:23,337
[SPEAKER_10]: All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live 08.

109
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And HomeCourt, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February.

110
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,826
[SPEAKER_11]: So it shouldn't be too bad.

111
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:46,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, um... There is also a lot of other, uh, you know, PlayStation 3 delays, you know, coming out.

112
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:55,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Um... You know, pretty much, you know, with everything, just, you know, as we mentioned earlier, we're talking about, you know, Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that.

113
00:09:55,688 --> 00:10:00,850
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you know, it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff's being delayed.

114
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:06,393
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um... Anyways, um...

115
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:08,933
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

116
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And this makes me very, very, very sad.

117
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:26,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3.

118
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:36,952
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, in a quote released by IGN, they said they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3.

119
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

120
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:43,873
[SPEAKER_06]: When you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.

121
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:46,614
[SPEAKER_06]: They're basically saying that since the

122
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,705
[SPEAKER_06]: The controller doesn't have the button.

123
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:53,753
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't actually activate it and you can't swap out the controller to change it in.

124
00:10:56,357 --> 00:11:06,085
[SPEAKER_10]: because you'll need to turn on the analog and, of course, the SG doesn't have analog, so... So, in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will not be working on the PlayStation 3.

125
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,127
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no physical way to make it work.

126
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:15,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So, would that go the same with, like, say, DDR, Beatmania, anything that uses an additional controller?

127
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's interesting because I have a last-minute update here.

128
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:25,400
[SPEAKER_10]: BomaniStyle just posted a story this evening because, you know, the PS3's out in Japan now and they're trying some backwards compatibility there and they're saying...

129
00:11:25,871 --> 00:11:31,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Poppin' Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds.

130
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Poppin' Music Disney has timing issues with the background music.

131
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:37,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Poppin' Music 2 is missing some images.

132
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:42,255
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, Beatmania Best Hits has timing issues.

133
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:46,977
[SPEAKER_10]: 6 Mix and Core has background music as well as Beatmania The Sounds of Tokyo.

134
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:48,797
[SPEAKER_10]: The timing's off in Godamix.

135
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:50,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the graphics don't appear in Godamix 2.

136
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:51,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And Disney...

137
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,480
[SPEAKER_10]: DDR Max 6 Mix.

138
00:11:53,881 --> 00:12:02,130
[SPEAKER_10]: The background doesn't always play correctly, which of course is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time and correctly, so it pretty much makes the game unplayable.

139
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you talking about the background videos, though?

140
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,996
[SPEAKER_10]: No, background music doesn't always play correctly.

141
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:08,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Beatmania 2DX

142
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:35,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that 100% compatibility?

143
00:12:35,978 --> 00:12:36,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite.

144
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:07,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kutaragi.

145
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,971
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's funny because somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kutaragi's on fire!

146
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:12,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Kutaragi's on fire!

147
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:14,833
[SPEAKER_10]: It was funny to me in that moment.

148
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,478
[SPEAKER_10]: He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons.

149
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:24,681
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was on fire, running around on fire.

150
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:26,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have him...

151
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym, and on fire.

152
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:35,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, someone who thinks Kutaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell.

153
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:39,867
[SPEAKER_10]: You might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari.

154
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,868
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, he's the granddaddy of Pong.

155
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:46,510
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in the foot.

156
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,631
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a high probability they will fail.

157
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,913
[SPEAKER_10]: The price point is probably unsustainable.

158
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:55,495
[SPEAKER_10]: For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer standpoint.

159
00:13:56,089 --> 00:13:56,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

160
00:14:19,682 --> 00:14:20,262
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

161
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:49,529
[SPEAKER_10]: on one of the blogs today that talked about how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast and everybody said Dreamcast has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than PS2 can, Dreamcast can do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed.

162
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:55,271
[SPEAKER_10]: So people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online.

163
00:14:56,331 --> 00:14:57,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Will history repeat itself?

164
00:14:57,851 --> 00:15:00,092
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to listen to him because he brought us Pizza Time Theater.

165
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:01,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamcast didn't play DVDs.

166
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:09,873
[SPEAKER_10]: and at that time, DVDs were just breaking.

167
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:18,081
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, you know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray and Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.

168
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:20,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.

169
00:15:20,843 --> 00:15:23,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD.

170
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:27,089
[SPEAKER_10]: DVD was already somewhat established and everybody knew it was the next.

171
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,630
[SPEAKER_10]: This time you have a split.

172
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:33,275
[SPEAKER_10]: People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going to be the winner.

173
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:37,197
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you gonna get a Blu-ray?

174
00:15:37,217 --> 00:15:37,837
[SPEAKER_10]: They go, what's that?

175
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,958
[SPEAKER_10]: You gonna get an HD DVD?

176
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:40,378
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

177
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a DVD player.

178
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:41,999
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

179
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an HD TV.

180
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,801
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're gonna get an HD DVD.

181
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:46,121
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

182
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:50,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.

183
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:52,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

184
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,166
[SPEAKER_06]: If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.

185
00:15:55,726 --> 00:16:02,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, other interesting things about, also, we were talking about the backwards compatibility on games and how it's not working.

186
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:12,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not a huge surprise, but Japanese PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.

187
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:20,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the games are region-coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions.

188
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:24,027
[SPEAKER_11]: But that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.

189
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:27,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

190
00:16:43,847 --> 00:17:08,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background music correctly Xena Saga Episode 2, the opening movie sometimes stops Mega Man X7, background music won't play properly sometimes Devil May Cry, screen sometimes freezes during the title demo Suikoden 3, can't read PlayStation 1 data during the game Silent Hill 2, when going from title to demo, the screen may freeze Issues... That sounds like a lot of games

191
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:13,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, maybe that's what the day one firmware update's all about.

192
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

193
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there, so... Oh, ouch.

194
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:19,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Oopsie.

195
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:20,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point, good point.

196
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:28,989
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners think of all this console mania going on this week.

197
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:39,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelawnradio.com, and DarkSakura puts on the rubber gloves and dives in headfirst into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite emails to read for you folks.

198
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't you, DarkSakura?

199
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:41,751
[SPEAKER_06]: When I'm ready.

200
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:56,620
[SPEAKER_06]: The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.

201
00:17:57,741 --> 00:18:00,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

202
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:02,565
[SPEAKER_06]: This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.

203
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:04,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that name.

204
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:11,193
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.

205
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,896
[SPEAKER_06]: A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing...

206
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:41,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's about pre-ordering Halo 3 The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game Here's where the bullshit begins He said that the regular edition was just the game The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons The assault rifle 2 and the spike shot Have the first two games on the second disc come with the making of DVD Every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc Yeah, right

207
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,043
[SPEAKER_06]: and have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.

208
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:55,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie would include something like that, etc.

209
00:18:55,468 --> 00:19:03,311
[SPEAKER_06]: My classmate leaves, I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, Sir, I read the article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.

210
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:07,253
[SPEAKER_06]: He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie so you should read it more carefully next time.

211
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Needless to say, I now go to the other game shop in town.

212
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,862
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that.

213
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And when I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far.

214
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it got to the helmet thing.

215
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, wait a minute.

216
00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:20,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

217
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,011
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't wear the helmet, stupid.

218
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:23,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless his head's really tiny.

219
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:24,294
[SPEAKER_11]: He has a tiny head.

220
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,401
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

221
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,091
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't know who I am.

222
00:19:44,471 --> 00:19:51,875
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies.

223
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:56,897
[SPEAKER_10]: But they assume things about me because I'm older and I play games.

224
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,718
[SPEAKER_10]: They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.

225
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of sick of that attitude.

226
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going into game stores to get told what games or that I should be buying the guidebook because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.

227
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That only worked when Dan was a manager.

228
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:12,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Well,

229
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,159
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

230
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,564
[SPEAKER_10]: and, um, they, the guy treated me like I was royalty.

231
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:43,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition stuff.

232
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,872
[SPEAKER_10]: And instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I was like, okay, I can do that for you.

233
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,935
[SPEAKER_10]: And he went and got the game, and I was like, do you have Luminous 2?

234
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:55,219
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy was like, um, no, not, you know, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.

235
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:56,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me make a call.

236
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,245
[SPEAKER_10]: And he called another store, he was gonna have it shipped ordered, and he's like, I won't even charge you a pre-order because the game already came out.

237
00:21:01,545 --> 00:21:02,706
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

238
00:21:19,531 --> 00:21:20,151
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:49,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't treat your customers like dirt, because you never know who you're pissing off, you know, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.

240
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:51,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask which store you went to?

241
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one in particular?

242
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:02,763
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's... Oh, that's not the one then.

243
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:03,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

244
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

245
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:07,445
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one that your hubby used to work at years ago.

246
00:22:07,565 --> 00:22:10,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I know who the manager of that store is.

247
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:10,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care anymore.

248
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:11,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

249
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lost cause now.

250
00:22:12,952 --> 00:22:14,134
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I mean the GameCrazy.

251
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:21,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the GameCrazy I went to was in the... Okay.

252
00:22:23,627 --> 00:22:23,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

253
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:24,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

254
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:25,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

255
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:27,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually know about four managers of Game Crazies, too.

256
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:29,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he's a nice guy.

257
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:29,694
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a nice guy.

258
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:33,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my experience with... SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.

259
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:35,642
[SPEAKER_10]: He was not hitting on me, you jackass.

260
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:38,926
[SPEAKER_11]: My experience with the Game Stops, you know, usually it's...

261
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:41,228
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

262
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, the next one comes from Jason.

263
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,651
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.

264
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against the Xbox in general.

265
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you tell me if this is true?

266
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:34,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?

267
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show.

268
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:37,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I never miss it.

269
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:37,969
[SPEAKER_11]: and DarkSakura.com

270
00:23:49,402 --> 00:24:02,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Way later on, once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.

271
00:24:02,993 --> 00:24:07,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Doesn't HDMI, though, give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your regular eyes?

272
00:24:08,058 --> 00:24:10,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Unless you have, like, Borg vision or something.

273
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,661
[SPEAKER_11]: HDMI is basically, it's like kind of...

274
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:15,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

275
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:40,381
[SPEAKER_11]: In a way, you can be able to do it, and maybe later on down the line, that might be an issue, but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line, they're going to release some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.

276
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was the emailer that just sent that in?

277
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,002
[SPEAKER_10]: What was their name?

278
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:45,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason.

279
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:45,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason.

280
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:55,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here and bring your friend into the room, and we're going to give a special message to your friend right here.

281
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:56,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so stop right here.

282
00:24:57,308 --> 00:24:57,528
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

283
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:02,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi Jason's friend, this is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you, you're wrong.

284
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:03,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Hugs and kisses.

285
00:25:04,298 --> 00:25:04,639
[SPEAKER_10]: We love ya.

286
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:10,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments, and I wanted to read them.

287
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:17,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.

288
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:21,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their jobs.

289
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:23,349
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just don't want to carry on a stupid conversation with them.

290
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,689
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate talking to people.

291
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:25,870
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a whole different story.

292
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,490
[SPEAKER_11]: I will pretend to be better than them.

293
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:27,811
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

294
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:29,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki's just an asshole, is what it is.

295
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,032
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that he thinks he's better than you.

296
00:25:31,052 --> 00:25:31,632
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just a dick.

297
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:32,712
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

298
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:51,445
[SPEAKER_11]: at my work, so I understand.

299
00:25:51,746 --> 00:25:53,066
[SPEAKER_10]: One more comment, I promise, Jamie.

300
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:55,527
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is from Brad from PodCulture, and he's cool.

301
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:56,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Brad.

302
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,428
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a comment from him.

303
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:01,849
[SPEAKER_10]: But he was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Phantasy Star Universe.

304
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:05,390
[SPEAKER_10]: They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.

305
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,711
[SPEAKER_10]: He's 36, he admits.

306
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:09,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Their first comment was, this is for your kid?

307
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:14,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Dot, dot, dot.

308
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:18,535
[SPEAKER_11]: They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee content in it.

309
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:22,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I gotta sell it on eBay.

310
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:25,296
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what happens when you assume, you make an asset out of you and me.

311
00:26:26,277 --> 00:26:29,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this next email comes from TheAfroGuy.

312
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, OLR, I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.

313
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:43,890
[SPEAKER_06]: My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully, um, Canis Canem ate it, because I think he's emailing from overseas.

314
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:51,012
[SPEAKER_06]: He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really does feel like a living, breathing school.

315
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:56,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for hours on Grand Theft Auto.

316
00:26:57,253 --> 00:27:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.

317
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:08,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw him on the ground, and spit on him.

318
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:10,696
[SPEAKER_06]: His reaction was, oh, never done that before.

319
00:27:11,417 --> 00:27:15,339
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.

320
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,722
[SPEAKER_06]: What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.

321
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:22,103
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was in quotes, by the way.

322
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:28,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly a shock to our parents.

323
00:27:28,986 --> 00:27:33,649
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of harmless teasing.

324
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:35,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a footnote on here.

325
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,451
[SPEAKER_06]: I love emails with footnotes.

326
00:27:37,878 --> 00:27:44,880
[SPEAKER_06]: said, if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.

327
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,742
[SPEAKER_06]: To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame, and soon it will be on its way to a pre-owned rack in-game.

328
00:27:54,382 --> 00:28:05,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place in a school, and those acting violently are around his age.

329
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:06,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, Rockstar should...

330
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:12,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't interest young teenagers.

331
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play bully, but perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.

332
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the showing.

333
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:22,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep up the good work, the Afro guy.

334
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:32,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework, my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know what she was doing.

335
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:36,310
[SPEAKER_10]: She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games so I had to do my own work.

336
00:28:37,171 --> 00:28:39,692
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.

337
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:52,376
[SPEAKER_10]: If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting and it sounds a little bit vague, sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.

338
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:53,477
[SPEAKER_10]: He needs to be punished.

339
00:28:53,837 --> 00:28:55,318
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to say that if

340
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:06,239
[SPEAKER_06]: If it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.

341
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:17,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial evidence that it would be, then removing the game, it's smart, I think.

342
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:20,427
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

343
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,521
[SPEAKER_10]: is this game appropriate for my child?

344
00:29:39,721 --> 00:29:47,724
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from nonfiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.

345
00:29:48,024 --> 00:29:51,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.

346
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,986
[SPEAKER_10]: For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.

347
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:56,887
[SPEAKER_10]: It just depends on the child.

348
00:29:57,287 --> 00:29:59,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I can also understand that for at least...

349
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: People of a like age in that game Because it's one thing for a kid I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference In a kid playing Grand Theft Auto Because technically they're not adults It's something that they know they have no real way of doing

350
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:22,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But a kid can go into school and basically be a bully.

351
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:26,660
[SPEAKER_10]: FloWalk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking about, but I like this.

352
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,661
[SPEAKER_10]: I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.

353
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I made the kid eat grass.

354
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:35,063
[SPEAKER_10]: But his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high heel, that bitch.

355
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,024
[SPEAKER_10]: You got your ass kicked by a girl.

356
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in two fights in school, honestly.

357
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've had like...

358
00:30:42,782 --> 00:30:45,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me.

359
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:49,047
[SPEAKER_06]: One time there was this guy, he was the school bully.

360
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:58,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.

361
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:06,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks after school once, but I just didn't go.

362
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,562
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, what are they going to do?

363
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:10,357
[SPEAKER_10]: CallMeNames.

364
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:13,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.

365
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:14,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just didn't go.

366
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:21,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.

367
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:25,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I just, I can't stand that type of thing.

368
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:29,184
[SPEAKER_06]: The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and punched her in the nose.

369
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.

370
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:33,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Make it quick.

371
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:34,406
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to get back to the game.

372
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:35,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, her name was Myra.

373
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're listening, you deserved it.

374
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:43,755
[SPEAKER_06]: She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.

375
00:31:43,915 --> 00:31:46,876
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.

376
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:50,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasn't Myra the chick in Tiny Toons that was like, I'm gonna love it, it's squeezing?

377
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:51,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, my bad.

378
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:57,822
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.

379
00:31:57,922 --> 00:32:00,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my journal and a couple other books.

380
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:06,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And she even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her, and she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.

381
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,307
[SPEAKER_10]: But did you learn that from River City Ransom?

382
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:11,234
[SPEAKER_06]: River City Ransom

383
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:42,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter.

384
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:44,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.

385
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:46,036
[SPEAKER_10]: The last email comes from John D.,

386
00:32:51,252 --> 00:32:55,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey guys, well yes, this is my first email to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.

387
00:32:56,313 --> 00:33:01,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting in that I was actually really good.

388
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:04,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I was playing the 8 plus star songs which made me laugh.

389
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:09,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters in Super Smash Bros.

390
00:33:09,577 --> 00:33:13,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?

391
00:33:13,318 --> 00:33:17,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.

392
00:33:20,851 --> 00:33:37,476
[SPEAKER_10]: with all due respect to the listener we're glad we got a new listener in a first email I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month but I'm going to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener so welcome to the show and I don't mean to tease you we do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers I

393
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:46,053
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it does make a good fit.

394
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:46,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't gur at me, Drew Nami.

395
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:47,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That was already in Air Guys.

396
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Bros.

397
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:54,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Other characters I want to see, I definitely want to see Tom Nook.

398
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:56,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see Tom Nook.

399
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom Nook is a bastard.

400
00:33:59,675 --> 00:34:00,616
[SPEAKER_10]: He'll take all my money.

401
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:01,576
[SPEAKER_10]: That'll be a special move.

402
00:34:01,876 --> 00:34:03,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I want... Do you have somebody?

403
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Little Mac.

404
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that'd be cool.

405
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:11,830
[SPEAKER_11]: I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rain Man.

406
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:14,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, interesting speculation.

407
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:18,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.

408
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:25,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic, which, you know, Sega and, you know, the GameCube were just, like, best buddies.

409
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:27,747
[SPEAKER_11]: So, of course, makes perfect sense.

410
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:29,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And also to that listener...

411
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:38,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Download some Parapara videos off of YouTube and type Parapara Girls into YouTube or whatever it is, Parapara Deluxe or Velfair or whatever.

412
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:43,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Parapara Paras.

413
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:47,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it.

414
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,510
[SPEAKER_10]: That's random.

415
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:54,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.

416
00:34:55,374 --> 00:34:55,614
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

417
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:57,977
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the last email, yes?

418
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,598
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the last email.

419
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:04,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can do that anytime you want.

420
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:04,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Just send us an email.

421
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:07,625
[SPEAKER_10]: It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

422
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:08,926
[SPEAKER_10]: We look forward to hearing from you.

423
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:14,270
[SPEAKER_10]: We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.

424
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,393
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

425
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:21,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for you guys.

426
00:35:22,397 --> 00:35:23,838
[SPEAKER_10]: And last week we asked...

427
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:26,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3?

428
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be camping out for any of them?

429
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what are you going to be doing?

430
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:35,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And we got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now.

431
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:37,024
[SPEAKER_10]: One of our voicemails of the week here.

432
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:39,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey guys, it's DJ Tyrant.

433
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:42,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Just calling in about the voicemail of the week.

434
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.

435
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:50,691
[SPEAKER_15]: I pre-ordered it at the electronics boutique that I work at.

436
00:35:51,685 --> 00:36:09,776
[SPEAKER_15]: and I also got a gift card for Best Buy for my birthday so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up my system and Zelda and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.

437
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:12,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Calling in for a quick question.

438
00:36:14,658 --> 00:36:20,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Wondering what other launch titles I should pick up besides Zelda.

439
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:21,854
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Rebuttal

440
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I say Red Steel all the way.

441
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:18,366
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:37:45,774 --> 00:37:46,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it maybe crappy?

443
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:47,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you think it's crappy.

444
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,357
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in the minority of folks there.

445
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:51,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Send us a voicemail.

446
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:52,780
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.

447
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,462
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.

448
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:57,523
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, we get confused.

449
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, back to the story.

450
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,827
[SPEAKER_10]: The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?

451
00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.

452
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:12,055
[SPEAKER_10]: They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line Stand.

453
00:38:12,635 --> 00:38:13,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And some quotes here.

454
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:15,647
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

455
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:33,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Bullet point, there's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.

456
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting it.

457
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:43,504
[SPEAKER_10]: You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you, know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.

458
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:46,988
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.

459
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:50,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.

460
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:58,691
[SPEAKER_10]: Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring something to make your $600 less conspicuous?

461
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:05,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags, but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous.

462
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:11,694
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe you want to bring something to hide it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000 for that, da-da-da-da-da-da.

463
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:15,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun camping in the lines.

464
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:17,914
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.

465
00:39:19,254 --> 00:39:21,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Drunami says wear deodorant.

466
00:39:21,395 --> 00:39:21,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Good idea.

467
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:23,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring extra.

468
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Just bring extras for others.

469
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:26,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.

470
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:27,918
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

471
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:42,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, you know, better known for ruining E3.

472
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:42,244
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um,

473
00:39:44,557 --> 00:39:45,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they games?

474
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:45,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

475
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:18,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?

476
00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:19,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

477
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:21,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they then video games?

478
00:40:22,313 --> 00:40:23,833
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's not a bad title.

479
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:25,934
[SPEAKER_10]: What's there to not understand?

480
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:37,316
[SPEAKER_11]: He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products were categorized as something more serious than a game.

481
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:40,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Because entertainment is a serious business!

482
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:41,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

483
00:40:43,103 --> 00:40:47,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying, how about shut the fuck up?

484
00:40:52,689 --> 00:40:59,834
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if we called, like, that, I mean, that's kind of retarded, because if you think about it, okay, say we called them interactive entertainment or something like that.

485
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:08,680
[SPEAKER_11]: So, say, for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided to call rape candy, would, I mean, would...

486
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, well, you know, candy's good.

487
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:14,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I like candy.

488
00:41:14,663 --> 00:41:15,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, crap.

489
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:17,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't like rape.

490
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:19,148
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confused.

491
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:21,270
[SPEAKER_10]: I like candy only when they say yes.

492
00:41:23,572 --> 00:41:24,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy is delicious.

493
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:27,795
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're smoothies.

494
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Hadn't played the game.

495
00:41:56,768 --> 00:42:00,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game.

496
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:04,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Or, like, you know, claim to have played it online, despite the fact that's impossible.

497
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:12,320
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that no matter what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people.

498
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And it doesn't matter how you dress up turd, it's still a turd.

499
00:42:17,944 --> 00:42:19,185
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's basically it.

500
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:20,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

501
00:42:20,866 --> 00:42:21,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

502
00:42:24,429 --> 00:42:24,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

503
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:29,111
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.

504
00:42:30,593 --> 00:42:32,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?

505
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.

506
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:41,442
[SPEAKER_06]: A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo... Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?

507
00:42:43,763 --> 00:42:44,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy is delicious.

508
00:42:47,006 --> 00:42:49,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway... Wow, we're gonna get emails on this, I already know.

509
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:53,011
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay, okay, I have to tell you, there is an in-joke about candy.

510
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,351
[SPEAKER_06]: in one of my circles.

511
00:42:58,813 --> 00:43:13,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, a 31 year old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or Alive was basically sexually harassing her.

512
00:43:15,063 --> 00:43:20,787
[SPEAKER_06]: The compensation she is looking for Rob

513
00:43:24,497 --> 00:43:28,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million... Rob, what the hell?

514
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:31,439
[SPEAKER_10]: It's candy, get it?

515
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,020
[SPEAKER_06]: This candy is not so delicious.

516
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:38,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843.

517
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:49,033
[SPEAKER_06]: said that he started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.

518
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become.

519
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,215
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's basically saying that she wanted it.

520
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:06,558
[SPEAKER_06]: But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to it.

521
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:15,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Tiara's sitting over in the corner going, I want candy.

522
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:19,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.

523
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop laughing!

524
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not laughing!

525
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,661
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a serious matter!

526
00:44:26,942 --> 00:44:38,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was sexual harassment related to the man who created DOA, I still like the bouncing...

527
00:44:39,062 --> 00:44:42,525
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bounciness, because it's like completely against the laws of physics.

528
00:44:42,926 --> 00:44:45,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.

529
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:49,051
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, hey baby, you want to model for my next big game?

530
00:44:50,152 --> 00:44:53,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Knight in our chatroom says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.

531
00:44:55,377 --> 00:44:56,298
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a political joke.

532
00:44:56,639 --> 00:44:57,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that one.

533
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Harr.

534
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:01,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is no joke.

535
00:45:01,856 --> 00:45:05,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.

536
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:08,941
[SPEAKER_10]: It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.

537
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not quite that level.

538
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:14,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.

539
00:45:15,065 --> 00:45:18,508
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?

540
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:23,091
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been an ad that ran in... what was this?

541
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:23,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War.

542
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:25,453
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, it was in Gears of War.

543
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:27,094
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a little ad in there, and it said...

544
00:45:27,918 --> 00:45:46,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer demo Which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace soon Kind of cool So for those folks that are anticipating that game And I gotta say, I played the first demo And I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?

545
00:45:46,803 --> 00:45:54,285
[SPEAKER_11]: This is boring I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't into it at all It's a pretty game, and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish

546
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:56,582
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.

547
00:45:58,162 --> 00:46:01,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo-goo-ga-ga over that game.

548
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Lost Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.

549
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:04,765
[SPEAKER_11]: It's exactly Gears of War.

550
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:10,828
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.

551
00:46:11,128 --> 00:46:13,209
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.

552
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:18,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War.

553
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:20,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like Prey is Gears of War.

554
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:23,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Except, no, that's a first-person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.

555
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:24,414
[SPEAKER_10]: But, like,

556
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:26,486
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't die in Prey.

557
00:46:55,888 --> 00:47:02,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.

558
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:07,270
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, seeing them as almost like degenerates or scum of the earth.

559
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,131
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, that's pretty cool.

560
00:47:10,491 --> 00:47:14,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, you know, who have been behind this for a while now.

561
00:47:14,971 --> 00:47:20,292
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.

562
00:47:20,392 --> 00:47:23,833
[SPEAKER_11]: So pretty cool and definitely a good cost.

563
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:35,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you want to know more information about that, visit PennyArcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org Did they take systems as well as financial donation?

564
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:36,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Like actual game games?

565
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:38,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I know where you're going with this.

566
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:45,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity.

567
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe some money as well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.

568
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:49,368
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

569
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:50,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not so hot right now.

570
00:47:50,388 --> 00:47:52,389
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I have some extra money, I support this charity.

571
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,500
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

572
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:25,965
[SPEAKER_10]: You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDR Oha Style.

573
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what this song's called?

574
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Candy.

575
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Candy is delicious.

576
00:48:37,073 --> 00:48:43,117
[SPEAKER_06]: My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do this one last week and I forgot the address.

577
00:48:43,897 --> 00:48:44,037
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

578
00:48:45,109 --> 00:49:04,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass, people running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships.

579
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:14,249
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even volunteer to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org Very, very, very cool site.

580
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Bookmark it for next year.

581
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:16,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

582
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,132
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still also look at it regularly, though, for updates.

583
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,014
[SPEAKER_10]: You just have that in one window and game politics in the other?

584
00:49:25,054 --> 00:49:25,434
[SPEAKER_10]: You're set.

585
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:27,935
[SPEAKER_10]: You're politically of sound mind.

586
00:49:29,496 --> 00:49:35,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your favorite gaming companies.

587
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:39,340
[SPEAKER_10]: A quote came from the ESA this week.

588
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,861
[SPEAKER_10]: The ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.

589
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:59,931
[SPEAKER_10]: his organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for generating a list of invitees the point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings that is not for the ESA to say or influence interesting

590
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:07,281
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.

591
00:50:07,762 --> 00:50:11,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they still wanting to call them invites, or is that a negative connotation towards gamers?

592
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:13,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Do they want to call them something else?

593
00:50:13,786 --> 00:50:14,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea.

594
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:19,851
[SPEAKER_10]: All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.

595
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:27,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.

596
00:50:27,637 --> 00:50:28,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

597
00:50:28,177 --> 00:50:28,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

598
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,816
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to talk to us, bastards.

599
00:50:32,356 --> 00:50:34,718
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you have that attitude, who would?

600
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:41,721
[SPEAKER_11]: So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3.

601
00:50:42,181 --> 00:50:46,343
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to be taking place in October 07.

602
00:50:47,284 --> 00:50:52,367
[SPEAKER_11]: And they want you to name it because they don't have a name.

603
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:54,908
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have a contest.

604
00:50:55,461 --> 00:51:23,492
[SPEAKER_11]: basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance to name the expo and if you win you will win a prize package including a round trip airfare for two hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo contest ends though on Monday November 20th I got a name

605
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:25,605
[SPEAKER_10]: How about Gamer Expo?

606
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:33,147
[SPEAKER_10]: How about... How about Big LA Game Place?

607
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:34,688
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Thingy?

608
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,488
[SPEAKER_10]: How about GamePro Expo?

609
00:51:36,848 --> 00:51:38,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, just give it a name.

610
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:40,389
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't have to be that snazzy.

611
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:42,789
[SPEAKER_06]: How about... Hey, this is an E3!

612
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,490
[SPEAKER_10]: How about... Boobs and Games?

613
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:49,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

614
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,023
[SPEAKER_10]: What'd you say, Drew?

615
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:56,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't be a bitch to say in a cutscene, per se.

616
00:51:56,866 --> 00:51:57,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I should.

617
00:51:57,146 --> 00:51:58,447
[SPEAKER_06]: That's his tiara today.

618
00:51:58,627 --> 00:51:59,288
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

619
00:52:00,629 --> 00:52:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have time to smoke a bowl!

620
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:02,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

621
00:52:04,912 --> 00:52:07,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?

622
00:52:10,156 --> 00:52:10,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

623
00:52:11,177 --> 00:52:13,439
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.

624
00:52:13,459 --> 00:52:16,742
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Miklatov playing with Power Ranger toys.

625
00:52:17,582 --> 00:52:18,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And a Santa hat.

626
00:52:18,783 --> 00:52:19,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that Magic Ranger?

627
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:20,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It's his...

628
00:52:25,135 --> 00:52:30,157
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkTetsuya says call it G3, GamePro Gamers Gathering, G3!

629
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:35,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, hey, I'm trying to do a short here.

630
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:44,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal,

631
00:52:44,864 --> 00:52:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: has been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California for embezzlement and drunken driving.

632
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:58,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.

633
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:02,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Big, expensive car.

634
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:05,460
[SPEAKER_10]: He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.

635
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:07,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked the Gizmondo.

636
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:09,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked that Johnny Whatever game.

637
00:53:10,224 --> 00:53:11,305
[SPEAKER_10]: One game.

638
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:12,206
[SPEAKER_10]: It had one...

639
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Stinkin' game that was kinda neat.

640
00:53:16,862 --> 00:53:20,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, he, um... I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.

641
00:53:21,505 --> 00:53:28,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, he, um... Basically, it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.

642
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:33,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So, he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.

643
00:53:35,113 --> 00:53:37,455
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Drew Nami, the people behind the N-Gage need to go to the chair.

644
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:40,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

645
00:53:40,157 --> 00:53:42,158
[SPEAKER_06]: He was trying to basically get out of going to jail.

646
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So... However, he's still in jail.

647
00:53:46,193 --> 00:53:47,794
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be deported.

648
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,539
[SPEAKER_06]: They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and restitution to the banks involved.

649
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, basically, there is no more Gizmondo.

650
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?

651
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:04,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

652
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:05,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope not.

653
00:54:05,866 --> 00:54:10,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think, I just think he, uh, I'm just like, think that he deserves it.

654
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:11,430
So...

655
00:54:16,221 --> 00:54:35,438
[SPEAKER_06]: N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo N-Gage 2 Electric Boogaloo Fuck, I'd buy one just for that name Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our geekier fans is that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game

656
00:54:36,075 --> 00:54:38,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be out with the next film June 2007.

657
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:49,087
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes me very happy because I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.

658
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:51,410
[SPEAKER_10]: They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?

659
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:52,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It has Silver Surfer!

660
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:53,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really.

661
00:54:53,952 --> 00:54:55,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means it might have Galactus.

662
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:56,414
[SPEAKER_10]: The search for more losses.

663
00:54:57,475 --> 00:54:59,938
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'll say the guy that played the torch guy?

664
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:01,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Smokin'.

665
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:06,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?

666
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,416
[SPEAKER_10]: You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity clause.

667
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:10,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay, okay.

668
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.

669
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then dye her hair.

670
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.

671
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:25,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Just more human torch guy, please.

672
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:26,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'll go see the movie.

673
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:30,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, yeah, thank you.

674
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:31,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And right on cue, the chat room goes,

675
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:33,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Flame on, Sky!

676
00:55:33,521 --> 00:55:34,142

00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:27,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

701
00:56:27,478 --> 00:56:34,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast system previously.

702
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:41,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.

703
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:45,730
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, that is our podcast listeners no good.

704
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:48,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?

705
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't really have it on hand.

706
00:56:51,172 --> 00:56:53,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just going to post it in there.

707
00:56:54,393 --> 00:56:56,534
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, well, what's in this article?

708
00:56:57,575 --> 00:57:07,038
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, what happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console out there.

709
00:57:07,098 --> 00:57:08,739
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't want to leave the market.

710
00:57:09,452 --> 00:57:10,993
[SPEAKER_12]: with the Saturn Stink.

711
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:15,114
[SPEAKER_12]: They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.

712
00:57:15,174 --> 00:57:16,355
[SPEAKER_12]: The Saturn Stink.

713
00:57:16,375 --> 00:57:18,996
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that term.

714
00:57:19,016 --> 00:57:22,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking great offense to that because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.

715
00:57:22,377 --> 00:57:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well because Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities for every employee that worked there and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM card out here or all the good games.

716
00:57:37,063 --> 00:57:38,144
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to leave those in Japan.

717
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Sega Stink Michael Moore He was in Sega

718
00:58:02,757 --> 00:58:05,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.

719
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:05,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter Moore.

720
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.

721
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:08,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Moore does films.

722
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:11,284
[SPEAKER_10]: He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?

723
00:58:11,644 --> 00:58:14,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Big guy with the beard harasses congressmen on the street.

724
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:14,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

725
00:58:14,827 --> 00:58:15,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Peter Moore.

726
00:58:16,408 --> 00:58:28,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference where he came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay, let's get it out of the way.

727
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:30,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.

728
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

729
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:31,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

730
00:58:34,403 --> 00:58:35,463
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other comparisons.

731
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:37,505
[SPEAKER_10]: I see, so Peter Moore is the comparison here.

732
00:58:38,345 --> 00:58:42,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up.

733
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:49,192
[SPEAKER_12]: Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.

734
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:51,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Sega did not have a lot of money.

735
00:58:51,393 --> 00:58:54,455
[SPEAKER_12]: The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.

736
00:58:56,316 --> 00:59:00,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.

737
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:03,149
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll call it Gizmondo 2.

738
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:05,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Electric Boogaloo.

739
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.

740
00:59:09,153 --> 00:59:09,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good night, alright?

741
00:59:10,154 --> 00:59:10,714
[SPEAKER_10]: You too, bye.

742
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:10,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

743
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:13,956
[SPEAKER_10]: Michael Moore, head of Microsoft.

744
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:15,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

745
00:59:15,937 --> 00:59:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

746
00:59:17,518 --> 00:59:19,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it's Nintendo Maniac 64.

747
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't called in a while.

748
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:21,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Nintendo Maniac 64.

749
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:22,842
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind, buddy?

750
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:26,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, first off, I gotta know, does my quality suck?

751
00:59:27,714 --> 00:59:28,234
[SPEAKER_10]: You're okay.

752
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:30,655
[SPEAKER_10]: You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.

753
00:59:30,715 --> 00:59:32,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.

754
00:59:34,095 --> 00:59:35,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

755
00:59:35,556 --> 00:59:40,617
[SPEAKER_14]: First off... I forgot what I was going to say.

756
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:42,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, it's something completely different.

757
00:59:43,378 --> 00:59:48,359
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, what was it, last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was kind of odd.

758
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,959
[SPEAKER_14]: There's one I've been following.

759
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,900
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually a fan game.

760
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,320
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually...

761
00:59:55,117 --> 00:59:55,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

762
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:18,585
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate mobile games, right?

763
01:00:18,725 --> 01:00:20,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they all are poopy.

764
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:24,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.

765
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:31,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic formula of Luminous.

766
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:38,074
[SPEAKER_10]: For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors, and then sometimes the shapes are different.

767
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:40,375
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.

768
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:40,955
[SPEAKER_10]: It made it kind of...

769
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:42,916
[SPEAKER_10]: feel a little bit refreshing and different.

770
01:00:43,236 --> 01:00:46,618
[SPEAKER_10]: And for cell phone, Java-type game, it actually wasn't bad.

771
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:47,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I was kind of impressed.

772
01:00:49,919 --> 01:00:51,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.

773
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:51,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

774
01:00:53,601 --> 01:00:55,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure Zelda on the phone would be cool, too.

775
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, is it out?

776
01:00:56,883 --> 01:00:57,483
[SPEAKER_10]: When can we get it?

777
01:00:57,783 --> 01:01:00,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's actually a second demo.

778
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:09,989
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made for him a hangout at, oddly enough, it's called Zelda Fan Game Central, so this, gc.com.

779
01:01:10,751 --> 01:01:11,932
[SPEAKER_14]: I posted a link in chat already.

780
01:01:13,873 --> 01:01:15,493
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to take a look at it.

781
01:01:16,074 --> 01:01:16,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, second off,

782
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:42,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Halloween was last week and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.

783
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,601
[SPEAKER_14]: It is gaming related.

784
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:46,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?

785
01:01:47,944 --> 01:01:48,224
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

786
01:01:48,344 --> 01:01:49,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what did you dress up as?

787
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:49,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell us.

788
01:01:50,346 --> 01:01:51,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

789
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:53,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm putting the links in chat.

790
01:01:54,869 --> 01:01:55,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, there they are.

791
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let me bring it up.

792
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,993
[SPEAKER_10]: This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.

793
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:03,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Might I remind you here.

794
01:02:04,196 --> 01:02:06,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, explain the costume for the podcast listeners.

795
01:02:07,879 --> 01:02:08,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

796
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:18,288
[SPEAKER_14]: My name, TimmanX64, kind of shows that I am a big Nintendo lover, and other people might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.

797
01:02:18,488 --> 01:02:19,689
[SPEAKER_14]: You probably already know this guy.

798
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,130
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

799
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:27,654
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on PlayStation.

800
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,516
[SPEAKER_14]: I went for the irony factor.

801
01:02:29,536 --> 01:02:32,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made up.

802
01:02:33,223 --> 01:02:35,124
[SPEAKER_14]: of masking tape and permanent marker.

803
01:02:35,224 --> 01:02:40,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the PlayStation hater.

804
01:02:40,386 --> 01:02:41,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a well-done logo.

805
01:02:41,287 --> 01:02:44,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you did a pretty good job.

806
01:02:44,608 --> 01:02:46,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?

807
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:48,150
[SPEAKER_10]: You went for the old-school PS logo.

808
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:52,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's the PlayStation logo.

809
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, the PlayStation logo.

810
01:02:55,513 --> 01:02:55,873
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad.

811
01:02:57,314 --> 01:02:58,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a PS3 on it.

812
01:02:59,477 --> 01:03:02,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.

813
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:04,439
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, though.

814
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:04,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good one.

815
01:03:05,019 --> 01:03:05,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for calling, all right?

816
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:07,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

817
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:07,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Later.

818
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,681
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're going to get to some more calls.

819
01:03:09,741 --> 01:03:11,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go over to this one.

820
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:13,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

821
01:03:13,382 --> 01:03:13,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

822
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:15,563
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Jason.

823
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:18,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Jason, buddy, our webmaster.

824
01:03:19,386 --> 01:03:19,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

825
01:03:19,506 --> 01:03:22,408
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard any complaints, but I like to think it's working pretty well.

826
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:26,410
[SPEAKER_10]: When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole, you know, lowered participation numbers and all this other nonsense.

827
01:03:49,722 --> 01:03:55,805
[SPEAKER_08]: and with the whole Xbox SMA Hold on a minute, buddy.

828
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, put the car apart for a minute there, buddy.

829
01:03:57,886 --> 01:04:02,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number is doing so great and the quality of his call right now is kind of crappy?

830
01:04:03,188 --> 01:04:06,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Like we're hearing a lot of breakup in there.

831
01:04:07,049 --> 01:04:07,930
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the irony factor.

832
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:08,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Jason.

833
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:10,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to tell you.

834
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:14,213
[SPEAKER_10]: So E3, yeah?

835
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,514
[SPEAKER_08]: E3 and the whole lower participation amongst independent developers

836
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:23,119
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Lorde participation in general and not just in general masses.

837
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:35,909
[SPEAKER_08]: But XNA, Xbox, Microsoft's XNA, the development suite, can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.

838
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:43,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work with the XNA?

839
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:47,740
[SPEAKER_08]: XMA is a launching point.

840
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:50,164
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go so much further beyond there.

841
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:55,011
[SPEAKER_08]: If you bring together independent developers and publishers...

842
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:57,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I really have to go further than that?

843
01:05:20,442 --> 01:05:49,447
[SPEAKER_10]: underground media a little more than any other company so I'll give them credit for that if anyone were to do this it would probably be them and the fact of how much that can help them in general in XBL in the next couple of years this whole generation is going to be a really big difference it's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out it would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof I definitely agree Jason the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality I'm so sorry we love you anyway

844
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:52,849
[SPEAKER_10]: We love you Jason, have a good one.

845
01:06:18,959 --> 01:06:20,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's DMN.

846
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,881
[SPEAKER_10]: No, really, it's Ranma.

847
01:06:22,242 --> 01:06:23,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, DMN Ranma.

848
01:06:23,183 --> 01:06:23,703
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

849
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:25,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Not much.

850
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:27,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a quick question for Loki.

851
01:06:28,627 --> 01:06:30,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if he's paying attention.

852
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:31,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, are you paying attention?

853
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:31,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

854
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:32,891
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, boobs.

855
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:34,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Boobs, Loki, boobs.

856
01:06:34,632 --> 01:06:35,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what's on your mind?

857
01:06:36,314 --> 01:06:36,794
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

858
01:06:37,534 --> 01:06:40,275
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, have you heard anything about Halo 3?

859
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:47,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a friend of mine works for GameStop, he just told me last week that Microsoft, the press release that's coming out on November 2007.

860
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard anything new since that?

861
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:52,062
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I haven't heard anything new.

862
01:06:52,102 --> 01:06:53,843
[SPEAKER_11]: We still have the date as March.

863
01:06:54,463 --> 01:06:56,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Has that press release actually come out anywhere?

864
01:06:57,565 --> 01:06:58,265
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it has not.

865
01:06:58,405 --> 01:06:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I have told my friend that.

866
01:07:00,326 --> 01:07:03,168
[SPEAKER_10]: So your friend who works at this random GameStop...

867
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:06,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens to know the inner workings at Microsoft and what they're developing.

868
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,809
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the GameStop employees?

869
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,951
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm thinking we got Exhibit A right here.

870
01:07:16,072 --> 01:07:19,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Look, Loki might be dead fucking wrong, and you might be right.

871
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:22,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Your GameStop kid might be right.

872
01:07:22,115 --> 01:07:22,636
[SPEAKER_10]: It's November 07.

873
01:07:23,556 --> 01:07:28,939
[SPEAKER_10]: But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft, and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a press release right now.

874
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:29,720
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

875
01:07:30,777 --> 01:07:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I trust Loki more than I do GameStop.

876
01:07:32,738 --> 01:07:40,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going to be in the holiday.

877
01:07:40,702 --> 01:07:42,343
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be the November title.

878
01:07:42,923 --> 01:07:44,584
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be my guess right there because...

879
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:46,521
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

880
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:12,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still saying March.

881
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Until I hear otherwise.

882
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:44,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for you.

883
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:45,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so too.

884
01:08:45,843 --> 01:08:47,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I asked him.

885
01:08:48,105 --> 01:08:49,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, DarkSakura has a question for you.

886
01:08:49,366 --> 01:08:49,606
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

887
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:50,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and finish what you were saying.

888
01:08:53,348 --> 01:08:56,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was saying to him, well, this is an actual press release.

889
01:08:56,971 --> 01:08:58,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think somebody would have leaked it by now?

890
01:08:59,032 --> 01:09:00,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had asked him for proof.

891
01:09:00,293 --> 01:09:03,435
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.

892
01:09:03,715 --> 01:09:07,978
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been checking.

893
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:08,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing about it.

894
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:10,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's just all smoke and

895
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:15,266
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

896
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:46,203
[SPEAKER_11]: November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system when we don't have a release date because it's easy to enter in when you're entering items into a database.

897
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:48,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I picked up another call.

898
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:53,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn that feedback.

899
01:09:53,745 --> 01:09:54,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, finish your thought.

900
01:09:54,545 --> 01:09:55,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't pick up another call until you're ready.

901
01:09:56,266 --> 01:09:58,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so that would be a default date.

902
01:09:58,266 --> 01:10:01,707
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.

903
01:10:04,298 --> 01:10:05,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Shadow Next Gen Halo 3 I agree with Loki

904
01:10:34,048 --> 01:10:34,388
[SPEAKER_10]: And why?

905
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:41,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that would also be when basically the quote-unquote real launch of the PlayStation 3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.

906
01:10:42,851 --> 01:10:45,352
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.

907
01:10:47,033 --> 01:10:56,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said it, or somebody was rumored that Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.

908
01:10:57,377 --> 01:10:58,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, exactly.

909
01:10:58,317 --> 01:10:59,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Took the words right out of my mouth.

910
01:11:00,358 --> 01:11:03,199
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be when it is.

911
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:11,942
[SPEAKER_10]: So in a way, maybe that kind of happens, where maybe it goes up against the Euro launch, or as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.

912
01:11:11,982 --> 01:11:13,923
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kind of an interesting perspective.

913
01:11:16,084 --> 01:11:21,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo, and it sucked.

914
01:11:23,506 --> 01:11:24,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you play Johnny Whatever?

915
01:11:25,607 --> 01:11:27,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get to play anything, because they were all broken.

916
01:11:29,093 --> 01:11:34,578
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had a bunch on display and nothing.

917
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:36,940
[SPEAKER_00]: What, Drew Nami?

918
01:11:38,021 --> 01:11:39,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you wash your hands after touching them?

919
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:43,165
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

920
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:46,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.

921
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:52,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those controllers.

922
01:11:53,073 --> 01:11:53,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry.

923
01:11:54,934 --> 01:11:56,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii

924
01:11:57,475 --> 01:11:58,576
[SPEAKER_13]: My GameStop had a key off.

925
01:11:58,956 --> 01:11:59,876
[SPEAKER_10]: And what did you think of the Wii?

926
01:12:00,977 --> 01:12:03,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And I thought it was very awesome.

927
01:12:03,378 --> 01:12:04,239
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very awesome.

928
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:04,999
[SPEAKER_10]: What games did you play?

929
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:13,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the Photo Channel and the Mii Channel, things like that.

930
01:12:14,304 --> 01:12:18,146
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I had some friends get... One of my friends posted on LiveJournal about this.

931
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:21,507
[SPEAKER_10]: They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.

932
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:23,588
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you stupids.

933
01:12:23,628 --> 01:12:23,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

934
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:29,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently the guy came up behind him and was like, you can't do that, you know, that whole thing.

935
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:31,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, you guys are hella dumb.

936
01:12:32,021 --> 01:12:32,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

937
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:38,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.

938
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:39,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, where are you going to go camp out at?

939
01:12:41,125 --> 01:12:41,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Nowhere.

940
01:12:41,485 --> 01:12:42,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a pre-order at GameStop.

941
01:12:43,266 --> 01:12:43,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, look at you go.

942
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, congratulations.

943
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:46,828
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?

944
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.

945
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:51,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

946
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,451
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, until then, have a good week.

947
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your call.

948
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:53,571
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, buddy?

949
01:12:54,452 --> 01:12:54,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thanks.

950
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:55,412
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

951
01:12:55,452 --> 01:12:56,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck with the Wii.

952
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:56,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun.

953
01:12:57,625 --> 01:13:00,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'm going to try this caller again.

954
01:13:01,266 --> 01:13:02,627
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.

955
01:13:02,707 --> 01:13:03,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

956
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:06,789
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Did You Lose a Sock.

957
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Did You Lose a Sock.

958
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:10,250
[SPEAKER_10]: We're getting a little feedback.

959
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:13,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that better?

960
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,512
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit, yes.

961
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:17,133
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?

962
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a better game?

963
01:13:19,273 --> 01:13:21,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Fears of Wars or Viva Pinata?

964
01:13:23,135 --> 01:13:25,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't say because I haven't played Viva Pinata.

965
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:30,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?

966
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:37,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't even hear that.

967
01:13:37,172 --> 01:13:41,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I think Viva Pinata promotes violence against... Sorry, did you lose the sock?

968
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:43,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't deal with the feedback going on right now.

969
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:49,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Viva Pinata promotes violence against animals?

970
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:50,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it promotes gay bashing.

971
01:13:50,903 --> 01:13:53,545
[SPEAKER_10]: It promotes violence against flamboyant animals.

972
01:13:55,086 --> 01:13:55,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not cool.

973
01:13:56,417 --> 01:14:00,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to write to GLAAD, tell them to ban Viva Pinata.

974
01:14:00,659 --> 01:14:01,239
[SPEAKER_10]: One more call.

975
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:03,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

976
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:06,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.

977
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:08,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Paradox Vincent, what's on your mind?

978
01:14:10,443 --> 01:14:22,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just thinking, a while ago I was watching this thing, and it was somebody at Microsoft, I want to say Peter Moore.

979
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:25,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah?

980
01:14:27,686 --> 01:14:30,067
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been the most competitive cycle yet.

981
01:14:30,087 --> 01:14:30,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you...

982
01:14:55,791 --> 01:14:59,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?

983
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:07,580
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony.

984
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:09,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want to attack Nintendo.

985
01:15:09,921 --> 01:15:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

986
01:15:14,184 --> 01:15:17,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just this cycle is so...

987
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,302
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.

988
01:15:22,622 --> 01:15:24,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember that.

989
01:15:36,593 --> 01:15:36,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

990
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:53,723
[SPEAKER_10]: In all seriousness, since this was just recently campaign season, it kind of reminds me of campaign season where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight and we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.

991
01:15:54,004 --> 01:15:58,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And then suddenly a month later, Drew Nami is running for Congress.

992
01:15:58,546 --> 01:16:02,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And did you know when he was younger, he really liked candy.

993
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:06,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Do not elect Drew Nami.

994
01:16:06,892 --> 01:16:08,833
[SPEAKER_10]: paid for by Rob Roberts for President Campaign.

995
01:16:08,873 --> 01:16:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like, you see all those negative ads all over.

996
01:16:11,375 --> 01:16:12,876
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I don't know.

997
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:18,580
[SPEAKER_10]: They always start off like, oh, hey, yeah, it's going to be a clean fight because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.

998
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,862
[SPEAKER_10]: But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.

999
01:16:24,864 --> 01:16:25,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know what you mean.

1000
01:16:26,325 --> 01:16:26,585
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1001
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:28,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I know what I mean, too.

1002
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,548
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, no, thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent.

1003
01:16:30,568 --> 01:16:31,008
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

1004
01:16:31,028 --> 01:16:32,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to say to our listeners?

1005
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:35,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, not really.

1006
01:16:36,129 --> 01:16:37,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well have a good one.

1007
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:42,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.

1008
01:16:44,592 --> 01:16:45,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.

1009
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:47,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, have fun with your Wii.

1010
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:48,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1011
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:53,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight.

1012
01:16:53,534 --> 01:16:54,215
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

1013
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:59,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.

1014
01:16:59,776 --> 01:17:01,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?

1015
01:17:03,522 --> 01:17:15,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan-made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool, but it is fan-made, so just so that nobody freaks out.

1016
01:17:16,869 --> 01:17:21,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.

1017
01:17:21,351 --> 01:17:24,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.

1018
01:17:25,148 --> 01:17:30,813
[SPEAKER_00]: The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.

1019
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:33,896
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys won't have to wait for much longer.

1020
01:17:33,996 --> 01:17:35,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.

1021
01:17:36,958 --> 01:17:39,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.

1022
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:41,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Your free time's almost up.

1023
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:45,526
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.

1024
01:17:46,587 --> 01:17:51,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Start off here with Saints of Rokideen, an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.

1025
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:53,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Bros., Ice, Hockey, Soccer

1026
01:18:15,489 --> 01:18:22,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Super Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

1027
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:41,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, there was some estimates on the PlayStation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.

1028
01:18:41,799 --> 01:18:52,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3, and they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the PlayStation 3 launch.

1029
01:18:53,004 --> 01:18:53,864
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a lot of money.

1030
01:18:54,824 --> 01:18:56,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's Toad's Turnpike.

1031
01:18:56,585 --> 01:18:58,566
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.

1032
01:18:58,766 --> 01:18:59,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

1033
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:00,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways...

1034
01:19:01,994 --> 01:19:12,202
[SPEAKER_11]: You might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entis of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how that there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.

1035
01:19:12,242 --> 01:19:24,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the PlayStation 3, but in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.

1036
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,113
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all about physics.

1037
01:19:27,354 --> 01:19:28,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Did he see the same trailer I did?

1038
01:19:30,077 --> 01:19:30,617
[SPEAKER_11]: He's an idiot.

1039
01:19:31,498 --> 01:19:31,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

1040
01:19:34,014 --> 01:19:38,257
[SPEAKER_11]: There was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W.S.

1041
01:19:38,537 --> 01:19:41,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.

1042
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:42,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it looked very boring.

1043
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:45,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!

1044
01:19:47,202 --> 01:19:59,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, anyways, we know that, of course, November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Sneak King, which I'm sure... Most anticipated games of the year.

1045
01:19:59,789 --> 01:20:02,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but that's not where it stops.

1046
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:11,004
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, Kellogg's, Serial, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.

1047
01:20:11,644 --> 01:20:18,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently, you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.

1048
01:20:18,849 --> 01:20:20,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Fruit Loops the game!

1049
01:20:21,911 --> 01:20:23,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of interesting.

1050
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:30,618
[SPEAKER_11]: As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well, they have PTV for...

1051
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:33,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!

1052
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:40,665
[SPEAKER_11]: The last bit of information, of course, comes for the PlayStation 3 and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.

1053
01:20:59,545 --> 01:21:00,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Scoop King

1054
01:21:27,313 --> 01:21:28,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Poop Scoop King.

1055
01:21:31,097 --> 01:21:32,318
[SPEAKER_10]: What else can we put in the cereal?

1056
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:39,845
[SPEAKER_10]: On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar-coated cereal and end the program.

1057
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:43,468
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

1058
01:21:44,749 --> 01:21:47,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight.

1059
01:21:47,211 --> 01:21:47,932
[SPEAKER_10]: What's your final thought?

1060
01:21:49,213 --> 01:21:49,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie.

1061
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:59,917
[SPEAKER_10]: and Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun and I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.

1062
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Any final thoughts for our listeners?

1063
01:22:02,759 --> 01:22:04,281
[SPEAKER_06]: War is over, if you want it.

1064
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:06,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Aw, I like that.

1065
01:22:06,983 --> 01:22:07,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki?

1066
01:22:08,484 --> 01:22:11,306
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.

1067
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:15,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.

1068
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:18,893
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is reject False Icons.

1069
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:27,311
[SPEAKER_10]: I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.

1070
01:22:27,531 --> 01:22:28,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And a heart.

1071
01:22:29,092 --> 01:22:30,972
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my final thought is I heart you, Jamie.

1072
01:22:31,052 --> 01:22:34,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Heart, heart, heart, love, love.

1073
01:22:37,694 --> 01:22:38,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Your final thought, DarkSakura.

1074
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:45,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Rawr.

1075
01:22:46,316 --> 01:22:46,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Gwar?

1076
01:22:46,996 --> 01:22:47,576
[SPEAKER_10]: I love gwar.

1077
01:22:47,616 --> 01:22:48,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Rawr!

1078
01:22:51,838 --> 01:22:52,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, okay?

1079
01:22:53,319 --> 01:22:53,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You!

1080
01:22:54,259 --> 01:22:57,800
[SPEAKER_06]: No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Junami.

1081
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,341
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go make them in the bathroom.

1082
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:01,942
[SPEAKER_06]: He said I was holding a grudge.

1083
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:03,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show you a grudge.

1084
01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:05,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll beat you with a ferret.

1085
01:23:07,084 --> 01:23:09,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1086
01:23:10,005 --> 01:23:15,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting as always, even on strange nights like this one.

1088

1089
01:23:18,688 --> 01:23:19,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, next week,

1090
01:23:19,793 --> 01:23:21,714
[SPEAKER_10]: and Crazy System Launches.

1091
01:23:22,595 --> 01:23:27,878
[SPEAKER_10]: John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us.

1092
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:34,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their Excite Truck on.

1093
01:23:34,182 --> 01:23:41,847
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's sure to be a clusterfuck event, which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.

1094
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:44,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.

1095
01:23:44,088 --> 01:23:45,249
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll talk more about that next week.

1096
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:48,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
