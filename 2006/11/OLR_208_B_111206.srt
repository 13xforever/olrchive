5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,000
Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,520
And we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 208 for this November the 12th

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
of 2006.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,320
And for those that were listening to part A, I went outside, got some fresh air, because

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,340
it's getting kind of cold now, so I'm a little bit more calmed down, I'm not quite as hyper

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,160
as I was during the first segment.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,160
I apologize if I was a little bit punchy in the first segment.

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
But then again at the same time I don't apologize, because that's me.

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,980
Take it or leave it.

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,600
If you don't like what I have to say, there's a thousand other podcasts you can subscribe

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
to.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,920
And if you don't like what Dark Sakura has to say, mute your podcast now, because here

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,360
she goes with another story.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm just teasing.

19
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,760
Well we do have a little bit more news regarding the Playstation 3.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,840
They're going to have a universal login.

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
You'll basically be using the same online ID for every of the online games that you're

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,680
going to play.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,360
It's actually going to be not just for the titles that use your, the central buddy list

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,560
and the messaging system, it's going to go for all titles.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:35,240
Basically it's, I suppose to make it easier, more user friendly, so that you don't have

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,920
login for this, login for game, login for your mom, login for your cat.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
It's all on there.

28
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,400
But they were basically saying that, they were actually saying that specific to resistance

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,280
game coming out that is going to be using the same login.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,040
I still feel like, even with this being said, I still feel like we don't really know a lot

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
about Playstation's vision for online, which just kind of cements in my mind, I don't want

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,000
to come off sounding like a Microsoft fanboy, but, because I'm a fanboy of all three, but

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,120
I don't, Microsoft seriously has online down.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,480
They're doing it the best and it doesn't look like anybody's going to take the online throne

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,680
from them this time around.

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,800
So I don't know, it gets very little that we know about Sony's Playstation 3 and the

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
online stuff.

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,080
What I've seen so far though still makes me think that Xbox Live is going to be the superior

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,720
online.

40
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,880
As it was last generation, but I would have thought that this generation, the other two

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,620
would have been, but Nintendo's really had to play catch up and I think their friend

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,560
code thing kind of hurts them a little bit, I don't know.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,860
The friend code thing in that respect though I think sort of protects.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,440
I understand why they do it, but for the hardcore gamer it doesn't make it any easier, you know.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,440
But then again on Live you can also go through, pick and choose, and approve those you know

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
are your friends.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Right.

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
And I'm really surprised the other two systems didn't really copy achievements, although

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,760
I guess we're hearing that Excite Truck kind of has achievements, but I'm guessing it's

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,080
probably like Super Smash Brothers Trophy Room or like a lot of Nintendo games do is

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,160
that you collect a lot of crap that you can look at in your trophy room or whatever.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Yay, crap!

53
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
I love crap!

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,680
Anyway, here's another piece of crap I'm going to have to buy for my Playstation 3 when I

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,400
finally get one.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,820
There's going to be, oh I'm sorry, well we heard about the converter, right?

57
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,640
You have to convert your old school memory card into what, the USB so that you can save

58
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,960
things on the hard drive itself.

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, when you're actually playing the Playstation 2 or PS1 games on the Playstation 3, you actually

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,560
create an internal memory card on the system.

61
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,480
There's something you create in the cross media bar and there's a memory card utility

62
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,480
and then you can actually create a Playstation 1 card and a Playstation 2 card, name them

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,280
and assign whatever slot it's going to be them.

64
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,160
So it's like you're doing like you're emulating a memory card, which is kind of interesting.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,000
So that's how it's going to work on the Playstation 3 if you were curious.

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,280
And I suppose when you copy it over, you'd be copying it into one of your virtual cards.

67
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Makes sense.

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
That's pretty cool.

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,840
I didn't load my virtual hack to run games on the hard drive.

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,920
I don't know, but the internal memory card, well they'll just do some firmware update

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
if you try that crap.

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,000
The internal memory cards will have the same storage space as your typical memory cards,

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,160
15 blocks on the PS1, 8 megs on the PS2.

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,280
You can create as many of these cards as you want though until you run out of hard drive

75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
space.

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
You can just swap them in and out.

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Hmm.

78
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Interesting.

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,580
Well, some other interesting things of course are going to be the next big games coming

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,240
out for the Playstation 3.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
The ones I'm like, you know, waiting for.

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,720
For example, Motorstorm, Lair, and Heavenly Sword.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,180
Well, for example, Motorstorm, which is supposed to be a launch title, is now actually February

84
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,760
2007.

85
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,440
Lair, which is also supposed to be a launch title and delayed.

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,800
I believe that one ended up for March 2007 release.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:06,240
And then of course Heavenly Sword, which to me looked like a ripoff of God of War anyways,

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,880
is slated for a 2007 release also in March.

89
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,880
And of course their flagship title, Warhawk, is in the summer now, so that's kind of interesting.

90
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,000
But basically another reason why maybe waiting for Playstation 3 is a good idea because some

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,060
of the bigger games are coming out later on.

92
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm reading our chat room, which is available at chat.orangelaungeradio.com.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
Well over 50 people there tonight, thank you guys so much for joining us.

94
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,800
Let's see, I'm looking at, who said this here, ShadowNextGen said ExciteTruck does have achievements.

95
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,040
It may or may not, I mean, yes we've heard it does, I'm not disputing that part, but

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
we don't really know how that fits in with the rest of it.

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,920
Like you know, the cool thing about Xbox is that I can go online and see what achievements

98
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,580
my friends have and I can see what their score is, and then these other like fan-created

99
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,560
things and Xbox developer community stuff pops up like mygamercard.net, which is a very

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,300
cool site, which by the way, we have the OL Army, what do we call it, the OL Army E-Penis

101
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,600
Leaderboard or something like that, where it's tracking all our gamer scores and you're

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,900
on there and you're on there and I'm on there, and if you want to join, check out our forums

103
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,640
and put your name in the Xbox Gamer Tag thread and we'll add you to the OL Army My Gamer

104
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Card Leaderboard so you can participate in the Gamer Score Fund, but will the Wii have

105
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
anything like that?

106
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't think so because I think if it did, we would have heard about that by now.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,680
Now that's not going to break the system, it's just kind of surprising that they didn't

108
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,560
embrace the online in that way, because I think not being online kind of killed them

109
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,160
last round, but that's just my opinion I suppose, what do I know, I'm just some guy on the internet.

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Well back to different PS3 news, and actually a few people have already told me their experiences

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,320
with this, you can go to Target now and see if they have the PS3 kiosk, the game's available

112
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,200
on Motorstorm and NBA 07, but according to one of our listeners, it crashed I think every

113
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,280
what, five minutes, I believe that it was JV Mon mentioned it.

114
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,600
What was it overheating or what was it doing?

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,120
Oh, at Best Buy, sorry, it was the one that Best Buy was breaking every five minutes,

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
but there's the playable kiosks.

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,640
Well that was kind of happening at Tokyo Game Show too, but I guess it was a different environment.

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm not surprised.

119
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,040
Interesting, well as long as it doesn't do the same thing in my house, that's all I care

120
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
about.

121
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,480
Just open the back end of it and put it on a rack-mounted server, because that's apparently

122
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,520
the only way it was staying on.

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Anyways, of course like most anything else that's being released nowadays, right as it

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
comes out, it's going to be upgraded, and of course that's the same with the PlayStation

125
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,640
3, you will be getting a firmware update on launch day, and it will basically allow you

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:11,480
to utilize the PlayStation Network functions, so not a big surprise, but they're doing the

127
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,280
same thing with the Wii when that comes out there, you have to do a firmware update as

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,200
well for that.

129
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,260
But I don't know, I guess in order to get the units out there, they have to launch early

130
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,180
and be able to get them manufactured, and if that means adding a firmware update later

131
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,720
on so that they can get those units out there, if they find more bugs and stuff, then so

132
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
be it.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:47,040
If they have to wait for this final firmware, they might be getting 2 PS3s instead of 400,000.

134
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,460
What I think is interesting, something I was talking about during the break, is that one

135
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,240
game I wanted was NBA Live 07 for the PlayStation 3, yes there was a sports title I actually

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,180
wanted, well guess what, I'm not going to be able to get it, because EA cancelled it.

137
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,920
They're saying in a statement, quote, we are concentrating our efforts on creating a spectacular

138
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,880
NBA Street home court instead of porting NBA Live 07, and home court will be coming to

139
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,840
the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 early next year.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:23,240
All the work that they've done on NBA Live 07 will be instead headed on over to NBA Live

141
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
08.

142
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:34,520
Home court, if I remember correctly, I believe is coming out, I want to say January or February,

143
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,640
so it shouldn't be too bad.

144
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:51,520
There was also a lot of other PlayStation 3 delays coming out, pretty much with everything,

145
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,760
as we mentioned earlier we were talking about Rainbow Six Vegas and stuff like that, so

146
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:04,520
it's not a huge surprise that a lot of the stuff is being delayed.

147
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:12,160
But anyways, I gotta note, was it home court January or February for next year I believe,

148
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,400
so that's when we can look forward to that.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,240
Well as for other PS3 related news, and this makes me very, very, very sad.

150
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:32,840
Guitar Hero 2 will not work on the PS3, in fact in a quote released by IGN, they said

151
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,560
they assumed that Guitar Hero and the sequel would work perfectly well on PlayStation 3,

152
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,440
unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case when you pop in a PS2 or PS1 game, you're

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,860
prompted to tap the PlayStation button on the controller.

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,600
They're basically saying that since the controller doesn't have the button, you can't actually

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,040
activate it, and you can't swap out the controller to change it in, because you'll need to turn

156
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,300
on the analog, and of course the SG doesn't have analog.

157
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,720
So in other words, one of the biggest PlayStation 2 games to come out in the past year will

158
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,600
not be working on the PlayStation 3.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,480
There is no physical way to make it work.

160
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,880
So would that go the same with say, DDR, BeatMania, anything that uses an additional controller?

161
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Well it's interesting because I have a last minute update here, Bamani Style just posted

162
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,380
a story this evening, because you know the PS3 is out in Japan now, and they're trying

163
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,400
some backwards compatibility there, and they're saying Pop'n Music 4, 5, 6, and Animation Melody

164
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,000
have problems with the keynotes and backgrounds, Pop'n Music Disney has timing issues with

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,860
the background music, Pop'n Music 2 is missing some images, and let's see, BeatMania Best

166
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,000
Hits has timing issues, 6Mix and Core has background music, as well as BeatMania The

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,880
Sounds of Tokyo, the timings off in Gotta Mix, some of the graphics don't appear in

168
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,700
Gotta Mix 2, and DDR Max 6Mix, the background doesn't always play correctly, which of course

169
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,920
is the essential part of DDR is to have your music play on time incorrectly, so it pretty

170
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
much makes the game unplayable.

171
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,280
Are you talking about the background videos though?

172
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,200
No, background music doesn't always play correctly, which is kind of something you need.

173
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,560
Now in BeatMania 2DX 3rd Style and 6th Style, some of the graphics are altered, they're

174
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,200
just not showing up correctly, but I guess the games are still playable, so that's interesting

175
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,660
though because we're just looking at one genre of games, and that's already, that's a huge

176
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,560
list of issues for one very narrow genre of games, so now granted a lot of these, especially

177
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,760
the pop and music titles, a lot of those are PS1 and very old, the BeatMania titles as

178
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,000
well, but still, is that 100% compatibility?

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,240
No, and I believe they're talking about 99.9% compatible games, and that's a pretty huge

180
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,120
chunk out of the games right there, and they're saying that those are not compatible, oops,

181
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,160
I guess we forgot to play all the music games, darn, I guess those aren't big name stuff.

182
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,720
This is going to sound really random, but in Phantasy Star Universe, I was laughing

183
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,720
tonight because a character joined my party, and his name was Kootaragi, and I don't think

184
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,960
it's a pun or anything, but the guy's name is seriously Kootaragi, so it's funny because

185
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,120
somebody set him on fire, so it was like, Kootaragi's on fire, Kootaragi's on fire,

186
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,680
it was funny to me in that moment.

187
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,280
He was not wearing a helmet, nor was he eating crayons, but he was on fire, running around

188
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,320
on fire.

189
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,600
So now we have him eating crayons, wearing a bicycle helmet, leashed to a jungle gym,

190
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
and on fire.

191
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,840
Well, someone who thinks Kootaragi should put down the crayons is Nolan Bushnell, you

192
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,680
might recognize him as one of the founders of Atari, or the founder of Atari, he's the

193
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,120
granddaddy of Pong, he said, quote, earlier this week, I think Sony shot themselves in

194
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
the foot.

195
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,000
There is a high probability they will fail.

196
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,080
The price point is probably unsustainable.

197
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,200
For years and years, Sony has been a very difficult company to deal with from a developer

198
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
standpoint.

199
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,320
They could get away with their arrogance and capriciousness because they had an installed

200
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
base.

201
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,360
They have also historically had horrible software tools.

202
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,000
You can compare that to the Xbox 360 with really great authoring tools and additional

203
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
revenue streams from Xbox Live.

204
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,640
A first party developer would be an idiot to develop for Sony first and not the 360.

205
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,680
People don't buy hardware, they buy software.

206
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,680
P.S.

207
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,800
I'm a big Microsoft fanboy.

208
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Just kidding about the P.S. part, but that's almost what it sounds like there in that little

209
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
statement.

210
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:29,200
Some interesting comments there from one of the granddaddies of gaming.

211
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,520
You know, I saw an interesting comparison on one of the blogs today that talked about

212
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,540
how the PlayStation 2 came out a year after the Dreamcast, and everybody said Dreamcast

213
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:47,120
has better games, Dreamcast can go online much better than P.S. 2 can, Dreamcast can

214
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,280
do all this, but yet Dreamcast failed, so people are saying, well, Xbox 360 has got

215
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:57,880
the better games, Xbox 360 has got the better online, will history repeat itself?

216
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,160
We have to listen to him because he bought us Pizza Time Theater.

217
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,160
I have to say there's a big difference here, though, something that wasn't considered in

218
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
the article.

219
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,120
Dreamcast didn't play DVDs, and at that time DVDs were just breaking, and I think, you

220
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,040
know, in this assumption, and of course you're going to say, well, Sony plays Blu-ray, and

221
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,200
Microsoft doesn't have anything next-gen built in.

222
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,760
I think the consumer market's in a different place right now, though.

223
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,800
I think at that time, consumers were ready to move to DVD, DVD was already somewhat established

224
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,540
and everybody knew it was the next.

225
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,240
This time you have a split.

226
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,640
People are reluctant to go to Blu-ray or HD DVD because they don't know which one's going

227
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
to be the winner.

228
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,240
You know, most casual people I talk to, I go, hey, you're going to get a Blu-ray?

229
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
They go, what's that?

230
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,040
You're going to get an HD DVD?

231
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
What?

232
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
I have a DVD player.

233
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
What?

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
I have an HDTV.

235
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,760
No, you're going to get an HD DVD.

236
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,760
What?

237
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,920
Well, I don't know if the consumer market's in the same place it was.

238
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Exactly.

239
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,320
If you mean their head up their butt, then maybe.

240
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,680
Anyways, other interesting things about, also we were talking about the backwards compatibility

241
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,000
on games and how it's not working.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,580
Well, one thing that won't work, and it's not very, you know, a huge surprise, but Japanese

243
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,880
PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1 games will not play on an American PlayStation 3.

244
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Because the games are region coded, the PlayStation 3 will not play games, whether for PlayStation

245
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:27,440
1 or PlayStation 2, from other regions, but that'd be cool if it did, but it just doesn't.

246
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,280
I just want to jump in real quick here and notice that, or note that Travis, who hosts

247
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,600
our show here Saturday Nights on Orange Launch Radio, Travis Donovan Live, just sent me a

248
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,640
link to a story over on IGN where they've been logging all these backward compatibility

249
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,480
issues with PlayStation 3, Tekken 5 has a number of modes that don't play background

250
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,680
music correctly, Xenosaga Episode 2, the opening movie, sometimes stops, Mega Man X7, background

251
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,660
music won't play properly sometimes, Devil May Cry, screen sometimes freezes during the

252
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,440
title demo, Suikoden 3 can't read PlayStation 1 data during the game, Silent Hill 2, when

253
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:11,280
going from title to demo, the screen may freeze, issues, that sounds like a lot of games, maybe

254
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,800
that's what the day one firmware update's all about, who knows.

255
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,680
Well, they've already gotten those day one firmware updates with that system right there,

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,680
so oopsie.

257
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Good point, good point.

258
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,040
All right, well anyway, let's head on over to our mailbag and see what our listeners

259
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,840
think of all this console mania going on this week.

260
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,120
Every week we invite your emails at mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com, and DarkSakura puts

261
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,000
on the rubber gloves and dives in head first into the mailbag and pulls out her favorite

262
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
emails to read for you folks.

263
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Don't you DarkSakura?

264
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:48,720
When I'm ready.

265
00:17:48,720 --> 00:18:00,520
The mailbag this week is kind of sparse, so I'm going to read the top four.

266
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,280
This one comes from My Little Pony Killer.

267
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
I love that name.

268
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,560
You know, I was in my local GameStop the other day picking up Gears of War, awesome game

269
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,640
by the way, and I realized the guys there don't know shit.

270
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,760
A classmate of mine came in when I was browsing and asked about pre-ordering Halo 3.

271
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,440
The guy told him about the regular collector's edition and legendary editions of the game.

272
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,500
Here's where the bullshit begins.

273
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,920
He said that the regular edition was just the game.

274
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,600
The collector's edition has a cool case and a making of DVD.

275
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,720
He wanted to say the legendary edition would include two exclusive weapons, the assault

276
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,480
rifle 2 and the spike shot, have the first two games on the second disc come with the

277
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,240
making of DVD, every single episode of Red vs. Blue on a third disc, yeah right, and

278
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,620
have the Halo movie on a fourth disc.

279
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,880
Not to mention the glowing three and a half minute description of the included helmet

280
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,280
replica and how he was going to wear it every Halloween and that he can't believe that Bungie

281
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
would include something like that, etc.

282
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
My classmate leaves.

283
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,400
I grab Gears of War off the shelf, bring it up to the counter and say, sir, I read the

284
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,440
article in the magazine too and I didn't get out of it what you did.

285
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,800
He replies, well, it's all been confirmed by Bungie, so you should read it more carefully

286
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
next time.

287
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,000
Needless to say, I now go to the other GameStop in town.

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,080
You know, and Loki, I was thinking the same thing when she was reading that, and when

289
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
I was first reading the email, I was like, well, it sounds right so far, and then I got

290
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,800
to the helmet thing, I'm like, wait a minute, wait a minute, you can't wear the helmet,

291
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
stupid.

292
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,880
Unless his head's really tiny, maybe he has a tiny head.

293
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,960
Well okay, this reminds me of something I wanted to talk about tonight.

294
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,040
I now have a new favorite game store, and it's because of things like this.

295
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,840
I am sick of going into a game store where I feel elitism coming from the people behind

296
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,000
the counter.

297
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,400
They don't know who I am.

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,700
I'm not trying to say I'm better than they are or anything because I have this stupid

299
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,040
video game podcast that I do on the side with my buddies, but they assume things about me

300
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,960
because I'm older and I play games.

301
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,720
They always try to one-up me with game knowledge when I go into certain stores.

302
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm kind of sick of that attitude.

303
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm not going into game stores to get told what games I should be buying the guidebook

304
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,160
because it's the only way I'm going to get through the game.

305
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,400
That only worked when Dan was a manager.

306
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
No.

307
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Well, that's different.

308
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Because he actually does know his shit.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,280
That's different, that's different.

310
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know what it's like in your town.

311
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is one thing I notice.

312
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,580
I may say that I'm shopping at this particular store, but town to town I notice it's different.

313
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,920
It's totally different, but in this particular town I got fed up with one particular chain,

314
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,920
and now I'm shopping at GameCrazy because I went to GameCrazy, I went to look for a

315
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,680
particular game, and the guy treated me like I was royalty.

316
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,720
I said, I just want the Gears of War regular edition, I don't want the collector's edition

317
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
stuff.

318
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Instead of just trying to upsell me and say, oh, you don't know what you're missing, I

319
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,000
was like, okay, I can do that for you.

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,520
He went and got the game, and then I was like, do you have Luminous 2?

321
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,600
The guy was like, no, we don't have that in yet for some weird reason.

322
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,720
Let me make a call.

323
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
He called another store.

324
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,120
He was going to have it shipped ordered, and he was like, I won't even charge you a pre-order

325
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,440
because the game already came out.

326
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm like, oh my gosh, I just got great customer service at a game store as someone who kind

327
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,920
of met me on a peer level and just was like, hey, you're a gamer, you seem to know what

328
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,560
you want, and didn't try to sell me all this garbage.

329
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,400
It was awesome.

330
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,560
That's funny you mention that because my hubby is starting at GameCrazy.

331
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,080
And again, I don't know your town, people.

332
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,320
I'm just talking about my town.

333
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,920
Maybe in your local town the folks at GameCrazy are dicks and you have to go to Best Buy.

334
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
I don't know what.

335
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,360
I'm talking about right here, right now, I'm totally having it for GameCrazy.

336
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
That's where I'm going to be doing my shopping right now because of good customer service

337
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,360
goes so far.

338
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,240
So if you work in a game store, because I know we have folks that work in game stores

339
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,200
that listen to this program, don't treat your customers like dirt because you never know

340
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,840
who you're pissing off, how many games they might be buying when you're not working.

341
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,480
Can I ask which store you went to?

342
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,320
Which one in particular?

343
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:06,080
It was the one that is, I don't want to say on air, but it's the one that your hubby used

344
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,360
to work at years ago.

345
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,240
I think I know who the manager of that store is.

346
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
I don't care anymore.

347
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
It doesn't matter.

348
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
It's a lost cause now.

349
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
No, I mean the GameCrazy.

350
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,280
Oh, oh, oh, no, the GameCrazy I went to was in the...

351
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay.

352
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Sorry.

353
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Sorry.

354
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,760
It's because I actually know about four managers of GameCrazies too.

355
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Well, that's a nice guy.

356
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,960
Well, my experience with...

357
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,840
SSJ100Matt says he was hitting on me.

358
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,840
He was not hitting on me, you jackass.

359
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,880
My experience with the GameStops, usually it's retardation, talking to people, or they'll

360
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,000
try to carry on small talk.

361
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,560
So what games are you playing right now?

362
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm like, I don't want to talk to you, I just want to buy this game.

363
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,840
Or they're trying to sell me Splinter Cell Double Agent on the Wii, I'm like, no, I don't

364
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,960
want that game at all.

365
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I always used to hate...

366
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,960
I would go in there and I'd buy something like Prey, and then they go, do you want to

367
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
pre-order Halo 3?

368
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,720
I'm like, if I want to pre-order Halo 3, I would have asked.

369
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,480
Okay, Jamie's pointing at the mailbag going, more emails.

370
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Okay, sorry.

371
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
All right.

372
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,680
Well, the next one comes from Jason says, I recently bought a 360 and have been trying

373
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,840
to decide whether to get the HD DVD drive when it comes out.

374
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,360
A friend of mine told me that the 360 can't do real HD because it doesn't have an HDMI

375
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,800
connection, but it's hard to have a conversation with him about it because he's so against

376
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,240
the Xbox in general.

377
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,140
So can you tell me if this is true?

378
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,160
Is there an adapter I can get to hook up HDMI or does it matter at all?

379
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,760
Any info is appreciated and keep up the great show, I never miss it.

380
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Doesn't matter.

381
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,000
You can do 1080p either with component or with the VGA cable.

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,440
The only thing the HDMI is for is because later on when they digitally sign everything,

383
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,640
way later on once that digital copyright act or whatever the hell they're calling it, digital

384
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:03,120
broadcast flag, it will require HDMI or something like that to be able to plug into your stuff.

385
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,700
Doesn't HDMI though give a slight better quality that you probably won't even notice with your

386
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
regular eyes?

387
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:19,760
HDMI is basically based on DVI, which is enhanced more over DVI because DVI is just video.

388
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,960
HDMI actually carries a digital video and audio signal on it, but you can get DVI to

389
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,040
HDMI adapters and stuff like that.

390
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,160
In a way you can be able to do it and maybe later on down the line that might be an issue,

391
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,280
but I'm thinking if it is going to be an issue later on down the line they're going to release

392
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,040
some sort of HDMI connector for the 360.

393
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,600
Who is the emailer that just sent that in?

394
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
What was their name?

395
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Jason.

396
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
Jason.

397
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,280
Okay, Jason, what I want you to do is I want you to stop your playback device right here

398
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,240
and bring your friend into the room and we're going to give a special message to your friend

399
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
right here.

400
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Okay, so stop right here.

401
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
All right.

402
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Hi, Jason's friend.

403
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,040
This is Orange Lounge Radio and we're here to tell you you're wrong.

404
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,320
Hugs and kisses.

405
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,880
We love you.

406
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,080
I hate to go back to the last email, but we do have some good chat comments and I wanted

407
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,320
to read them.

408
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,280
Travis Donovan is saying, Loki was displaying customer elitism earlier.

409
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,960
Customers who think they are better than the hourly people working there just doing their

410
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
jobs.

411
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,400
No, I just don't want to carry out a stupid conversation with them.

412
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
I hate talking to people.

413
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's a whole different story.

414
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,640
I will pretend to be better than them.

415
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
That's true.

416
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Loki's just an asshole is what it is.

417
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
No, I'm not.

418
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
He thinks he's better than you.

419
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
He's just a dick.

420
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,280
I'm not an asshole and I do get annoyed when they're giving them wrong information, but

421
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,240
I don't try to correct them because that is annoying.

422
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,200
All I do is I don't want Splinter Cell and they understand that.

423
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,640
They're just trying to upsell and that's fine.

424
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,240
That's what they're supposed to do, but obviously I don't like that and I have to do that at

425
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,800
my work, so I understand.

426
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,640
One more comment, I promise, Jamie, but this is from Brad from Pod Culture and he's cool.

427
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
I like Brad.

428
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
We got a comment from him.

429
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,200
He was saying the same thing happened to him when he bought Fantasy Star Universe.

430
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,800
They were trying to sell him crap he didn't need because he's an older gamer.

431
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,520
He's 36, he admits.

432
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,760
Their first comment was, this is for your kid?

433
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,400
Dot, dot, dot.

434
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,800
They didn't want to buy my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because it had the hot coffee

435
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
content in it.

436
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Apparently, you can't buy that back anymore, so I guess I got to sell it on eBay.

437
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,320
You know what happens when you assume.

438
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,560
You make an ass out of you and me.

439
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,320
This next email comes from The Afro Guy.

440
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Hey, O.L.R.

441
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,200
I've listened to your excellent show for ages, but this is the first time I've felt compelled

442
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,480
to write in on a subject that we're all very familiar with by now.

443
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,760
My younger brother, 13 years of age, recently brought Bully.

444
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,640
Canis Canim ate it because I think he's emailing from overseas.

445
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,280
He loves it, not for its violence or witty dialogue, but for the fact that it really

446
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,460
does feel like a living, breathing school.

447
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:55,440
Like most boys of his age, he's watched his fair share of 15 rated movies and played for

448
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,320
hours on Grand Theft Auto.

449
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,400
The other day, our dad watched him playing for 30 seconds and immediately became worried

450
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,200
that the game was too violent, which is totally understandable.

451
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,440
I once watched my brother in the game pick a student up, punch him in the face, throw

452
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,080
him on the ground, and spit on him.

453
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,200
His reaction was, oh, never done that before.

454
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,320
However, I argued that it's no different to movies of the same rating.

455
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,160
What's interesting is that after about a week, he was sent home from real school for fighting.

456
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,960
And that was in quotes, by the way.

457
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,720
Our school does have a notoriously strict policy on violence and such, but it was certainly

458
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,040
a shock to our parents.

459
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,840
My brother claimed it was self-defense that another student attacked him with a bit of

460
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,800
harmless teasing.

461
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,200
And there's a footnote on here.

462
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,480
I love emails with footnotes.

463
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,200
So if throwing a stick counts as harmless teasing, the other kid did pretend to slap

464
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,240
him on the face first, but my brother's description of the events is suspiciously vague.

465
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,340
To go back into the email, naturally the game was to blame and soon it will be on its way

466
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,400
to a pre-owned rack in-game.

467
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,020
Of course he shouldn't have been bought the game in the first place, and while he's previously

468
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,940
played and watched other violent media, I see Bully as different since it takes place

469
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,720
in his school and those acting violently are around his age.

470
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Therefore Rockstar should have been more careful with their marketing and made sure it didn't

471
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
interest young teenagers.

472
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,380
I'm certainly not supporting Jack Thompson, who doesn't want anyone to play Bully, but

473
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,120
perhaps video games do have more effect on youngsters than we'd like to think.

474
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,320
Thanks for the showing, keep up the good work, The Afro Guy.

475
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,200
I never got into fights when I was in school, but if I got bad grades or didn't do my homework,

476
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,520
my mom would take away the cords to the Nintendo or have my dad do it because she didn't know

477
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
what she was doing.

478
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,720
She'd have my dad take the cords away to the Nintendo so I couldn't play games, so I had

479
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,060
to do my homework.

480
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,800
I think maybe that's what needs to go on in this situation.

481
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,200
If the brother's going to get sent home for fighting, and it sounds a little bit vague,

482
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,280
sounds like it might have been his fault, then obviously he needs to be doing something

483
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,440
a little more constructive with his time than playing games for a little bit.

484
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,760
He needs to be punished.

485
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:02,740
I do have to say that if it is suspected that that might be the root of his behavior, it's

486
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,760
very commendable that it's being taken out of his hands if that is an influence.

487
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:13,640
I say if it's proven as an influence, which it looks like there's a lot of at least circumstantial

488
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,640
evidence that it would be, then removing the game is smart, I think, the agreeable thing

489
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,640
to do.

490
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,240
I absolutely agree in some aspects with the anti-video game stuff because not all kids

491
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,600
should be playing Bully, but that's up to a parent to decide.

492
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,280
A parent knows their kid best, or at least a parent should know their kid better than

493
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,680
anyone else, and it's up to the parent to decide, is this game appropriate for my child?

494
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,760
If the child's not going to be causing problems and the child can distinguish fiction from

495
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,220
non-fiction, then they can play the game until the cows come home.

496
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,660
Maybe for other children, it's best that it's in doses.

497
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,080
For some children, they should be reading and not playing games at all.

498
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,960
It just depends on the child.

499
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,760
I can also understand that for at least people of a like age in that game, because it's one

500
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,360
thing for a kid, I think that there's actually a little bit of a reality line difference

501
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,440
in a kid playing Grand Theft Auto because technically they're not adults.

502
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:20,360
It's something that they know they have no real way of doing, but a kid can go into school

503
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,200
and basically be a bully.

504
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,880
Flow Walk has this funny story that kind of has nothing to do with what we're talking

505
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,000
about, but I like this.

506
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,720
I've only had one fist fight ever in fourth grade.

507
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,080
I made the kid eat grass, but his sister came in and kicked me in the shin with her high

508
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
heel.

509
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
That bitch.

510
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,720
I've been in two fights in school, honestly.

511
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,000
I've actually had to defend myself from somebody who tried to start a fight with me, but one

512
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,040
time there was this guy, he was the school bully.

513
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,920
I was in fourth grade, he was a fifth grader, and he was going around pushing over the other

514
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,160
kids off the swing set, so I ran up and tripped him and kicked him in the back of the head.

515
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,220
I've never been in a fight in my entire life, but I did get called out to the bike racks

516
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,520
after school once, but I just didn't go.

517
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,700
I was like, what are they going to do?

518
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Call me names?

519
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,440
Oh, gee, nobody's ever done that to me before when I was in eighth grade.

520
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,440
So I just didn't go.

521
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,620
What I found out what happened is that he actually stayed away from me the rest of the

522
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,240
year and started picking on people when I wasn't around.

523
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I can't stand that type of thing.

524
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,480
The only other fight I got in was some girl who was harassing me, so I turned around and

525
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
punched her in the nose.

526
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,940
Okay, okay, okay, I have to tell the story.

527
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Make it quick.

528
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,480
She was, okay, her name was Myra.

529
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
If you're listening, you deserved it.

530
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,840
She was, okay, I have to say I was picked on in high school.

531
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,360
I was the dark goth, I hate everybody person.

532
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,880
Wasn't Myra the chicken tiny toons that was like, I'm going to love him, excuse him.

533
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Oh, Myra.

534
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Oh, sorry, my bad.

535
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,900
But anyway, she made me drop something that was pretty important.

536
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,120
It was my journal and a couple other books.

537
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,000
She even followed me around for like 15 minutes, so I just turned around and decked her and

538
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,800
she looked so surprised she left me alone the rest of the year.

539
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,000
But did you learn that from River City Ransom?

540
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,560
Did I play River City Ransom then?

541
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't know, did you?

542
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,040
I was busy playing Tetris.

543
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,640
No, I have my Super Nintendo.

544
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,720
I have my Super Nintendo.

545
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,200
So did the games make you do it?

546
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,840
No.

547
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,400
I was just tired of harassing me.

548
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,320
It sounds like it was almost like a real-life bully there for a minute.

549
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
She was.

550
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Oh, my God.

551
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,320
She was horrible to everybody.

552
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
All right.

553
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,280
If she left me alone, I didn't care what she did to anyone else.

554
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,760
Raven's Dolphin says she learned it from Street Fighter because that was on the Super Nintendo.

555
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,600
I did play a lot of Street Fighter back in the day.

556
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
There you go, Shoryuken.

557
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,600
All right, next email.

558
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
No.

559
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,080
The last email comes from John D. He says, Hey guys, well, yes, this isn't my first email

560
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,120
to y'all considering I just started listening about a month ago.

561
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,680
I had finally played Power of Power Paradise yesterday and found it extremely addicting

562
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,760
in that I was actually really good.

563
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,760
I was playing the eight-plus star songs, which made me laugh.

564
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,440
But to get to my point now, I know that Nintendo hasn't released any good info on the characters

565
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,480
in Super Smash Brothers Brawl, but who all do you think or would want to see in it?

566
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,900
Honestly, I would crack up if I ever saw like a pack of 10 Pikmin raping on Leon from RE4.

567
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,280
With all due respect to the listener, we're glad we got a new listener and a first email.

568
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,920
I feel like we're getting the Smash Brothers question at least once a month, but I'm going

569
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,560
to give this person the benefit of the doubt that maybe they're a new listener.

570
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,720
So welcome to the show, and I don't mean to tease you.

571
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,360
We do appreciate the fact that you sent in an email.

572
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,440
Okay, character that should be in Smash Brothers.

573
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,240
The fanboy side of me would like to see Cloud in it as much as I hate to admit it, but it

574
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,320
does make a good fit.

575
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Don't grr at me.

576
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Cloud is already in Air Guys.

577
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,940
I guess that's true, but that would be cute to see in Super Smash Brothers.

578
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,940
Other characters I'd want to see.

579
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,040
I definitely want to see Tom Nook.

580
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,600
I want to see Tom Nook.

581
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,720
Tom Nook is a bastard.

582
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
He'll take all my money.

583
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,800
That'll be a special move.

584
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I want...

585
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Oh.

586
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Do you have somebody?

587
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Little Mac.

588
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Yeah?

589
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
That'd be cool.

590
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,440
I think more realistically, you'll probably see Sonic the Hedgehog and Rayman.

591
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,960
Oh, interesting speculation.

592
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Because you've got Ubisoft dedicating, what, seven games to the Wii at launch.

593
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:27,440
Sonic, which Sega and the GameCube were just best buddies, so of course it makes perfect

594
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,440
sense.

595
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:35,160
And also to that listener, download some Para Para videos off of YouTube and type Para Para

596
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,480
Girls into YouTube, or whatever it is, Para Para Deluxe or VELFER or whatever.

597
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,680
Put that into a YouTube, and that's what you look like when you play Para Para Para Eyes.

598
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:57,120
I want Marl from Puyo Puyo in it, so that you can drop a bunch of Puyo thingies on everybody.

599
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,240
That was the last email, yes?

600
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,560
That was the last email.

601
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,880
Well, we're sorry to have to close the mailbag, but if you want to send us an email, you can

602
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,280
do that anytime you want.

603
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
Just send us an email.

604
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,680
It's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

605
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,340
We look forward to hearing from you.

606
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:14,400
We also, by the way, always welcome your voicemails on our Skype line.

607
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,320
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR, and we'll go through and play some of our favorite voicemails for

608
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,920
you guys.

609
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,480
Last week we asked, are you going to be buying the Wii or the PlayStation 3, and are you

610
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,160
going to be camping out for any of them, or what are you going to be doing?

611
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,520
We got this voicemail, and I want to play this for you guys right now, one of our voicemails

612
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
of the week here.

613
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,040
Hey guys, it's DJ Tyron, just calling in about the voicemail of the week.

614
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,600
Anyways, I will be camping out for the Wii.

615
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:53,360
I pre-ordered at the electronics boutique that I work at, and I also got a gift card

616
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,320
for Best Buy for my birthday, so I will be heading over to Best Buy after picking up

617
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,960
my system and Zelda, and then going up and picking up a classic controller and points

618
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:11,360
card and another game over at Best Buy after picking up my system.

619
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:19,840
And then for a quick question, I'm wondering what other launch titles I should pick up

620
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
besides Zelda.

621
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,440
I was thinking possibly Metal Slug or Red Steel.

622
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,040
Anyways, just want to hear your guys' opinion, and hope to hear from you soon.

623
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
Keep up the great show, guys.

624
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Thanks.

625
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Thanks for the voicemail.

626
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,040
What do you guys think?

627
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Other launch titles?

628
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,520
Do not touch Metal Slug with a 10-foot pole, and the reason why I say that is because you're

629
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,760
only encouraging SNK to release Metal Slug again and again and again and again.

630
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,520
And to be honest, there's a lot of other games out there.

631
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,080
Dark Soccer, Rebuttal?

632
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I like it.

633
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,280
I love Metal Slug.

634
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,100
Excite Truck, if you can find it.

635
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:01,320
I would say Excite Truck as well, or Red Steel, or I think the sleeper hit would be Elibits

636
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,340
is actually I think a lot better than a lot of people might be getting.

637
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,880
If you want something right away, Rayman's Raven Rabbids.

638
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,460
It depends what kind of games you're into.

639
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,280
If you're into sports, maybe you ought to be checking out Madden 07.

640
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,760
I say Red Steel all the way.

641
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,280
All right, if you'd like to leave us a voicemail for next week, go ahead and send us a voicemail.

642
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,000
It's 1-877-GAME-OLR.

643
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,720
And what we want to know from you guys is Gears of War.

644
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Today is Emergence Day after all, and I know I'm looking at my friends' list, and I see

645
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,160
tons of freaking people playing Gears of War.

646
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,760
What are your thoughts on Gears of War if you've been playing the game?

647
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Is it the 10 out of 10 game it's being lauded as on blogs and things around the internet?

648
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,800
Or is it just kind of okay?

649
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,140
Or is it maybe crappy?

650
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Maybe you think it's crappy.

651
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,000
You're in the minority of folks there.

652
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Send us a voicemail.

653
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,220
We want to know your thoughts on Gears of War.

654
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,600
If you're listening live here on Sunday night, please wait until after the show to call us.

655
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,400
Otherwise, we get confused.

656
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,120
Anyway, back to the story.

657
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,060
The voicemail topic was, you know, are you going to be waiting in line for a Wii?

658
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,880
And if you are going to be doing some line waiting, Kotaku has some advice for you guys.

659
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,000
They put some bullet points up in an article posted on November 7th called How to Line

660
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Stand.

661
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,360
And some quotes here.

662
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh, actually, I guess, oh, I'm sorry, originally this came via some other blog, Random Digital

663
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Musings.

664
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
So sorry about that.

665
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,720
I want to give credit where credit's due.

666
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,000
We just saw it on Kotaku first.

667
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Bullet point.

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,840
There's nothing worse, and I mean nothing, than taking all this time to camp out overnight

669
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,840
only to find out that the store isn't getting any units.

670
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,320
So yeah, you might want to call ahead and make sure they're going to actually be getting

671
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,440
it.

672
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
You must let the person behind you, and maybe even mention it to the lady in front of you,

673
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,640
know that you need to make a short trip to the restroom.

674
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,060
I'm sure they'll appreciate the same courtesy when nature calls for them as well.

675
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,520
Don't forget that November is winter, so dress accordingly.

676
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,360
Rather than walking out of Best Buy as a Target with a big yellow and blue bag, why not bring

677
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,200
something to make your $600 less conspicuous?

678
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,740
Most people who have considered this just go with the ever-popular black garbage bags,

679
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,120
but sometimes those can be just as conspicuous, so maybe you want to bring something to hide

680
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,880
it in so you don't get accosted as you walk out with people going, I'll pay you $1,000

681
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,440
for that, da da da da da da.

682
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
Have fun camping in the lines.

683
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
We'll be looking for your stories on our Skype calls next week.

684
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,160
Wear deodorant.

685
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Yeah.

686
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Drunami says wear deodorant.

687
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,720
Good idea.

688
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Bring extra.

689
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Just bring extras for others.

690
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Bring the spray kind so you can spray others.

691
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:39,640
So, other stuff in the news this week, of course, the ESA boss, Doug Lowenstein, better

692
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:47,920
known for ruining E3, no, but he doesn't want video games to be called video games.

693
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,120
He wants them to be called something better because he believes that video games are kind

694
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,460
of getting this negative stereotype to them.

695
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,280
So he would prefer video games to be referred to as interactive entertainment or entertainment

696
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
software.

697
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
I don't know.

698
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,320
That's kind of vague to me, but who cares?

699
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
They're video games.

700
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,400
That's like saying, let's name the revolution a we.

701
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,760
Are they games?

702
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,880
Yes.

703
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,760
Do they involve video, like a video cassette recorder?

704
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,920
Yes.

705
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,200
Are they then video games?

706
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,680
I think that's not a bad title.

707
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,200
That's there to not understand.

708
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,160
He says he believes that they might not attract as much negative publicity if its products

709
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,360
were categorized as something more serious than a game.

710
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,880
Because entertainment is a serious business.

711
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,280
Oh, really?

712
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,800
Of course, Shadow Charlie gives the answer I'm sure some people are thinking, saying,

713
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,720
how about shut the fuck up?

714
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,840
So if we called, that's kind of retarded because if you think about it, say we called them

715
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,560
interactive entertainment or something like that.

716
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,360
So say for example, there was someone out there that committed rape, and if we decided

717
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,000
to call rape candy, would that make rape any better?

718
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Oh well, you know, candy's good.

719
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
I like candy.

720
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,160
Oh crap, I mean, I don't like rape.

721
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
I'm confused.

722
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,840
I like candy only when they say yes.

723
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,400
Candy is delicious.

724
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,520
It's just like interactive entertainment could be masturbation, right?

725
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
That's something you have to interact with, right?

726
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,080
They're basically saying the critics of video games always equate games with toys and thus

727
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,800
with children, and so they kind of treat it badly.

728
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,200
Here's my thing, the critics of video games a lot of times don't do their research.

729
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,000
Just like a lot of people coming out talking about Bully hadn't played the game, didn't

730
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,780
know anything about the game other than what people have told them about the game, or claimed

731
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:07,760
to have played it online despite the fact that it's impossible, I think that no matter

732
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,540
what you call gaming, it's still going to get criticized by stupid people, and it doesn't

733
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,880
matter how you dress up a turd, it's still a turd, so that's basically it.

734
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
Wow.

735
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
Alright.

736
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:30,880
Well, you know, though, turds do make the flowers grow.

737
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,840
Speaking of turdy things, though, guess what happened?

738
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,400
Itagaki got sued for sexual harassment.

739
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,040
A 31-year-old employee of Tecmo- Shouldn't that have been speaking of candy?

740
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Candy is delicious.

741
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,040
Anyway.

742
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Wow.

743
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,520
We're going to get emails on this, I already know.

744
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,880
No, okay, okay, absolutely.

745
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,920
There is an in-joke about candy in one of my circles, so.

746
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:08,560
Anyway, a 31-year-old employee of Tecmo said that our dear friend who was behind Dead or

747
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,080
Alive was basically sexually harassing her.

748
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:21,080
The compensation she is looking for- Rob.

749
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:30,640
Anyway, she's seeking compensation in 10 million- Rob, what the hell?

750
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,520
It's candy, get it?

751
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,960
This candy is not so delicious.

752
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,760
Anyway, she's looking for 10 million yen, which in US dollars is 84,843, so that he

753
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,640
started in 2003 and basically forced her into quitting the company on the 8th of September.

754
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:55,420
She filed on September 10th, but it's only recently become- But he's basically saying

755
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,720
that she wanted it.

756
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:06,480
But he's not denying that they had any relations, but basically saying that she consented to

757
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:12,120
it.

758
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,560
Tara is sitting over in the corner going, I want candy, dude.

759
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,440
Okay, in all seriousness, it's not cool.

760
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,440
Stop laughing.

761
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm not laughing, it's a serious matter.

762
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:34,640
Okay, where I'm really not surprised to hear that there was a sexual harassment related

763
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,760
to the man who created DOA, I still like the bounciness, because it's completely against

764
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
the laws of physics.

765
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,080
But I hope she nails him to the wall if he really did it, so that's it.

766
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,320
It's like, hey, babe, you want to model for my next big game?

767
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,920
Dark Knight in our chat room says he did not have sexual relations with that woman.

768
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,440
That's a political joke.

769
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,960
I like that one.

770
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Har.

771
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,200
Well, this is no joke.

772
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,960
Lost Planet is a very anticipated game for the Xbox 360.

773
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,120
It's almost like Gears of War level anticipation for this.

774
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,160
Maybe not quite that level.

775
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,440
Certainly not Halo 3 level, but certainly a high level of anticipation for this.

776
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,640
There's already been a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace, but guess what?

777
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,560
There's been an ad that ran in Gears of War.

778
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:31,440
There was a little ad in there and it said, check out Xbox Live Marketplace for new multiplayer

779
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,080
demo, which means that Lost Planet must be getting a multiplayer demo on Xbox Live Marketplace

780
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
soon.

781
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,880
Kind of cool.

782
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,600
So for those folks that are anticipating that game, and I got to say, I played the first

783
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,880
demo and I was like, why are people anticipating this so much?

784
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,880
This is boring.

785
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,600
I'm going to be honest, I wasn't into it at all.

786
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,280
It's a pretty game and yeah, it's very Gears of War-ish.

787
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,240
No, it wasn't even Gears of War-ish.

788
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,640
Gears of War, I understand why people are all goo goo gaga over that game, but Lost

789
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,600
Planet, I just didn't get into it at all.

790
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,920
It's exactly Gears of War.

791
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,040
It's got aliens, it's got people with guns running around shooting things.

792
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,560
A lot of games have aliens and people with guns.

793
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,640
Yeah, but they're both on the 360, therefore it is Gears of War, just like Prey is Gears

794
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,640
of War.

795
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,040
Except, no, that's a first person shooter and it's over the shoulder stuff.

796
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:28,460
But like, you can't die in Prey.

797
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,720
That's the greatest thing about Prey.

798
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,000
Yeah, that's kind of ironic.

799
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,080
You can't die in Prey?

800
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,440
They can't finish Duke Nukem Forever, so it makes sense.

801
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,480
Anyways, so on things that aren't Gears of War, Child's Play 2006 has just finally started

802
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,600
and, of course, this is going to be the fourth annual gaming charity fundraiser that helps

803
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,320
supply children's hospitals around the world with gaming goodness, like Gears of War, and

804
00:46:53,320 --> 00:47:04,060
set up basically to respond to the media painting that gamers and gaming is basically a negative.

805
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:09,160
Seeing them as almost degenerates or scum of the earth.

806
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,600
So yeah, that's pretty cool.

807
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,800
And definitely, of course, put on by Penny Arcade, who have been behind this for a while

808
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,800
now.

809
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,800
In fact, they even have that brand new scholarship that they have for gaming schools.

810
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,520
Pretty cool and definitely a good cause.

811
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:33,400
And if you want to know more information about that, visit pennyarcade.com or visit www.childsplaycharity.org.

812
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,600
Do they take systems as well as financial donation?

813
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,000
Like actual game games?

814
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,840
I know where you're going with this.

815
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,680
Well, because I have a Nintendo 64 and instead of throwing mine away, since I don't play

816
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,960
the damn thing anymore, maybe I will give it to this charity and maybe some money as

817
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,040
well, depending on how I look financially at the end of the year.

818
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,040
I don't know, I'm not so hot right now, but if I have some extra money, I support this

819
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,040
charity.

820
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,240
You'll have to check out the website.

821
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,160
All right, I will do that right now or I'm sure someone in chat will say, oh, I already

822
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,960
read it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

823
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:14,860
Anyway, DarkSakura surfs the web up and down and back and forth every week and finds a

824
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:19,380
website that she likes and she's going to share that website with you right now in her

825
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,380
website of the week.

826
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:22,280
And you know what I just realized?

827
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,040
You know your background music for this segment is a game from DDRO Hostile.

828
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,040
You know what this song is called?

829
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
Candy.

830
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:37,080
Candy is delicious.

831
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,720
My side of the week, actually, I'm sorry I'm a week late for this, but I did want to do

832
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,000
this one last week and I forgot the address.

833
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,360
It's Project Vote Smart, where it goes over the issues based on your location for different

834
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:58,960
basically laws that are trying to go into effect, different things are trying to pass.

835
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:06,280
People running for office, publications, video, news, partnerships, you can even volunteer

836
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:14,360
to work with them, but it's www.vote-smart.org, O-R-G, a very, very, very cool site.

837
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,480
Book market for next year.

838
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,480
Yep.

839
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:22,880
You can still also look at it regularly though for updates.

840
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,720
You just have that in one window and game politics in the other, you're set.

841
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,640
You're politically of sound mind.

842
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,280
If you want to go to E3 this year, you know who's ass you should start kissing is your

843
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,720
favorite gaming companies.

844
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:44,000
A quote came from the ESA this week, the ESA does not control invites, according to Lowenstein.

845
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,220
His organization will be provided names from ESA members and use that as the basis for

846
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,760
generating a list of invitees.

847
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,380
The point is for attendees to be the people participants want to see in one-on-one meetings.

848
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,520
That is not for the ESA to say or influence.

849
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,120
Interesting.

850
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,080
If you have friends at a game company, it's time to start kissing their butt so you can

851
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,400
get into E3 as different as it may be this next year.

852
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Who knows?

853
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,680
Are they still wanting to call them invites or is that a negative connotation towards

854
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
gamers?

855
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,680
Do they want to call them something else?

856
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,300
I have no idea.

857
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,080
All I know is that no company likes us enough to be getting us in.

858
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:27,680
Well, you know a certain company that begins with a K needs to freaking pony up.

859
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,680
Good luck.

860
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Good luck.

861
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,440
They don't want to talk to us bastards.

862
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,420
But when you have that attitude, who would?

863
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:42,580
So IDG is launching a brand new interactive expo in the place of E3 that's going to be

864
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:52,560
taking place in October 07 and they want you to name it because they don't have a name.

865
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,880
So they have a contest.

866
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:04,420
Basically go to www.gamepro.com slash name or named by gamers and you can get a chance

867
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:10,640
to name the expo and if you win, you will win a prize package including a round trip

868
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,480
airfare for two.

869
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:18,640
Hotel and local transportation plus a ton of other cool goodies to the actual expo.

870
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,940
Contest ends on Monday, November 20.

871
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,080
I got a name.

872
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,160
How about Gamer Expo?

873
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,040
How about Big LA Game Place?

874
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,080
How about Thingy?

875
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,760
How about Game Pro Expo?

876
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,960
I mean seriously, just give it a name.

877
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,120
It doesn't have to be that snazzy.

878
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,240
How about, hey, this is an E3.

879
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,480
How about Boobs and Games?

880
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Anyway.

881
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:56,120
Bitch, what did you say, you're not a bitch, this ain't a cutscene, press A.

882
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,680
I should, I should, that's his tiara today.

883
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,680
That was great.

884
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,080
You don't have time to smoke a bowl.

885
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Anyway.

886
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Well, who remembers the Gizmondo?

887
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,240
Huh?

888
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,680
I, I remember the Gizmondo for about two seconds.

889
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,640
We have Miklotov playing with Power Rangers toys.

890
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,640
And a Santa hat.

891
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,520
Is that Magic Ranger?

892
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,520
Can we do the show, please?

893
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,520
Can we do the show?

894
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,520
Oh, I'm sorry.

895
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:28,040
Hey, Dark Tetsuya says call it G3.

896
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,360
Game Pro Gamers Gathering, G3, ha ha ha ha ha ha.

897
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,360
Anyway.

898
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,360
Failed.

899
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,680
Hey, I'm trying to get short here.

900
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:44,960
So Bo Stefan Eriksson, who was one of the founders of the Gizmondo gaming deal, has

901
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,720
been sentenced to three and a half years in jail in California.

902
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,440
He bought four embezzlement and drunken driving.

903
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:01,400
Basically, he crashed and wrote off a Ferrari Enzo.

904
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,720
Big expensive car.

905
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,560
He should have gone to jail for the Gizmondo being kind of crappy.

906
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,520
I liked the Gizmondo.

907
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,200
I liked that Johnny whatever game it was.

908
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
One game.

909
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,840
It had one stinkin' game that was kinda neat.

910
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,000
Anyway, he, um.

911
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,520
I think while they're at it, they should jail all the people behind the Phantom.

912
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:29,080
Anyway, he, um, basically it ended in a mistrial, but he struck a bargaining court.

913
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:35,120
So he basically pled guilty in exchange for the car theft being dropped.

914
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,840
So Drunami, the people behind the Engage need to go to the chair.

915
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,000
He was trying to basically get out of going to jail, so.

916
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,280
However, he's still in jail.

917
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,440
He's going to be deported.

918
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,560
They've seized his mansion in California, and it will be sold to pay court costs and

919
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,980
restitution to the banks involved.

920
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,440
And basically, there is no more Gizmondo.

921
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,200
Will I then never have to hear about this guy ever again?

922
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,800
I don't know.

923
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,800
I hope not.

924
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,240
I just think, I just think he, uh.

925
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:16,200
I'm just like, I think that he deserves it.

926
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Engage 2?

927
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
God.

928
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,640
I'm glad that he wasn't miked for that.

929
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,720
Engage 2 Electric Boogaloo.

930
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,720
That's fucked.

931
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,000
I'd buy one just for that name.

932
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,040
Well, I also, though, I do have some happy news for some of our, uh, geekier fans is

933
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,240
that 2K is putting out a Fantastic Four game that will be out with the next film, uh, June

934
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,240
2007.

935
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:45,280
It will be Fantastic Four, Rise of the Silver Surfer, third-person action game, and it makes

936
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,180
me very happy because I, I, I have to say I was a Silver Surfer fan.

937
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,480
They're making a sequel to the Fantastic Four movie?

938
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,480
It has Silver Surfer!

939
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,480
Yeah, really.

940
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,880
Which means it might have Galactus.

941
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,080
The search for more losses.

942
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,760
The uh, you know, I'll say that the guy that played the torch guy?

943
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,520
He's smoking.

944
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,840
Hey Jessica Alba, Jessica Alba for you, alright?

945
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,600
You get Jessica Alba and her non-nudity claws.

946
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,720
Okay, okay, okay.

947
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,480
Jessica Alba did not look good as a blonde.

948
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,800
Okay, then dye her hair.

949
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,880
Jessica Alba did not look good in clothing.

950
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,680
Just more, more human torch guy, please.

951
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,440
Then I'll go see the movie.

952
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,280
Thank you, yeah, thank you.

953
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:35,920
And right on cue, the chat room goes, flame on Skye, flame on, ha ha ha ha.

954
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh my God, SSG100 Matt's winner, Galactus voiced by Penn & Teller.

955
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,080
Oh shit.

956
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:49,140

You can call us live.

That's 877-426-3657.

962
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,920
That toll-free number, FYI, only works toll-free in the U.S. and Canada.

963
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,920
Let's go to the phones.

964
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,400
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

965
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,400
Who dis?

966
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,680
Raven's Dolphin, it's good to hear from you.

967
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,280
Hi, Raven's Dolphin, what's on your mind?

968
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,800
Flame on, Raven's Dolphin.

969
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah, flame on.

970
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,140
There's only one thing I want to talk to you about is the Xbox 360, and you talked about

971
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,720
it being a Dreamcast.

972
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,160
Well, it's not a Dreamcast, but I was saying there were comparisons made to the Dreamcast

973
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,640
system previously.

974
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,940
I found a good article, and I'm going to link it up in the chat room later, that talked

975
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:41,920
all about the Dreamcast and all about Sega's history.

976
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,880
All right, that is our podcast listeners, no good.

977
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,160
Where are you getting this article from so they can go look it up if they want?

978
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,160
I don't really have it on hand.

979
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,960
I'm just going to post it in there.

980
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,520
All right, what's in this article?

981
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:06,640
What happened was the Saturn was selling super, super poor, so they had to get a new console

982
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:07,640
out there.

983
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,420
They didn't want to leave the market with the Saturn stink.

984
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:15,200
They knew they had to get out of the market, so they had to release the Dreamcast.

985
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,680
The Saturn stink.

986
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,640
I like that term.

987
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,440
I'm taking great offense to that, because the Saturn actually sold very well in Japan.

988
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,920
It's just they had poor support over here, which is why it didn't sell well, because

989
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,560
Sega of America had a big stick up their ass and decided to lose all of their mental facilities

990
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,320
for every employee that worked there, and said, no, we aren't going to bring the RAM

991
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,000
card out here or all the good games.

992
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,320
We're just going to leave those in Japan.

993
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,040
That's what it said in the article.

994
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,160
Sega stink.

995
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,120
They were losing a lot, a lot of money on everything.

996
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,800
The Saturn and the Dreamcast.

997
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,680
How does this compare to Xbox 360, though?

998
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,080
Because Microsoft's losing on the consoles?

999
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,560
Michael Moore.

1000
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,560
What?

1001
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,800
You mean Peter Moore?

1002
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,600
Michael Moore was in Sega before he was in Microsoft.

1003
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,520
Put the car in park, Raven's Dolphin.

1004
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,960
Michael Moore does films.

1005
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,740
He did that Fahrenheit 9-11 movie, right?

1006
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,600
Big guy with a beard, harasses congressmen on the street.

1007
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Thank you.

1008
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,600
Peter Moore.

1009
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,320
Didn't I have Dan on when he was talking about the GameStop Managers Conference, where he

1010
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:27,800
came out to address all the employees at the GameStop Managers Conference and says, okay,

1011
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,800
let's get it out of the way.

1012
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Let's hear a shout out for the Dreamcast.

1013
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Yay!

1014
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,800
Okay.

1015
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
Cute.

1016
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
Anyway.

1017
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
There's other comparisons.

1018
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,800
I see.

1019
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,000
So, Peter Moore is the comparison here.

1020
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,800
Yeah, because he jumped ship, but there's one thing I want to say before I hang up is

1021
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:49,560
Microsoft has so much money so they can throw away with the Xbox 360.

1022
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,400
Sega did not have a lot of money.

1023
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,160
The only thing they had left was $500 million to their name.

1024
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,760
Shit, if I had that kind of money, I'll sell you a console.

1025
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,920
I'll call it Gizmondo 2.

1026
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,920
Electric Boogaloo.

1027
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,200
All right, thanks for calling Raven's Dolphin.

1028
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
Have a good night, all right?

1029
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,200
You too.

1030
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Bye.

1031
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,200
Later.

1032
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
Bye.

1033
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Bye.

1034
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1035
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,200
Who's this?

1036
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,200
Yes, it's NintendoManiac64.

1037
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,200
I haven't called in a while.

1038
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,200
Hi, NintendoManiac64.

1039
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
What's on your mind, buddy?

1040
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Okay.

1041
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:27,800
First off, I've got to know, does my quality suck?

1042
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
You're okay.

1043
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,720
You're a little quiet, but there's not a lot we can do about that.

1044
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,200
Folks will just have to listen carefully, so get your thoughts out.

1045
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Okay.

1046
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
First off...

1047
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,200
I forgot what I was going to say.

1048
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,320
This is something completely different.

1049
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,080
I remember last week you guys were talking about actually cell phone games, which was

1050
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,080
kind of odd.

1051
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,120
There's one that I've been following.

1052
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,960
It's actually a fan game.

1053
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:00,200
It's basically Zelda for a cell phone, and I don't have a cell phone, and they don't

1054
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,920
try it, even though there's a cell phone emulator.

1055
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,680
Link, I'm too lazy to go through that.

1056
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,440
This is a homebrew type game, right?

1057
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,560
Somebody made this from scratch.

1058
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,240
I seem to remember we had an article on it a few shows ago.

1059
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,200
This was a long time ago, so you may have missed it, but yeah, I do remember we talked

1060
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,200
about it previously.

1061
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,400
I haven't played it myself, but you know, speaking of mobile games, you know I hate

1062
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,040
mobile games, right?

1063
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,920
I think they all are creepy.

1064
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,160
I actually played one I really liked this week, and you'll never guess what it was.

1065
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,960
Luminous on mobile was actually pretty cool because they made some changes to the basic

1066
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,400
formula of Luminous.

1067
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,720
For instance, there's different types of special pieces, and sometimes they come in three colors,

1068
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,080
and then sometimes the shapes are different.

1069
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,440
They actually changed quite a bit of the basic game mechanics.

1070
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,800
It made it kind of feel a little bit refreshing and different, and for a cell phone, Java

1071
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,640
type game, it actually wasn't bad.

1072
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,920
I was kind of impressed.

1073
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,600
Anyway, that had nothing to do with the game you were talking about.

1074
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,600
I'm sorry.

1075
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,720
I'm sure Zelda on the phone will be cool too.

1076
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,960
Is it out?

1077
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960
When can we get it?

1078
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,760
Well, it's actually a second demo.

1079
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,280
The guy who makes it, he goes on a forum that basically made a forum I hang out at, but

1080
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:10,120
oddly enough to call it Zelda Fan Game Central, so just gc.com.

1081
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:16,120
I posted the link in chat already if you want to take a look at it.

1082
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,120
All right.

1083
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,120
Oh, you posted the link in chat.

1084
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,120
All right.

1085
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,120
I'll check it out.

1086
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,120
We'll see.

1087
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,560
Hey, tell the guy if he wants to come on the show and plug his product.

1088
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
We'll do that.

1089
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
I'm curious.

1090
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
I would love to...

1091
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
I guess I'll ask him.

1092
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,320
But you know the first question I'm going to ask is, why cell phone?

1093
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,320
No, I understand.

1094
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,980
Zelda's a beloved game, and to be able to take it with you on your phone wherever you

1095
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:36,560
go would be pretty cool, I got to admit.

1096
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:37,560
Okay.

1097
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,400
Second off, Halloween was last week, and I really wanted to show my Halloween costume.

1098
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,920
It is gaming related.

1099
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,840
Okay, but this isn't going to be great radio, is it?

1100
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
No.

1101
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
All right.

1102
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
What did you dress up as?

1103
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
Tell us.

1104
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
Okay.

1105
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,640
I'm putting the links in chat.

1106
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:55,960
Okay, there they are.

1107
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,960
All right.

1108
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,400
Let me bring it up.

1109
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,040
This is great radio, Nintendo Maniac 64.

1110
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Might I remind you here?

1111
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,040
Okay.

1112
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,040
All right.

1113
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,240
Explain the costume for the podcast, listeners.

1114
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,240
Okay.

1115
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,440
My name, Nintendo Maniac 64, kind of shows that I am a big entire lover, and other people

1116
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,520
might not know this, that I completely hate Sony.

1117
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,700
You probably already know this guy.

1118
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,960
I do.

1119
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,440
And I wore that at school and things, and most people know that I hate some things on

1120
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,440
PlayStation.

1121
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,440
I went for the irony factor.

1122
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,000
I had a shirt with the PlayStation logo completely made.

1123
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,160
Of masking tape and permanent marker.

1124
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:39,240
Yeah, so you made this PlayStation logo on a shirt, but you're known around town as the

1125
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,240
PlayStation hater.

1126
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,640
It's a well done logo.

1127
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,640
Yeah, you did a pretty good job.

1128
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,720
Why PlayStation 1 and not PS3?

1129
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,360
You went for the old school PS logo.

1130
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,000
Because it's the PlayStation logo.

1131
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
All right.

1132
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, sorry.

1133
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
The PlayStation logo.

1134
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
My bad.

1135
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,560
It has a PS3 on it.

1136
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,720
Congratulations on your ironic costume, Nintendo Maniac 64.

1137
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,620
We got to let you go so we can get some more calls though.

1138
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,620
Have a good one.

1139
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Thanks for calling.

1140
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,620
All right?

1141
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,620
Okay.

1142
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Later.

1143
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,620
All right.

1144
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
We're going to get to some more calls.

1145
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:12,620
Let's go over to this one.

1146
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,620
Hi.

1147
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:14,620
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1148
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:15,620
Who's this?

1149
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:16,620
This is Jason.

1150
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:17,620
Hi, Jason.

1151
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,620
Buddy, our webmaster.

1152
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:19,620
What's up?

1153
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,620
Yay.

1154
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,620
Yay.

1155
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:22,620
We love you.

1156
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:23,620
Whee!

1157
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,620
How's the 800 number going?

1158
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:29,400
You were the one that was the mastermind behind that whole thing, so we really appreciate that.

1159
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:33,640
I know the listeners do, too, and the folks leaving voicemails, so yay, Jason.

1160
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,640
I have a certain complaint.

1161
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,680
I'd like to think it's working pretty well.

1162
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,520
It does seem to be working okay.

1163
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,520
What's on your mind, buddy?

1164
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:47,640
When the E3 article came up, I was kind of thinking about the whole low-word participation

1165
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,320
numbers and all the fun nonsense, and with the whole Xbox, what's it called, XNA.

1166
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,320
Hold on a minute.

1167
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,320
Hold on a minute, buddy.

1168
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,920
Put the car in park for a minute there, buddy.

1169
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:01,440
Isn't it ironic that I told him the 800 number's doing so great and the quality of his call

1170
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,160
right now is kind of crappy, like we're hearing a lot of break-up in there?

1171
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,160
Just the irony factor.

1172
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,160
Sorry, Jason.

1173
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,560
I don't know what else to tell you.

1174
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,560
So E3, yeah?

1175
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:20,120
E3 and the whole low-word participation amongst independent developers, no, low-word participation

1176
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:27,480
in general and not just in general masses, but XNA, Xbox, Microsoft, XNA, the independent

1177
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:33,200
development suite can provide so many more developers in the world that would be eligible

1178
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,520
theoretically to go to E3 or one of these events again.

1179
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,800
So you're saying that Microsoft should consider inviting some of these developers that work

1180
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,800
with the XNA?

1181
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:44,800
Yeah.

1182
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,080
I mean, XNA is a launching point.

1183
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:54,320
You can go so much further beyond there, and if you bring together independent developers

1184
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:57,480
and publishers, I mean, do I really have to go further than that?

1185
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,800
You know, I will say this.

1186
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,640
Microsoft seems to be in touch with their underground audience, so to speak, more than

1187
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,160
a lot of other big gaming companies I've seen, and that, you know, obviously Major Nelson

1188
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,440
has a lot to do with that.

1189
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,920
You know, you might remember at Gamers Developers Conference, they had like the bloggers' breakfasts

1190
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,360
and things, and they had that bus at E3.

1191
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:23,080
They definitely seem to be in touch with the underground media a little more than any other

1192
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,080
company.

1193
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,080
So thank you for that.

1194
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,920
If anyone were to do this, it would probably be them.

1195
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
All right.

1196
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:33,600
And the fact of how much that that can help them on their place in general in XBL, in

1197
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,840
the next couple of years, this whole generation is going to be a really big difference.

1198
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,240
It's going to be very interesting just to see how everything plays out.

1199
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,600
It would be interesting certainly to get all those minds under one roof.

1200
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,600
I definitely agree.

1201
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,720
Jason, the chat room is yelling at me to hang up on you because of the quality.

1202
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:48,800
I'm so sorry.

1203
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,640
We love you anyway.

1204
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,640
We love you, Jason.

1205
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,880
Another one.

1206
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:55,880
Good thought.

1207
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,880
Yeah.

1208
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:57,880
Watch them start kicking people from chat.

1209
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,600
That would be awesome.

1210
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
You what?

1211
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
You're going to talk shit about me?

1212
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,800
Who's talking shit about him right there?

1213
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,800
Let's see.

1214
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:04,800
We have Jason is awesome.

1215
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:05,800
Let's see.

1216
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,800
Stop.

1217
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,800
You fail at calling.

1218
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,760
See, he's going to boot GS68 right there for you fail at calling.

1219
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,600
Oh, he just gave him the middle finger.

1220
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,600
All right.

1221
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,600
Let's go to another call.

1222
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,600
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

1223
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:15,600
Who's this?

1224
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,600
Hola.

1225
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,600
Hey, it's DMN.

1226
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,600
No, really.

1227
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:19,600
It's Ron.

1228
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Hi.

1229
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:21,600
Hi, DMN.

1230
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,600
Hi.

1231
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,600
Hi, DMN, Ronmo.

1232
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,600
What's on your mind?

1233
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,600
Not much.

1234
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,600
I have a quick question for Lokey.

1235
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,600
Lokey, I want to ask you...

1236
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Lokey, are you paying attention?

1237
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,600
Yes.

1238
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
Lokey, boobs.

1239
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,600
Boobs, Lokey, boobs.

1240
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,600
Yeah, what's on your mind?

1241
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Chose a DNA.

1242
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
What's on your mind?

1243
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
All right, Lokey.

1244
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,920
Have you heard anything about Halo 3?

1245
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:45,480
Because a friend of my orchestra, Gamestop, he just told me last week that Microsoft,

1246
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,080
the press release has coming out on November 2007.

1247
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,600
Have you heard anything new since that?

1248
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,120
No, I haven't heard anything new.

1249
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,600
We still have the date as March.

1250
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,920
Has that press release actually come out anywhere?

1251
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,380
No, it has not.

1252
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,380
So your friend...

1253
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,380
I told my friend that.

1254
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,140
Well, so your friend who works at this random Gamestop happens to know the inner workings

1255
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,080
at Microsoft and what they're developing.

1256
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:12,400
You remember when I was talking earlier about elitism with the Gamestop employees?

1257
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,120
I'm thinking we got exhibit A right here.

1258
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,880
He might be dead fucking wrong and you might be right.

1259
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,160
Your Gamestop kid might be right.

1260
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,760
It's November 2007.

1261
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:28,000
But please, he knows what's going on at Microsoft and he knows that Microsoft's cooking up a

1262
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,640
press release right now.

1263
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,640
Please.

1264
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,040
I trust Lokey more than I do Gamestop.

1265
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:38,760
Like I said, I would guess probably Halo 3 is going to be in March and Halo Wars is going

1266
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,760
to be in the holiday.

1267
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,160
It's going to be the November title.

1268
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,800
So that'd be my guess right there because there you got your two Halo games.

1269
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:53,640
You've got one that's just in time for when the PlayStation 3 systems might be available.

1270
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,400
Again, their second big push.

1271
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,080
More of a reason to not go to the Sony side.

1272
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:05,200
And then you have your last Halo game that's probably also going to get like your Fable

1273
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,280
2 and stuff as well also in the holiday season.

1274
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,080
So it's perfect timing for that.

1275
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,720
And plus, the other thing, March being the end of their financial quarter, it makes their

1276
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,760
numbers look good.

1277
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,640
So more people invest in their company.

1278
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,860
That's kind of why they would do it that way because they don't really have a big game

1279
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,760
coming out in March right now.

1280
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:33,520
I think what they have Forza 2 on the line, Crackdown and probably Shadowrun.

1281
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,120
And I think those were all scheduled before June.

1282
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,520
So I don't know.

1283
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,440
I'm still saying March until I hear otherwise.

1284
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,720
I have a question I think so too.

1285
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:49,520
I mean, because I asked him Wait, DarkSaga has a question for you.

1286
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,520
No, no, no.

1287
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,520
He go ahead and finish what you're saying.

1288
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,840
Well, I was saying to him, well, if this is an actual press release, don't you think somebody

1289
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,200
would have leaked it by now?

1290
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
Because I had access for proof.

1291
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,760
He said, no, it's just went through the answer of all the GameStop locations.

1292
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,960
And I've been checking on the sites, nothing about it.

1293
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,000
So I think it's just all smoke.

1294
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,560
He's breaking up now.

1295
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Yeah.

1296
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,400
Well, I got to let you go because you're breaking up hella bad.

1297
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:22,320
But thanks so much for the call and tell your friend he's full of shit.

1298
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,320
Sorry DarkSaga.

1299
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,320
What were you going to ask?

1300
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Maybe he can answer in chat.

1301
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,320
I forget.

1302
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,160
Let me put it this way.

1303
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,480
They have November 1st as a date right now.

1304
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:39,540
Like I know we use, for example, November 1st, 2011 as our default dates in our system

1305
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:43,560
when we don't have a release date, because it's easy to enter in when you're entering

1306
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,000
items into a database and it's 1111111.

1307
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,760
Sorry, I picked up another call.

1308
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,520
Hi, you're on our service.

1309
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,280
Ah, damn that feedback.

1310
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,520
Sorry, I finished your thought.

1311
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,440
I won't pick up another call until you're ready.

1312
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,320
Anyway, so that would be a default date.

1313
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,240
So for example, for them, they might just do 111 and there you go, November 1st.

1314
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,400
And that's what they have on their website right now.

1315
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,680
It's a default placeholder date.

1316
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,080
All right.

1317
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,480
Now let's try another call.

1318
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,480
Sorry.

1319
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,480
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1320
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
Who's this?

1321
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,160
Hey, it's ShadowNextGen in the chat.

1322
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:18,360
Hi, ShadowNextGen.

1323
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,360
What's on your mind, buddy?

1324
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,360
Hey guys, what's going on?

1325
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,360
I just had a couple of-

1326
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,000
No, we're just doing a radio show.

1327
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,800
How about you?

1328
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,200
About Halo 3, I actually agree with Loki.

1329
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,840
And why?

1330
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,800
Because that would also be when basically the quote unquote real launch of the PlayStation

1331
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,920
3 is, you know, when everyone else gets it.

1332
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:46,400
So that would be another good way for Microsoft to hype up the 360.

1333
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,520
Ah, so this comes back to that whole story from years ago where, I don't know who said

1334
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,160
or somebody was rumored that Halo 3-

1335
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,040
That Halo 3 would be there for the PS3 launch.

1336
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,040
Yes, exactly.

1337
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,760
It took the words right out of my mouth.

1338
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,600
So yeah, I'm thinking that's going to be what it is.

1339
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:08,420
So in a way, maybe that kind of happens where it's maybe it goes up against the Euro launch

1340
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:12,160
or like, as you say, when most people will actually be getting the system.

1341
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:16,160
That's kind of an interesting perspective.

1342
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:23,560
And also at the 2005 E3, I actually got to try the Gizmondo and it sucked.

1343
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:25,500
Did you play Johnny Whatever?

1344
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,680
I didn't get to play anything because they were all broken.

1345
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,640
I had a Gizmondo guy right by me and I kept jumping from different systems because I had

1346
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,200
a bunch on display.

1347
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,200
And nothing.

1348
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:40,920
Did you wash your hands after touching them?

1349
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,920
Yeah.

1350
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,240
And I'm totally bringing hand sanitizer to the next big game show.

1351
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:52,400
I never think about that, but think about all that fan funk that's getting on those

1352
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,400
controllers.

1353
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,400
Anyway, sorry.

1354
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,080
Also, yesterday I got to play the Wii because my GameStop had a kiosk.

1355
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,160
And what did you think of the Wii?

1356
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,760
I thought it was very awesome.

1357
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,360
It was very awesome.

1358
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:06,320
What games did you play?

1359
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:11,800
I got to try out Excite Truck and then a couple of the other features like the photo channel

1360
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,340
and the Mii channel, things like that.

1361
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:18,480
You know, I had some friends get, one of my friends post on LiveJournal about this.

1362
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,400
They got kicked out of a GameStop because they were making a Hitler Mii.

1363
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,400
I'm like, you stupid.

1364
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,400
Really?

1365
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,400
Yeah.

1366
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,760
Apparently the guy came up behind him and like, you can't do that, you know, that whole

1367
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,760
thing.

1368
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,760
Yeah.

1369
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,760
You guys are hella dumb.

1370
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
Anyway.

1371
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,760
Yeah.

1372
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,880
And it just made me excited for when I go get mine on midnight on Saturday.

1373
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,880
Hi.

1374
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:40,480
Where are you going to go camp out at?

1375
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,480
Uh, nowhere.

1376
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,880
I have a pre-order of GameStop.

1377
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,160
Well, look at you go.

1378
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,160
Well, congratulations.

1379
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,360
You're going to call in next week and tell us all about it?

1380
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Yeah.

1381
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,360
Well, definitely that and Twilight Princess.

1382
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:51,360
All right.

1383
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,360
Well, until then, have a good week.

1384
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,360
Thanks for your call.

1385
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,360
All right, buddy?

1386
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,360
Yeah.

1387
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,360
Thanks.

1388
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,360
All right.

1389
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,360
Good luck with the Wii.

1390
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Have fun.

1391
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,360
Wii.

1392
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,360
Yeah.

1393
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,360
This is the one that had the bad feedback earlier.

1394
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Hi.

1395
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,360
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1396
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,640
Hi.

1397
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,480
This is Did You Lose A Sock.

1398
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:08,480
Hi, Did You Lose A Sock.

1399
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,500
I, we're getting a little feedback.

1400
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,500
Get away from the screen.

1401
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,500
Is that better?

1402
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,500
A little bit, yes.

1403
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:16,500
What's on your mind?

1404
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,500
What's on your mind?

1405
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:02,180
Um, which is a better game, Pen

1406
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:22,740
Fears of Wars or Vivapinata?

1407
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,680
I can't say because I haven't played Vivapinata.

1408
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:33,680
Do you think Viva Pinata promotes violence against flamboyant animals?

1409
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,680
I'm going to write to Glaad and tell them to ban Viva Pinata.

1410
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,680
One more call.

1411
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,680
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1412
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,680
Hey, it's Paradox Vincent.

1413
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,680
Hi, Paradox Vincent. What's on your mind?

1414
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:18,680
I was just thinking. A while ago, I was watching this thing.

1415
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:23,680
And it was somebody at Microsoft. I want to say Peter Moore.

1416
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,680
Ah, yes, our good buddy Michael Moore, yeah.

1417
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:34,680
Yeah. And he was talking about how he wanted to take a more unified stance.

1418
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:41,680
This is before the Xbox 360 was even kind of. This is back, you know, last generation.

1419
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:46,680
I was taking more of a unified stance towards gaming.

1420
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:55,680
And how this has been the most competitive cycle yet.

1421
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:02,680
Wait, and what did Mandy Moore mean by unified gaming?

1422
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:12,680
Well, they were saying that they didn't want to attack Sony. They didn't want to attack Nintendo.

1423
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:22,680
Yeah, but this cycle is so competitive. I just think it's kind of eating away at itself.

1424
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:29,680
Hasn't Peter Jackson been the source of comments against Sony at some point?

1425
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,680
Didn't Peter Pan do that?

1426
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:36,680
I don't remember that.

1427
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:42,680
In all seriousness, it was just recently campaign season.

1428
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,680
It kind of reminds me of campaign season.

1429
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:49,680
Where everyone starts out and says, oh yeah, we're going to have a nice clean fight.

1430
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:53,680
And we're not going to run any negative campaign ads against the competition.

1431
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,680
And then suddenly a month later,

1432
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,680
Drew Nami is running for Congress.

1433
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:04,680
And did you know, when he was younger, he really liked candy?

1434
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,680
Do not elect Drew Nami.

1435
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,680
Paid for by Rob Roberts for President campaign.

1436
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:12,680
You see all those negative ads all over.

1437
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,680
They always start off like, oh yeah, it's going to be a clean fight.

1438
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,680
Because we don't want anyone to talk shit about us.

1439
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:24,680
But then somebody throws down the gauntlet and now we all talk smack about each other.

1440
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,680
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1441
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:28,680
I know what I mean, too.

1442
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,680
Thanks so much for the call, Paradox Vincent. We appreciate it.

1443
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,680
Anything else you want to say to our listeners?

1444
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,680
No, not really.

1445
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,680
All right, well have a good one.

1446
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:43,680
Have fun playing with your PS3 or Wii, whatever you end up getting this weekend, if either one at all.

1447
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,680
Yeah, I think I'm going to buy the Wii.

1448
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,680
All right, have fun with your Wii.

1449
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,680
All right.

1450
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,680
Thank you guys so much for calling in to our program tonight. We appreciate it.

1451
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:59,680
And that's going to lead us to the part of the show where I ask if we have any last minute stories.

1452
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,680
Anybody have anything last minute they wanted to get in?

1453
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:11,680
Bandit did link me a Knights 2 trailer that's fan made that I just want to say is absolutely fantastically cool.

1454
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:16,680
But it is fan made, just so that nobody freaks out.

1455
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,680
I do have one last release date for those of us who are still WoW addicts.

1456
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,680
Blizzard made a press release earlier this week.

1457
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:31,680
The official release date for World of Warcraft The Burning Crusade is going to be January 17th, 2006.

1458
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,680
So you guys won't have to wait for much longer. Hopefully they'll fix that broken beta.

1459
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,680
I was going to say, in other words, the beta's ending.

1460
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,680
Your free time's almost up.

1461
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,680
So anyways, I've got some more stories, of course.

1462
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:51,680
Start off here with Saints Rogue getting an actual download for some more multiplayer maps.

1463
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,680
And it's only going to cost you 80 Microsoft points, or $1.

1464
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,680
So for a couple maps, that's a pretty good price.

1465
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,680
So I'm glad of that.

1466
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:05,680
We mentioned the ESRB leaked some titles for the Virtual Console.

1467
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,680
There's actually a little bit more than what we mentioned.

1468
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:14,680
Including Excitebike, Ice Climber, Dr. Mario, Mario Brothers, Ice Hockey, and Soccer.

1469
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,680
And for the Super Nintendo Mario RPG, Legend of the Seven Stars.

1470
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,680
That's hot.

1471
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,680
Fuck yeah.

1472
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:24,680
Kirby Super Star, Super Metroid, and Kirby's Dream Land 3.

1473
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:29,680
For the Nintendo 64, Mario Kart 64, Star Fox 64, and Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.

1474
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,680
Sweet, Toad's Highway.

1475
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,680
So that is pretty sweet right there.

1476
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:40,680
Of course, there was some estimates on the Playstation 3 and how much money Sony's going to lose from this.

1477
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,680
Merrill Lynch is another one of those people talking about the PS3.

1478
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:51,680
And they're saying that Sony will lose $6.5 billion on the Playstation 3 launch.

1479
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,680
That's a lot of money.

1480
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:57,680
It's Toad's Turnpike, I'm being corrected by Nintendo Maniac, of course.

1481
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:58,680
Sorry.

1482
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:11,680
Anyways, you might have heard earlier this week that Glenn Entus of EA was talking a little bit about Gears of War and saying how there's no actual innovation in the gameplay.

1483
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:20,680
While he's also on the record saying that Final Fantasy, the modeling fidelity might get a little bit better with the Playstation 3.

1484
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:24,680
But in other words, the game models aren't going to look any more realistic.

1485
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,680
It's all about physics.

1486
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,680
Did he see the same trailer I did?

1487
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,680
He's an idiot.

1488
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:41,680
Let's see here, there was also a teaser poster released for the brand new Paul W. S. Anderson Castlevania film, and it sucks balls.

1489
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,680
Yeah, it looked very boring.

1490
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,680
Now, hey, I get it, it's a castle!

1491
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:56,680
Anyways, we know that November 19th marks the launch of the Burger King, Xbox 360, and Xbox games, including Snake King.

1492
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,680
Most anticipated games of the year.

1493
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,680
Yes, but that's not where it stops.

1494
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:10,680
In fact, Kellogg's, Cereal, and Xbox are teaming up for some brand new games that are going to be coming out soon.

1495
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:18,680
And apparently you're going to be able to get some promo games and some 30-day trial to Gamefly.

1496
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,680
Froot Loops the game!

1497
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,680
So that's kind of interesting.

1498
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:34,680
As we mentioned before, you were saying how Sony, their online service, well they have PTV for the Playstation download service where you're going to be able to download videos and stuff.

1499
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:42,680
Right now they don't currently have any extra content on there, but you can download some free trailers including stuff for like Underworld Evolution and that kind of thing.

1500
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
So that's kind of neat.

1501
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,680
And then finally...

1502
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,680
Come play my new Xbox 360 game, it's great!

1503
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:58,680
The last bit of information of course comes for the Playstation 3, and they were serious when they were talking about that you would be able to install other operating systems on top of that.

1504
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:05,680
In fact, you can actually get the binaries now for a Linux version that you can put on your Playstation 3.

1505
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:13,680
And that's all available actually on Playstation's website on www.playstation.com slash ps3 dash open platform.

1506
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,680
So that's kind of neat.

1507
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,680
That's it.

1508
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,680
Two scoops of raisins in this Xbox 360 game.

1509
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:30,680
Scoop King. Poop Scoop King.

1510
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,680
What else can we put in the cereal?

1511
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:39,680
On that note, I obviously need to stop eating sugar coated cereal and end the program.

1512
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:43,680
This is the part of the program where we go around and get everybody's final thought.

1513
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:48,680
Drew Nami, thanks so much as always for being here tonight. What's your final thought?

1514
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:51,680
Pie.

1515
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:55,680
And Tiara, thank you for coming to visit and I hope you had fun.

1516
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,680
And I appreciate your moral support of Orange Lounge Radio.

1517
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,680
Any final thoughts for our listeners?

1518
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,680
War is over, if you want it.

1519
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,680
Aww, I like that.

1520
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:11,680
Loki, my final thought is we better be coming in on Thursday.

1521
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:16,680
Nintendo, better not delay any shipments or I will kill you.

1522
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:24,680
My final thought is reject false icons.

1523
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,680
I love to do that just to piss her off every once in a while.

1524
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:37,680
My final thought is I heart you, Jamie. Heart, heart, heart, love, love.

1525
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:44,680
Your final thought, Dark Sakura?

1526
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:46,680
Gwar.

1527
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,680
Gwar? I love Gwar.

1528
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,680
Gwar!

1529
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,680
She's holding a grudge.

1530
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:57,680
Shut up, okay? You! No more ever jokes are allowed in this room by Drew Nami.

1531
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,680
You have to go make them in the bathroom.

1532
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:02,680
He said I was holding a grudge.

1533
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,680
I'll show you a grudge. I'll beat you with a ferret.

1534
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:09,680
Just another love-filled episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

1535
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,680
Thank you guys so much for downloading and supporting independent podcasting as always,

1536
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:15,680
even on strange nights like this one.

1537
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,680
We appreciate you sticking by us.

1538
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,680
Have a great week.

1539
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,680
Hey, next week, crazy system launches.

1540
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:27,680
John, aka DMN, is going to be here next week to talk about the Wii with us

1541
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,680
and since it's likely that we'll have a Wii in the house one way or the other,

1542
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,680
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of freaking people here getting their excite truck on,

1543
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:36,680
so it's sure to be a clusterfuck event,

1544
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,680
which is good because after that we're going to go into a couple weeks of pre-taped shows.

1545
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,680
Sorry about that, but we have some busy holiday stuff coming up.

1546
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,680
We'll talk more about that next week.

1547
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:48,680
Until then, thanks a lot for tuning into and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1548
