00:00.000 --> 00:03.000

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
We're the hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and Multi

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight, November 19th, 2006

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Our own stories from the console lineups

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
A recent horror game causes controversy in Rome

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And for those not ready to go to next gen

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
There's Dreamcast love coming for ya

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
And welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
We are that video game radio program

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
And tonight's probably going to be a little bit of randomness too

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Because we have a very very full house

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Say hi everyone

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hi

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
We've got a very full house tonight

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Obviously it's a big big week for gaming

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
So let's get right into it

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
First let's introduce ourselves

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm one of your co-hosts

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Rob Roberts

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Say hello as well to Miss Dark Sakura

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Jamie Summers

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Bwar

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
How you doing?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
So freaking worn out

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
You're worn out?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
You're tired?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Exhausted?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Well somebody was asleep in his warm bed

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Alright we'll get to that in a minute

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Hello

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
How you doing sir?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I'm doing fine

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Alright, right on

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Joining us tonight

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
We have a variety of special guests

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
First let's introduce those folks that you know

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You've met before

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
And you know quite well

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Say hello over there to Drunami

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
What's up?

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Or as he might be called tonight

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Drunawee

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I don't know

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
Wee

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Alright

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Say hello to the Orange Lounge Radio

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
One and only lesbian

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Say hello to Chris

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
The official lesbian

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
The official lesbian

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Well you have to share that title with Magsy

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
She's the roaming lesbian

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
She's the roaming?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
I'm the in-house lesbian

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh I see

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
You're our in-house

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
She's our field lesbian

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Yeah she's the field lesbian

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
From the far off land of Wisconsin

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Or the Isle of Lesbos

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
As I was saying over dinner

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Alright

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Alright anyway

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Also say hello to somebody who's come from a long way away

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Certainly not the Isle of Lesbos

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
But the Isle of Redmond Washington

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Say hello to Mr. DMN John

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Hi everybody

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
And you guys know John

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Because he calls into our show like all the freaking time

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh I don't

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
And yes you do

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
And now he's here in studio

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
With us

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
I'm gonna

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
I'm actually gonna call

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
When the sky blinds open

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
What

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
What

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
I'm gonna do it right now hold on

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
No no no no no

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
No no no

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
And where do you work for our first time?

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
I work at the magical land where Wii's flow like wine Nintendo

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Really?

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yes

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Last I checked

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I sometimes have Wii flow when I drink a lot of wine but I don't

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Alright forget it bad joke

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Look you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
You're all gonna just die

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
So anyway well welcome to the show DMN

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Thank you thank you for having me

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And you know just having him here in the studio

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
And like hanging out with us all weekend

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
It just proves Orange Launch Radio listeners

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Stalking us works

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
It really does

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Yeah

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Here he is

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
And he violated me last night

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
And it was no I'm just kidding

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm totally chill

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
That's not what you said

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
You were

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
You were

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Can I say that?

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
And it's a family show boys and girls

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Sort of

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
I know it's not really

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
No it's not

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Alright look

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
I know we might have gotten some new listeners this week

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
You know not just because you know iTunes

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
And all the great reviews you guys have been leaving for us there

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I've been you know up in our ranking and stuff

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
And XB stream and the cool people over there at us

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Default podcasts

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Just everywhere else we've been listed

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
And then locally this week we got some support as well

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
We'll talk about that in a little bit

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
So if you're new to Orange Launch Radio

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And want to say hey and welcome

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
And we're just a program

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
We go on for like two and a half three hours

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
We're gamers just like the rest of you guys

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
We don't get paid for this

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
At least not yet

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
We've been doing this almost five years

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
In May it'll be five years

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
So about four and a half years we've been doing this

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
We started as a program dedicated to

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Dance Dance Revolution

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
And music based video games

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Parappa amplitude things of that nature

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
But you know we found that

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
It kind of ended up being a little too limiting

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Especially when there was a very slow period

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Think of the period before DDR Supernova

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Before Guitar Hero

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
There was a very slow period of music gaming

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
So we thought you know we're video game nuts first

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So we started doing a general video game show

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
So that's where we're at now

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Because we're all nerds

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
And we invite you guys to be nerdy with us

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
So please come to our chat room

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
If you're listening to us live here on Sunday night

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
If you're not listening to us on our audio blog

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
You can come join us in the chat room

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It's chat.orangelaunchradio.com

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
And guess what

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
If you're listening live on this Sunday night

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
You definitely want to be here tonight

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Because DMN what did you bring with you

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
For one of our random chatters tonight?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I brought a Wii

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Not my Wii you sickos

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Get your head out of the gutter

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
No a Wii and a box with the Wii Sports

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And all that fun stuff

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
And I do know we have a worldwide audience

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
But it should be said

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is a US region Wii

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah this is a region one Wii

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
So I'm really sorry to all you

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
Japanese, South American, Antarctica

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
European listeners

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
It probably won't do you much good

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
But if you want to win it that badly

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
You gotta be in chat

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
It's gonna be at some point tonight

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
More rules to come later

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
But first

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
We usually start off the show with a little bit of

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
How was your gaming week

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
But obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
By other madness going on out there

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And that would be the craziness going on around

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
The Playstation 3 and Wii lineups

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So first off, Playstation 3

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
I know a lot of us here in this room

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Weren't really gonna do the campout thing

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
For the Playstation 3

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
You know I've voiced previously on the program

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
I'm not ready for Playstation 3

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It's just there's no game out right now

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I really want

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Wake me when Metal Gear Solid 4

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Final Fantasy 13

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Some of the big franchises are on their way

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
But I'm not into PS3 right now

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I think Loki's in a very similar camp

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But DarkSakura has expressed on a previous show

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That she was already signed up

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Thanks to her husband for a Playstation 3

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
So what happened?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
How did that go down?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Did he just bring it home magically one day

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
Or did you guys wait anywhere?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
No because it was an employee purchase

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
It's gonna be on the next shipment

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Which is fair

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
You know he got to reserve it first

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
We were guaranteed one

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
But now Dan's like

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Maybe I'm just gonna cancel my reserve

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm like the hell you will

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Wait you see

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't understand DarkSakura

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Cause you tend to go back and forth

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You're like some days you're very anti-PlayStation

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Some days you're very like

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You better bring me that damn Playstation

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
No

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
I hate it okay

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
I hate it

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
But I have to have every video game system

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
That comes out

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I see

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
So it's the collector in me that says

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I want

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
And besides that I'm gonna play White Knights

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
When it's out

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
And

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Why the hate for Sony Playstation right now?

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Cause Ken Kuragi eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
And is leased to the jungle gym

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I see

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I see

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Thank you Magsy

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But certain games are gonna change your mind

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Like White Knights and things are gonna change your mind later

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Well White Knights I definitely wanna play

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
There's a few other things that I'm sorta curious about

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
But right now not curious enough

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
That I would go out and wait in line for a PS3

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Wow

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm going to interview him Monday

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Was your coworker

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Now was your coworker

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Now this is a lot of controversy going around around the Playstation 3 launch

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Did your coworker actually wait in the line to get a Playstation 3 to play

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Or were they getting one to sell

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
He was getting one to play

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh well that's admirable

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
He got Madden

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Okay I see

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
So sports game fan you know obviously

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah I can see that if you're a hardcore sports game

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
You wanna have the up graphics and all that cool stuff

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
That comes with you know the new system

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Okay I see that

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Alright so more to come on Playstation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
And you know I can say this

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I did touch the demo station they had at Target

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I randomly went to Target on I think it was Wednesday I went there

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
Wednesday night I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Like shampoo and stuff

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And there was already a line forming for the Playstation 3

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
And I just said hi

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
I was like Playstation 3 right

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
They're all yeah

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So you know they were you know having fun just camping out

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
I didn't ask the eBay question but I went in the store

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
And they actually had a demo station there to play

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
So I picked up MotorStorm

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And just played that a little bit

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
And I gotta be honest guys I'm not feeling it

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I don't know maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I mean again I'm playing this in a Target

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm not sitting down on my couch

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
My you know surround and the HD and all that stuff

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I just I wasn't feeling it

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I feel like I don't know burnouts more of a racer for me

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Or even test drive was better

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
I just wasn't feeling the MotorStorm

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
I mean granted it's a different

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's you know a very different type of racer

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
But even it felt kind of slow to me

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Kind of clunky I don't know

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
So I wasn't really feeling the love with MotorStorm

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
I'm sorry to say

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
I did see the basketball game which is NBA 07 yes

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
And that looked very nice

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I thought it was a very good looking game

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
And pretty slick

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
So if I were going to be getting a Playstation 3 at launch

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
That would because you know I like basketball more than any other sport

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
That probably is the game I would pick up

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
It would be that game but

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Yeah well I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
The sports gamers and the hardcore

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Because you usually see the people who

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Especially the sports games who just come

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And will buy it without hesitation

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
They always have the stupid Madden day

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Where people I've heard camp out for it

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
If that is the case

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
It's kind of sad but

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Yeah I see your point

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Well so that was pretty much Playstation 3

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Loki did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
Did you play a demo station or anything

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I watched I went by the best buy actually

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Today it was funny because I went down there

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
And it was completely dead and the station was open

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
I saw MotorStorm but I mean it looks exactly the same

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
When I saw it at E3

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Although the videos I've seen online look really cool

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
And it made me want to get it at some point

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
But I don't know

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Then we saw that lair demonstration thing going on

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
At Walmart that was frozen on Saturday

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
So yeah I don't really know

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
How well the demo kiosks were working

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
But at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
So I don't know

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Alright well let's go to the chat room

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Over at chat.orangelandtrader.com

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
For some comments from our chatters

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
They're like the invisible guests

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
We love to be an interactive show

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Let's see

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
JeremyTau1 says

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mirror toy?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Not when there's a profit to be made

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
As some people found out with Playstation 3

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
That was really their mirror motivation

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
It's like hey I make more money doing this than I do at my job

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I don't know

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Me personally I don't know

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The little angel that sits on my shoulder says

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Not a good idea

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So I don't do it

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
BlackLab in our chat room says

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
We have some crazy news about those Playstation 3 lines

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
We'll get to a little bit later

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Okay so after the Playstation 3 launch

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Obviously then the Wii line started forming

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
And that's kind of where we come in

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Because I think we've also voiced previously on the program

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
That we have played Wii

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Wii is the cheaper option

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
And as we said earlier in the program

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
You know we do this show as a hobby not a job

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
So you know our day jobs only give us so much money

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
So the Wii is really realistically

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
In my eyes the more affordable console anyway

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
But Loki you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
You had a Wii before a lot of people did

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
How did this happen?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
Because I work for a video and game distributor

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
And of course we get ours in early

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
Like on Wednesdays when we got them in

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
So that we could ship them to our customers

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So that they would have them for the street date

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
And me being the greedy bastard that I am

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And so I had mine on Thursday

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
And playing it ever since

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So you know what this meant boys and girls

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Party at Loki's house on Friday

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
So right on

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
So yeah we played a little bit of the Wii there

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
So then flash forward to last night

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
When the real camping started

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Some of us were at dinner

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And we were at Strings

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
And this little local Italian place

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I keep forgetting we're an international show

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
So not everybody knows that

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
And we were just sitting around

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
And I don't know like lightning just kind of struck

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And we were just kind of like

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Dude let's go like buy cookies and orange soda

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
And go around to lines and just hand out goodies

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Let's just go and like talk to gamers

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
And Loki can tape it

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Maybe we can do a YouTube thing

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
And we'll just hand him stuff

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Because you know you read all those reports

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
About people getting shot and stuff

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
But we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
That a lot more people were being very cordial

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
So we were like

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Let's go have fun

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Let's go meet some more nerds

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
So we did

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
We hit up

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
We started at a local Target

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
We went to a Walmart

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
We went to GameStop

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Where people were lining up for the midnight launch

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
That they already had pre-ordered

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
We went to another Target

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
The Great Land or Super Target

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Whatever it's called

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
We went to like a Best Buy

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Circuit City

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
We went all around

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
We went to Toys R Us too

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
That was fun

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Yeah the one guy at Toys R Us

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
That looked very scary

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
He was like throw the cookie and drive

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
DMN what did you think about our little experience

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Doing the Cookie Patrol?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
I thought that was a lot of fun

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
You got to interact with a lot of people

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I honestly think that most of those people in that line

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Were there to play it

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Not to eBay it

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Where as opposed to the PS3 people

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Are thinking

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Oh I can make double what I bought off this

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
A lot of these people were really good in line

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
They had a lot of fun

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
They seemed to be very grateful for the cookies

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
So if any of you are listening

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Hi and we love you

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Alright very cool

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
So anyway

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
One of our favorite lines

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Now we liked a lot of the people that we met

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
I mean it was kind of weird

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Because we would walk up at first

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
And some people were like

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
What are these guys going to do to us

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Do they have BB guns

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Or what's going to happen

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
You're poisoning the cookies Rob

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
You're poisoning the cookies

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
So you can get your weegee

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
That was my running joke throughout the whole night

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Is that people went you know

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I'd say oh the cookie

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
The arsenic in the cookies

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Will kick in about 15 minutes

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Have your wallets out

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Wait wait wait

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Arsenic?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
I thought it was laxative

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Whatever it was I don't know

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Whatever the joke was

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So we went to all these people

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
We met a lot of great people

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
But we

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I don't know what it was

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
About the line to target Great Land

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But maybe it was the fact that like

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Somebody in that line there

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Actually listened to the program

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
And like knew who we were

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
And that was kind of cool

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
And then there was just a

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Like there was another girl

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
That you ended up giving your hat to

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Right

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Even though everybody everywhere

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Was asking for your wee hat

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
My jacket too

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
God

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
What made you give it to that girl

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
She seemed really genuinely interested in the wee

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And she seemed pretty hardcore

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Right on

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah she was

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
And so getting back into this

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
Where Chris and Jamie

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
No it's cool it's cool

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
So I called Jamie on my phone

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Because I really

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I asked the target Great Land line

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
I go

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
How many units are you guys getting here

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
And they're like 60

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
And I'm looking at the line

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm like

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
There's only like 25 people in this line

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
This is like a great opportunity to line up

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So I called Jamie on my cell

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
And I said

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
Girl if you want a wee

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Get your butt down here

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
You can get a wee

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
So what happened

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
I interrupted something you were doing

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Somebody else had

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
This was just basically me being exhausted already

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
And somebody else said

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Oh yeah

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
The target Great Lands are doing

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
The target Great Lands are doing a midnight launch

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Which part of my brain went bullshit

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But the rest of me was so tired

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
That I was like

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
Yeah I'm gonna go

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
We were actually

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
My friend Marissa

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Who I mentioned on the show a few times

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
She was in town

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
And she's a singer-songwriter from LA

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
And there was a

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Singer-songwriter convention going on

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Just actually a few

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
At the

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
What was it

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
The Marriott

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah the Marriott

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
It was the Marriott

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Chris we don't need to tell them all where I live

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
Sorry

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
That's alright

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So we were

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
You know we were exhausted

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
It was very claustrophobic

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
They had blocked off an entire section

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Just for the musicians

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
And everyone was like

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
Oh man

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
And then Jamie calls me on my phone

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
She's like

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
Where are you

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
I'm like

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
I'm at the end of the hall

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
She's like

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
We need to go to Target

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Right now

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
I'm like

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Are you sick or something

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
I was just like

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Where am I gonna get a wee

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
I'm like

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Okay

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
And since I'm hanging out with her

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
I kind of

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
She's my ride

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
And I wasn't really expecting

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
To get one

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
And part of me was excited too

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
About because Megsy called earlier

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Oh yeah Megsy

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
And was humping her wee

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah she's like

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm touching it

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I'm touching it

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Ah

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
That was her on the phone

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
It was really really funny

16:12.000 --> 16:16.240
Funny enough that's not the first time they had that conversation

16:16.240 --> 16:19.000
I was getting all excited and all that

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
So we

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
You had wee fever

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
We ran down there

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
Weaver fever

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
We pulled up to the

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Weevil

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
We pulled up to the line

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
And Jamie rolled down the window

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
And screamed out

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Orange Little Dream

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
And someone at the front yelled

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Dark Sakura

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
It was really really funny

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
And then she parked and said

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Can we hang out with you guys

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
And then someone like

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
She wasn't really in the zone

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
So let me clarify

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Dark Sakura used her celebrity to cut in line

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Yeah

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
You're a bitch Jamie

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm not a bitch

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
No no

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
She wouldn't have done it if

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I mean they were getting 60

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
And there was only like 20 people in line

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
So you know nobody was getting hurt so

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
But we ended up going there

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
And slowly it dawned on me

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
This is not a midnight launch

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Cause it was like a half an hour till midnight

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
It was like 1130 something

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
And it was

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
And Jamie

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I'm like Jamie

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
This isn't a midnight launch

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
She's like

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
It's not

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
So we ended up

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
I was

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I was

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Again already tired of having been around that many people

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
It was really claustrophobic

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
We were with Marissa

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
But we jumbled things around

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
We ended up

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
What we were gonna do

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Is we were gonna go back

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Wait with them until morning

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
This is like at one o'clock

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
We were gonna wait with them

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
And then at one point

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I was gonna go for coffee and donuts

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Which started off really weird

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
I just like

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Cause we had to leave and go get stuff

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
And I'm like

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Does anybody want anything while I'm gone?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And someone's like

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
The eyes kind of looked and went

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Huh?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Someone's getting something?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
I'm like

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Does anyone want coffee?

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And everybody went

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Me?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
I think one thing we've kind of discovered

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
Through this whole process

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Is that

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
People are really not used to

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Other people just wanting to do nice things for them

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Everyone was so shocked

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
That I offered to get

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
Someone actually brought up their money

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
I'm like

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
No no it's on me

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
And they're like all

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
They looked at me with like the weirdest look

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Like I was giving them a razor

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
It was so

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yeah that kind of razor

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Like killing killing yourself razor

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Not the phone

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
But it's

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
So

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
By the time we got back

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
And we waited for

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Until like

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Like 3.30

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I said

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Alright I'm gonna go get coffee

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And I counted how many people were in line

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
And it was like

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Something like

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Just under 30

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
But to be safe I said 35

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
So I went to the shell station

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Down the street

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
And said

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I need 35 cups of coffee

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
And they

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
They gave me

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
They gave me free

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
A powdered creamer

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
And free sugar

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
You know the stuff that they have

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
For that store only

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
For the shell station

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Cause like if you buy

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
35 cups of coffee

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
You get this free

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
I'm like

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Okay

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
So

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
I got some other creamer

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
And I came back

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
And everyone was like

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Oh coffee

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
They were really really really happy

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
I'm like courtesy

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Of Orange Land Jameo

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Yeah nice pimping for the show by the way

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Props to Chris

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
I mean she

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
She did this for no reason

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Other than she just thought it would be fun

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
To just buy people coffee

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
That's actually the reason why I was in line

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Is I was looking forward to the fact

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
Actually I was really tired

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I was more tired than Jamie

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm like

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
Do I really want to wait outside

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
But then I offered to get coffee

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And it's just the light in people's eyes

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Went

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
And so I said

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Okay I get coffee

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
But it didn't end there

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Because you got doughnuts too

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
How did you

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
I got crispy

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
I got

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I got six

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Well what happened was

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
I had bought too much coffee

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
And right

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
There's

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Where the Target is

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
There's a Best Buy

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Just like

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
In the same parking structure

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
So I'm like

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Well I've got too much coffee

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
So I'm gonna go see if they want some coffee

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
And sure enough

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
The

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Oh my gosh

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
That line

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah when we went to Best Buy

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
With the cookies

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
They were running from the back

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
To the front

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I'm like

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Dude we're gonna come up the line

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
They were cool

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
I like the Best Buy line too

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
They had a big sign that said

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
We spawn's here

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
And I asked the guy

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
I'm like

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
What the hell does that mean

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
And they're like

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Get it

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Because it's gonna spawn here

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
In a couple hours

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I'm like

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh my god

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Meanwhile

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
And I thought

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
I was a nerd for doing a radio program

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
On the internet

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Meanwhile while Chris is running around

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
In my car

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Which I'm like

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
My baby

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Your baby's fine

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Some kid asked to borrow my DS

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
And then I pulled up my micro

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
To play

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh can I play your micro

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
What's this

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
So I had to explain the micro

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
This is a dead system basically

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Here

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
And play

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
I have Puzzle Fighter

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
What else do you have

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Uh

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I have Kingdom Hearts

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
I wanna play Puzzle Fighter

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Anyway

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
So uh

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
Yeah

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
So I got too much coffee

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I went over to the Best Buy line

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
And they swarmed me

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I'm like

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
I'm coming back

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
I had to make

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
I think five trips

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
To Shell Station

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Oh my god

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
To get that much cups of coffee

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
And then I'm like

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Does it

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
And then I called out

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Does anyone want donuts

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Everyone perked up

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Donuts

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
There was a security guard at Best Buy

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
And he was like

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Oh can you get me the cream filled one

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
The security guard was so cute

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
He looked so tired

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
And he's like

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Oh he's like

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Can you get me a coffee

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
I'm like

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
Yeah I'm coming back with more

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
And um

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
People just liked it

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
I bought six dozen donuts

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
And six dozen plus one for the guard

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
I got the little

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I made sure I got him the cream

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
That is so cute

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
And all the time I said

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
You gave mad pimpage to our show Chris

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
And for that we love you

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
But you weren't doing it just

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
The promo for the show was just a bonus right

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Yeah well I was

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
You know I'm not really on this show that often

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
But I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Because I was hanging out with Jamie

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
And I really wanted to you know

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It's like you guys have been sweet to me

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
So I figured hey you know

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's like I'm doing something nice

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm here representing your show

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
So here by from here on out folks

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
We're gonna refer to Chris as Saint Chris

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Because she

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
No she did this out of the goodness of our she

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
She went and got donuts and coffee

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
For two lines

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
Of people waiting for the wee

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
So a little gesture goes a long way

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
So good for you Chris

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
We love you

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
They look so cool

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
But they looked at me crazy

22:06.000 --> 22:07.000
Some guy went up to me and goes

22:07.000 --> 22:08.000
Why are you doing this

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
And this is like

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Well you guys look cold

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
The goodness of my heart

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
Doesn't factor in at all

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
But you know

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Guys there's a couple old people

22:19.000 --> 22:20.000
In the Best Buy line

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
And they were so grateful for that coffee

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
It made my day

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Dude one guy in the Great Land line

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Had a beer

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
I saw that

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
Somebody offered it back

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
There was a guy there who said

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Hey he's really cool

22:31.000 --> 22:32.000
You know we were talking about like

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
ThinkGeek and different t-shirts

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
And you know

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
The joys of Firefox

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
And he's like

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
I got some beer if you want some

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
And I was like

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
What kind?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Bass

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Oooh

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
Because for anyone who doesn't know

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
I love beer a lot

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
And I'm trying to cut down on my beer

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Consumption

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
So I was sorely tempted

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
I was like

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Bass

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
I love you

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Give me beer

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Oh wait no

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Because the whole problem with that is

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
The guys are going around the corner to pee

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
I don't have the equipment

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
To go around the corner and pee

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Well you could

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
No

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
But it's just not a cemetery

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
No

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Okay I'm in an awkward position on the floor

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
Right next to Rob's legs

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
But somebody in the chatroom asked me

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
How much money I spent

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I can't tell who that is

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Footy something?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Oh footy monster probably

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
Footy monster

23:28.000 --> 23:29.000
They asked me how much money I spent

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
Enough

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Enough

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
It was my money though

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
So Orange Lounge will continue to

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Spend all of the money that they get

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
On our crackin' booths

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
On your crackin' booths

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
I would also like to add something

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
That's kind of funny

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
According to nextgenwars.com

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Uh

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
It looks like Wii is beating up PlayStation 3

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
Well they have more units at launch

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
I mean that's kind of

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I mean to be fair

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
Well they

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
I mean they've basically got a greater market share

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Well we'll see

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
We'll see

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
I mean we'll see

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
It's still a long ways to go

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
It's still a long ways to go

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
I mean I'm not

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
I'm just trying to be fair

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Extifer I brought you in for a minute

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
My roommate Extifer

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Who's co-host on the Wednesday show

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
Who's a little sick from camping out

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
All this morning

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Yeah

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
Now you went and met

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Jamie

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
And Chris at one point

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
I slept in his car

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
I did

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
I was hopped up on AMD

24:15.000 --> 24:16.000
That's fine

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
At the time

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
No

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
Extifer was really cool

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Because I had pretty much

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Roto

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
I didn't feel like camping out

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
And I was like

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
You know

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
I like my warm bed

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I'll just pick up a Wii

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
At the second shipment

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
They're gonna keep coming

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm cool

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
But Extifer was like

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
I'll get him out

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
If you want one

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
I'm like

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Okay

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Here's money

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Have fun

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
So you did it

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I love spending money

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
When it's somebody else's

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
I do

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
I found that

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Spending money

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
When it's not your own

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Is very

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It's a very nice thing

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Now

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Before I forget

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
By the way

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Bandit sent me the link

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
Okay

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
I gotta start wrapping this up

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
So we can keep getting into game news

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
But

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I've heard on other podcasts

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I wanna say it was

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
It was one of the other all game shows

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
I wanna say it was

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
Alon from Chatterbox

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
I apologize if I'm misappropriating this

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
But

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
He had a horrible target experience

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
With the Xbox 360

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Like

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
They gave out tickets

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
And didn't even honor him

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
And all this junk

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
So

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
I have to admit

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
You hearing these stories on the internet

25:13.000 --> 25:14.000
About stores that had failed launches previously

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
Made me a little bit nervous

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
But

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
You came back

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
You walked through the door

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
And you were like

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
I love Target

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
I love Target

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
What made it so great

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
What happened

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
How did it go down

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
First of all

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
The store manager himself

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Was outside

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
And letting everybody know

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Exactly what's gonna happen

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Before the store opened

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
And

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Excuse me I have to burp

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
And

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
This is great right here

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
And so

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Sorry I just took some Airborne

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Man you can't blame me

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
No I

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
I went and

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
So basically the store manager

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
You know

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Explained everything

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
And then he

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Then

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
We

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
You know

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Were in line

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
They handed out things

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
For us to fill out

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
As to which games we wanted to get

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
And then

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
They kind of

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Escorted us into the

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Into the store

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Where we handed them the flyer

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
That we filled out

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
And then they got everything for us

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
And then sent us to a register

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
It was very very very very

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
Organized

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Well organized

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
No glitches

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Nobody you know upset

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Everybody knew they were gonna get one

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
That was gonna get one

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
It was wham bam

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
Thank you ma'am Chris

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
Right

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It was very very convenient

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Yes it was

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
And I even told the lady

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
That walked me over to the register

26:28.000 --> 26:29.000
That I was very

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
I appreciated

26:30.000 --> 26:31.000
That

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
What

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
What the hell

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000
Um

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
And uh

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
And so that's the end

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Bye

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Alright well thank you

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Extover for sharing that

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I just got linked to the best site ever

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Did you

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Did you also

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Your website the weeks later in the show

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
Did you

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
No this is

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
I might make this next weeks

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Alright did

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Did you find the process to be just as great

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
Oh yeah

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000
Very smooth

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
But I laughed at the stupid woman

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
Oh my gosh

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
So

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Uh

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Somebody

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000
The prissiest looking woman

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
There were like

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
Actually walks up from her SUV

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Here you go

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
Okay

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
And she's all in her skirt and her high heels

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Looking all prissy prissy prissy

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
And she walks to the end of the line

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
And she walks with an attitude

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
Like I didn't have to wait

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
I didn't have to wait

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
I didn't have to wait

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
And walk all the way back there

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
And she went back and they basically said

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Oh we're the last ones to get it

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
And she walks back looking so pissed off

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
I was like

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Ha ha

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
There were like a few people who showed up

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Thinking they can just jump in the line

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
And the guy said I'm sorry

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
We don't have anymore

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
We're the only people

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
You know that was probably gonna be me

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
If extra had been so volunteer

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
But I would have been okay

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
I wouldn't have left away in a huff

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
I would have understood

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
You know

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
I would have been okay

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
I'm going to Kmart

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
Cause no one shops at Kmart

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
But anyway

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
We gotta keep moving

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Cause we wanna get in the show

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
But we wanna give a great big round of applause

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
To the line at Target Greatland and Citrus Heights

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
And the great staff there

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
For making the relaunch good

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
Yay

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
And I also wanna give a round of applause

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
To the guy at the front of the line

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
At Walmart in Rancho Cordova

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
The grandpa

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
Waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Not to sell it on eBay

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
But he looked like the nicest guy in the world

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
So I wanna give him a round of applause too

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Cause I liked him a lot

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
And I liked all the gamers we met

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
He didn't take your cookie though

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
No he didn't take the cookie

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
But that's okay

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I understand

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
And I'm not gonna force people to take the cookies

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Alright so anyway

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chatroom

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Why are they even

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
That was Shadow Charlie

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
But why are they even talking about Paris Hilton

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
Oh cause

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
Well we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Use their celebrity to get systems

28:32.000 --> 28:33.000
We'll talk about that later

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free okay

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Alright

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Fireboma says Paris Hilton

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Of the Wiimote easily

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
Anyway

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Let's get into another favorite segment

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
We like to do here on Orange Land Australia

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
This is usually how we kick off the show

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
And we don't have launch party stories to tell

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Oh I forgot to add

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
Oh I'm so sorry

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
I didn't even ask

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
You guys all camped in the line for the Wii

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
What did you get?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
What games did you end up getting?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
Dark Soccer

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
I got

29:05.000 --> 29:08.000
Well I actually got another Wiimote

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
And then I got Zelda Excite Truck

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
And Trauma Center

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Which

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
Those are the exact same three games I got by the way

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck and Zelda

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Loki?

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
I feel so bad but

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
I got Zelda Excite Truck

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Rayman's Raving Rabbids

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Red Steel

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
And Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
I think that was it

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Did you get Spongebob?

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I did not get Spongebob

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
I will talk about it in a little bit but

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Pretty quick at a GameStop

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Ouch ouch

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Not sounding like some good reviews there

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
I want to say this comment from chat though real quick about the Wii lines

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Rama said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems not sell them

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Another very interesting observation

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
I have noted this observation was made on blogs where you know

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
Most of the people on the Playstation 3 lines were eBay profiteers

30:12.000 --> 30:15.000
Most of the people on the Wii lines actually plan on playing them

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
I asked you know and I didn't expect people to be honest with me but I asked straight up

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
I said who is selling the Wii on eBay

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
And only one person kind of fessed up so that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
Like their friend ratted them out

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
That was it

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
One guy at Best Buy

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
Fessed up and said yeah I bought two Playstation 3's and I sold them both on eBay for a profit

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
And I am using that money to buy the Wii and I am like what are you selling the Wii too?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.000
Give me back the cookie

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
And he is like

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
He said no I actually want to play the Wii

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
This is very interesting

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
Just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people have

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
Pooeater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports

30:51.000 --> 30:57.000
My girlfriend Migzy she has been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And she says it has actually gotten kind of boring

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
Really?

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
I mean it is good for like to learn how things go I guess

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
But it is not really a you know

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
I got to agree Wii Sports is pretty much a

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Look it is a glorified tech demo

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
But I could see that as a good multiplayer game especially with like Wii Bowling

31:15.000 --> 31:21.000
It strikes me as a good party game and a good thing to like just show somebody the Wii to get into

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
You know what I mean like if I wanted to take it over and show my sister who maybe does not play video games

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Say hey you want to check out what I just got fire it up here you go

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Pass it off to Drew Nami for a minute because I want to ask

31:30.000 --> 31:33.000
You just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
And you played Wii Sports what was your impressions?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
Just pick it up and go

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
There is nothing to it at all

31:40.000 --> 31:45.000
It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing but everything else was easy

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Alright

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
We have been putting off long enough

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
We are already like more than 20 minutes into the show

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Let us talk about how is your gaming week

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And since there is a lot of us we want to kind of keep it a little bit brief

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
But I know some people like Loki got like 7 games

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
So Dark Sakura how is your gaming week?

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
Well actually I did not play the Wii yet

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
Because I was so tired that we went right to bed pretty much

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
But I have been playing Cooking Mama

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Which I found a used one

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
I was so happy

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
And every time I tried to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
So I have not actually gotten started yet

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I played some Mario

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
But mostly I was playing Cooking Mama

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
And I have my Elite Beat Agents today

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Thank you

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Alright that is it

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Very cool

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Have fun with it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Play lots of the Wii for next week

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
And pinball

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Like real pinball not virtual console pinball

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
I had a pinball party last night so I have actually

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Well of course we were not there

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
But I was playing some of the machines

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
While Sauce was here last week too

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Before we got into how is your gaming week

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
But I got to read these

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
Robway in our chatroom says

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
I think less people want to resell the Wii

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
Plus I am not buying from the eBay scum

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Megzi says

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Megzi said I showed the parentals Wii Sports

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
They were like speechless in awe

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
Megzi!

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Kind of interesting

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
My gaming week was great

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Especially with the Wii on Thursday

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
We started off with Wii Sports

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And that was actually pretty fun

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
The Wii Tennis was really cool

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
I mean everyone really had fun with it

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Then tried a little bit of Wii Boxing

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Which is a little weird

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Because I did not really read the manual on how to play it

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
So could not quite get it to work correctly

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
But it was still fun

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
Wii Golf was kind of okay I guess

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
And then Wii Bowling did not really try that too much

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And then the baseball I think is way too damn hard

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
Been playing lots of that

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
That game is really fun

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
That is the best way to describe it

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
Although the music is so goddamn horrible

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
You really need the SD memory card

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
And just load your own MP3's

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I tell you once you do that

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
It makes the game completely better

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
It is a really fun game

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
Then moving on

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
If you played Monkey Ball before

34:19.000 --> 34:20.000
And you were used to it

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Then you probably liked this game

34:22.000 --> 34:25.000
I thought that the original Monkey Ball was too hard

34:25.000 --> 34:31.000
Or at least it was too frustrating for me to put more attention towards it

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
So I got really sick of the game really quick

34:33.000 --> 34:37.000
And this is after level 7

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
And it was pretty damn hard

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
And I was just like fuck this

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
I do not want to play this

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
And the minigames to be honest

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I did not like them

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
I did not like them too much

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
So it is not something I would play by myself

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Maybe a good party game

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
But money is better spent elsewhere

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Because if you are really interested in a minigame type of game

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
That is the one for you

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Because it is just insane

35:04.000 --> 35:07.000
I mean the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
Just how off the wall weird they are

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
My favorite was the eating one

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
That you trace the food

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
And like one of the foods was a baseball

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
The guy would eat

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I was like what the hell he is eating a baseball

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It is excellent

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
So definitely you are going to need to check that out

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Zelda is pretty awesome

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But I mean what do you expect from a Zelda

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
It is just pretty neat

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
So Zelda yay

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
And then of course

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Tony Hawk's Downhole Jam

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
I bought this thinking it is going to be like SSX

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Because I love SSX

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
It is not SSX

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
It is not even close to being SSX

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
And I got really frustrated this right away

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Because to be honest

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
I do not know if it was my TV

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But the cables I had the detail on it

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
I had trouble seeing some of the tracks

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
And I just

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I want a game that I can get into and have fun with

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And Excite Truck was that

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Tony Hawk was not

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
So I would not recommend it

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
I mean unless you are a really big Tony Hawk fan

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I really would not recommend it

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
So yeah

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
And then of course finally

36:11.000 --> 36:12.000
Virtual Console Games

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I tried Mario 64

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Which is ok with the classic controller

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
I wonder how well it will look with the component cables

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But it looks just like it did before

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
And then Zelda

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Seemed a bit dark to me

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
But I guess that was because it was from the collection disc

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Or something that came out of the GameCube

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Not too long ago

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
Now it makes sense

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Because hey it is already imported right

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Exactly

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
I wish it was brighter though

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Because like all those games we saw at E3

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
Were very vivid and bright

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And that is what I kind of liked about them

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
And now

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I mean I think it is all about the cables though

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
Right now

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
So

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
That was pretty much it

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Yeah of course you know the usual suspects

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Call of Duty 3

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
On the 360

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
And

36:54.000 --> 36:57.000
Gears of War a little bit

36:57.000 --> 36:58.000
And other scrolls

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Finally finished it

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
SSJ100Matt wants to know

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
What does Nellie, Loki's wife

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Have to say about Loki playing all those games this week

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Now here is the funny thing

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
About that actually

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Nellie originally

37:09.000 --> 37:12.000
If you have her as a friend on LiveJournal

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
You would have seen that she wrote

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
Some pretty negative reviews on the Wii

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Saying if I really wanted to exercise

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I would go to the gym

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
I won't play the Wii

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Ironically enough though

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Once she picked up Excite Truck

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
She has been playing it

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
She played it for five hours yesterday

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
And a couple hours today

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
So

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
And she has actually finished

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
All the four different cups in it

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
All the way up through the platinum cup

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
She is all finished with it

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Now she is going back to get S-Rank games

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
On all the other tracks

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I haven't even played it that much

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
So that is how much she is like this

37:44.000 --> 37:45.000
And she loves the game

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
She says it is like

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
It is basically like

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Women driver the game

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Because it allows you to crash through trees

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
And just drive aimlessly

37:54.000 --> 37:55.000
And you get points

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
You get rewarded

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Yeah you get rewarded for driving recklessly

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
So she loves the game

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Sail at Mervyn's

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
But you know what

38:04.000 --> 38:05.000
You know what I like though

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
Playing on there

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Is the Mii Channel

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
And I like creating stupid Miis

38:08.000 --> 38:09.000
That I sent to Rob

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
Which is great

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Oh gosh

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
I went into my Mii Channel

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
And suddenly like

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
Eight new Miis

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
All dropped in my little thing

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Loki sent you this

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Loki sent you this

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
And he sent him and Nellie

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
And then he sent like

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Damian

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Or what you did

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
To get those horns

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
I don't know what you did

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
And then he just

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
He sent me a guy with a giant afro

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
And called it Afro

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
It is from DDR

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
I get it

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
I get it

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Alright

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Alright

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Let's talk to our guests

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
Oh I got to say

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
My gaming week

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
I'll make it quick

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Phantasy Star Universe

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Before the

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
You know

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Mass hysteria of the Wii launch

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
I played a lot of Phantasy Star Universe

38:44.000 --> 38:45.000
Online mode

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
Because they opened up some new areas

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
In online

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
Motube is a new planet you can go to

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
And some new missions are available as well

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
I got my butt handed to me

38:53.000 --> 38:54.000
In Motube though

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Because the missions

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Even though they're level 15

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
They're a little bit harder

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
Than the ones on New Days

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
So

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
It's good though

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
I'm glad they're keeping it fresh

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
With new content

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Let's hope

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Sega gets it right this time

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
And consistently gives us the new stuff

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I'll be a very happy camper if so

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
When it came to the Wii

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
I would say

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
Trauma Center

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Is a very overlooked launch title

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
I didn't play the one on the DS

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I just heard a lot of people rave about it

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
And you know

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
I hate those Discovery Channel shows

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
That are all about surgery

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
Because I get like

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
I'm a big wimp

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
When it comes to blood

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
And things like that

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
But I love Trauma Center

39:27.000 --> 39:28.000
It's so fun

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
And it's

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
When I get mad at the patients

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
I stab them with my scalpel

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
And just kill them

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
I have a review from Meg Z

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
She said

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
The Trauma Center for the DS

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Makes you want to hit yourself with a brick

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
It's hard

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
It's a really hard game

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
And you have to like remember

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It's almost like Simon says

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't know if like Simon says

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
But you have to remember like

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Okay

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
First I got to drain it

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Then I got to scalp it

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Then I got to take it out with a thing

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Then I got an antibiotic

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
And you have to remember

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
Like what order you have to do everything in

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
It's crazy

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
But it's fun

39:58.000 --> 39:59.000
And DMN

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
You watched me play it

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
And I was like

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Stressing out

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
I was like

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
That was hilarious

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
That was cool

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
I had a good time

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
But yeah

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
It's kind of an overlooked launch title

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
But I think it's kind of fun

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
$50?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.000
I don't know

40:11.000 --> 40:12.000
I'm still not loving these high prices for games

40:12.000 --> 40:13.000
But

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Whatever

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
It's

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
You know I guess I could always trade it back

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Or whatever

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
You know

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Rampage is $29.99

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
But it's Rampage

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
How many times have I played Rampage

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
In whatever

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Incorations

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
I have no interest in it

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
I'm sorry Midway

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
But I'm just

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
You know

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Get a new franchise

40:29.000 --> 40:30.000
I will pick a Mortal Kombat though

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
So

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
I'm totally being a hypocrite

40:32.000 --> 40:33.000
Because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat

40:33.000 --> 40:34.000
When it comes out of the way

40:34.000 --> 40:35.000
DMN

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
How was your gaming week?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Well I

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Played a bunch of games at work

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
That I can't talk about

40:39.000 --> 40:40.000
But

40:40.000 --> 40:41.000
Let's see

40:41.000 --> 40:42.000
At home

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I actually busted out the Super Nintendo

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Played some Tecmo Super Bowl

40:46.000 --> 40:47.000
Wario's Woods

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Actually when I got here

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
I played a lot of Luminous 2

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
Played a lot of Burnout Revenge

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
On his 360

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
And this is actually the first time

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
I've actually gotten to play the Wii

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
And play it on my own terms

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Rather than

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
You're playing this for 8 hours

41:03.000 --> 41:04.000
Have fun

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
But

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun

41:08.000 --> 41:09.000
With the system

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Trauma Center is just funny

41:11.000 --> 41:12.000
Again

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
The stabbing people

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Excite Truck is pretty fun

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
I actually did not like

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Raving Rabbids

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I just thought it was stupid

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
But

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Yeah

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
That's about it

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
I'm boring like that

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
Oh wait wait wait wait

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Elite Beat Agents

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Yeah

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
I played a lot of that

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
Alright

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Right on

41:31.000 --> 41:32.000
Chris

41:32.000 --> 41:33.000
I know you don't usually play

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
A whole lot of games

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
But did you try out anything this week

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
That you liked?

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
Well

41:38.000 --> 41:39.000
I got Cookie Mama

41:39.000 --> 41:40.000
So that was really good

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
I haven't played the Wii yet

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Which I got

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
Which is a surprise to me now

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I didn't expect to get it

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
I did however

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
I got Sims 2 Pets

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 Pets

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
And you can kill animals

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
And turn them into ghost animals

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
But no

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
It's actually really fun

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
All the animals

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
You can't actually tell the animals

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
What to do

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
But

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
They have their own personalities

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
And they just kind of run around

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
You can tell them not to do something

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
All my cats

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
That I have for my Sims

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
They don't

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
They are on the furniture all the time

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
And I can't get them to stop

42:13.000 --> 42:14.000
But

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And I also played Pokemon Ranger

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
That game is weird

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
That's like

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
I'm old school Pokemon fan

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Like the trainer games

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
Those are the only ones I like

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
I don't have pinball or anything like that

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
It's not

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
It's kind of weird

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
It's like

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
You have to make the Pokemon think you're a friend

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So you draw a circle around it

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
With your stylus

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Many many times

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
But it will get pissed off

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
And hurt your stylus circle

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
And then you have to try again

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
And your stylus will die

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And then you have to start over

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
But you get a friend

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You get a friend that travels with you nonstop

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
Which is

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
I have no idea what that Pokemon is

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
It's the plus minus Pikachu thing

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Oh

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
Plus one minus

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Yeah that thing

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
I have plushies of those

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
Yeah they

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
That's always with you

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
But you can get

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
Like the friends that you make

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
Follow you around

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Until you're done with them

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
And you can use your Pokemon

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
So it's even worse than training them

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
You use them

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
You use

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
It's like

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
You get that for me

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
And they get the hell out

43:09.000 --> 43:10.000
But

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
So that's

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Wow

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
That's a weird game

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
I mean if you like Pokemon anyway

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I mean I guess it's a really cool game

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
But I like training them

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I like using them for purposes of battle

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I like trying to kill my Pokemon

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
PETA doesn't like me I don't think

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
So

43:26.000 --> 43:27.000
Okay that was my gaming week

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Right on

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Drewnami

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Drew I really really like your shirt

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
It says noob

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Noob

43:33.000 --> 43:34.000
It's what's for dinner

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
And it has a noob

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
It has a noob assuming the position

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
Cut up like the

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
Cuts a meat chart

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah that's so funny

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
Drewnami

43:43.000 --> 43:44.000
Or Drewnawee

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
How was your gaming week?

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
I actually decided to kick a little bit old school

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
Because I didn't get

43:48.000 --> 43:51.000
Didn't get any of the next gen stuff

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
So I went back to my old

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
MechWarrior games

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Just started playing MechWarrior 3

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
MechWarrior 4

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
MechCommander 2

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
That kind of stuff

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Didn't do much else except

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Guitar Hero

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And they really ramped up the difficulty

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
On expert mode

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Which is almost impossibly hard

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
When you get to the stuff like Miserloo

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Ugh

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
Other than that not much else

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Alright very cool

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
You know what's funny is that you know

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Earlier in the show I was talking about

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Our history as a music gaming network

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
I think you're the only

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
Oh no

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
Dark Soccer played Guitar Hero 2 last week

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Cause I haven't played it yet

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
I've played a bunch of that too

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
What's your favorite spot?

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Pandora is hot

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Pandora is fucking hot

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Pandora makes me fail songs

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Alright

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Well that was our gaming week

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
And hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Whether you were in the Playstation 3 camp

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
Or the Wii camp

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Or the F the next generation camp

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
Or maybe 360

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You're just there holding out on 360

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Whatever hope you had a good gaming week as well

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
We gotta get into some gaming news

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So real quick housekeeping

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Real quick

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Just wanted to say

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
For those that have been saying

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Why do you put out part B so late in the week

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Why do we have to wait so long for part B

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Okay

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
We're gonna try a new thing

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And we're gonna put out part B a little bit earlier

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So look for it this week

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
There's another podcast out there

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
It's another show that's syndicated on all games like we are

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Our show replays on all games on Monday

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And there's a show on Thursday

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
I think on all games

45:16.000 --> 45:17.000
I apologize if I mess that up

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Called Game Addict Hotline

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
There's a spinoff show from that called Cross Platform

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Where they have multiple people come together

45:24.000 --> 45:27.000
From different podcasts and magazines and stuff

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And just talk about random stuff

45:29.000 --> 45:30.000
So the guy there, Luke

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
I've been chatting with for a little bit

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
So he had me on episode four and five

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
So you should check that out

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
So go to gameaddicthotline.com

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
And you can download the show

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
And you can hear how gamer Andy yells at me

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
For being excited about Blue Dragon

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
But look

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
Number three most anticipated title in Japan

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Gamer Andy

45:48.000 --> 45:49.000
That's all I have to say

45:49.000 --> 45:50.000
No

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
All the Final Fantasy people

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
You know what a Final Fantasy whore I am

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
No

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
Gamer Andy's great

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
And so are all the guys there that have been on the program

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
So check that out

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
It was a good time

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
One other thing I want to say real fast

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
DMM

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Do you have anything you want to share with our listeners?

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
I have a cookie

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
Oh you mean that thing

46:08.000 --> 46:09.000
Um

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah I have a Wii

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
I'm going to give it to somebody

46:11.000 --> 46:12.000
Um

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
Um

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
It's only gonna be

47:43.000 --> 47:44.000
It's gonna be like maybe

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
A 30

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
30

47:46.000 --> 47:47.000
45 minute show

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Um

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
It will be pre-taped

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
Until uh

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
We decide

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Hey

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
We're gonna

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
You know

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Feel the wrath

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
Of the live listeners

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
But um

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
We look forward to being

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
A part of the Orange

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Lounge Radio family

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
And we are going to have

48:01.000 --> 48:02.000
A lot of fun with it

48:02.000 --> 48:03.000
So when's that start

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
Thursday after Thanksgiving

48:04.000 --> 48:05.000
Right

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
Yes it will be the

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
First Thursday after Thanksgiving

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
We're shooting for an evening

48:08.000 --> 48:09.000
Sort of time

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
So people can uh

48:10.000 --> 48:11.000
You know

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
We're gonna have it

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
At three in the morning

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
Alright

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
Alright now

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
Is it seven o'clock

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
I think it's gonna be seven

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Yeah I think we're gonna be at seven

48:18.000 --> 48:19.000
Most of the other shows

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Are at seven or seven thirty

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
So probably in that window

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
Somewhere so

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Alright um

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Just real quick

48:24.000 --> 48:25.000
I wanna say one more time

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
Okay

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Okay

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
Ask an OP

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
If you need to know

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
How to private message

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Somebody in chat

48:31.000 --> 48:32.000
Um

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
The folks in chat

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Would request that if you

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Already have a Wii

48:35.000 --> 48:36.000
You don't enter the contest

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
But since there's no way

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
For us to verify it

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Maybe you know someone

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
In need of a Wii

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
So we're not gonna stop

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
People that already have one

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
From entering

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
But you know

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
You know

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
You win brownie points

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
Use your best judgement

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
Yeah

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
So

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
Only PM me

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
When I say to

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
And after a certain period

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Of time

48:53.000 --> 48:54.000
One number

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yes

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
So it's not the first person

48:56.000 --> 48:57.000
To PM me

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
It's one number

48:58.000 --> 48:59.000
From someone who PMs me

48:59.000 --> 49:00.000
Yes

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
Will be drawn at random

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yes

49:02.000 --> 49:03.000
Okay

49:03.000 --> 49:04.000
And by the way

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
If you're PMing me

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Other things during the show

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
Cause there's a lot of people

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
In chat tonight

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
I can't look at them right now

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
Cause there's too much else

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Going on

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
I'm very sorry folks

49:12.000 --> 49:13.000
But you have to

49:13.000 --> 49:14.000
No love letters

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
General chat

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
Or

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
I don't know

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
See if

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
See if Loki or DarkSakura

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
Can answer

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
Or ask

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
One of your friendly OP's

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Alright

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
So

49:24.000 --> 49:25.000
I know we haven't given

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
The 360 a lot of love tonight

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
But Loki can you change that

49:27.000 --> 49:28.000
For us a little bit

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
Of course I can

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
I love the 360

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
And I'll still be playing

49:31.000 --> 49:32.000
Plenty

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Anyways

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Um

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
So

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
On the 15th

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
You know

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
There's a big anniversary

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
The 5th year anniversary

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Of Halo

49:40.000 --> 49:41.000
And of course

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
To commemorate the 5th anniversary

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
Of Halo

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
They announced some more things

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
About Halo 3

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
And some stuff for Halo 2

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
Um

49:50.000 --> 49:51.000
So starting things off

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Halo 3 is going to be getting a multiplayer beta

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
In the spring of 2007

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Which uh

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
If I remember correctly

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
I think that they

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
That news came out a while ago

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
At least it was rumored to be happening

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
So

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
There will be

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
Some sort of demo coming out

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
Spring of 2007

50:06.000 --> 50:07.000
Um

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
No word on

50:09.000 --> 50:10.000
What you know

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
That will consist of

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And whether it will be free

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
So

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
I don't know

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Something coming out though

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
Spring 2007

50:17.000 --> 50:18.000
So that's pretty cool

50:18.000 --> 50:19.000
Um

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Halo 2 is actually

50:20.000 --> 50:21.000
Going to be getting some

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Xbox 360 exclusive maps

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Um

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
Brand new multiplayer maps

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Also coming out in the spring

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Um

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Exclusively for Xbox 360 players

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
So

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
You know

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Sorry if you have just an Xbox

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Um

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
Also

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
The first Halo 3 television ad

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Will air

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
Um

50:40.000 --> 50:41.000
During ESPN Monday Night Football

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
On December 4th

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
And it will be a 60 second spot

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Um

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
So that will be very interesting

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
You know

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Checking

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Or tune into that to watch it

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Or catch it on YouTube

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
The day after

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
So

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Alrighty

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
Sorry

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
I haven't been having to

50:58.000 --> 50:59.000
Argue a little bit

50:59.000 --> 51:00.000
With some people in chat room

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
They're like

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Look the rules are the rules

51:02.000 --> 51:03.000
And it's DMN's Wii

51:03.000 --> 51:04.000
And he can do whatever he wants

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
To give it away

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Because he doesn't have to be doing it

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
So

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
That's it

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Yeah it's a very massive Wii

51:09.000 --> 51:10.000
You have there DMN

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
Anyway

51:11.000 --> 51:12.000
I wanted to say real quick

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
On the Halo 3

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
So

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
The beta coming out in spring

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Now you have said

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
In the previous episodes

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
You are convinced

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
That the game is coming out in

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
What?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
March?

51:21.000 --> 51:22.000
April?

51:22.000 --> 51:23.000
Somewhere in that window?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.000
Uh huh

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
No

51:26.000 --> 51:27.000
They beta tested

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
Fantasy Star Universe

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Right before it came out

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
What's the big deal?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
I mean

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
It doesn't have to be beta tested

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
Months in advance

51:33.000 --> 51:34.000
In fact

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
The only exception I've seen so far

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Um

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
With demos and Xbox Live

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Would probably be the stuff from E3

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
You know

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Lost Planet got a demo

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
And Test Drive Unlimited

51:44.000 --> 51:45.000
And stuff like that

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
I mean

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
That stuff was way early

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
But then again

51:48.000 --> 51:49.000
It was also already done

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
For that show

51:50.000 --> 51:51.000
So they didn't have to really

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Work on it

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Um

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
So yeah

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
It makes perfect sense

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
Why would you have a beta test

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
For something

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
And then wait like six months

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
To put it out

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
I'm still telling you

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
End of March

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
So

52:02.000 --> 52:03.000
Whatever

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
Alright

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
You all will see

52:06.000 --> 52:07.000
We shall

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
We shall see

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Uh

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
Speaking of things

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
That need to be beta tested

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Perhaps the PlayStation 3

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Backwards compatibility

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Should have been play tested

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
I'm sure you guys have been

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
hearing reports about

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
I think we got into it

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
A little bit last week

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Some of the games

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
Don't work right

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Uh

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
They have little bugs

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
I don't know if any

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Are any of them

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
Rendered unplayable

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
That you've heard of

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
I don't think any of them

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Are necessarily unplayable

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
I don't know about

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Unplayable

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
But you've got graphical

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
Audio bugs

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
Quite a bit

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
But it's very interesting

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Because there was an interview

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
With Sony Computer

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Entertainment America exec

52:38.000 --> 52:39.000
Jack Trettin

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
And he made this

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
Very interesting

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
And bizarre quote

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
In response to the question

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Do you have a response

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
For people experiencing

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Backwards compatibility

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
Issues and or television

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
Upscaling problems

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Quote

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
I would like my car to fly

52:50.000 --> 52:51.000
And make me breakfast

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
But that's an unrealistic

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Expectation

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
We've reported problems

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
On only 200 of the

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
8000 PlayStation 1 and 2 games

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I would challenge the average

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
Consumer to say

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
There are significant problems

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
With any of the games

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
In their library

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
If you look at our competitors

53:05.000 --> 53:06.000
One machine has zero

53:06.000 --> 53:07.000
Backwards compatibility

53:07.000 --> 53:08.000
And one only has it

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
With a third of their games

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Someone needs to notify him

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
That the Wii will actually

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
Play all GameCube games

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
But

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
And then also

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
The older games

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
Here's the other thing

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
That's kind of funny

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
200 games so far

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Out of the 8000

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
Because it's only been

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
Released in one region

53:23.000 --> 53:24.000
So far

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
You do realize

53:25.000 --> 53:26.000
There are other games

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
In other regions

53:27.000 --> 53:28.000
Of course

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
He might not realize that

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Since he thinks that

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
The Wii doesn't play

53:31.000 --> 53:32.000
Any other games

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
But

53:33.000 --> 53:34.000
I know

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
And Fireball Man

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Chatroom says

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
That's just giving

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
A big fuck you

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
To the gaming community

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
And I tend to agree

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
I mean that's a very

53:41.000 --> 53:42.000
Snide thing

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
I want a flying car

53:43.000 --> 53:44.000
To fix them

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
We'll fix them

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Our bad

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
I want to get

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
A big

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
Pro-tip

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
For every single

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Higher up

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
At every single

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Video game company

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
You don't know

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
What the fuck

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
You're talking about

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Shut the hell up

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Hello

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
This includes mine too

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
I know you're listening

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
Perrin

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
Now

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
They are working on

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Patch to fix this stuff

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
It's

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
You know

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
To be fair

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
Microsoft

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Their games

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Aren't

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
Backwards compatible

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Not all of them

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
I mean

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
They have about

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
They have as many

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Backwards compatible games

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
As Sony has

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Games that aren't working

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
In backwards compatibility

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I mean

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
It's about

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
About that

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
So

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
It'll be fixed

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
In a patch

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
You know

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
People can quit

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Their bitching

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Granted

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
There's still gonna be

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Other problems

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
But

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
That's why they have

54:36.000 --> 54:37.000
These updates

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
And firmware updates

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
And stuff like that

54:39.000 --> 54:40.000
So

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Not a huge deal

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
I mean

54:42.000 --> 54:43.000
It's going to be in the library

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
I mean

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
The percentage of

54:45.000 --> 54:46.000
Games that aren't working

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
Is about like

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
2%

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
That's really

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
Not that big

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Of a deal

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
So

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
It will

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Be fixed soon

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
I mean

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
At least

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
They could have said

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
At least

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
Hey we're

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
We're doing better

55:00.000 --> 55:01.000
Than 360

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Granted

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Yeah

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
This guy

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
Is an idiot

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
I mean

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
They do not

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
Need people like

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Him

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
You know

55:10.000 --> 55:14.280
familiar sounding name, says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.120
It's very rude. It's just rude. It's horrible PR.

55:18.120 --> 55:22.080
It is a little bit. Considering they're relying on these people

55:22.080 --> 55:25.600
to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they're

55:25.600 --> 55:30.240
really rude to them at launch. Interesting words.

55:30.240 --> 55:35.080
What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for

55:35.080 --> 55:39.160
the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound

55:39.160 --> 55:41.200
like pricks. Them's fighting words.

55:41.200 --> 55:44.360
Those are fighting words. I still, despite all this crap, I do still

55:44.360 --> 55:48.040
consider myself a Sony fanboy. I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.320
So, you want to go outside? You want to go to the parking lot?

55:50.320 --> 55:55.040
You want to go get Todd a lesson? All right. Fight. Fight.

55:55.040 --> 55:58.040
I might shoot him. Okay.

55:58.040 --> 56:01.360
I get to stop. Anyway.

56:01.360 --> 56:07.860
Speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.

56:07.860 --> 56:11.320
Well, not really got shot. Well, actually, in other states they got shot.

56:11.320 --> 56:17.520
But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their

56:17.520 --> 56:25.400
PS3. Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game

56:25.400 --> 56:26.400
system. It's not the whole diamond.

56:26.400 --> 56:30.120
It's $599 US dollars. I don't fucking care.

56:30.120 --> 56:35.380
$600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay. But there's people getting shot over this

56:35.380 --> 56:43.400
and I'm like, you people are pathetic. Wait.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.840
Let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up a mic again.

56:46.840 --> 56:51.560
Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.

56:51.560 --> 57:02.720
You smart ass. I'm just all, you know, it's, they were shooting

57:02.720 --> 57:07.880
people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.

57:07.880 --> 57:12.400
I guess the PS3 must be the must own console because that's, you know, every year you hear

57:12.400 --> 57:17.440
about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking

57:17.440 --> 57:21.840
each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them.

57:21.840 --> 57:25.720
My mom did that. My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle

57:25.720 --> 57:29.180
Me Elmo. That's hot.

57:29.180 --> 57:33.560
And now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation threes.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.920
It's crazy. You know what?

57:35.920 --> 57:41.080
I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back

57:41.080 --> 57:46.280
to any of those assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis

57:46.280 --> 57:50.800
shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and boric acid poured over the stump.

57:50.800 --> 57:55.280
You know, that's probably someone's fetish. You know, while having to watch Bad Santa.

57:55.280 --> 57:59.800
No, while having to watch Manos, the Hands of Fate.

57:59.800 --> 58:05.080
You know, Jamie is starting to sound a little angsty. And you know what happens when Jamie

58:05.080 --> 58:07.240
gets angsty? People die?

58:07.240 --> 58:11.280
Well, suddenly background music starts coming in and we get into a regular segment of the

58:11.280 --> 58:16.280
show. Oh, look, right on cue.

58:16.280 --> 58:29.960
FUs of the Week time, Dark Sakura. A big flippin' FU to Sony. All-encompassingly.

58:29.960 --> 58:34.880
And all of your retarded, as you may notice, I'm saying retarded fanboys, as in not that

58:34.880 --> 58:41.680
all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.

58:41.680 --> 58:49.560
All those, I guess it's stupid men, really. But it's rather like, oh, we're going to sell

58:49.560 --> 58:56.080
it on eBay. You people are disgusting. And I have a secondary FU that I think is going

58:56.080 --> 59:00.160
to go in line with somebody else's in this room. FU to Art Thieves.

59:00.160 --> 59:12.800
FU to Nintendo, Mad Catz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.

59:12.800 --> 59:21.520
Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday or today? Whatever. Why do

59:21.520 --> 59:29.560
I have to wait? I cannot stand composite cables. I need higher def cables. How will I live

59:29.560 --> 59:39.440
in a high def world with standard composite cables? It's barbaric. And besides, why do

59:39.440 --> 59:44.200
I have to wait until December? I don't want to wait.

59:44.200 --> 59:51.920
My FU of the Week goes to Dark Sakura, Chris, and Extrofer, and the entire line at Target

59:51.920 --> 59:59.600
Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my

59:59.600 --> 01:00:05.000
bed, warm and toasty asleep. And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.760
so FU to my toothache. No. If we really wanted to effect revenge on you,

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.280
we would have dumped some ice water on you, too.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.600
I would have locked the door to my house so you couldn't do that.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:19.240
If it makes you really better, I thought about pulling you at five.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:24.120
So, no, I'm teasing. Of course, they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:29.400
bit of sand in my vagina this week. DMN, your FUs of the Week.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:35.120
My first FU of the Week goes to T-Mobile because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.560
with money to spend, and then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money, and

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.160
you're going to fucking hate your weekend. But thankfully, I have friends who help me

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.440
out, but they don't get FUs. But T-Mobile does. If you ever take my fucking money without

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:52.440
my permission again, people will die. And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.680
the other day. I've totally pwned you a butterfly.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.160
We're going to... I want to play you a... Rematch, bitch, right now.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.720
Right now. Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.360
I will still get Laquisha. It's already been brought in.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.080
All right. Chris, your FUs of the Week. All right, then Drew. Drew, your FUs of the

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.080
Week. You guys serve.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:18.080
Okay, FU to Dimash Marketing Strategies. Why do we have just not enough game systems for

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:24.320
everyone who watches it the first time around? It still makes no fucking sense to me.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.480
FU to the ramped up difficulty levels of Guitar Hero 2. What the hell? I mean, I know you're

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.160
going to make it harder, but Jesus. Miserloo on Expert? What the hell?

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:39.200
Also, FU to the DMV. I know everyone shares FU. Now they have to have your birth certificate

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:43.040
even though you've been through the whole thing before just for a new something. So

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.040
you get to stand in line not once, but twice. Isn't it lovely? Ain't it grand?

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.040
Fine. Chris, your FUs. Well, Jimmy kind of already stated my FU.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.960
FU to Art Thieves. My art was stolen on DeviantArt. That was fun.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.200
Why would somebody steal art? You know, well, it was kind of funny because

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.960
it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.360
publicly, so I'm not that great, but it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.880
enough that she thought no one would recognize it, but somebody did and they informed me

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.640
and she did it on both her accounts and she actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.640
member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description too. Word for word. It was really,

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:31.480
really funny. What a hooker.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.520
I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thieves. My bad.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:39.040
Oh, no. I draw, so. I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.000
FU, but a kind of confused why don't you notice is all the people who asked me why are you

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:52.400
doing this online when I was handing out coffee. I'm kind of not pleased that people have just

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.080
lost faith in humanity. It's like I know you read about all these things happening, it's

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.160
like people are killing each other for a PS3, but there are nice people left and they're

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:09.680
all gay. I love you, Drew.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:17.000
Wow. They knew me as the lesbian in line.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.080
That's how they knew you on the show too. We love you. You're much more than a lesbian.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.440
You're also the chick with blue hair. All right.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:29.040
And I feed you sugar. I give you sugar.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:38.680
Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week. A pregnant

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:46.080
woman actually was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey, and she says nine months

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.000
pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.960
to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's

01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:02.760
father, and her younger brother. Okay, yeah, you're really...

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.720
You're stupid. That is pretty stupid.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.160
Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.300
Why are you allowed to be pregnant? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is where I'm going off

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:21.860
because this is one of the things I hate. I hate when stupid people breed. When people

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.080
exist only on this earth to start out babies. Jamie, she really, really, really, really

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:32.080
wanted one. No. No, no, no. Seriously, what is more important,

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.560
the birth of your child or a video game system? You are a disgusting person, and I hope your

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.760
child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:45.980
Depends. How ugly is your child? Wow. Wow.

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:51.160
It depends on if she was at Walmart or not. Landmine Fairy in Chat says, WTF, is she going

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:55.440
to play Trauma Center while in labor? No, no, no. She will not be playing Trauma

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:58.040
Center. Trauma Center is not on PlayStation 3.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.320
Oh, that's right. Oh, snap. She'll be playing one of the 15 games that

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:07.560
came out before and that's about it. No, she won't let me play Motorstorm until

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.800
March. She will be playing Rises of the Old Man.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.360
She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spiderman impregnated her. I don't

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.440
know. To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.520
very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:31.960
I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child,

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.480
you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.320
No video game system is worth your child's life.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:46.800
All right. I love the chat room. SSJ100Matt says, Loki,

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:54.240
it's New Jersey after all. I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.560
I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once. It was fun.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.720
All right. For all you people in Jersey, that's loki

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.680
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. There you go. Send the hate mail. Fire away.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:08.880
I'm just reading the chat room, okay? I didn't say it.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:14.960
To one very strange incident in a line, to a line that was complimented on a very big

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:22.360
blogging site, Joystiq, gave kudos to Best Buy in the landmark center, Best Buy in Boston,

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.680
where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:32.520
What happened is that, okay, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.120
the next day. What happened is that at 11 p.m. the night

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:41.760
before, the general manager walked over to the line and told them he didn't care whatever

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.400
system they wanted to use. So they formed this list. There was a line

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.760
and you had to check in every hour. They had roll call every half hour, whatever,

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.240
for the line. And if you weren't there, you were out.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.660
And so what happened is that there was, I guess, 40 people in line.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.860
And then what happened, by 3 p.m. they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:07.540
So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:12.320
They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.560
come back and get their system. And anything that was left over was automatically

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.900
raffled off. So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.580
that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:27.920
interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:32.560
Good for them. So it's good to hear that not every line was

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.640
just, you know, fucking nuts. So good for you guys in Boston.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:41.840
Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.400
Wii launches. Basically doing this in conjunction with the

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:53.240
law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:56.320
So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.880
on in regards to the system launches elsewhere. That's pretty good.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:07.400
I know it wasn't with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.800
It's real chaos. But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:17.240
week at launch, you may be in luck. There may be some more coming in next week

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:22.680
for Black Friday. So if you really want to fight the chaos in

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:29.920
the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:35.240
systems out there for next week and stuff. I don't know, personally, I don't think that

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.200
there's a real big need for it right now. With only 15 games going to be out before

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.720
the end of the year, I mean, you probably could wait.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.840
You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:49.560
I mean, what's coming out next month anyways? Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.960
Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:58.240
Yeah, so it's not a huge deal. But that's cool at least that they're shipping

01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.520
them relatively quick. Do you think this is going to drive the eBay

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.280
prices down as the market gets more deluded? It already has actually, from what I was reading.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:16.920
They're going for about $1,500 now. That's also another reason I think you're

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:22.960
probably not seeing a lot of Wees on eBay, because their shipments are going to be coming

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.680
in around the same time. I think we heard that we're getting our next

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:30.840
shipment after Thanksgiving. So, yeah, they're going to have systems out

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.520
there, and people don't really need to spend tons of money.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.920
Rama just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.040
What's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:48.240
Two gunshots to the head. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.800
Hey, look, I didn't write them. I only read them.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:57.280
You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.320
You guys remember John Edwards? He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:06.080
He ran with John Kerry, right? Well, there was a story circulating around

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.480
the Internet that what happened. Now, what's interesting to note about John

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:15.320
Edwards is he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know,

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:20.120
and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart, so he's kind of in

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.240
that camp and it's one of his platforms or whatever.

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:29.980
What happened is that according to a statement that he made, his wife told him, his wife

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:34.920
Elizabeth said, hey, we want to get a PlayStation 3 for the young kids.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:38.120
What happened is that she made the comment, and again, this is according to a statement,

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.400
in front of one of the staff people. Well, the staff people mentioned it then in

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:46.500
front of a volunteer, and the volunteer started to make all efforts to get one, and so who

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:51.320
did the volunteer call? Walmart, and tried to use John Edwards' name

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.760
to say, hey, this guy wants a PlayStation 3, you should help us out.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:59.520
So of course, Walmart used the opportunity to put out their own release and say, well,

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:06.900
Edwards is here criticizing us and now he wants a PlayStation 3 and he's being a little

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.920
bit hypocritical, huh? So it's very interesting back and forth.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.520
Obviously, there's the he said and they said type things, so it's really hard to know who's

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.640
right, but if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.040
unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.040
silly. One of his staffers is fired?

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.520
Yeah, one of his staffers is probably fired. Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:35.960
soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.840
Interesting. What's this quote from Walmart?

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.880
Oh, here's the quote from Walmart. Quote, while the rest of America's working

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.920
families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.860
Ouch. Certainly not good if he's trying to run

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:53.760
for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:57.480
Most people will probably forget. I don't know, I don't know.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:02.120
I'm just thinking, you know, it's a while ago, and I will say, we'll see.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:09.200
On a small political note, he made a joke about George Bush, and everyone took it to

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:14.480
be a joke about him insulting the troops. They're going to play that too.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.880
That was Kerry, not Edwards. Oh, that was Kerry?

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.160
Yeah. He did that in Seattle, and I thought it

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.240
was the funniest thing ever. He's not running anyway, because he's associated

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:26.760
with John Kerry. All right, this isn't Crossfire, boys and

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.920
girls. We've got to keep it moving. We're just going to have to go to a different country

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.940
or something to get us off of this tangent. Well, there's a country that I would certainly

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:39.680
love to visit if somebody would like to send me a plane ticket there, but in the interim,

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:47.080
I will just have to cover news there. Basically, the PS3 folks are, it's, stupid

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:54.400
freaking Sony, but there's a company that's placing ads in London train stations saying

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.120
that they will be able to sell a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.440
The thing is, is that Sony's cracked down on all of the shipping.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:10.480
They're saying Play Asia is not sending any Sony products to Europe.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:18.520
eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done, but there is a company that's advertising

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:25.360
in these stations stating PS3, order now for Christmas, and they're given a premium, one

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.120
fifty minute phone number to call to leave details on the phone service to where they'll

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:39.040
be called back when the systems are available. A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:43.580
investigating it further. We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:49.200
urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:54.760
A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.880
going on just to get their hands on the PlayStation 3.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:02.240
Jesus Christ, Sony, what are you trying to hide from Europe? Let them import the goddamn

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.560
systems. But I still think that this stinks of scam.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.640
Oh no, I don't doubt that one bit. I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up,

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.640
and scammers, shut the fuck up. Scammers just die.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.760
You should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story. No, I'm kidding. You

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:27.520
know I love you, DMN. Anyways, sorry. So, it's kind of funny though,

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:33.920
I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart, and it's

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:38.800
really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:44.360
there with a PlayStation 3 in there, and well, basically they found out it's not running

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.200
actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:56.960
actually PlayStation 3 live footage. So, oops, I guess that sucks, but that was actually

01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:05.080
coming from GamerAndy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there, one for the TV,

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:11.680
one for a DVD player. Is this, I'm just asking this question hypothetically

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:17.720
to bring up debate, is this necessarily such a bad thing though? I mean, if that's what

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.260
Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine? I mean, if that's

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.360
how they want to do it? That's fine, but I still think it's funny

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:31.760
how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk. It's authentic, I'll

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:37.120
give them that. You're harsh, you're harsh. Alright, well,

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:42.000
you know, Sony may not be the only thing, only folks experiencing some broken things

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.120
here at launch. Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.520
yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually just before we went live, and I think it missed

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.900
the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are

01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:57.640
breaking down, but, you know, any launch console is going to have their issues where certain

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:02.740
ones don't work, so that's inevitable. But what should be interesting to note is that

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.780
some of the stuff they said was going to be available on the Wii isn't really quite ready

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.880
yet. What's interesting is that the forecast channel is not actually going to show up until

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:17.240
December 20th, and the news channel will not actually start until January 27th of next

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:21.880
year, so two of these things they were touting at E3 just for whatever reason, not ready

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.480
to go just yet. It should be noted, it's kind of interesting,

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.320
I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:32.020
available either. You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.040
channel, and some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.080
because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now. All those people

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.680
that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today, so, you know, everybody's

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.880
trying to download that at once, and thankfully I didn't have a problem. I guess we're lucky

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:53.200
in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores, but, yeah, you know,

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.880
certainly interesting that they have all these updates.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.200
Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.480
detrimental to the system's operation. It is first and foremost a gaming console. I

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.480
honestly think that the news channel's coming out a little later because it was announced

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:13.520
that they're partnering with CNN, and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:18.240
yet. I have no idea about the forecast channel, but, yeah, it was interesting to see that

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.200
firmware update right out of, I don't want to say right out of the box, but when you

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.160
connected to the internet.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.400
Mikew0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down. Well,

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.800
yeah, that's because it happened to me, so I was pissed, of course, and if my Wii breaks,

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.840
I'm going to be pissed, too. But, no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay, but

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.040
it's kind of one of the things, like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point,

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:49.360
you know, every launch console has bugs, but, you know, in the first wave, no matter what,

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.000
this isn't PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.360
Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.440
I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and, again, this was so new, it didn't make

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:07.800
our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like, it said, you

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:12.960
need to eject the disk and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.440
like that, and lots of, like, discrete errors, yeah, little things like that, so.

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:22.120
That's not the amount that Sony is supposedly reporting, right?

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:25.400
Well, but I don't know, who's tracking it? We don't know, you know, no one's tracking,

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.880
and keep in mind, Sony doesn't have as many consoles out there, so I don't know, until

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.220
we see some hard figures, and are these companies going to release statistics on how many broken

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.940
machines they have? Probably not, so I don't know if this is on the same level as Three

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:41.720
Rings of Death or not, on 360, so who knows? Who knows?

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:47.760
I'm going to chat room to read more comments, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.880
Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat, do you really want news or weather?

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:58.560
No, I don't, but I would like the internet browser, yeah, I would like that, definitely.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.800
I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.320
it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.880
I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry, I still have no one to play.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.080
Honestly, if you want to know what the weather's going to look like, it's called looking out

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080
the fucking window.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.080
Open a window.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.120
I can't open the window, the sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.120
Oh, touche.

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:27.960
That's why I live in Seattle, where it's cloudy and rainy all day.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.280
At least you know what it's always going to be like there.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:35.880
Well, at any rate, you know, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.920
is music.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:45.240
And there's going to be an MP3 player out, in Europe anyway, on 8th December, that will

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.160
be 20 pounds.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.880
It's for the Game Boy Advance and DS, that's supposed to be just like the Playon.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:59.600
It has a 512 megabyte SD card that lets you load music files onto it via your PC, then

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:06.960
you plug in the adapter into your Game Boy SP, your Game Boy Micro, or Nintendo DS, and

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:11.240
you can listen to songs on the go.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:13.480
Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:20.280
Well, if it is a redo of the Playon, it will also have a, the Playon had a capacity to

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:24.720
take a 2 gigabyte SD card, so.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.600
I thought they already had something like that already.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.600
That was the Playon.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:34.120
No, here, it's not the Playon or whatever, it's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:40.720
They use it mainly for, I don't know, pirating games and other things, but it's also meant

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.720
for media.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:46.440
And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte, like hard drive, micro

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.440
drive in there.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.920
Well, this one's official.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.840
All right, interesting.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:55.160
I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick, Miek Latov

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:58.080
PM'd me and he said his Wii froze up today.

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.200
He was exiting the Mii channel and it just froze.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:06.240
He had to turn it off and on, so there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.240
patched or something.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:11.760
Mine froze up once, but it, well actually it didn't really freeze up, it just seemed

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:18.160
like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system before they

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.080
launched the internet thing.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080
So yeah, I didn't like it.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:26.040
Well, I tried to do the shop channel today and it just, it froze up when I was trying

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:29.640
to go into shop channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.080
Yeah, mine kind of a little delayed today too, so.

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:37.640
I mean, I can let little web errors slide because those are at least fixed in an hour,

01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:39.760
you know, just depending on the issue.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.600
Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues for like, ever since the damn game came out,

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:50.240
so I don't know, a World of Warcraft, long queue times and all that fun stuff, so.

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:55.920
Anywho, so you know, of course you can get issues with a console like this and you know,

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.920
I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they'd cut out, like

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.880
you know, DVD playback and stuff like that, but not a big deal.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:07.040
But actually they were aiming for even lower price point than $249, they would have liked

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:12.180
to have seen it at under $100 according to Miyamoto.

01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:17.440
And his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.720
could be spent on proving the interface and software.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.760
And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:32.040
photos and other pricey parts, they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.280
And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280
$99?

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:46.840
I mean, as it is, they're flying off the shelves pretty quick, but $99 is just stupid low.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:50.360
Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.600
as the revolution, that the revolution was going to be $99?

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:57.200
I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.160
made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:01.160
I do think.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.360
But I don't know, I think $249 is pretty good.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.320
Definitely it's different.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.600
A lot of people though, I think their competition is going to be saying, well, our graphics

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:12.600
are better.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.800
You know, we can do HD movies, but yeah.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800
So what?

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.840
You know, I just, I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.520
it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:33.120
I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me, so whatever.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:41.520
All right, moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:43.920
know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.840
I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming, and you know what?

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:50.800
Hey, you know, Drew's waving his hand over there.

01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.480
What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?

01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:56.560
Is it just the cost, or what's the deal?

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:02.040
Right now it's the cost, and I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.600
Like Final Fantasy 13, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.760
Super Smash Bros. Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.080
I'm just waiting for the big name titles.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.280
Well, what current gen systems do you have?

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.280
Do you have a Dreamcast?

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280
I have a PS2.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280
I want a Dreamcast.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:24.640
Well, you probably still get one cheap, and good news for you Dreamcast owners, there

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.320
is another Dreamcast game coming out.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:32.020
Play Asia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020
October.

01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.560
It's a side-scrolling space shooter.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:40.840
It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:44.640
It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured,

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.480
distributed, or endorsed by Sega.

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:51.400
One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:55.840
AES and NBS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.840
Oh, interesting.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:57.840
I didn't even catch that.

01:24:57.840 --> 01:24:58.840
I went to the website.

01:24:58.840 --> 01:24:59.840
Ah, very cool.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:06.040
I just want to give the website real quick, if anyone's interested, www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:10.440
The one thing about it, though, is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:17.600
Neo Geo carts, so yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo, unless

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.440
you get CD or Dreamcast.

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:24.760
Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince,

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.640
that OLR reported on a few months ago.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640
Yeah, that's true.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640
Remember the Genesis game?

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640
Yeah, very cool.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:36.200
All right, well, we're going to move on, and I was thinking we were going to do the drawing

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.240
very soon, but now there was just a net split, so we have to wait for that situation to clear

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.320
itself out before we can do the giveaway, so I'll have to wait a little bit on that,

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:50.240
but definitely make your way on over to chat.orangelaungeradio.com when the situation resolves a little later

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.240
on in the evening.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.500
We'll be doing that Wii giveaway, but for now, we've got to do one of our favorite segments

01:25:55.500 --> 01:26:00.560
here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that is Dark Sakura's very own website of the week.

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.940
She surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and left and right, and finds a

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.480
website that she deems worthy of your attention.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:10.120
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be looking at this week?

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:21.280
My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.280
It's smashmyps3.com.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:30.760
Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.760
Smash My PS3.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.680
And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:45.760
young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:53.760
3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting and waiting and waiting for

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:56.320
their very own PlayStation 3.

01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:05.520
Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:13.760
different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:20.920
PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.640
Translated, that means they smash that thing to the ground.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.240
It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:37.040
At abstract translation, a method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.920
Now I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe they did take the second

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:41.920
one and sell it.

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.400
Now that their conscience cleared a little bit, out of curiosity, will you be visiting

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:47.400
SmashMyWe.com?

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.400
The sequel?

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.400
No, that will make me cry.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:56.520
No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny, because there's people who are so

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:02.640
freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:10.600
Yeah, I actually, there's a, you can't get laid, Jiranami, there's actually, there was

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:14.400
a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:17.960
The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool,

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.960
and I'm looking forward to it.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.840
There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.960
Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:26.960
Let's pray.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.240
Say it in commands that I give my soul to Sony.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.560
Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like watching someone

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.360
smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point?

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.480
Wait, does that mean that Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.480
I haven't seen that.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:46.680
No, I love Little Nicky!

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.680
Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.840
Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes, he eats crayons.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.680
He's like the Pooh of Cthulhu.

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.160
He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.200
fecal matter.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:06.680
Wow, that's interesting.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:12.040
Alright, what we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.520
here, and it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.560
to hold off on the contest a little bit here.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:22.400
We'll fill you in after this taped segment, what we're going to do, we're hoping the rest

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400
of chat comes back in.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.520
Rob broke the internet.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:25.520
I didn't break it.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:26.840
I have a backup plan just in case.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.080
I'll run it by DMN, but we're going to go to this taped bit.

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.440
Dark Soccer and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland, and they

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.280
thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:42.160
So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.160
people.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:45.800
So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:50.560
Well, in the car we were thinking, hey vehicle, I did interview people to see why they're

01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:51.560
out in line.

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:55.900
So I was like, Jamie was keeping our place on the line, and I was going to go play reporter.

01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:59.880
And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.800
I don't like talking to new people.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.800
I'm pretty shy.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.120
I am pretty shy around new people.

01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:08.240
So I walked up and I was representing Orange Land.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.080
So I'm like, hi, do you mind if I interview you for orangelandradio.com?

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:13.080
It's a video game.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:17.700
You know, I went through the whole thing, and most of them went, uh, sure.

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.920
So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.920
So I'm sorry.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.160
I'm sorry you have to listen to those.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.160
No, it's cool.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.680
So yeah, DMN?

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:30.640
So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640
Good job.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640
Oh, yeah.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.440
Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:41.520
This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Land Radio message line from the line outside Target

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.520
in Citrus Heights, California.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.520
Say hi, everybody.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:51.480
So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.480
night.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.480
So, well, done by our house lesbian.

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:55.480
Hi.

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.480
Hi.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.480
And, uh, stay tuned to listen.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.480
Okay, bye-bye.

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.840
Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Orange Land Radio.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:09.640
I am Chris, also known as DisneyPunk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.640
Garden Center, actually.

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.600
We're under the sign that says Garden Center, and there's probably looks to be about 30

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:15.600
people online.

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.600
I'm going to start at the end, because the end rules.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.600
Huh.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.600
It's girls and acts.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.600
The girls.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.800
I'm right in front of a guy and a girl, one's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.800
hats on.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.800
One's got an Alcatraz office on.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:27.800
That's great.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:28.800
So we're going to ask a couple of questions.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.800
First of all, can you state your name?

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800
Jamie.

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800
Jamie?

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800
Our co-star, Focker, actually, is named Jamie, too.

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.800
No, I'm kidding.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.800
Can I have your name?

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800
Aaron.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:36.800
Aaron.

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:46.800
Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at,

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.800
what is it, two, two o'clock in the morning?

01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:51.800
Well, it's my birthday today.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:52.800
Thanks.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.800
I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.000
I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones, because the

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.800
codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.800
Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800
No.

01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.800
Definitely not.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.800
Definitely not.

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:10.800
Why not?

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:13.800
I'm not as interested, really, right now.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.800
Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:17.800
Fair enough.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:20.800
And can I ask you guys a random question?

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.800
What's your favorite color?

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.800
Blue.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800
Green?

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.800
Okay, those were both wrong answers and you failed.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:28.800
I'm kidding.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:29.800
Orange.

01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:30.800
Orange, okay.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:33.800
Can I ask you, sir, what's your name?

01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800
Nathan.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.800
Nathan?

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.800
Okay, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.800
Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan,

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:42.800
I grew up on it.

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.800
All right, old school fan.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.800
Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.800
No, absolutely not.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800
Okay.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:54.800
And here's your obligatory question.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.800
That's a good one.

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:58.800
I can't really think of an obligatory question.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:32:59.800
What's your favorite color?

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:00.800
Red.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:01.800
Red?

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.800
Okay.

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:03.800
That was the right answer.

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:04.800
You win.

01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:07.800
All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:11.800
There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here and there isn't a big line,

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.800
so good luck.

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.800
Good evening, radio fans.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:20.800
And this is Kristin again with your Wii.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.800
I guess it would be our cast of our Wii.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:25.800
I don't know what you call it.

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:28.800
But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.800
And I'm here with, can you state your name?

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800
Sarah.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800
Sarah.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:36.800
I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line,

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.800
and now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:42.800
But she's probably got the most awesome hat here.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:45.800
It's a white hat, like, baseball cap with a Wii.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:50.800
It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.800
So can I ask you, she's actually great.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.800
What's your shirt?

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.800
Donkey Kong.

01:33:54.800 --> 01:33:55.800
That's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.800
That's awesome.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:01.800
So can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.800
Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:06.800
Actually, how long have you been here?

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.800
I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.800
Not too terribly long, yeah.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.800
That's not bad.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:17.800
Why do you think the Wii is waiting for just early in the morning?

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:18.800
Twilight Princess, first of all.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:23.800
Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while,

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.800
and I think it's certainly worth the wait.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.800
Yep.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:28.800
Did you get a PS3?

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.800
Oh, hell no.

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:35.800
Do you see a difference, or is it just the price?

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:40.800
I would not pay $600 to test out an unproven format of disc, no.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.800
They're getting too big for their shorts.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.800
Oh, you are loved by many Orange Los Angeles nerds.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.800
Are they all bashed on you all the time?

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.800
And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.800
Blue.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.800
You fail and lose.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:58.800
I'm sorry.

01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.800
I meant to say orange.

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:00.800
I meant to say orange.

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:02.800
Okay, you survived.

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:06.800
All right, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii,

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.800
but I don't think it will be that bad.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:09.800
There's not that many people in line.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:10.800
Thank you very much.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.800
You're welcome.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.800
Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800
What is your quest?

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.800
You.

01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:20.800
Cake or death.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800
Cake, please.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800
Very well.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.800
I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:28.800
I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions,

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.800
but I was so nervous.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.800
I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them,

01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.800
and I just kept, what's your favorite color?

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.800
It's all right.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800
It's an internet radio show.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.800
You don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie.

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.800
You still are.

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.800
You're Saint Chris, remember?

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:47.800
She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:51.800
No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:53.800
if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.800
I wanted to, they both, I was trying to help your radio.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:58.800
It's fun.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.800
No, it's funny.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.800
I like it, because I like hearing people's reactions to it.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:02.800
No.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:03.800
Hell no.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:06.800
But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later,

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:08.800
but I just had to interrupt to say that, because that was funny.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:09.800
So back to the tape.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.800
Hello, radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people,

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.800
in line for the Wii.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:17.800
Can you guys speak your name?

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.800
Stella.

01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:21.800
John.

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.800
How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:25.800
Since, like, nine.

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:26.800
About, like, eight.

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:27.800
Okay.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:28.800
What's your name?

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:29.800
Kyle.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:30.800
Kyle?

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800
How long have you been here?

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.800
Just kind of.

01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.800
What do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:38.800
What?

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.800
Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.800
What's so special about it?

01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.800
Because it's so kick-ass, and there's Zelda.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.800
I'm just picking it up for a friend.

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.800
Wow.

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:52.800
Damn, he must owe you, or you owe him.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800
Do you owe him money?

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.800
Okay.

01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.800
I'm just here for kicks.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.800
You're just hanging out in the cold.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.800
All right.

01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:05.800
David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:06.800
No.

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.800
Not unless you drop the prize.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:13.800
Okay.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.800
He's just here for kicks.

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800
All right.

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:18.800
And your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.800
Green.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.800
Plaid.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.800
Yellow.

01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:22.800
Yellow?

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.800
Okay.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.800
You win.

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.800
Plaid wins.

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:26.800
All right.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.800
Well, thank you, guys.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.800
If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:32.800
tonight, or we're on podcast.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:34.800
You can download it on iTunes.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.800
Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, so it should be fun.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:39.800
Yay, Wii.

01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.800
Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but this is the next one.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.800
This is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.800
But we're interviewing people at the Wii.

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.800
So, Jamie, stop talking to people.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800
What?

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.800
Okay.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.800
State your name, please.

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.800
DarkSlashTheGreatAndMighty.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.800
That was pretty pathetic.

01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800
Write my act.

01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.800
Literally?

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800
Yeah.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.800
In public.

01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800
Okay.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.800
And you get to be asked these questions, too.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:08.800
First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:09.800
I was bored.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:10.800
Okay.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.800
Yeah, you're not bad at it.

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:14.800
All right.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:15.800
Are you getting a PS3?

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.800
Yeah.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.800
Okay, okay.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:25.800
We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a traitor and preordered one, but right before

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:26.800
he clicked GameStop.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.800
You guys actually get it?

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.800
No, we're getting a second shipment.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:29.800
I don't care, because Sony sucks my butt.

01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:30.800
Here from her.

01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.800
Sony sucks.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:32.800
Your obligatory question.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.800
Can you peel potatoes correctly?

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:47.800
You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama,

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.800
and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:55.800
Nintendo, please give her money.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:59.800
Better living than Nintendo, I'm now the aluminum chef.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.800
Uh-huh.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:01.800
Hey, Jory.

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:04.800
Thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.800
I go on to the next step.

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:11.800
Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the Wii line at Target.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:15.800
And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are, or one of them at least, who's apparently

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.800
a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second.

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.800
I want to get closer to him.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.800
They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:23.800
I've lost five of them.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:24.800
Yeah, a lot of them.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.800
I just think that that's like old school.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:28.800
Yeah.

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.800
All right, all right.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.800
Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.800
What's your name?

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.800
Jory.

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:37.800
Jory.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:38.800
What's your name?

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:39.800
ratio.

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.800
Jory started laughing.

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.800
Jordan.

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.800
Okay, Jordan.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:53.800
All right, can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at two in the morning?

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.800
We want the Wii.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.800
We want the Wii.

01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:56.800
We want the Wii.

01:39:56.800 --> 01:39:57.800
Why do you want the Wii so badly?

01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.800
Twilight Princess.

01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.800
Twilight Princess.

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:00.800
And you?

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.800
Twilight Princess.

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:02.800
Twilight Princess.

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:03.800
That's right.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:04.800
Cora!

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.800
Can I get your name?

01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800
Kristen.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800
Travis?

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.800
Travis.

01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:12.800
Why are you out here?

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.800
Did you get a Wii for his brother?

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.800
He owe him money?

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.800
No, I'm just a good friend, and that's broke.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:44.080
I'm going to ask you guys to get a PS3, or planning on getting a PS3?

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.080
Maybe $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.080
That's the only game I will be getting today.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.080
Now.

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.080
Now.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.080
I'll borrow his metal gear.

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:53.080
Yeah, I'll borrow mine.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.080
No.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.080
No PS3.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:56.080
No.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:57.080
Yeah.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.080
Final fantasy is 13.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.080
To be 18 to mark.

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.080
Alright.

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:01.080
And here's your biggest question.

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:02.080
What's your favorite color?

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:03.080
Blue.

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.080
No.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.080
Brown.

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.080
You fail.

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.080
You fail.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.080
Green.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.080
Okay, that's correct.

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.080
Blue.

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:11.080
No, you don't.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.080
Fail.

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:13.080
Fail.

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.080
Fail.

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.080
Fail.

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:16.080
Fail.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.080
Fail.

01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:18.080
Fail.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.080
Fail.

01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.080
Fail.

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.080
Fail.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.080
Fail.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.080
Black.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.080
Ah, that's.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.080
Baby blue.

01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.080
No.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.080
Oh, I like you.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.080
Alright.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:34.360
Alright, I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a dark soccer fanboy

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:35.360
apparently.

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.360
So, I'll be there in a second.

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:37.360
Hello, radio listeners.

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:42.480
I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.480
Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:47.800
So, can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.920
Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:51.920
You're not in the chat at all?

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.920
Okay, but you are a listener?

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:53.920
Archive listener.

01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920
Awesome.

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:58.920
Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m. for a week?

01:41:58.920 --> 01:41:59.920
Oh, wait.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:00.920
The we?

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.920
I thought it was in the PHP line.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.920
No, I'm getting a we.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920
Okay, why are you getting a we?

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.920
Spongebob.

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:05.920
Wait, wait.

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920
I also hear Zelda's pretty good.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920
Zelda's.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920
Okay.

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:09.920
Well, we'll buy that.

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:10.920
Alright.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.920
Are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:12.920
I'll probably buy a PS3.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.920
My friends get it all the way but I'm not gonna buy it myself.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:19.920
Okay.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:20.920
I see.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:21.920
What's your favorite color?

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:22.920
Brown.

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920
Brown, yeah.

01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.920
No, hold on.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920
I put white.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920
Loki is displeased with you.

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920
Loki is displeased with you.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.920
He's a Microsoft fan.

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:35.920
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.480
Loki is displeased with you.

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:39.080
Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.240
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.

01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.840
I like Microsoft.

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.040
Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.760
It's amazing.

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.440
What's your favorite part?

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.680
I like Epus of the Week.

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.080
Jamie has just informed us that he came up with that.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.160
It's funny because I always talk about the roads

01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:55.720
of Sacramento.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:57.400
I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.720
So it's pretty cool.

01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.760
Awesome.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.560
Is there anything you can, any advice you'd want to give Rob,

01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:05.880
Jamie, and Loki?

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:07.840
Yeah, I'd love to go snowboarding.

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.640
Yeah, I'd go snowboarding more often.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.760
More snowboarding inside the gaming news.

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:14.720
I see.

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:19.800
Can I give you a hint of another thing to mention to them?

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:22.720
To any of you guys, I would mention more lesbians

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.200
on the show.

01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:26.040
Oh, yeah, I'd love to do it now.

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:26.960
Aw.

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:28.200
All right, we have to move on.

01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.680
I've got another group of people to answer that.

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.680
More lesbians.

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.520
Aw, that didn't work.

01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.720
OK.

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.400
All right, I'll move on to the next group.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.080
Thank you, guys.

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.480
Hello, Orange Land listeners.

01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.400
I am at the front of the line.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:46.520
Somebody just yelled something.

01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.360
That was interesting.

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.560
Anyway, I am at the front of the line

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.160
with some people playing monoculars.

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:53.680
And I actually haven't gotten an OK to interview all of them,

01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:54.560
but let's start.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:56.200
Can I interview her?

01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:56.720
OK.

01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.680
Can I get your name?

01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.680
I'm Nick.

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:00.520
Nick, I got some logo t-shirts.

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.560
Rod.

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:04.640
Barnsworth.

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.840
Hey, Eric.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.400
Katie.

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.360
Katie.

01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.640
I like to go by Eepus.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:09.640
Eepus?

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:10.400
Gotcha.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:14.840
Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you

01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.200
to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:21.400
We just needed a cool place to play Monopoly.

01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.880
Oh.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.440
No, seriously.

01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.360
What's the Wii worth waiting for?

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.760
Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.480
I mean, that's all we're really doing.

01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.880
We had nothing else better to do.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:37.280
Just hanging out with friends, playing games,

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.240
and we really want the Wii, I guess.

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.120
Why do you really want the Wii?

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:43.840
Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.

01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.800
Nothing better to do next weekend.

01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.440
That works.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.520
I want to fit in.

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.360
I want to be in the in crowd.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.040
You're not cool unless you have a Wii.

01:44:52.040 --> 01:44:52.720
Exactly.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:53.240
OK.

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.920
That's going to be so much fun out of you, Barrett.

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.040
Do you want to come back?

01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:58.520
Yeah.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:44:59.280
OK.

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:01.600
I heard it actually increases sexual performance.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.440
Yeah.

01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.960
With the wrist movements.

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.760
No, with the wrist movements.

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.880
The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.360
I think that's the most interesting answer

01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:20.800
I've gotten yet.

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:23.440
I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:25.760
of innovating the game system.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.080
And that's the most intelligent one at the table.

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.560
OK.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:31.840
All right.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.840
Can I ask you guys, is he getting a PS3 at all?

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.520
Or what do you think about it?

01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:39.720
If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay $600 on it.

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:41.280
The one that goes down in price.

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.120
Hang on, I'm moving.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.440
You mean the piece of shit three that already have glitches?

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.200
Yeah, pretty much.

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.880
Oh, whoa.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.200
That's what you better bring in.

01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:51.960
Yeah, I'll be getting one.

01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:54.600
Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.120
going to glitch, and $600 for something

01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.360
that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once

01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:00.840
in a while?

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:01.560
Yeah, I don't know.

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.800
Yeah, that's like getting a hooker downtown

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:08.040
than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.

01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:08.960
OK, I like this table.

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.280
These people are interesting.

01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:12.280
OK, you guys get an obligatory question.

01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.400
What's your favorite color?

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:14.280
Clear.

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:15.680
Fail.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.720
Blonde.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:19.360
I'll accept that.

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.000
Corn yellow.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.520
Interesting, I accept.

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.240
Damn it, you stole mine.

01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.000
Fail.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:27.600
I'll pick.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.880
I like pink, OK.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.080
Light purple.

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:33.200
OK, I'll accept that.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:36.640
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.240
Well, thank you guys for being with me.

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:39.240
Good luck.

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:40.640
All right, that was our last one.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.880
They are at the front of the line.

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.120
And I'll call one more time to tell you

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:49.120
how I feel about all this, if anyone really gives a shit.

01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.280
So, all right, thanks.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.480
Hello, Orange Toys R' Us, and this is the last one.

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:55.840
I'll be making these, because I bet you're just sick of them,

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:56.840
and sick of me.

01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:59.600
But you get one more little tidbit,

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.360
and that is from Moi, your tokenar lesbian at the show.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:07.760
I'm actually out here because a bunch of people

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:10.000
are waiting out in line.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.600
And they look cold, and they do not

01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.760
look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.

01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.320
So Jamie and I actually offered to get them a coffee

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:23.000
and donuts, and that's pretty much why I'm out here,

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.240
is because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.400
That's the only reason.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.880
And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too, so whatever.

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.480
I actually never played Zelda before.

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:35.760
I never got to, because my daddy did not let me.

01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:37.160
I was a deprived child.

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.120
So anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.240
Disney Punk.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.000
And this is in front of Target, reporting for the Wii line.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.440
And just to let you know, there's

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.240
a Best Buy right across the way.

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:52.280
And that line's like 10 times the longer.

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:56.440
And that amuses me.

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.640
But this line's cooler, because they're getting coffee

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:01.560
and donuts soon.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.880
All right, have fun out there in the ethernet.

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.360
All right, thank you, Chris.

01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.680
I know some of the folks in the chat room were like,

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.880
oh, this is long.

01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:12.480
This is long.

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.920
You guys are talking to too damn many people.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.560
I am so sorry.

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:16.640
Don't be sorry, because you know what?

01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.400
Usagi hit the air.

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.800
Usagi, I say Usagi.

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:22.200
Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to help.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.600
But no, she's right on here, because the quote here

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:28.240
is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.040
about, the best people on Earth.

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.040
And that's exactly it.

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:33.600
That's what made last night so fun,

01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.120
was just meeting other nerds.

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:36.480
It was really amazing.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:37.640
They were so nice.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.640
And they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:43.160
And it was really important to interview.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.760
There weren't that many people in line, considering.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.400
And it's like, well, there's not that many people.

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:49.700
We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on.

01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.080
And Rob can edit it later.

01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.000
But it was just really fun meeting all of them.

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:53.880
They all said thanks.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.600
And they all asked, so when is it going to be played?

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:58.280
It was like, I think some of them are in here now.

01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.400
I saw Ace Ender earlier.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:48:59.920
Oh, he's back.

01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:02.060
So that must have been that whole net split thing came back.

01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.720
And some of those other people said, do you got some votes?

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.200
Oh, hi.

01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:07.280
I have to say, too, the group that

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.320
let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.720
You guys were infinitely awesome.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.480
Thank you so much.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:15.880
Sources of amusement and kept me from passing out.

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:17.440
The entire night, the people just

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.200
that were right next to us and right behind us,

01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:21.040
they just were so nice.

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.840
Somebody kept walking up and down, just talking to us.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.920
Everybody was so nice.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.440
It was like one big block party.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.880
It was really cold.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.440
It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.280
Yeah, it was so fun.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.400
I was hearing the single best commentary

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.320
coming from that game of Risk.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.320
That was the best.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.880
Yeah, every now and then you'd hear that collective, oh!

01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:45.480
And every so often, I would ask, who took over the world yet?

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:48.520
I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.320
Oh, man.

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.320
I just took Australia, motherfucker.

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:55.720
The BTF, mate.

01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.680
All right.

01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.520
Now, of course, the chat room is asking.

01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.240
We're running a little long this segment,

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.200
but the chat room is asking, when do we get to win the damn

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.160
Wii?

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:05.000
All right.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.400
Shut up.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.880
This just in.

01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:10.280
We're changing it up on you.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.120
Having the net split earlier in the show

01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.300
made us realize that maybe the chat room isn't

01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:15.680
the best process.

01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:17.600
So we are going to change it just a little bit.

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.240
We can do that because, you know what?

01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.760
It's DMN's Wii, and he's giving it away out

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.040
of the goodness of his heart.

01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.920
This was not something that was given to him.

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:27.800
This was not something that he bought this with his own money,

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.800
and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:30.200
Yes.

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.840
Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners,

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.620
something like that.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.120
So we can do whatever rules we want.

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.240
So here's the new rules.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:37.640
It's easy, and it's still fair.

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.600
There's the AP and it's wins.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:39.100
Go.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:39.600
No, no, no.

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.400
No, I'm just kidding.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.280
So here it is.

01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:43.720
Now, instead of sending me a private message in chat,

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.020
here's what you're going to do.

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:48.040
Remember, this only applies to folks listening live

01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:48.960
Sunday night.

01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:51.240
This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:51.800
on all games.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.400
This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.120
or whatever program you use to download our audio archive

01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.000
later on.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:50:59.640
OK, here it is.

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.280
If you're listening Sunday night and you

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.280
want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.780
Send an email, one email.

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:08.680
If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:11.320
If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP.

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.940
You will be disqualified, and you don't have much time

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:14.760
to pull any tricks.

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:15.520
So here it is.

01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:22.280
Send one email to wiicontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T,

01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:27.200
at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.840
number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:32.600
on air, or a Skype name will do as well.

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.120
And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in,

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:38.120
and we'll be drawing a very random one

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:41.520
when we kick off part B. All right?

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.680
Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast,

01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:45.480
you're going to have to wait a day.

01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:46.720
All right.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.080
Sucks for you.

01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:51.080
All right, so we will be back soon

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:54.040
to determine the winner of the Wii contest.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.040
And for those of you who got, yep, you do it now.

01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.800
Right now, we're going to have like five minutes

01:51:58.800 --> 01:51:59.600
to get it in there.

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.120
Go, hurry.

01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:02.000
What the hell are you doing listening to us?

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Open up your email and freaking email us.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.720
All right, nope, subject does not

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.220
have to be any particular something.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:09.400
We just opened up the email address for that.

01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:10.040
Send one email.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.720
But the more you suck up to me.

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.220
With your screen name and your number,

01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:16.120
we're going to give away the Wii right at the top of part B.

01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:16.800
So that's it.

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.600
Oh, yes, Chris?

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.920
If you send a naked picture with it,

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:21.400
you know, extra bonus points.

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:22.080
Of me.

01:52:22.080 --> 01:52:22.880
Stop, stop.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:23.600
All right.

01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.120
Boobs only, please.

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:27.400
All right, we'll be back in a little bit

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.400
to find out the winner.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.360
Those of you listening to us on the audio archive,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:31.600
we'll be back in about a day.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.440
And you can hear the exciting conclusion.

01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:34.800
Those of you guys on All Games Radio

We'll be right back.
