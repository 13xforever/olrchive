Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio
We are that video game radio program
Dedicated to video games, gamer culture, and the gamer lifestyle
And tonight's probably going to be a little bit of randomness too
Because we have a very very full house
Say hi everyone
Hi
We've got a very full house tonight
Obviously it's a big big week for gaming
So let's get right into it
First let's introduce ourselves
I'm one of your co-hosts
My name is Rob Roberts
Say hello as well to Miss Dark Sakura
Jamie Summers
Bwar
How you doing?
So freaking worn out
You're worn out?
You're tired?
Exhausted?
Well somebody was asleep in his warm bed
Alright we'll get to that in a minute
Say hello as well to Tech Master Loki
Hello
How you doing sir?
I'm doing fine
Alright, right on
Joining us tonight
We have a variety of special guests
First let's introduce those folks that you know
You've met before
And you know quite well
Say hello over there to Drunami
What's up?
Or as he might be called tonight
Drunawee
I don't know
Wee
Alright
Say hello to the Orange Lounge Radio
One and only lesbian
Say hello to Chris
The official lesbian
The official lesbian
Well you have to share that title with Magsy
She's the roaming lesbian
She's the roaming?
I'm the in-house lesbian
Oh I see
You're our in-house
She's our field lesbian
Yeah she's the field lesbian
From the far off land of Wisconsin
Or the Isle of Lesbos
As I was saying over dinner
Alright
Alright anyway
Also say hello to somebody who's come from a long way away
Certainly not the Isle of Lesbos
But the Isle of Redmond Washington
Say hello to Mr. DMN John
Hi everybody
And you guys know John
Because he calls into our show like all the freaking time
Oh I don't
And yes you do
And now he's here in studio
With us
Yeah
I'm gonna
I'm actually gonna call
When the sky blinds open
What
What
I'm gonna do it right now hold on
No no no no no
No no no
What possessed you to come be here in Sacramento with us on this interesting day
Because I don't want to have to be at work during this fucking pandemonium
And where do you work for our first time?
I work at the magical land where Wii's flow like wine Nintendo
Really?
Yes
Last I checked
I sometimes have Wii flow when I drink a lot of wine but I don't
Alright forget it bad joke
Look you've probably had so many of those puns the past few days
You're all gonna just die
So anyway well welcome to the show DMN
Thank you thank you for having me
And you know just having him here in the studio
And like hanging out with us all weekend
It just proves Orange Launch Radio listeners
Stalking us works
It really does
Yeah
Here he is
And he violated me last night
And it was no I'm just kidding
I'm totally chill
That's not what you said
You were
You were
Can I say that?
And it's a family show boys and girls
Sort of
I know it's not really
No it's not
Alright look
I know we might have gotten some new listeners this week
You know not just because you know iTunes
And all the great reviews you guys have been leaving for us there
I've been you know up in our ranking and stuff
And XB stream and the cool people over there at us
Default podcasts
Just everywhere else we've been listed
And then locally this week we got some support as well
We'll talk about that in a little bit
So if you're new to Orange Launch Radio
And want to say hey and welcome
And we're just a program
We go on for like two and a half three hours
We're gamers just like the rest of you guys
We don't get paid for this
At least not yet
We've been doing this almost five years
In May it'll be five years
So about four and a half years we've been doing this
We started as a program dedicated to
Dance Dance Revolution
And music based video games
Parappa amplitude things of that nature
But you know we found that
It kind of ended up being a little too limiting
Especially when there was a very slow period
Think of the period before DDR Supernova
Before Guitar Hero
There was a very slow period of music gaming
So we thought you know we're video game nuts first
So we started doing a general video game show
So that's where we're at now
Because we're all nerds
And we invite you guys to be nerdy with us
So please come to our chat room
If you're listening to us live here on Sunday night
If you're not listening to us on our audio blog
You can come join us in the chat room
It's chat.orangelaunchradio.com
And guess what
If you're listening live on this Sunday night
You definitely want to be here tonight
Because DMN what did you bring with you
For one of our random chatters tonight?
I brought a Wii
Not my Wii you sickos
Get your head out of the gutter
No a Wii and a box with the Wii Sports
And all that fun stuff
And I do know we have a worldwide audience
But it should be said
This is a US region Wii
Yeah this is a region one Wii
So I'm really sorry to all you
Japanese, South American, Antarctica
European listeners
It probably won't do you much good
But if you want to win it that badly
You gotta be in chat
It's gonna be at some point tonight
More rules to come later
But first
We usually start off the show with a little bit of
How was your gaming week
But obviously our gaming weeks have been somewhat interrupted
By other madness going on out there
And that would be the craziness going on around
The Playstation 3 and Wii lineups
So first off, Playstation 3
I know a lot of us here in this room
Weren't really gonna do the campout thing
For the Playstation 3
You know I've voiced previously on the program
I'm not ready for Playstation 3
It's just there's no game out right now
I really want
Wake me when Metal Gear Solid 4
Final Fantasy 13
Some of the big franchises are on their way
But I'm not into PS3 right now
I think Loki's in a very similar camp
But DarkSakura has expressed on a previous show
That she was already signed up
Thanks to her husband for a Playstation 3
So what happened?
How did that go down?
Did he just bring it home magically one day
Or did you guys wait anywhere?
No because it was an employee purchase
It's gonna be on the next shipment
Which is fair
You know he got to reserve it first
We were guaranteed one
But now Dan's like
Maybe I'm just gonna cancel my reserve
I'm like the hell you will
Wait you see
I don't understand DarkSakura
Cause you tend to go back and forth
You're like some days you're very anti-PlayStation
Some days you're very like
You better bring me that damn Playstation
No
I hate it okay
I hate it
But I have to have every video game system
That comes out
I see
So it's the collector in me that says
I want
And besides that I'm gonna play White Knights
When it's out
And
Why the hate for Sony Playstation right now?
Cause Ken Kuragi eats crayons and wears a bicycle helmet
And is leased to the jungle gym
I see
I see
Thank you Magsy
But certain games are gonna change your mind
Like White Knights and things are gonna change your mind later
Well White Knights I definitely wanna play
There's a few other things that I'm sorta curious about
But right now not curious enough
That I would go out and wait in line for a PS3
One of my coworkers waited from Tuesday until the release date
Wow
I'm going to interview him Monday
Was your coworker
Now was your coworker
Now this is a lot of controversy going around around the Playstation 3 launch
Did your coworker actually wait in the line to get a Playstation 3 to play
Or were they getting one to sell
He was getting one to play
Oh well that's admirable
He got Madden
Okay I see
So sports game fan you know obviously
Yeah I can see that if you're a hardcore sports game
You wanna have the up graphics and all that cool stuff
That comes with you know the new system
Okay I see that
Alright so more to come on Playstation 3 a little later when Jamie finally gets hers
And you know I can say this
I did touch the demo station they had at Target
I randomly went to Target on I think it was Wednesday I went there
Wednesday night I went over there just to buy some things I needed around the house
Like shampoo and stuff
And there was already a line forming for the Playstation 3
And I just said hi
I was like Playstation 3 right
They're all yeah
So you know they were you know having fun just camping out
I didn't ask the eBay question but I went in the store
And they actually had a demo station there to play
So I picked up MotorStorm
And just played that a little bit
And I gotta be honest guys I'm not feeling it
I don't know maybe I just didn't spend enough quality time with it
I mean again I'm playing this in a Target
I'm not sitting down on my couch
My you know surround and the HD and all that stuff
I just I wasn't feeling it
I feel like I don't know burnouts more of a racer for me
Or even test drive was better
I just wasn't feeling the MotorStorm
I mean granted it's a different
It's you know a very different type of racer
But even it felt kind of slow to me
Kind of clunky I don't know
So I wasn't really feeling the love with MotorStorm
I'm sorry to say
I did see the basketball game which is NBA 07 yes
And that looked very nice
I thought it was a very good looking game
And pretty slick
So if I were going to be getting a Playstation 3 at launch
That would because you know I like basketball more than any other sport
That probably is the game I would pick up
It would be that game but
Yeah well I think that the PS3 seems to be geared a lot more towards
The sports gamers and the hardcore
Because you usually see the people who
Especially the sports games who just come
And will buy it without hesitation
They always have the stupid Madden day
Where people I've heard camp out for it
If that is the case
It's kind of sad but
Yeah I see your point
Well so that was pretty much Playstation 3
Loki did you come in contact with any PS3 stuff this week
Did you play a demo station or anything
I watched I went by the best buy actually
Today it was funny because I went down there
And it was completely dead and the station was open
I saw MotorStorm but I mean it looks exactly the same
When I saw it at E3
Although the videos I've seen online look really cool
And it made me want to get it at some point
But I don't know
Then we saw that lair demonstration thing going on
At Walmart that was frozen on Saturday
So yeah I don't really know
How well the demo kiosks were working
But at least one of the two that I've seen have been frozen
So I don't know
Alright well let's go to the chat room
Over at chat.orangelandtrader.com
For some comments from our chatters
They're like the invisible guests
We love to be an interactive show
So let's see what's going on in the chat room over there
Let's see
JeremyTau1 says
Am I the only one that finds it kind of weird that some people camp out for days for a mirror toy?
Not when there's a profit to be made
As some people found out with Playstation 3
That was really their mirror motivation
It's like hey I make more money doing this than I do at my job
I don't know
Me personally I don't know
The little angel that sits on my shoulder says
Not a good idea
So I don't do it
But I guess everybody's a little bit different when it comes to those things
BlackLab in our chat room says
Congrats to those PS3 campers that didn't get shot
We have some crazy news about those Playstation 3 lines
We'll get to a little bit later
Okay so after the Playstation 3 launch
Obviously then the Wii line started forming
And that's kind of where we come in
Because I think we've also voiced previously on the program
That we have played Wii
Wii is the cheaper option
And as we said earlier in the program
You know we do this show as a hobby not a job
So you know our day jobs only give us so much money
So the Wii is really realistically
In my eyes the more affordable console anyway
So that's why I ended up deciding to pick that one up
But Loki you were the first one to get your hands on a Wii
You had a Wii before a lot of people did
How did this happen?
Because I work for a video and game distributor
And of course we get ours in early
Like on Wednesdays when we got them in
So that we could ship them to our customers
So that they would have them for the street date
And me being the greedy bastard that I am
I overnighted mine from our one branch in Oklahoma City
And so I had mine on Thursday
And playing it ever since
So you know what this meant boys and girls
Party at Loki's house on Friday
So right on
So yeah we played a little bit of the Wii there
So then flash forward to last night
When the real camping started
Some of us were at dinner
And we were at Strings
And this little local Italian place
I keep forgetting we're an international show
So not everybody knows that
And we were just sitting around
And I don't know like lightning just kind of struck
And we were just kind of like
Dude let's go like buy cookies and orange soda
And go around to lines and just hand out goodies
Let's just go and like talk to gamers
And Loki can tape it
Maybe we can do a YouTube thing
And we'll just hand him stuff
Because you know you read all those reports
About people getting shot and stuff
But we were seeing the early reports from the Wii line
That a lot more people were being very cordial
So we were like
Let's go have fun
Let's go meet some more nerds
So we did
We hit up
We started at a local Target
We went to a Walmart
We went to GameStop
Where people were lining up for the midnight launch
That they already had pre-ordered
We went to another Target
The Great Land or Super Target
Whatever it's called
We went to like a Best Buy
Circuit City
We went all around
We went to Toys R Us too
That was fun
Yeah the one guy at Toys R Us
That looked very scary
He was like throw the cookie and drive
DMN what did you think about our little experience
Doing the Cookie Patrol?
I thought that was a lot of fun
You got to interact with a lot of people
Who seemed genuinely anxious about the Wii
I honestly think that most of those people in that line
Were there to play it
Not to eBay it
Where as opposed to the PS3 people
Are thinking
Oh I can make double what I bought off this
I'm going to be a rude little bastard in line
A lot of these people were really good in line
They had a lot of fun
They seemed to be very grateful for the cookies
So if any of you are listening
Hi and we love you
Alright very cool
So anyway
One of our favorite lines
Now we liked a lot of the people that we met
I mean it was kind of weird
Because we would walk up at first
And some people were like
What are these guys going to do to us
Do they have BB guns
Or what's going to happen
You're poisoning the cookies Rob
You're poisoning the cookies
So you can get your weegee
That was my running joke throughout the whole night
Is that people went you know
I'd say oh the cookie
The arsenic in the cookies
Will kick in about 15 minutes
Have your wallets out
Wait wait wait
Arsenic?
I thought it was laxative
Whatever it was I don't know
Whatever the joke was
So we went to all these people
We met a lot of great people
But we
I don't know what it was
About the line to target Great Land
But maybe it was the fact that like
Somebody in that line there
Actually listened to the program
And like knew who we were
And that was kind of cool
And then there was just a
Like there was another girl
That you ended up giving your hat to
Right
Even though everybody everywhere
Was asking for your wee hat
My jacket too
God
What made you give it to that girl
She seemed really genuinely interested in the wee
And she seemed pretty hardcore
Right on
Yeah she was
And so getting back into this
Where Chris and Jamie
No it's cool it's cool
So I called Jamie on my phone
Because I really
I asked the target Great Land line
I go
How many units are you guys getting here
And they're like 60
And I'm looking at the line
I'm like
There's only like 25 people in this line
This is like a great opportunity to line up
So I called Jamie on my cell
And I said
Girl if you want a wee
Get your butt down here
You can get a wee
So what happened
I interrupted something you were doing
Somebody else had
This was just basically me being exhausted already
And somebody else said
Oh yeah
The target Great Lands are doing
The target Great Lands are doing a midnight launch
Which part of my brain went bullshit
But the rest of me was so tired
That I was like
Yeah I'm gonna go
We were actually
My friend Marissa
Who I mentioned on the show a few times
She was in town
And she's a singer-songwriter from LA
And there was a
Singer-songwriter convention going on
Just actually a few
At the
What was it
The Marriott
Yeah the Marriott
It was the Marriott
Chris we don't need to tell them all where I live
Sorry
That's alright
So we were
You know we were exhausted
It was very claustrophobic
They had blocked off an entire section
Just for the musicians
And everyone was like
Oh man
And then Jamie calls me on my phone
She's like
Where are you
I'm like
I'm at the end of the hall
She's like
We need to go to Target
Right now
I'm like
Are you sick or something
I was just like
Where am I gonna get a wee
I'm like
Okay
And since I'm hanging out with her
I kind of
She's my ride
And I wasn't really expecting
To get one
And part of me was excited too
About because Megsy called earlier
Oh yeah Megsy
And was humping her wee
Yeah she's like
I'm touching it
I'm touching it
Ah
That was her on the phone
It was really really funny
Funny enough that's not the first time they had that conversation
I was getting all excited and all that
So we
You had wee fever
We ran down there
Weaver fever
We pulled up to the
Weevil
We pulled up to the line
And Jamie rolled down the window
And screamed out
Orange Little Dream
And someone at the front yelled
Dark Sakura
It was really really funny
And then she parked and said
Can we hang out with you guys
And then someone like
She wasn't really in the zone
So let me clarify
Dark Sakura used her celebrity to cut in line
Yeah
You're a bitch Jamie
I'm not a bitch
No no
She wouldn't have done it if
I mean they were getting 60
And there was only like 20 people in line
So you know nobody was getting hurt so
But we ended up going there
And slowly it dawned on me
This is not a midnight launch
Cause it was like a half an hour till midnight
It was like 1130 something
And it was
And Jamie
I'm like Jamie
This isn't a midnight launch
She's like
It's not
So we ended up
I was
I was
Again already tired of having been around that many people
It was really claustrophobic
We were with Marissa
But we jumbled things around
We ended up
What we were gonna do
Is we were gonna go back
Wait with them until morning
This is like at one o'clock
We were gonna wait with them
And then at one point
I was gonna go for coffee and donuts
Which started off really weird
I just like
Cause we had to leave and go get stuff
And I'm like
Does anybody want anything while I'm gone?
And someone's like
The eyes kind of looked and went
Huh?
Someone's getting something?
I'm like
Does anyone want coffee?
And everybody went
Me?
I think one thing we've kind of discovered
Through this whole process
Is that
People are really not used to
Other people just wanting to do nice things for them
Everyone was so shocked
That I offered to get
Someone actually brought up their money
I'm like
No no it's on me
And they're like all
They looked at me with like the weirdest look
Like I was giving them a razor
It was so
Yeah that kind of razor
Like killing killing yourself razor
Not the phone
But it's
So
Yeah
By the time we got back
And we waited for
Until like
Like 3.30
I said
Alright I'm gonna go get coffee
And I counted how many people were in line
And it was like
Something like
Just under 30
But to be safe I said 35
So I went to the shell station
Down the street
And said
I need 35 cups of coffee
And they
They gave me
They gave me free
A powdered creamer
And free sugar
You know the stuff that they have
For that store only
For the shell station
Cause like if you buy
35 cups of coffee
You get this free
I'm like
Okay
So
I got some other creamer
And I came back
And everyone was like
Oh coffee
They were really really really happy
I'm like courtesy
Of Orange Land Jameo
Yeah nice pimping for the show by the way
Props to Chris
I mean she
She did this for no reason
Other than she just thought it would be fun
To just buy people coffee
That's actually the reason why I was in line
Is I was looking forward to the fact
Actually I was really tired
I was more tired than Jamie
I'm like
Do I really want to wait outside
But then I offered to get coffee
And it's just the light in people's eyes
Went
And so I said
Okay I get coffee
But it didn't end there
Because you got doughnuts too
How did you
I got crispy
I got
I got six
Well what happened was
I had bought too much coffee
And right
There's
Where the Target is
There's a Best Buy
Just like
In the same parking structure
So I'm like
Well I've got too much coffee
So I'm gonna go see if they want some coffee
And sure enough
The
Oh my gosh
That line
Yeah when we went to Best Buy
With the cookies
They were running from the back
To the front
I'm like
Dude we're gonna come up the line
They were cool
I like the Best Buy line too
They had a big sign that said
We spawn's here
And I asked the guy
I'm like
What the hell does that mean
And they're like
Get it
Because it's gonna spawn here
In a couple hours
I'm like
Oh my god
Meanwhile
And I thought
I was a nerd for doing a radio program
On the internet
Meanwhile while Chris is running around
In my car
Which I'm like
My baby
Your baby's fine
Some kid asked to borrow my DS
And then I pulled up my micro
To play
Oh can I play your micro
What's this
So I had to explain the micro
This is a dead system basically
Here
And play
I have Puzzle Fighter
What else do you have
Uh
I have Kingdom Hearts
I wanna play Puzzle Fighter
What's wrong with Kingdom Hearts
Anyway
So uh
Yeah
So I got too much coffee
I went over to the Best Buy line
And they swarmed me
I'm like
I'm coming back
I had to make
I think five trips
To Shell Station
Oh my god
To get that much cups of coffee
And then I'm like
Does it
And then I called out
Does anyone want donuts
Everyone perked up
Donuts
There was a security guard at Best Buy
And he was like
Oh can you get me the cream filled one
The security guard was so cute
He looked so tired
And he's like
Oh he's like
Can you get me a coffee
I'm like
Yeah I'm coming back with more
And um
People just liked it
I bought six dozen donuts
And six dozen plus one for the guard
I got the little
I made sure I got him the cream
That is so cute
And all the time I said
Courtesy of Orange Lounge Radio
You gave mad pimpage to our show Chris
And for that we love you
But you weren't doing it just
I mean
The promo for the show was just a bonus right
Yeah well I was
You know I'm not really on this show that often
But I feel like I was representing Orange Lounge
Because I was hanging out with Jamie
And I really wanted to you know
It's like you guys have been sweet to me
So I figured hey you know
It's like I'm doing something nice
I'm here representing your show
So here by from here on out folks
We're gonna refer to Chris as Saint Chris
Because she
No she did this out of the goodness of our she
She went and got donuts and coffee
For two lines
Of people waiting for the wee
So a little gesture goes a long way
So good for you Chris
We love you
They look so cool
But they looked at me crazy
Some guy went up to me and goes
Why are you doing this
And this is like
Well you guys look cold
The goodness of my heart
Doesn't factor in at all
But you know
Guys there's a couple old people
In the Best Buy line
And they were so grateful for that coffee
It made my day
Dude one guy in the Great Land line
Had a beer
I saw that
Somebody offered it back
There was a guy there who said
Hey he's really cool
You know we were talking about like
ThinkGeek and different t-shirts
And you know
The joys of Firefox
And he's like
I got some beer if you want some
And I was like
What kind?
Bass
Oooh
Because for anyone who doesn't know
I love beer a lot
And I'm trying to cut down on my beer
Consumption
So I was sorely tempted
I was like
Bass
I love you
Give me beer
Oh wait no
Because the whole problem with that is
The guys are going around the corner to pee
I don't have the equipment
To go around the corner and pee
Well you could
No
But it's just not a cemetery
No
Okay I'm in an awkward position on the floor
Right next to Rob's legs
But somebody in the chatroom asked me
How much money I spent
I can't tell who that is
I
Footy something?
Oh footy monster probably
Footy monster
They asked me how much money I spent
Enough
Enough
It was my money though
So Orange Lounge will continue to
Spend all of the money that they get
On our crackin' booths
On your crackin' booths
I would also like to add something
That's kind of funny
According to nextgenwars.com
Uh
It looks like Wii is beating up PlayStation 3
Well they have more units at launch
I mean that's kind of
I mean to be fair
Well they
I mean they've basically got a greater market share
Well we'll see
We'll see
I mean we'll see
It's still a long ways to go
It's still a long ways to go
I mean I'm not
I'm just trying to be fair
Extifer I brought you in for a minute
My roommate Extifer
Who's co-host on the Wednesday show
Who's a little sick from camping out
All this morning
Yeah
Now you went and met
Jamie
And Chris at one point
I slept in his car
I did
I was hopped up on AMD
That's fine
At the time
No
Extifer was really cool
Because I had pretty much
Roto
I didn't feel like camping out
And I was like
You know
I like my warm bed
I'll just pick up a Wii
At the second shipment
They're gonna keep coming
I'm cool
But Extifer was like
I'll get him out
If you want one
I'm like
Okay
Here's money
Have fun
So you did it
I love spending money
When it's somebody else's
I do
I found that
Spending money
When it's not your own
Is very
It's a very nice thing
Now
Before I forget
By the way
Bandit sent me the link
Okay
I gotta start wrapping this up
So we can keep getting into game news
But
I've heard on other podcasts
I wanna say it was
It was one of the other all game shows
I wanna say it was
Alon from Chatterbox
I apologize if I'm misappropriating this
But
He had a horrible target experience
With the Xbox 360
Like
They gave out tickets
And didn't even honor him
And all this junk
So
I have to admit
You hearing these stories on the internet
About stores that had failed launches previously
Made me a little bit nervous
But
You came back
You walked through the door
And you were like
I love Target
I love Target
What made it so great
What happened
How did it go down
First of all
The store manager himself
Was outside
And letting everybody know
Exactly what's gonna happen
Before the store opened
And
Excuse me I have to burp
And
This is great right here
And so
Sorry I just took some Airborne
Man you can't blame me
No I
I went and
So basically the store manager
You know
Explained everything
And then he
Then
We
You know
Were in line
They handed out things
For us to fill out
As to which games we wanted to get
And then
They kind of
Escorted us into the
Into the store
Where we handed them the flyer
That we filled out
And then they got everything for us
And then sent us to a register
It was very very very very
Organized
Well organized
No glitches
Nobody you know upset
Everybody knew they were gonna get one
That was gonna get one
Yeah
It was wham bam
Thank you ma'am Chris
Right
It was very very convenient
Yes it was
And I even told the lady
That walked me over to the register
That I was very
I appreciated
That
What
What the hell
Um
And uh
And so that's the end
Bye
Alright well thank you
Extover for sharing that
I just got linked to the best site ever
Did you
Did you also
Your website the weeks later in the show
Did you
No this is
I might make this next weeks
Alright did
Did you find the process to be just as great
Oh yeah
Very smooth
But I laughed at the stupid woman
Oh my gosh
So
Uh
Somebody
The prissiest looking woman
There were like
Actually walks up from her SUV
Here you go
Okay
And she's all in her skirt and her high heels
Looking all prissy prissy prissy
And she walks to the end of the line
And she walks with an attitude
Like I didn't have to wait
I didn't have to wait
I didn't have to wait
And walk all the way back there
And she went back and they basically said
Oh we're the last ones to get it
And she walks back looking so pissed off
I was like
Ha ha
There were like a few people who showed up
Thinking they can just jump in the line
And the guy said I'm sorry
We don't have anymore
We're the only people
You know that was probably gonna be me
If extra had been so volunteer
But I would have been okay
I wouldn't have left away in a huff
I would have understood
You know
I would have been okay
I'm going to Kmart
Cause no one shops at Kmart
But anyway
We gotta keep moving
Cause we wanna get in the show
But we wanna give a great big round of applause
To the line at Target Greatland and Citrus Heights
And the great staff there
For making the relaunch good
Yay
And I also wanna give a round of applause
To the guy at the front of the line
At Walmart in Rancho Cordova
The grandpa
Who was there since like 3 o'clock yesterday
Waiting to get the Wii for his grandkid
Not to sell it on eBay
But he looked like the nicest guy in the world
So I wanna give him a round of applause too
Cause I liked him a lot
And I liked all the gamers we met
He didn't take your cookie though
No he didn't take the cookie
But that's okay
I understand
And I'm not gonna force people to take the cookies
Alright so anyway
Someone said fuck Paris Hilton in the chatroom
Why are they even
That was Shadow Charlie
But why are they even talking about Paris Hilton
Oh cause
Poo Eater said I bet Paris Hilton can get a free one
Well we'll talk about people that were trying to get systems
Use their celebrity to get systems
We'll talk about that later
Paris Hilton can get a lot of shit for free okay
Alright
Paris Hilton has already gotten everyone else's Wii
Fireboma says Paris Hilton
Fireboma says Paris Hilton figured out the rumble feature
Of the Wiimote easily
Anyway
Let's get into another favorite segment
We like to do here on Orange Land Australia
This is usually how we kick off the show
And we don't have launch party stories to tell
Oh I forgot to add
Oh I'm so sorry
I didn't even ask
You guys all camped in the line for the Wii
What did you get?
What games did you end up getting?
Dark Soccer
I got
Well I actually got another Wiimote
And then I got Zelda Excite Truck
And Trauma Center
Which
Those are the exact same three games I got by the way
That was Trauma Center, Excite Truck and Zelda
Loki?
I feel so bad but
I got Zelda Excite Truck
Rayman's Raving Rabbids
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz Red Steel
And Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam
I think that was it
Did you get Spongebob?
I did not get Spongebob
I will talk about it in a little bit but
Tony Hawk and Super Monkey Ball may end up used
Pretty quick at a GameStop
Ouch ouch
Not sounding like some good reviews there
I want to say this comment from chat though real quick about the Wii lines
Rama said Nintendo fans actually want to play their systems not sell them
Another very interesting observation
I have noted this observation was made on blogs where you know
Most of the people on the Playstation 3 lines were eBay profiteers
Most of the people on the Wii lines actually plan on playing them
I asked you know and I didn't expect people to be honest with me but I asked straight up
I said who is selling the Wii on eBay
And only one person kind of fessed up so that they were going to sell the Wii on eBay
Like their friend ratted them out
That was it
One guy at Best Buy
Fessed up and said yeah I bought two Playstation 3's and I sold them both on eBay for a profit
And I am using that money to buy the Wii and I am like what are you selling the Wii too?
Give me back the cookie
And he is like
He said no I actually want to play the Wii
This is very interesting
Just very interesting the different kind of attitudes people have
Pooeater in chat said he wants to play the Wii Sports
My girlfriend Migzy she has been playing the Wii Sports since she got it at the midnight launch at her GameStop
And she says it has actually gotten kind of boring
Really?
I mean it is good for like to learn how things go I guess
But it is not really a you know
I got to agree Wii Sports is pretty much a
Look it is a glorified tech demo
But I could see that as a good multiplayer game especially with like Wii Bowling
It strikes me as a good party game and a good thing to like just show somebody the Wii to get into
You know what I mean like if I wanted to take it over and show my sister who maybe does not play video games
Say hey you want to check out what I just got fire it up here you go
Pass it off to Drew Nami for a minute because I want to ask
You just played the Wii for the very first time about 30 minutes ago in our living room
And you played Wii Sports what was your impressions?
Just pick it up and go
There is nothing to it at all
It took a little bit of learning for the whole baseball thing but everything else was easy
Alright
We have been putting off long enough
We are already like more than 20 minutes into the show
Let us talk about how is your gaming week
And since there is a lot of us we want to kind of keep it a little bit brief
But I know some people like Loki got like 7 games
So Dark Sakura how is your gaming week?
Well actually I did not play the Wii yet
Because I was so tired that we went right to bed pretty much
But I have been playing Cooking Mama
Which I found a used one
I was so happy
And every time I tried to sit down to play Trauma Center I get interrupted
So I have not actually gotten started yet
I played some Mario
But mostly I was playing Cooking Mama
And I have my Elite Beat Agents today
Thank you
Alright that is it
Very cool
Have fun with it
Play lots of the Wii for next week
And pinball
Like real pinball not virtual console pinball
I had a pinball party last night so I have actually
Well of course we were not there
But I was playing some of the machines
While Sauce was here last week too
Really good chatroom comments coming in from what we were just talking about
Before we got into how is your gaming week
But I got to read these
Robway in our chatroom says
I think less people want to resell the Wii
Because the original price was low enough to justify not reselling
Plus I am not buying from the eBay scum
Megzi says
Megzi said I showed the parentals Wii Sports
They were like speechless in awe
Megzi!
Kind of interesting
Loki how was your gaming week?
My gaming week was great
Especially with the Wii on Thursday
We started off with Wii Sports
And that was actually pretty fun
The Wii Tennis was really cool
I mean everyone really had fun with it
Then tried a little bit of Wii Boxing
Which is a little weird
Because I did not really read the manual on how to play it
So could not quite get it to work correctly
But it was still fun
Wii Golf was kind of okay I guess
And then Wii Bowling did not really try that too much
And then the baseball I think is way too damn hard
At least the one I was playing against the computer is ridiculous
Excite Truck has been mainly my weekend
Been playing lots of that
That game is really fun
That is the best way to describe it
Although the music is so goddamn horrible
You really need the SD memory card
And just load your own MP3's
I tell you once you do that
It makes the game completely better
It is a really fun game
Then moving on
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz
If you played Monkey Ball before
And you were used to it
Then you probably liked this game
I thought that the original Monkey Ball was too hard
Or at least it was too frustrating for me to put more attention towards it
So I got really sick of the game really quick
And this is after level 7
And it was pretty damn hard
And I was just like fuck this
I do not want to play this
And the minigames to be honest
I did not like them
I did not like them too much
So it is not something I would play by myself
Maybe a good party game
But money is better spent elsewhere
And that money should probably go to Rayman's Raving Rabbits
Because if you are really interested in a minigame type of game
That is the one for you
Because it is just insane
I mean the games in it kind of remind me almost like Earthworm Jim
Just how off the wall weird they are
My favorite was the eating one
That you trace the food
And like one of the foods was a baseball
The guy would eat
I was like what the hell he is eating a baseball
It is excellent
So definitely you are going to need to check that out
Zelda is pretty awesome
But I mean what do you expect from a Zelda
It is just pretty neat
So Zelda yay
And then of course
Tony Hawk's Downhole Jam
I bought this thinking it is going to be like SSX
Because I love SSX
It is not SSX
It is not even close to being SSX
And I got really frustrated this right away
Because to be honest
I do not know if it was my TV
But the cables I had the detail on it
I had trouble seeing some of the tracks
And I just
I want a game that I can get into and have fun with
And Excite Truck was that
Tony Hawk was not
So I would not recommend it
I mean unless you are a really big Tony Hawk fan
I really would not recommend it
So yeah
And then of course finally
Virtual Console Games
I tried Mario 64
Which is ok with the classic controller
I wonder how well it will look with the component cables
But it looks just like it did before
And then Zelda
Seemed a bit dark to me
But I guess that was because it was from the collection disc
Or something that came out of the GameCube
Not too long ago
Now it makes sense
Because hey it is already imported right
Exactly
I wish it was brighter though
Because like all those games we saw at E3
Were very vivid and bright
And that is what I kind of liked about them
And now
I mean I think it is all about the cables though
Right now
So
That was pretty much it
Yeah of course you know the usual suspects
Call of Duty 3
On the 360
And
Gears of War a little bit
And other scrolls
Finally finished it
SSJ100Matt wants to know
What does Nellie, Loki's wife
Have to say about Loki playing all those games this week
Now here is the funny thing
About that actually
Nellie originally
If you have her as a friend on LiveJournal
You would have seen that she wrote
Some pretty negative reviews on the Wii
Saying if I really wanted to exercise
I would go to the gym
I won't play the Wii
Ironically enough though
Once she picked up Excite Truck
She has been playing it
She played it for five hours yesterday
And a couple hours today
So
And she has actually finished
All the four different cups in it
All the way up through the platinum cup
She is all finished with it
Now she is going back to get S-Rank games
On all the other tracks
I haven't even played it that much
So that is how much she is like this
And she loves the game
She says it is like
It is basically like
Women driver the game
Because it allows you to crash through trees
And just drive aimlessly
And you get points
You get rewarded
Yeah you get rewarded for driving recklessly
So she loves the game
Sail at Mervyn's
But you know what
You know what I like though
Playing on there
Is the Mii Channel
And I like creating stupid Miis
That I sent to Rob
Which is great
Oh gosh
I went into my Mii Channel
And suddenly like
Eight new Miis
All dropped in my little thing
Loki sent you this
Loki sent you this
And he sent him and Nellie
And then he sent like
Damian
Who I don't know if you turned the eyebrows on their side
Or what you did
To get those horns
I don't know what you did
And then he just
He sent me a guy with a giant afro
And called it Afro
It is from DDR
I get it
I get it
Alright
Alright
Let's talk to our guests
Oh I got to say
My gaming week
I'll make it quick
Phantasy Star Universe
Before the
You know
Mass hysteria of the Wii launch
I played a lot of Phantasy Star Universe
Online mode
Because they opened up some new areas
In online
Motube is a new planet you can go to
And some new missions are available as well
I got my butt handed to me
In Motube though
Because the missions
Even though they're level 15
They're a little bit harder
Than the ones on New Days
So
It's good though
I'm glad they're keeping it fresh
With new content
Let's hope
Sega gets it right this time
And consistently gives us the new stuff
I'll be a very happy camper if so
When it came to the Wii
I would say
Trauma Center
Is a very overlooked launch title
I didn't play the one on the DS
I just heard a lot of people rave about it
And you know
I hate those Discovery Channel shows
That are all about surgery
Because I get like
I'm a big wimp
When it comes to blood
And things like that
But I love Trauma Center
It's so fun
And it's
When I get mad at the patients
I stab them with my scalpel
And just kill them
I have a review from Meg Z
She said
The Trauma Center for the DS
Makes you want to hit yourself with a brick
It's hard
It's a really hard game
And you have to like remember
It's almost like Simon says
I don't know if like Simon says
But you have to remember like
Okay
First I got to drain it
Then I got to scalp it
Then I got to take it out with a thing
Then I got an antibiotic
And you have to remember
Like what order you have to do everything in
It's crazy
But it's fun
And DMN
You watched me play it
And I was like
Stressing out
I was like
That was hilarious
That was cool
I had a good time
But yeah
It's kind of an overlooked launch title
But I think it's kind of fun
$50?
I don't know
I'm still not loving these high prices for games
But
Whatever
It's
You know I guess I could always trade it back
Or whatever
You know
Rampage is $29.99
But it's Rampage
How many times have I played Rampage
In whatever
Incorations
I have no interest in it
I'm sorry Midway
But I'm just
You know
Get a new franchise
I will pick a Mortal Kombat though
So
I'm totally being a hypocrite
Because I'll totally get Mortal Kombat
When it comes out of the way
DMN
How was your gaming week?
Well I
Played a bunch of games at work
That I can't talk about
But
Let's see
At home
I actually busted out the Super Nintendo
Played some Tecmo Super Bowl
Wario's Woods
Actually when I got here
I played a crap load out of Rob's PSP
I played a lot of Luminous 2
Played a lot of Burnout Revenge
On his 360
And this is actually the first time
I've actually gotten to play the Wii
And play it on my own terms
Rather than
You're playing this for 8 hours
Have fun
But
I think the Wii is just a whole bunch of fun
With the system
Trauma Center is just funny
Again
The stabbing people
Excite Truck is pretty fun
I actually did not like
Raving Rabbids
I just thought it was stupid
But
Yeah
That's about it
I'm boring like that
Oh wait wait wait wait
Elite Beat Agents
Yeah
I played a lot of that
Alright
Right on
Chris
I know you don't usually play
A whole lot of games
But did you try out anything this week
That you liked?
Well
I got Cookie Mama
So that was really good
I haven't played the Wii yet
Which I got
Which is a surprise to me now
I didn't expect to get it
I did however
I got Sims 2 Pets
Because I'm addicted to Sims 2 Pets
And you can kill animals
And turn them into ghost animals
But no
It's actually really fun
All the animals
You can't actually tell the animals
What to do
But
They have their own personalities
And they just kind of run around
You can tell them not to do something
All my cats
That I have for my Sims
They don't
They are on the furniture all the time
And I can't get them to stop
But
And I also played Pokemon Ranger
That game is weird
That's like
I'm old school Pokemon fan
Like the trainer games
Those are the only ones I like
I don't have pinball or anything like that
And I thought Ranger was going to be similar to that
It's not
It's kind of weird
It's like
You have to make the Pokemon think you're a friend
So you draw a circle around it
With your stylus
Many many times
But it will get pissed off
And hurt your stylus circle
And then you have to try again
And your stylus will die
And then you have to start over
But you get a friend
You get a friend that travels with you nonstop
Which is
I have no idea what that Pokemon is
It's the plus minus Pikachu thing
Oh
Plus one minus
Yeah that thing
I have plushies of those
Yeah they
That's always with you
But you can get
Like the friends that you make
Follow you around
Until you're done with them
And you can use your Pokemon
So it's even worse than training them
You use them
You use
It's like
You get that for me
And they get the hell out
But
So that's
Wow
That's a weird game
I mean if you like Pokemon anyway
I mean I guess it's a really cool game
But I like training them
I like using them for purposes of battle
I like trying to kill my Pokemon
PETA doesn't like me I don't think
So
Okay that was my gaming week
Right on
Drewnami
Drew I really really like your shirt
It says noob
Noob
It's what's for dinner
And it has a noob
It has a noob assuming the position
Cut up like the
Cuts a meat chart
Yeah that's so funny
Drewnami
Or Drewnawee
How was your gaming week?
I actually decided to kick a little bit old school
Because I didn't get
Didn't get any of the next gen stuff
So I went back to my old
MechWarrior games
Just started playing MechWarrior 3
MechWarrior 4
MechCommander 2
That kind of stuff
Didn't do much else except
Guitar Hero
And they really ramped up the difficulty
On expert mode
Which is almost impossibly hard
When you get to the stuff like Miserloo
Ugh
Other than that not much else
Alright very cool
You know what's funny is that you know
Earlier in the show I was talking about
Our history as a music gaming network
I think you're the only
Oh no
Dark Soccer played Guitar Hero 2 last week
Cause I haven't played it yet
I've played a bunch of that too
What's your favorite spot?
Pandora is hot
Pandora is fucking hot
Pandora makes me fail songs
Alright
Well that was our gaming week
And hopefully you had a fun gaming week as well
Whether you were in the Playstation 3 camp
Or the Wii camp
Or the F the next generation camp
Or maybe 360
You're just there holding out on 360
Whatever hope you had a good gaming week as well
We gotta get into some gaming news
So real quick housekeeping
Real quick
Just wanted to say
For those that have been saying
Why do you put out part B so late in the week
Why do we have to wait so long for part B
Okay
We're gonna try a new thing
And we're gonna put out part B a little bit earlier
So look for it this week
There's another podcast out there
It's another show that's syndicated on all games like we are
Our show replays on all games on Monday
And there's a show on Thursday
I think on all games
I apologize if I mess that up
Called Game Addict Hotline
There's a spinoff show from that called Cross Platform
Where they have multiple people come together
From different podcasts and magazines and stuff
And just talk about random stuff
So the guy there, Luke
I've been chatting with for a little bit
So he had me on episode four and five
So you should check that out
So go to gameaddicthotline.com
And you can download the show
And you can hear how gamer Andy yells at me
For being excited about Blue Dragon
But look
Number three most anticipated title in Japan
Gamer Andy
That's all I have to say
No
All the Final Fantasy people
You know what a Final Fantasy whore I am
No
Gamer Andy's great
And so are all the guys there that have been on the program
So check that out
It was a good time
One other thing I want to say real fast
DMM
Do you have anything you want to share with our listeners?
I have a cookie
Oh
Oh you mean that thing
Um
Yeah I have a Wii
I'm going to give it to somebody
Um
It's going to be a random chatter
Um
If

But at some point
Um
Please uh
PM him in the chat
No no no no no no
I'll give the rules in chat a little later
Because PMs are going to be too much
Fine
Well we can do PMs
Alright

You're disqualified
Yes

Make an ass of you on the internet
And say you want a Wii
Yeah if we can call you on air
Just give us your number
We'll do that so
Orange Lounge Radio employees are not eligible
Yeah sorry
Sorry people
But yeah
Other than that
Um
You'll get a Wii
Um
When I get back
To uh
Seattle
Because
I have the Wii
Um
Just not here
So
Um
If there's any questions
I don't have a computer
So deal with it
Um
I think that's it
Back to you Rob
Uh
No there was something else
What was
What else
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
That's something else
Um
I'm not wearing any pants
Um
Kirby
Kirby yes

S-T-F-U Rob
I mean wait
Um
Coming Thursdays
To uh
Orange Lounge Radio
Uh
DJ Tyron and myself will be hosting
A show called
S-T-F-U
Um
It's only gonna be
It's gonna be like maybe
A 30
30
45 minute show
Um
It will be pre-taped
Until uh
We decide
Hey
We're gonna
You know
Feel the wrath
Of the live listeners
But um
We look forward to being
A part of the Orange
Lounge Radio family
And we are going to have
A lot of fun with it
So when's that start
Thursday after Thanksgiving
Right
Yes it will be the
First Thursday after Thanksgiving
We're shooting for an evening
Sort of time
So people can uh
You know
We're gonna have it
At three in the morning
Alright
Alright now
Is it seven o'clock
I think it's gonna be seven
Yeah I think we're gonna be at seven
Most of the other shows
Are at seven or seven thirty
So probably in that window
Somewhere so
Alright um
Just real quick
I wanna say one more time
Okay
Okay
Ask an OP
If you need to know
How to private message
Somebody in chat
Um
The folks in chat
Would request that if you
Already have a Wii
You don't enter the contest
But since there's no way
For us to verify it
Maybe you know someone
In need of a Wii
So we're not gonna stop
People that already have one
From entering
But you know
You know
You win brownie points
Use your best judgement
Yeah
So
Only PM me
When I say to
And after a certain period
Of time
One number
Yes
So it's not the first person
To PM me
It's one number
From someone who PMs me
Yes
Will be drawn at random
Yes
Okay
And by the way
If you're PMing me
Other things during the show
Cause there's a lot of people
In chat tonight
I can't look at them right now
Cause there's too much else
Going on
I'm very sorry folks
But you have to
No love letters
General chat
Or
I don't know
See if
See if Loki or DarkSakura
Can answer
Or ask
One of your friendly OP's
Alright
So
I know we haven't given
The 360 a lot of love tonight
But Loki can you change that
For us a little bit
Of course I can
I love the 360
And I'll still be playing
Plenty
Anyways
Um
So
On the 15th
You know
There's a big anniversary
The 5th year anniversary
Of Halo
And of course
To commemorate the 5th anniversary
Of Halo
They announced some more things
About Halo 3
And some stuff for Halo 2
Um
So starting things off
Halo 3 is going to be getting a multiplayer beta
In the spring of 2007
Which uh
If I remember correctly
I think that they
That news came out a while ago
At least it was rumored to be happening
So
There will be
Some sort of demo coming out
Spring of 2007
Um
No word on
What you know
That will consist of
And whether it will be free
So
I don't know
Something coming out though
Spring 2007
So that's pretty cool
Um
Halo 2 is actually
Going to be getting some
Xbox 360 exclusive maps
Um
Brand new multiplayer maps
Also coming out in the spring
Um
Exclusively for Xbox 360 players
So
You know
Sorry if you have just an Xbox
Um
Also
The first Halo 3 television ad
Will air
Um
During ESPN Monday Night Football
On December 4th
And it will be a 60 second spot
Um
So that will be very interesting
You know
Checking
Or tune into that to watch it
Or catch it on YouTube
The day after
So
Alrighty
Sorry
I haven't been having to
Argue a little bit
With some people in chat room
They're like
Look the rules are the rules
And it's DMN's Wii
And he can do whatever he wants
To give it away
Because he doesn't have to be doing it
So
That's it
Yeah it's a very massive Wii
You have there DMN
Anyway
I wanted to say real quick
On the Halo 3
So
The beta coming out in spring
Now you have said
In the previous episodes
You are convinced
That the game is coming out in
What?
March?
April?
Somewhere in that window?
Uh huh
Doesn't this kind of screw your idea?
No
They beta tested
Fantasy Star Universe
Right before it came out
What's the big deal?
I mean
It doesn't have to be beta tested
Months in advance
In fact
The only exception I've seen so far
Um
With demos and Xbox Live
Would probably be the stuff from E3
You know
Lost Planet got a demo
And Test Drive Unlimited
And stuff like that
I mean
That stuff was way early
But then again
It was also already done
For that show
So they didn't have to really
Work on it
Um
So yeah
It makes perfect sense
Why would you have a beta test
For something
And then wait like six months
To put it out
I'm still telling you
End of March
So
Whatever
Alright
You all will see
We shall
We shall see
Uh
Speaking of things
That need to be beta tested
Perhaps the PlayStation 3
Backwards compatibility
Should have been play tested
I'm sure you guys have been
hearing reports about
I think we got into it
A little bit last week
Some of the games
Don't work right
Uh
They have little bugs
I don't know if any
Are any of them
Rendered unplayable
That you've heard of
I don't think any of them
Are necessarily unplayable
I don't know about
Unplayable
But you've got graphical
Audio bugs
Quite a bit
But it's very interesting
Because there was an interview
With Sony Computer
Entertainment America exec
Jack Trettin
And he made this
Very interesting
And bizarre quote
In response to the question
Do you have a response
For people experiencing
Backwards compatibility
Issues and or television
Upscaling problems
Quote
I would like my car to fly
And make me breakfast
But that's an unrealistic
Expectation
We've reported problems
On only 200 of the
8000 PlayStation 1 and 2 games
I would challenge the average
Consumer to say
There are significant problems
With any of the games
In their library
If you look at our competitors
One machine has zero
Backwards compatibility
And one only has it
With a third of their games
Someone needs to notify him
That the Wii will actually
Play all GameCube games
But
And then also
The older games
Here's the other thing
That's kind of funny
200 games so far
Out of the 8000
Because it's only been
Released in one region
So far
You do realize
There are other games
In other regions
Of course
He might not realize that
Since he thinks that
The Wii doesn't play
Any other games
But
I know
And Fireball Man
Chatroom says
That's just giving
A big fuck you
To the gaming community
And I tend to agree
I mean that's a very
Snide thing
I want a flying car
To fix them
We'll fix them
Our bad
I want to get
A big
Pro-tip
For every single
Higher up
At every single
Video game company
You don't know
What the fuck
You're talking about
Shut the hell up
Hello
This includes mine too
I know you're listening
Perrin
Now
They are working on
Patch to fix this stuff
It's
You know
To be fair
Microsoft
Their games
Aren't
Backwards compatible
Not all of them
I mean
They have about
They have as many
Backwards compatible games
As Sony has
Games that aren't working
In backwards compatibility
I mean
It's about
About that
So
It'll be fixed
In a patch
You know
People can quit
Their bitching
Granted
There's still gonna be
Other problems
But
That's why they have
These updates
And firmware updates
And stuff like that
So
Not a huge deal
I mean
It's going to be in the library
I mean
The percentage of
Games that aren't working
Is about like
2%
That's really
Not that big
Of a deal
So
It will
Be fixed soon
I mean
At least
They could have said
At least
Hey we're
We're doing better
Than 360
Granted
Yeah
This guy
Is an idiot
I mean
They do not
Need people like
Him
You know
familiar sounding name, says, I'm a Sony fanboy and I'm pissed.
It's very rude. It's just rude. It's horrible PR.
It is a little bit. Considering they're relying on these people
to give them business, I think they'd be a little more polite considering that they're
really rude to them at launch. Interesting words.
What's also interesting, going along the consensus of the general Sony fanboy, this is par for
the course, a lot of Sony fanboys sound like pricks and a lot of the Sony higher-ups sound
like pricks. Them's fighting words.
Those are fighting words. I still, despite all this crap, I do still
consider myself a Sony fanboy. I heart my PS2 to bits and bits.
So, you want to go outside? You want to go to the parking lot?
You want to go get Todd a lesson? All right. Fight. Fight.
I might shoot him. Okay.
I get to stop. Anyway.
Speaking of shooting and rude things, somebody got shot over a PS3.
Well, not really got shot. Well, actually, in other states they got shot.
But in particular, someone in Springfield, Maryland, was held up at gunpoint for their
PS3. Chris is on the floor yelling it's a game
system. It's not the whole diamond.
It's $599 US dollars. I don't fucking care.
$600 that goes for like $2,000 on eBay. But there's people getting shot over this
and I'm like, you people are pathetic. Wait.
Let me run that Drew joke that probably didn't get picked up a mic again.
Somebody said they're getting shot and Drew pipes up for massive damage in the corner.
You smart ass. I'm just all, you know, it's, they were shooting
people, you know, for shoes, you know, a few years ago, and now it's for video game systems.
I guess the PS3 must be the must own console because that's, you know, every year you hear
about, oh, the Cabbage Patch Kids, people are stomping, the Furbies, people are kicking
each other's ass, the Tickle Me Elmo, moms are clawing each other's eyes out for them.
My mom did that. My mom almost beat someone up for my Tickle
Me Elmo. That's hot.
And now it's, you know, guys are getting slammed into telephone poles for PlayStation threes.
It's crazy. You know what?
I mean, I hope none of our listeners are ever any of these people, but if this gets back
to any of those assholes, I hope you die a slow, horrible death by having your penis
shaved off with a cheese grater with lemon juice and boric acid poured over the stump.
You know, that's probably someone's fetish. You know, while having to watch Bad Santa.
No, while having to watch Manos, the Hands of Fate.
You know, Jamie is starting to sound a little angsty. And you know what happens when Jamie
gets angsty? People die?
Well, suddenly background music starts coming in and we get into a regular segment of the
show. Oh, look, right on cue.
FUs of the Week time, Dark Sakura. A big flippin' FU to Sony. All-encompassingly.
And all of your retarded, as you may notice, I'm saying retarded fanboys, as in not that
all of your fanboys are retarded, but the retarded sector of your fanboys.
All those, I guess it's stupid men, really. But it's rather like, oh, we're going to sell
it on eBay. You people are disgusting. And I have a secondary FU that I think is going
to go in line with somebody else's in this room. FU to Art Thieves.
FU to Nintendo, Mad Catz, and any other company that are publishing a Wii component cable.
Why the fuck were those cables not in the stores yesterday or today? Whatever. Why do
I have to wait? I cannot stand composite cables. I need higher def cables. How will I live
in a high def world with standard composite cables? It's barbaric. And besides, why do
I have to wait until December? I don't want to wait.
My FU of the Week goes to Dark Sakura, Chris, and Extrofer, and the entire line at Target
Greatland for calling me at 6.30 in the morning to all yell, hi, Rob, while I'm lying in my
bed, warm and toasty asleep. And I couldn't get back to sleep because I had a toothache,
so FU to my toothache. No. If we really wanted to effect revenge on you,
we would have dumped some ice water on you, too.
I would have locked the door to my house so you couldn't do that.
If it makes you really better, I thought about pulling you at five.
So, no, I'm teasing. Of course, they know I love them to bits, but that did get a little
bit of sand in my vagina this week. DMN, your FUs of the Week.
My first FU of the Week goes to T-Mobile because I was planning on having a wondrous vacation
with money to spend, and then T-Mobile was like, we're going to take your money, and
you're going to fucking hate your weekend. But thankfully, I have friends who help me
out, but they don't get FUs. But T-Mobile does. If you ever take my fucking money without
my permission again, people will die. And then an FU to Rob for beating me at DDR
the other day. I've totally pwned you a butterfly.
We're going to... I want to play you a... Rematch, bitch, right now.
Right now. Oh, no, you didn't. Oh, yes, I did.
I will still get Laquisha. It's already been brought in.
All right. Chris, your FUs of the Week. All right, then Drew. Drew, your FUs of the
Week. You guys serve.
Okay, FU to Dimash Marketing Strategies. Why do we have just not enough game systems for
everyone who watches it the first time around? It still makes no fucking sense to me.
FU to the ramped up difficulty levels of Guitar Hero 2. What the hell? I mean, I know you're
going to make it harder, but Jesus. Miserloo on Expert? What the hell?
Also, FU to the DMV. I know everyone shares FU. Now they have to have your birth certificate
even though you've been through the whole thing before just for a new something. So
you get to stand in line not once, but twice. Isn't it lovely? Ain't it grand?
Fine. Chris, your FUs. Well, Jimmy kind of already stated my FU.
FU to Art Thieves. My art was stolen on DeviantArt. That was fun.
Why would somebody steal art? You know, well, it was kind of funny because
it made me amused that my art was good enough to steal because I've never been to art school
publicly, so I'm not that great, but it pissed me off because that means that I was unknown
enough that she thought no one would recognize it, but somebody did and they informed me
and she did it on both her accounts and she actually stole a picture I did of a gorilla's
member, Noodle, and she actually stole my description too. Word for word. It was really,
really funny. What a hooker.
I thought you meant Sony when you meant Art Thieves. My bad.
Oh, no. I draw, so. I have a smaller FU, which isn't really an
FU, but a kind of confused why don't you notice is all the people who asked me why are you
doing this online when I was handing out coffee. I'm kind of not pleased that people have just
lost faith in humanity. It's like I know you read about all these things happening, it's
like people are killing each other for a PS3, but there are nice people left and they're
all gay. I love you, Drew.
Wow. They knew me as the lesbian in line.
That's how they knew you on the show too. We love you. You're much more than a lesbian.
You're also the chick with blue hair. All right.
And I feed you sugar. I give you sugar.
Anyways, so, you know, the lesbians weren't the only people in lines this week. A pregnant
woman actually was in one of the lines in Laurel, New Jersey, and she says nine months
pregnant, or basically they were saying nine months pregnant, Julie Mosley said she tried
to ignore her detractions for the chance to score a machine for her family, her daughter's
father, and her younger brother. Okay, yeah, you're really...
You're stupid. That is pretty stupid.
Good thing no one hit her eject button or we would have been in trouble.
Why are you allowed to be pregnant? No, no, no, no, no, no. This is where I'm going off
because this is one of the things I hate. I hate when stupid people breed. When people
exist only on this earth to start out babies. Jamie, she really, really, really, really
wanted one. No. No, no, no. Seriously, what is more important,
the birth of your child or a video game system? You are a disgusting person, and I hope your
child is taken away from you by Child Protective Services.
Depends. How ugly is your child? Wow. Wow.
It depends on if she was at Walmart or not. Landmine Fairy in Chat says, WTF, is she going
to play Trauma Center while in labor? No, no, no. She will not be playing Trauma
Center. Trauma Center is not on PlayStation 3.
Oh, that's right. Oh, snap. She'll be playing one of the 15 games that
came out before and that's about it. No, she won't let me play Motorstorm until
March. She will be playing Rises of the Old Man.
She can play Marvel Ultimate Alliance and dream that Spiderman impregnated her. I don't
know. To go ahead and answer the chat room, I feel
very, very strongly about people being responsible for their children.
I really feel very strongly that if you are going to make the choice to have a child,
you need to be 100% responsible for that child's well-being from conception forward.
No video game system is worth your child's life.
All right. I love the chat room. SSJ100Matt says, Loki,
it's New Jersey after all. I've met a lot of nice people in Jersey.
I went to a very random DDR party in Jersey once. It was fun.
All right. For all you people in Jersey, that's loki
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. There you go. Send the hate mail. Fire away.
I'm just reading the chat room, okay? I didn't say it.
To one very strange incident in a line, to a line that was complimented on a very big
blogging site, Joystiq, gave kudos to Best Buy in the landmark center, Best Buy in Boston,
where there was supposedly going to be a PS3 midnight launch.
What happened is that, okay, Wednesday, people started camping out for the midnight event
the next day. What happened is that at 11 p.m. the night
before, the general manager walked over to the line and told them he didn't care whatever
system they wanted to use. So they formed this list. There was a line
and you had to check in every hour. They had roll call every half hour, whatever,
for the line. And if you weren't there, you were out.
And so what happened is that there was, I guess, 40 people in line.
And then what happened, by 3 p.m. they knew there wasn't going to be a midnight launch.
So the manager took the list that the line made and began reading off names.
They would come up, show their ID, gave their phone number, paid, and got a ticket to just
come back and get their system. And anything that was left over was automatically
raffled off. So I guess they were giving kudos to a manager
that was kind of performing under pressure and just did the best thing that was in everyone's
interest for the line and listened to the people in the line.
Good for them. So it's good to hear that not every line was
just, you know, fucking nuts. So good for you guys in Boston.
Well, actually in Bel Air, Maryland, they were saying they weren't doing the PS3 and
Wii launches. Basically doing this in conjunction with the
law enforcement and the mall that they were working with.
So I guess they were trying to be proactive to stop some of the violence that was going
on in regards to the system launches elsewhere. That's pretty good.
I know it wasn't with all the shootings and people getting thrown into the telephone poles.
It's real chaos. But if you didn't score a PlayStation 3 this
week at launch, you may be in luck. There may be some more coming in next week
for Black Friday. So if you really want to fight the chaos in
the early morning rushes for those wonderful sales, you may be in luck and find some more
systems out there for next week and stuff. I don't know, personally, I don't think that
there's a real big need for it right now. With only 15 games going to be out before
the end of the year, I mean, you probably could wait.
You're not really going to miss out on anything huge.
I mean, what's coming out next month anyways? Full Auto 2, Sonic the Hedgehog.
Yeah, and not even great stuff really for the system.
Yeah, so it's not a huge deal. But that's cool at least that they're shipping
them relatively quick. Do you think this is going to drive the eBay
prices down as the market gets more deluded? It already has actually, from what I was reading.
They're going for about $1,500 now. That's also another reason I think you're
probably not seeing a lot of Wees on eBay, because their shipments are going to be coming
in around the same time. I think we heard that we're getting our next
shipment after Thanksgiving. So, yeah, they're going to have systems out
there, and people don't really need to spend tons of money.
Rama just told the worst joke in chat, but I have to repeat it.
What's the difference between a PlayStation 3 and a Nintendo Wii?
Two gunshots to the head. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.
Hey, look, I didn't write them. I only read them.
You know, it's very interesting, the folks that were trying to get a PlayStation 3.
You guys remember John Edwards? He was the vice presidential candidate in 2004.
He ran with John Kerry, right? Well, there was a story circulating around
the Internet that what happened. Now, what's interesting to note about John
Edwards is he's kind of against Walmart and a lot of the policies that Walmart, you know,
and there's technically quite a few people who are against Walmart, so he's kind of in
that camp and it's one of his platforms or whatever.
What happened is that according to a statement that he made, his wife told him, his wife
Elizabeth said, hey, we want to get a PlayStation 3 for the young kids.
What happened is that she made the comment, and again, this is according to a statement,
in front of one of the staff people. Well, the staff people mentioned it then in
front of a volunteer, and the volunteer started to make all efforts to get one, and so who
did the volunteer call? Walmart, and tried to use John Edwards' name
to say, hey, this guy wants a PlayStation 3, you should help us out.
So of course, Walmart used the opportunity to put out their own release and say, well,
Edwards is here criticizing us and now he wants a PlayStation 3 and he's being a little
bit hypocritical, huh? So it's very interesting back and forth.
Obviously, there's the he said and they said type things, so it's really hard to know who's
right, but if Edwards is totally telling the truth here in his statement, it sounds a little
unfortunate that one of his staffers can tarnish his name like that by doing something a little
silly. One of his staffers is fired?
Yeah, one of his staffers is probably fired. Probably going to be hired by Sony relatively
soon, seeing as they hire people of that caliber.
Interesting. What's this quote from Walmart?
Oh, here's the quote from Walmart. Quote, while the rest of America's working
families are waiting patiently in line, Senator Edwards wants to cut to the front.
Ouch. Certainly not good if he's trying to run
for president in 2008, but then again, most people will forget, don't you think?
Most people will probably forget. I don't know, I don't know.
I'm just thinking, you know, it's a while ago, and I will say, we'll see.
On a small political note, he made a joke about George Bush, and everyone took it to
be a joke about him insulting the troops. They're going to play that too.
That was Kerry, not Edwards. Oh, that was Kerry?
Yeah. He did that in Seattle, and I thought it
was the funniest thing ever. He's not running anyway, because he's associated
with John Kerry. All right, this isn't Crossfire, boys and
girls. We've got to keep it moving. We're just going to have to go to a different country
or something to get us off of this tangent. Well, there's a country that I would certainly
love to visit if somebody would like to send me a plane ticket there, but in the interim,
I will just have to cover news there. Basically, the PS3 folks are, it's, stupid
freaking Sony, but there's a company that's placing ads in London train stations saying
that they will be able to sell a PlayStation 3 for Christmas.
The thing is, is that Sony's cracked down on all of the shipping.
They're saying Play Asia is not sending any Sony products to Europe.
eBay UK is not allowing any shipping to be done, but there is a company that's advertising
in these stations stating PS3, order now for Christmas, and they're given a premium, one
fifty minute phone number to call to leave details on the phone service to where they'll
be called back when the systems are available. A Sony spokesperson was saying, SCE is currently
investigating it further. We also have forwarded the details onto the trading standards and
urge all consumers to wait until the official European PS3 launch in March.
A lot of very eager European gamers willing to be led astray by some of this crazy stuff
going on just to get their hands on the PlayStation 3.
Jesus Christ, Sony, what are you trying to hide from Europe? Let them import the goddamn
systems. But I still think that this stinks of scam.
Oh no, I don't doubt that one bit. I'm just saying, in general, Sony, shut the fuck up,
and scammers, shut the fuck up. Scammers just die.
You should shut the fuck up, DMN, so we can go to another story. No, I'm kidding. You
know I love you, DMN. Anyways, sorry. So, it's kind of funny though,
I mentioned earlier we went and saw one of the PlayStation 3 kiosks at Walmart, and it's
really hardly a kiosk, it's more of kind of like a video display that they have going
there with a PlayStation 3 in there, and well, basically they found out it's not running
actually off the PlayStation 3, it's running off of a DVD player made to look like it's
actually PlayStation 3 live footage. So, oops, I guess that sucks, but that was actually
coming from GamerAndy who spotted two controllers sitting in the kiosk there, one for the TV,
one for a DVD player. Is this, I'm just asking this question hypothetically
to bring up debate, is this necessarily such a bad thing though? I mean, if that's what
Sony wants to do is run a DVD showing off the games, isn't that fine? I mean, if that's
how they want to do it? That's fine, but I still think it's funny
how it locked up and it was frozen still just like the actual kiosk. It's authentic, I'll
give them that. You're harsh, you're harsh. Alright, well,
you know, Sony may not be the only thing, only folks experiencing some broken things
here at launch. Nintendo, well, okay, it's not necessarily broken over Nintendo just
yet, although I'm sure, you know, actually just before we went live, and I think it missed
the show roll for tonight, I was reading that there are certainly some Nintendos that are
breaking down, but, you know, any launch console is going to have their issues where certain
ones don't work, so that's inevitable. But what should be interesting to note is that
some of the stuff they said was going to be available on the Wii isn't really quite ready
yet. What's interesting is that the forecast channel is not actually going to show up until
December 20th, and the news channel will not actually start until January 27th of next
year, so two of these things they were touting at E3 just for whatever reason, not ready
to go just yet. It should be noted, it's kind of interesting,
I noticed when I plugged in my Wii and booted up for the first time, the shop channel wasn't
available either. You have to do a firmware update before you can even access the shop
channel, and some folks online today were having a lot of difficulty downloading that
because, you know, obviously everybody's hammering Nintendo servers right now. All those people
that camped out overnight, of course, are playing their Wiis today, so, you know, everybody's
trying to download that at once, and thankfully I didn't have a problem. I guess we're lucky
in that Target Greatland opened earlier in some of the other stores, but, yeah, you know,
certainly interesting that they have all these updates.
Well, also, I mean, honestly, the forecast channel and the news channel, they're not
detrimental to the system's operation. It is first and foremost a gaming console. I
honestly think that the news channel's coming out a little later because it was announced
that they're partnering with CNN, and maybe the paperwork hasn't been fully worked out
yet. I have no idea about the forecast channel, but, yeah, it was interesting to see that
firmware update right out of, I don't want to say right out of the box, but when you
connected to the internet.
Mikew0440 in chat says, Rob, you didn't give the 360 any slack about breaking down. Well,
yeah, that's because it happened to me, so I was pissed, of course, and if my Wii breaks,
I'm going to be pissed, too. But, no, I'm just saying, I'm not saying it's okay, but
it's kind of one of the things, like, you know, we're kind of used to it at this point,
you know, every launch console has bugs, but, you know, in the first wave, no matter what,
this isn't PS2, go back to the last gen, it's just as bad.
Okay, has there been any breakdowns apart from, like, just with the games themselves?
I want to say I saw some screenshots on blogs, and, again, this was so new, it didn't make
our role for tonight, but I want to say I saw some things where, like, it said, you
need to eject the disk and call Wii customer support, something's broken, little things
like that, and lots of, like, discrete errors, yeah, little things like that, so.
That's not the amount that Sony is supposedly reporting, right?
Well, but I don't know, who's tracking it? We don't know, you know, no one's tracking,
and keep in mind, Sony doesn't have as many consoles out there, so I don't know, until
we see some hard figures, and are these companies going to release statistics on how many broken
machines they have? Probably not, so I don't know if this is on the same level as Three
Rings of Death or not, on 360, so who knows? Who knows?
I'm going to chat room to read more comments, if you want to join our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
Phoenix was saying something to the effect in our chat, do you really want news or weather?
No, I don't, but I would like the internet browser, yeah, I would like that, definitely.
I just think it's interesting that they touted that at their press conference, looking like
it's there in the console, like right out of the box, and then it's not really there.
I don't, you know, I'm not going to cry, I still have no one to play.
Honestly, if you want to know what the weather's going to look like, it's called looking out
the fucking window.
Open a window.
I can't open the window, the sunlight will interfere with the sensor bar.
Oh, touche.
That's why I live in Seattle, where it's cloudy and rainy all day.
At least you know what it's always going to be like there.
Well, at any rate, you know, one thing that you don't have to worry about sunlight for
is music.
And there's going to be an MP3 player out, in Europe anyway, on 8th December, that will
be 20 pounds.
It's for the Game Boy Advance and DS, that's supposed to be just like the Playon.
It has a 512 megabyte SD card that lets you load music files onto it via your PC, then
you plug in the adapter into your Game Boy SP, your Game Boy Micro, or Nintendo DS, and
you can listen to songs on the go.
Sounds like something anybody in here is interested in getting.
Well, if it is a redo of the Playon, it will also have a, the Playon had a capacity to
take a 2 gigabyte SD card, so.
I thought they already had something like that already.
That was the Playon.
No, here, it's not the Playon or whatever, it's actually not put out by Nintendo at all.
They use it mainly for, I don't know, pirating games and other things, but it's also meant
for media.
And I want to say it's already out right now with like a 4 gigabyte, like hard drive, micro
drive in there.
Well, this one's official.
All right, interesting.
I hate to go back to the last story, but I just wanted to say really quick, Miek Latov
PM'd me and he said his Wii froze up today.
He was exiting the Mii channel and it just froze.
He had to turn it off and on, so there's buggy bugs out there, so hopefully they can get
patched or something.
Mine froze up once, but it, well actually it didn't really freeze up, it just seemed
like it froze up because I was trying to access the web update for the system before they
launched the internet thing.
So yeah, I didn't like it.
Well, I tried to do the shop channel today and it just, it froze up when I was trying
to go into shop channel, but I just chalked that up to everybody's hitting this thing.
Yeah, mine kind of a little delayed today too, so.
I mean, I can let little web errors slide because those are at least fixed in an hour,
you know, just depending on the issue.
Phantasy Star Universe has had login issues for like, ever since the damn game came out,
so I don't know, a World of Warcraft, long queue times and all that fun stuff, so.
Anywho, so you know, of course you can get issues with a console like this and you know,
I know that there was a lot of things that they had promised that they'd cut out, like
you know, DVD playback and stuff like that, but not a big deal.
But actually they were aiming for even lower price point than $249, they would have liked
to have seen it at under $100 according to Miyamoto.
And his idea was basically to spend nothing on console technology so that all the money
could be spent on proving the interface and software.
And it says if they hadn't used NAND flash memory to store the data such as games and
photos and other pricey parts, they might have actually succeeded at a sub $100 console.
And it's interesting because can you imagine how fast those would fly off the shelves for
$99?
I mean, as it is, they're flying off the shelves pretty quick, but $99 is just stupid low.
Don't you remember hearing some early, early rumors back when it was still being touted
as the revolution, that the revolution was going to be $99?
I seem to remember, I mean, it could just be some stupid coincidence by something someone
made up, but it's interesting, don't you think?
I do think.
But I don't know, I think $249 is pretty good.
Definitely it's different.
A lot of people though, I think their competition is going to be saying, well, our graphics
are better.
You know, we can do HD movies, but yeah.
So what?
You know, I just, I'd rather spend $49.99 on a game and figure out that I don't like
it than to spend $59.99 on a game and figure out I don't like it, but it's prettier.
I mean, that's really what it comes down to for me, so whatever.
All right, moving on, away from the Wii and the PlayStation 3 and even the Xbox 360, you
know, some people just aren't ready to jump ship yet.
I mean, some people are not ready for the next generation of gaming, and you know what?
Hey, you know, Drew's waving his hand over there.
What's stopping you from going to the next gen of gaming, Drew?
Is it just the cost, or what's the deal?
Right now it's the cost, and I'm just waiting for the big, big titles to start rolling in.
Like Final Fantasy 13, or Kingdom Hearts 3, or Devil May Cry 4, or on the Nintendo side
Super Smash Bros. Brawl, or Metroid Prime 3 Corruption.
I'm just waiting for the big name titles.
Well, what current gen systems do you have?
Do you have a Dreamcast?
I have a PS2.
I want a Dreamcast.
Well, you probably still get one cheap, and good news for you Dreamcast owners, there
is another Dreamcast game coming out.
Play Asia is taking pre-orders for a new Dreamcast release that will be coming out in December
October.
It's a side-scrolling space shooter.
It's called Last Hope, and it's going to be $40 and region-free.
It should be noted, though, the product is not officially licensed, designed, manufactured,
distributed, or endorsed by Sega.
One thing that should be mentioned is that it's primarily being advertised as a Neo Geo
AES and NBS cartridge, also available for Neo Geo CD.
Oh, interesting.
I didn't even catch that.
I went to the website.
Ah, very cool.
I just want to give the website real quick, if anyone's interested, www.lasthope.ngdevteam.com.
The one thing about it, though, is that it will be as prohibitively expensive as other
Neo Geo carts, so yeah, it's going to be retailing roughly about $300 for the Neo Geo, unless
you get CD or Dreamcast.
Jeremy Todd 1 in chat says, this story reminds me of that Sega Genesis game, Baker Prince,
that OLR reported on a few months ago.
Yeah, that's true.
Remember the Genesis game?
Yeah, very cool.
All right, well, we're going to move on, and I was thinking we were going to do the drawing
very soon, but now there was just a net split, so we have to wait for that situation to clear
itself out before we can do the giveaway, so I'll have to wait a little bit on that,
but definitely make your way on over to chat.orangelaungeradio.com when the situation resolves a little later
on in the evening.
We'll be doing that Wii giveaway, but for now, we've got to do one of our favorite segments
here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that is Dark Sakura's very own website of the week.
She surfs the internet up and down and back and forth and left and right, and finds a
website that she deems worthy of your attention.
Dark Sakura, what should the kids be looking at this week?
My website of the week is a site dedicated to freedom of speech and expression.
It's smashmyps3.com.
Yes, from the same people that brought us Smash My Xbox 360 and Smash My iPod, we have
Smash My PS3.
And there is a lovely bit of artistic video available on their site of a well-dressed
young fellow in a 70s pimp garb going into a Best Buy, purchasing a couple of PlayStation
3s, taking one out in front of the line of fanboys waiting and waiting and waiting for
their very own PlayStation 3.
Next, his associate pulls out a device called a sledgehammer and proceeds to practice several
different laws of physics by basically having this item collide with great force into said
PlayStation 3, also showing how force affects inertia as pieces of it go flying everywhere.
Translated, that means they smash that thing to the ground.
It was glorious and beautiful, and I cried tears of joy.
At abstract translation, a method of demonstrating one's freedom to be an asshole.
Now I hear they donated the excess money to charity, so maybe they did take the second
one and sell it.
Now that their conscience cleared a little bit, out of curiosity, will you be visiting
SmashMyWe.com?
The sequel?
No, that will make me cry.
No, actually, I just think that it's sort of funny, because there's people who are so
freaking emotionally riled up over a piece of plastic and silicone.
Yeah, I actually, there's a, you can't get laid, Jiranami, there's actually, there was
a difference between the people who got the PS3 and the people who got the Wii.
The Wii was like, hey, I want the Wii, it's supposed to be a fun system, it's really cool,
and I'm looking forward to it.
There were people who were disappointed, but they knew there would be more.
Yeah, and people who got the PS3, we need to have this system!
Let's pray.
Say it in commands that I give my soul to Sony.
Yeah, it's like, there's a difference in intensity, so I don't think it's like watching someone
smash a Wii is kind of like, okay, your point?
Wait, does that mean that Ken Kutaragi is like Little Nicky?
I haven't seen that.
No, I love Little Nicky!
Ken Kutaragi eats crayons.
Ken Kutaragi doesn't eat Popeyes, he eats crayons.
He's like the Pooh of Cthulhu.
He's not cool enough to be anything really associated with the Elder God except for his
fecal matter.
Wow, that's interesting.
Alright, what we're going to do now is we're going to go into a little bit of a taped clip
here, and it's going to be the end of our segment here, part A. Again, we're having
to hold off on the contest a little bit here.
We'll fill you in after this taped segment, what we're going to do, we're hoping the rest
of chat comes back in.
Rob broke the internet.
I didn't break it.
I have a backup plan just in case.
I'll run it by DMN, but we're going to go to this taped bit.
Dark Soccer and Chris, of course, were waiting at the line to target Greatland, and they
thought, boy, wouldn't it be fun to just harass the other people in line?
So they called into our voicemail and left a series of voicemails interviewing different
people.
So you want to set this piece up for us, Chris, our roving reporter?
Well, in the car we were thinking, hey vehicle, I did interview people to see why they're
out in line.
So I was like, Jamie was keeping our place on the line, and I was going to go play reporter.
And I was so nervous because I don't do that stuff very often.
I don't like talking to new people.
I'm pretty shy.
I am pretty shy around new people.
So I walked up and I was representing Orange Land.
So I'm like, hi, do you mind if I interview you for orangelandradio.com?
It's a video game.
You know, I went through the whole thing, and most of them went, uh, sure.
So I'm attempting to sound professional, but I'm just failing.
So I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you have to listen to those.
No, it's cool.
So yeah, DMN?
So long story short, if any of you at Target are listening, yay, you made it on the internet.
Good job.
Oh, yeah.
Let's go to the tape, boys and girls.
This is DarkSakura calling in Orange Land Radio message line from the line outside Target
in Citrus Heights, California.
Say hi, everybody.
So we're going to be doing a series of interviews to put on the message line throughout the
night.
So, well, done by our house lesbian.
Hi.
Hi.
And, uh, stay tuned to listen.
Okay, bye-bye.
Hello, radio viewers, and this is your token lesbian for Orange Land Radio.
I am Chris, also known as DisneyPunk, and I am here at the line in front of the Target
Garden Center, actually.
We're under the sign that says Garden Center, and there's probably looks to be about 30
people online.
I'm going to start at the end, because the end rules.
Huh.
It's girls and acts.
The girls.
I'm right in front of a guy and a girl, one's playing a Game Boy, and they've got black
hats on.
One's got an Alcatraz office on.
That's great.
So we're going to ask a couple of questions.
First of all, can you state your name?
Jamie.
Jamie?
Our co-star, Focker, actually, is named Jamie, too.
No, I'm kidding.
Can I have your name?
Aaron.
Aaron.
Can I ask you guys really quick, what do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at,
what is it, two, two o'clock in the morning?
Well, it's my birthday today.
Thanks.
I think the Wii will be fun, innovative, new control style.
I've never really been able to play video games except the light gun ones, because the
codes don't make any sense to me, so the Wii will be good.
Have you guys gotten a PlayStation 3 at all?
No.
Definitely not.
Definitely not.
Why not?
I'm not as interested, really, right now.
Don't have a thousand bucks laying around.
Fair enough.
And can I ask you guys a random question?
What's your favorite color?
Blue.
Green?
Okay, those were both wrong answers and you failed.
I'm kidding.
Orange.
Orange, okay.
Can I ask you, sir, what's your name?
Nathan.
Nathan?
Okay, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at two o'clock in the morning?
Well, I'm a little bit older than everyone else out here, so I'm an old Nintendo fan,
I grew up on it.
All right, old school fan.
Did you get a PlayStation 3 or any interest at all?
No, absolutely not.
Okay.
And here's your obligatory question.
That's a good one.
I can't really think of an obligatory question.
What's your favorite color?
Red.
Red?
Okay.
That was the right answer.
You win.
All right, well, I hope you guys all get your Wii.
There should be like, what, 30, 35 systems supposed to be out here and there isn't a big line,
so good luck.
Good evening, radio fans.
And this is Kristin again with your Wii.
I guess it would be our cast of our Wii.
I don't know what you call it.
But I'm here interviewing people who are online at the Target Center.
And I'm here with, can you state your name?
Sarah.
Sarah.
I was here earlier and you are actually one of the only girls in line,
and now I look at the front and there's a bunch of girls.
But she's probably got the most awesome hat here.
It's a white hat, like, baseball cap with a Wii.
It almost rivals the girl with the Alcatraz hat on, and that's awesome.
So can I ask you, she's actually great.
What's your shirt?
Donkey Kong.
That's like old school Donkey Kong shirt.
That's awesome.
So can I ask you, what do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
Like, why are you up here at like 2 o'clock a.m.?
Actually, how long have you been here?
I've been here since about 9 o'clock p.m.
Not too terribly long, yeah.
That's not bad.
Why do you think the Wii is waiting for just early in the morning?
Twilight Princess, first of all.
Second of all, it's the most innovative system that's come along in quite a while,
and I think it's certainly worth the wait.
Yep.
Did you get a PS3?
Oh, hell no.
Do you see a difference, or is it just the price?
I would not pay $600 to test out an unproven format of disc, no.
They're getting too big for their shorts.
Oh, you are loved by many Orange Los Angeles nerds.
Are they all bashed on you all the time?
And your obligatory question, what is your favorite color?
Blue.
You fail and lose.
I'm sorry.
I meant to say orange.
I meant to say orange.
Okay, you survived.
All right, well, thank you so much for interviewing with me, and good luck on getting your Wii,
but I don't think it will be that bad.
There's not that many people in line.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Can I just interrupt this real quick to say, what is your name?
What is your quest?
You.
Cake or death.
Cake, please.
Very well.
I was actually going to do, everybody got a random question.
I was going to go, it's like a what is, you know, it's like all these really stupid questions,
but I was so nervous.
I was so nervous asking people I've never met if I could interview them,
and I just kept, what's your favorite color?
It's all right.
It's an internet radio show.
You don't have to be a superstar, but you're still a superstar, sweetie.
You still are.
You're Saint Chris, remember?
She still spawned a Monty Python quote off.
No, my favorite, though, is how she's asking all the people in the Wii line
if they're going to get a PlayStation 3.
I wanted to, they both, I was trying to help your radio.
It's fun.
No, it's funny.
I like it, because I like hearing people's reactions to it.
No.
Hell no.
But I think there's one that might be a little different that's coming later,
but I just had to interrupt to say that, because that was funny.
So back to the tape.
Hello, radio listeners, and I am here with yet another person, people,
in line for the Wii.
Can you guys speak your name?
Stella.
John.
How long have you, actually, how long have you guys been here?
Since, like, nine.
About, like, eight.
Okay.
What's your name?
Kyle.
Kyle?
How long have you been here?
Just kind of.
What do you guys think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
What?
Why are you waiting for the Wii at 2 o'clock in the morning?
What's so special about it?
Because it's so kick-ass, and there's Zelda.
I'm just picking it up for a friend.
Wow.
Damn, he must owe you, or you owe him.
Do you owe him money?
Okay.
I'm just here for kicks.
You're just hanging out in the cold.
All right.
David, do you guys have a PlayStation 3 or want to get a PlayStation 3 here?
No.
Not unless you drop the prize.
Okay.
He's just here for kicks.
All right.
And your obligatory question, what's your favorite color?
Green.
Plaid.
Yellow.
Yellow?
Okay.
You win.
Plaid wins.
All right.
Well, thank you, guys.
If you want to listen to it, it's OrangeLunchRadio.com, and we'll be streaming live at 7 o'clock
tonight, or we're on podcast.
You can download it on iTunes.
Thank you so much for talking with us, and there should be enough systems, so it should be fun.
Yay, Wii.
Okay, I'm not going to keep saying this, but this is the next one.
This is Jamie, so you guys can just deal with it.
But we're interviewing people at the Wii.
So, Jamie, stop talking to people.
What?
Okay.
State your name, please.
DarkSlashTheGreatAndMighty.
That was pretty pathetic.
Write my act.
Literally?
Yeah.
In public.
Okay.
And you get to be asked these questions, too.
First of all, why do you think the Wii is worth waiting for at 2 o'clock in the morning?
I was bored.
Okay.
Yeah, you're not bad at it.
All right.
Are you getting a PS3?
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
We're getting the PS3 because my husband's a traitor and preordered one, but right before
he clicked GameStop.
You guys actually get it?
No, we're getting a second shipment.
I don't care, because Sony sucks my butt.
Here from her.
Sony sucks.
Your obligatory question.
Can you peel potatoes correctly?
You know, I couldn't peel potatoes worth a shit before, and then I played Cooking Mama,
and now I am the best potato peeler in the universe.
Nintendo, please give her money.
Better living than Nintendo, I'm now the aluminum chef.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Jory.
Thank you for interviewing with me, Jamie.
I go on to the next step.
Your token lesbian is back, and we're interviewing more people for the Wii line at Target.
And I'm actually with a bunch of guys that are, or one of them at least, who's apparently
a fan of Orange Lounge Radio, which I'll go over there and interview him in a second.
I want to get closer to him.
They're playing Risk right now, which I find actually really amusing.
I've lost five of them.
Yeah, a lot of them.
I just think that that's like old school.
Yeah.
All right, all right.
Okay, I'll interview the first three guys right here.
What's your name?
Jory.
Jory.
What's your name?
ratio.
Jory started laughing.
Jordan.
Okay, Jordan.
All right, can I ask you guys, why are you guys out here at two in the morning?
We want the Wii.
We want the Wii.
We want the Wii.
Why do you want the Wii so badly?
Twilight Princess.
Twilight Princess.
And you?
Twilight Princess.
Twilight Princess.
That's right.
Cora!
Can I get your name?
Kristen.
Travis?
Travis.
Why are you out here?
Did you get a Wii for his brother?
He owe him money?
No, I'm just a good friend, and that's broke.
I'm going to ask you guys to get a PS3, or planning on getting a PS3?
Maybe $100 just for Metal Gear Solid 4.
That's the only game I will be getting today.
Now.
Now.
I'll borrow his metal gear.
Yeah, I'll borrow mine.
No.
No PS3.
No.
Yeah.
Final fantasy is 13.
To be 18 to mark.
Alright.
And here's your biggest question.
What's your favorite color?
Blue.
No.
Brown.
You fail.
You fail.
Green.
Okay, that's correct.
Blue.
No, you don't.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Fail.
Black.
Ah, that's.
Baby blue.
No.
Oh, I like you.
Alright.
Alright, I will be interviewing now an actual Orange Lounge fan who is a dark soccer fanboy
apparently.
So, I'll be there in a second.
Hello, radio listeners.
I am your token lesbian, Chris, and I'm here with an Orange Lounge fan who actually recognized
Jamie and Rob, who was out here earlier with cookies.
So, can I get your name and your username so people can recognize you?
Anthony, AC Ender, but I'm never in the chat with you.
You're not in the chat at all?
Okay, but you are a listener?
Archive listener.
Awesome.
Okay, can I ask you why you're out here at 2 a.m. for a week?
Oh, wait.
The we?
I thought it was in the PHP line.
No, I'm getting a we.
Okay, why are you getting a we?
Spongebob.
Wait, wait.
I also hear Zelda's pretty good.
Zelda's.
Okay.
Well, we'll buy that.
Alright.
Are you thinking about getting a PS3 at all?
I'll probably buy a PS3.
My friends get it all the way but I'm not gonna buy it myself.
Okay.
I see.
What's your favorite color?
Brown.
Brown, yeah.
No, hold on.
I put white.
Loki is displeased with you.
Loki is displeased with you.
He's a Microsoft fan.
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.
Loki is displeased with you.
Oh, he's a Microsoft fan.
Yeah, he's a Microsoft fan.
I like Microsoft.
Actually, can I ask you, what do you think of the show?
It's amazing.
What's your favorite part?
I like Epus of the Week.
Jamie has just informed us that he came up with that.
It's funny because I always talk about the roads
of Sacramento.
I'm from Sacramento, so I can relate.
So it's pretty cool.
Awesome.
Is there anything you can, any advice you'd want to give Rob,
Jamie, and Loki?
Yeah, I'd love to go snowboarding.
Yeah, I'd go snowboarding more often.
More snowboarding inside the gaming news.
I see.
Can I give you a hint of another thing to mention to them?
To any of you guys, I would mention more lesbians
on the show.
Oh, yeah, I'd love to do it now.
Aw.
All right, we have to move on.
I've got another group of people to answer that.
More lesbians.
Aw, that didn't work.
OK.
All right, I'll move on to the next group.
Thank you, guys.
Hello, Orange Land listeners.
I am at the front of the line.
Somebody just yelled something.
That was interesting.
Anyway, I am at the front of the line
with some people playing monoculars.
And I actually haven't gotten an OK to interview all of them,
but let's start.
Can I interview her?
OK.
Can I get your name?
I'm Nick.
Nick, I got some logo t-shirts.
Rod.
Barnsworth.
Hey, Eric.
Katie.
Katie.
I like to go by Eepus.
Eepus?
Gotcha.
Can I ask you guys why it's so important for you
to be at the front of the line waiting for a Wii?
We just needed a cool place to play Monopoly.
Oh.
No, seriously.
What's the Wii worth waiting for?
Just to hang out with your friends and have a good time.
I mean, that's all we're really doing.
We had nothing else better to do.
Just hanging out with friends, playing games,
and we really want the Wii, I guess.
Why do you really want the Wii?
Because we ain't got nothing else better to do next weekend.
Nothing better to do next weekend.
That works.
I want to fit in.
I want to be in the in crowd.
You're not cool unless you have a Wii.
Exactly.
OK.
That's going to be so much fun out of you, Barrett.
Do you want to come back?
Yeah.
OK.
I heard it actually increases sexual performance.
Yeah.
With the wrist movements.
No, with the wrist movements.
The good thing about that is I can switch lovers each night.
I think that's the most interesting answer
I've gotten yet.
I'm just interested about the Nintendo's way
of innovating the game system.
And that's the most intelligent one at the table.
OK.
All right.
Can I ask you guys, is he getting a PS3 at all?
Or what do you think about it?
If I can steal one, but I'm not going to pay $600 on it.
The one that goes down in price.
Hang on, I'm moving.
You mean the piece of shit three that already have glitches?
Yeah, pretty much.
Oh, whoa.
That's what you better bring in.
Yeah, I'll be getting one.
Why am I going to pay $600 for a system that's
going to glitch, and $600 for something
that I'm going to get to play one to two hours every once
in a while?
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, that's like getting a hooker downtown
than playing a PlayStation 3 successfully.
OK, I like this table.
These people are interesting.
OK, you guys get an obligatory question.
What's your favorite color?
Clear.
Fail.
Blonde.
I'll accept that.
Corn yellow.
Interesting, I accept.
Damn it, you stole mine.
Fail.
I'll pick.
I like pink, OK.
Light purple.
OK, I'll accept that.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, that is the last section.
Well, thank you guys for being with me.
Good luck.
All right, that was our last one.
They are at the front of the line.
And I'll call one more time to tell you
how I feel about all this, if anyone really gives a shit.
So, all right, thanks.
Hello, Orange Toys R' Us, and this is the last one.
I'll be making these, because I bet you're just sick of them,
and sick of me.
But you get one more little tidbit,
and that is from Moi, your tokenar lesbian at the show.
I'm actually out here because a bunch of people
are waiting out in line.
And they look cold, and they do not
look happy to be sitting out here in front of Target.
So Jamie and I actually offered to get them a coffee
and donuts, and that's pretty much why I'm out here,
is because I'm going to go get some coffee and donuts.
That's the only reason.
And apparently I'm getting a Wii, too, so whatever.
I actually never played Zelda before.
I never got to, because my daddy did not let me.
I was a deprived child.
So anyway, this is Chris, a.k.a.
Disney Punk.
And this is in front of Target, reporting for the Wii line.
And just to let you know, there's
a Best Buy right across the way.
And that line's like 10 times the longer.
And that amuses me.
But this line's cooler, because they're getting coffee
and donuts soon.
All right, have fun out there in the ethernet.
All right, thank you, Chris.
I know some of the folks in the chat room were like,
oh, this is long.
This is long.
You guys are talking to too damn many people.
I am so sorry.
Don't be sorry, because you know what?
Usagi hit the air.
Usagi, I say Usagi.
Usagi, I'm sorry if I'm butchering your name to help.
But no, she's right on here, because the quote here
is, see, these interviews are what the gaming world is all
about, the best people on Earth.
And that's exactly it.
That's what made last night so fun,
was just meeting other nerds.
It was really amazing.
They were so nice.
And they just kind of took to my stupidity really well.
And it was really important to interview.
There weren't that many people in line, considering.
And it's like, well, there's not that many people.
We need to interview all of them and just get all of them on.
And Rob can edit it later.
But it was just really fun meeting all of them.
They all said thanks.
And they all asked, so when is it going to be played?
It was like, I think some of them are in here now.
I saw Ace Ender earlier.
Oh, he's back.
So that must have been that whole net split thing came back.
And some of those other people said, do you got some votes?
Oh, hi.
I have to say, too, the group that
let us hang out with you guys, you guys were fantastic.
You guys were infinitely awesome.
Thank you so much.
Sources of amusement and kept me from passing out.
The entire night, the people just
that were right next to us and right behind us,
they just were so nice.
Somebody kept walking up and down, just talking to us.
Everybody was so nice.
It was like one big block party.
It was really cold.
It was like a gaming convention in front of every store in town.
Yeah, it was so fun.
I was hearing the single best commentary
coming from that game of Risk.
That was the best.
Yeah, every now and then you'd hear that collective, oh!
And every so often, I would ask, who took over the world yet?
I can't wait for Risk to hit Xbox Live someday.
Oh, man.
I just took Australia, motherfucker.
The BTF, mate.
All right.
Now, of course, the chat room is asking.
We're running a little long this segment,
but the chat room is asking, when do we get to win the damn
Wii?
All right.
Shut up.
This just in.
We're changing it up on you.
Having the net split earlier in the show
made us realize that maybe the chat room isn't
the best process.
So we are going to change it just a little bit.
We can do that because, you know what?
It's DMN's Wii, and he's giving it away out
of the goodness of his heart.
This was not something that was given to him.
This was not something that he bought this with his own money,
and he's going to be giving it to one of our listeners, right?
Yes.
Or he's giving it to us to give to one of our listeners,
something like that.
So we can do whatever rules we want.
So here's the new rules.
It's easy, and it's still fair.
There's the AP and it's wins.
Go.
No, no, no.
No, I'm just kidding.
So here it is.
Now, instead of sending me a private message in chat,
here's what you're going to do.
Remember, this only applies to folks listening live
Sunday night.
This won't work if you're listening to the rebroadcast
on all games.
This won't work if you're listening to us in iTunes
or whatever program you use to download our audio archive
later on.
OK, here it is.
If you're listening Sunday night and you
want to enter our Wii contest, here it is.
Send an email, one email.
If you send multiple emails, you will be disqualified.
If you send from multiple addresses, we know your IP.
You will be disqualified, and you don't have much time
to pull any tricks.
So here it is.
Send one email to wiicontest, W-I-I-C-O-N-T-E-S-T,
at orangeloungeradio.com with your screen name and a phone
number we can reach you at if you don't mind us calling you
on air, or a Skype name will do as well.
And during the break, we'll be getting those emails in,
and we'll be drawing a very random one
when we kick off part B. All right?
Yeah, so for those of you on the podcast,
you're going to have to wait a day.
All right.
Sucks for you.
All right, so we will be back soon
to determine the winner of the Wii contest.
And for those of you who got, yep, you do it now.
Right now, we're going to have like five minutes
to get it in there.
Go, hurry.
What the hell are you doing listening to us?
Open up your email and freaking email us.
All right, nope, subject does not
have to be any particular something.
We just opened up the email address for that.
Send one email.
But the more you suck up to me.
With your screen name and your number,
we're going to give away the Wii right at the top of part B.
So that's it.
Oh, yes, Chris?
If you send a naked picture with it,
you know, extra bonus points.
Of me.
Stop, stop.
All right.
Boobs only, please.
All right, we'll be back in a little bit
to find out the winner.
Those of you listening to us on the audio archive,
we'll be back in about a day.
And you can hear the exciting conclusion.
Those of you guys on All Games Radio
are listening on Sunday night.
Stick around.
We'll be right back.
Bye.
