00:00.000 --> 00:24.160
All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 209 for this November

00:24.160 --> 00:26.160
the 19th of 2006.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.360
Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend,

00:31.360 --> 00:36.760
or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out or a current gen user who's not upgrading

00:36.760 --> 00:40.480
to next gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this

00:40.480 --> 00:41.960
program.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.960
We here at Orange Lounge Radio are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving

00:45.960 --> 00:50.600
away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off part B.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.340
If you want to know the details, you have to listen to part A. Remember Orange Lounge

00:54.340 --> 00:57.560
Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.880
There's part A, which comes out on Monday, and part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday

01:01.880 --> 01:04.360
instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.960
Our chat room is eagerly standing by.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.980
This is something special we did for our live listeners only.

01:08.980 --> 01:12.780
We only advertise this on our live journal and our MySpace communities, so if you want

01:12.780 --> 01:16.920
to find out about future contests before anyone else does, you might want to sign up.

01:16.920 --> 01:21.000
Live journal, our user name is Orange Lounge, and on MySpace we're MySpace.com slash Orange

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Lounge Radio.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.040
All right, we should stop stalling, huh, DMN?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.040
Yeah.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.040
God.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.080
DMN, AKA John, is just doing this out of the goodness of his heart, so there's no other

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
reason for it.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.400
All right, let's stop, let's stop stalling.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.400
Let's get to the winner.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
All right, here we go.

01:35.400 --> 01:39.600
I'm now going to pull up random.org, so John, you're going to be picking, I'm pulling 10

01:39.600 --> 01:44.160
random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away, and he is going to tell me which

01:44.160 --> 01:47.320
one of the 10 numbers I'm picking right now.

01:47.320 --> 01:48.320
Rob?

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
Yes.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.840
Whatever email is number six on that list.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.080
One, two, three, four, five, six, oh, this is great.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.440
All right, guess what number six is?

01:57.440 --> 02:00.280
It was email number 37.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.280
In a row?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.280
In a row?

02:02.280 --> 02:03.280
Yeah, I know how it's coming.

02:03.280 --> 02:04.880
All right, let's count them out, and I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
or any of that stuff.

02:05.880 --> 02:12.840
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen,

02:12.840 --> 02:17.400
eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty, thirty-two,

02:17.400 --> 02:21.080
thirty-four, thirty-six, here it is, thirty-seven.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.760
Oh, look who won it.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
Let's give them...

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
Oh, they're going to be...

02:26.760 --> 02:27.760
Oh, I'm...

02:27.760 --> 02:28.760
You know what?

02:28.760 --> 02:31.480
This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.060
This person is going to be very excited.

02:34.060 --> 02:35.960
Let's give them a call right now.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.600
All right, let's give them a call right now.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.640
It's connecting.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.080
Yeah, it's ringing right now, boys and girls.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.080
Let's hope it works.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
Here it goes.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.080
It's ringing.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.080
It's ringing.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.080
Hello?

02:52.080 --> 02:53.080
Hi.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.080
Did somebody order a pizza?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.080
Hi.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.080
We're kidding.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.080
Is this Raven's Dolphin?

02:58.080 --> 03:00.200
Just kidding.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.440
This is Orange Lounge Radio calling.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.440
You just won a Wii.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.440
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
No, you won the Wii, my friend.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
We're kidding.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.440
No, no, no.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.440
You just won it.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
Oh, my God.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
I won a Wii.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
Yep.

03:11.440 --> 03:12.440
You won the Wii, my friend.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
Oh, my God.

03:13.440 --> 03:22.920
Dude, I've got to say, I'm jazzed for you, calling to this show all the time.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.640
And for once, we're Skyping you.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.960
And for once, we're calling you to tell you that you won a Wii.

03:27.960 --> 03:28.960
You did it.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.840
You were emailed number 37 in the inbox.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.560
Oh, my God.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.560
So you did it.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.560
I'm literally speechless.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.560
I know.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.540
I'd go crazy, too, if I were you.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.120
So congratulations.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.000
So what are you going to do with your Wii?

03:43.000 --> 03:44.720
Do you already own a Wii?

03:44.720 --> 03:45.720
No.

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
No.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
Sort of.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
What?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
Sort of?

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
What does that mean?

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
All right.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
I do.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
But I have plans for this.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.720
Oh.

03:54.720 --> 03:55.720
What's the plans for this?

03:55.720 --> 03:56.720
All right.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.920
I was going to do something similar to DMN, but I won a Wii.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.920
I'm happy about that.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.920
The question is, I'm not going to go on an eBay.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.920
Good.

04:05.920 --> 04:11.280
Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.280
That's very generous.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
That's very cool.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.280
That's very cool.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.560
So someone's going to get it.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
That's awesome.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.160
Well, congratulations, Ravenstaufen.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.180
We need to get in touch with DMN.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.880
You know my personal email on the site, right?

04:24.880 --> 04:28.600
Just send me an email and we'll get your shipping address and get it taken care of, all right?

04:28.600 --> 04:30.320
Oh, one more thing, Rob.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.320
Yes.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
Long time you on the line.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Yes.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.320
Rayman's Raven Rabbits.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.320
Yes.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.320
Give me one.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.320
What about it?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.320
Rayman's Raven Rabbits.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.320
What about it?

04:39.320 --> 04:48.160
All right, there's this DDR team that you drum this deck with it and you beat the little

04:48.160 --> 04:53.520
rabbits to death, and it reminds me so much of you, and I enjoy it because they play girls

04:53.520 --> 04:57.320
that want to have fun, and it's such an enjoyable.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.320
Gee, thanks.

04:58.320 --> 04:59.320
All right.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.640
I haven't played that mini game yet.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.640
I'm sorry.

05:02.640 --> 05:03.640
Yes, you did.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.640
That one?

05:04.640 --> 05:05.640
Would girls just want to have fun?

05:05.640 --> 05:06.640
No.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
When we played the one with the...

05:07.640 --> 05:08.640
It was Misery Loo that played.

05:08.640 --> 05:09.640
Yes.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.640
But we played that one.

05:10.640 --> 05:11.640
All right.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.640
Raven's off.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.960
We've got to get back into the show, but thanks so much for entering and supporting Orange

05:14.960 --> 05:17.160
Launch Radio, and now we're giving something back to you.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.160
Oh, my gosh.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
All right.

05:19.160 --> 05:20.160
I can't believe I won.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
All right.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.160
Have a good one.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.160
Have a good one.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.160
See you back.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.160
All right.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.480
And of course, everybody in our chat was very bitter over the fact that he may or may not

05:28.480 --> 05:30.680
already own a Wii, but you know what?

05:30.680 --> 05:32.220
Hey, it's fair and square.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.220
We said it in front.

05:33.220 --> 05:36.340
Whoever wants to enter the contest can, and it sounds like he's got really good plans

05:36.340 --> 05:41.280
for the Wii that he's going to give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas

05:41.280 --> 05:42.280
time.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
So you know what?

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
I can't argue with that.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
That's going to be great.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.280
You guys stop being Scrooges.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
That's right.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
You guys are just Scrooge.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.280
You're bitter.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.520
You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.

05:51.520 --> 05:55.060
So just, you know, maybe next time.

05:55.060 --> 05:58.640
We got other stuff to give away and I've come to see your bundle of flip.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.640
Oh, you know what?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.440
Oh, I was going to tell people about this.

06:01.440 --> 06:07.480
If you've been reading the forms, it's going to be ongoing, you know, whenever it happens,

06:07.480 --> 06:10.080
but we're going to have a new contest called early release.

06:10.080 --> 06:15.880
Get your mind out of the gutter where we get games a little early where I work.

06:15.880 --> 06:22.880
So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now announcing games and we'll probably

06:22.880 --> 06:25.300
do the same thing as we did here.

06:25.300 --> 06:29.960
Like if a game comes out, like, you know, I think we may start it either next month,

06:29.960 --> 06:34.040
either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare because a lot of people

06:34.040 --> 06:35.240
love that.

06:35.240 --> 06:38.880
We're going to give away the game before it comes out so you can rub it in people's faces.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.640
I played it before it came out.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.640
Bitches.

06:41.640 --> 06:42.640
All right.

06:42.640 --> 06:43.640
We'll look forward to that.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.920
So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance

06:46.920 --> 06:47.920
later on.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.200
And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going

06:50.200 --> 06:52.120
to have some cool stuff for you guys too.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.640
We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really

06:54.640 --> 06:56.960
catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.680
So anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.760
Let's go back to the show, shall we?

07:05.760 --> 07:08.200
And talk about some more gaming news.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.200
All right, let's.

07:11.200 --> 07:17.240
So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving, and we all know it comes after Thanksgiving

07:17.240 --> 07:22.040
other than, you know, falling asleep from overeating Black Friday.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.680
And of course, you know, with Black Friday there's always going to be, you know, great

07:25.680 --> 07:28.000
deals on games and stuff.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.100
And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.400
They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.

07:35.400 --> 07:43.520
For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Table

07:43.520 --> 07:49.480
Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store

07:49.480 --> 07:50.740
before noon.

07:50.740 --> 07:55.360
And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.

07:55.360 --> 08:00.920
Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4,

08:00.920 --> 08:04.600
and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.

08:04.600 --> 08:05.600
So that's not bad either.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.440
I mean, those are some pretty good games.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.440
Full Auto is fun.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.440
All right.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.040
Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are

08:14.040 --> 08:16.560
taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.900
You know, I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging

08:20.900 --> 08:21.900
you to do it.

08:21.900 --> 08:25.960
I don't know if people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia, it's pretty rad.

08:25.960 --> 08:30.760
But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia,

08:30.760 --> 08:36.080
and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 11111, or Sony sucks

08:36.080 --> 08:40.440
and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 111DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
to add a...

08:41.440 --> 08:42.440
The hell I have.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.760
Ken Kutaragi's Bio PS eats crayons, or maybe it's Macy, who knows.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.800
So anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down.

08:51.800 --> 08:57.400
They've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony, for until further notice, so that

08:57.400 --> 09:02.960
you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user, I'm assuming of some standing

09:02.960 --> 09:06.520
there on Wikipedia, because if you're registered, then they can track what you do and give you

09:06.520 --> 09:09.160
the ban of death, the ban hammer.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.120
Isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii?

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
Ban hammer?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
No, project hammer, I know.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.080
Whatever happened to project hammer?

09:15.080 --> 09:17.840
I remember hearing about that at E3, but where did it go?

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
Oh, next year.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840
All right.

09:19.840 --> 09:26.720
So anyway, be good when you're editing Wikipedia articles, or else you'll get the project hammer

09:26.720 --> 09:29.680
slammed on you by the staff at Wikipedia.

09:29.680 --> 09:35.440
Well, not that it has too much to do with hammers, but I guess you could take it that

09:35.440 --> 09:37.640
way.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.960
Guess what game's coming out on PSP?

09:40.960 --> 09:41.960
Super Mario Brothers?

09:41.960 --> 09:42.960
Luminous 3.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.440
No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
Really?

09:46.440 --> 09:55.680
In Rising Star Games Evolution series, those are the PSP remakes, their DS ones are Revolution,

09:55.680 --> 09:59.360
and it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.

09:59.360 --> 10:06.440
Should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about

10:06.440 --> 10:07.440
it.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.960
And for anyone who's bitching that it was not on DS, yeah, it was.

10:11.960 --> 10:15.160
You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?

10:15.160 --> 10:16.160
I thought it was Rainbow Stars.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.160
That's the one that you shoot?

10:17.160 --> 10:18.160
That's Parasol Stars.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.660
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbows.

10:19.660 --> 10:20.660
I love Rainbow Islands.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.040
That's the one that you shoot the rainbows.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
Yeah, that's fun.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.920
I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.720
See, I universes actually have it on Turbo Graphics, but I would love to have a hand-held

10:28.720 --> 10:29.720
Parasol Stars.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.320
Well, I mean, technically I do, since I have one of the portable Turbo Graphics.

10:35.320 --> 10:39.520
But I would love to have it on, you know...

10:39.520 --> 10:42.120
But Rainbow Islands is the classic.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.000
Not as many people play Parasol Stars.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.640
You know I have to ask this question though, will I be able to get past level 30?

10:47.640 --> 10:53.540
Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe

10:53.540 --> 10:58.440
eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might

10:58.440 --> 11:02.840
function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.

11:02.840 --> 11:08.120
Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangeonserator.com said almost the same thing I did when I said

11:08.120 --> 11:09.120
it.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.020
It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?

11:11.020 --> 11:12.280
So very cool.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.480
Rama agrees, Paracel Stars owns.

11:14.480 --> 11:19.480
I think the first time I ever saw Paracel Stars, I want to say was on Supercade or whatever

11:19.480 --> 11:20.480
that game show.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.480
No, Supercade.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.480
Ultracade?

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
No, the game show.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
God, Starcade.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.320
No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.060
Starcade was the name of that show.

11:29.060 --> 11:31.600
They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good, remember?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.480
That was a great show.

11:33.480 --> 11:38.240
When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starcade.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.740
It was awesome.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.360
That's just craziness.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Crazy.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.360
Craziness.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.360
Crazy.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.800
Okay, maybe not that crazy.

11:46.800 --> 11:56.480
Anywho, okay, so of course with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.

11:56.480 --> 12:02.360
And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.

12:02.360 --> 12:11.080
You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.

12:11.080 --> 12:16.720
And they have a wonderful little application to easily install it on there for you.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.800
So homebrew on 2.8.

12:19.800 --> 12:23.540
I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly

12:23.540 --> 12:28.620
upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.

12:28.620 --> 12:32.280
Are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?

12:32.280 --> 12:33.440
Have you been following this at all?

12:33.440 --> 12:34.440
No, I just keep upgrading.

12:34.440 --> 12:36.440
You just keep upgrading?

12:36.440 --> 12:38.520
It's kind of lost now, wanting to do the whole NES games on this.

12:38.520 --> 12:40.880
I just don't care anymore.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.920
I don't hardly play.

12:42.920 --> 12:48.100
I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.400
The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out, but really

12:52.400 --> 12:55.920
I mean that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.

12:55.920 --> 12:59.760
I still like my PSP for like web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading

12:59.760 --> 13:04.760
shows and playing Luminous, of course, but I don't know.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.480
Somebody was telling me, John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the

13:07.480 --> 13:09.120
PSP's a done deal in 2007?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.120
Yes.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.920
Even with all the PS3 support?

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
It doesn't matter.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
It's gimmicky.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.920
No, no, no.

13:15.920 --> 13:16.920
This is honestly what I'm thinking.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.760
Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to

13:20.760 --> 13:26.440
like the Big Daddy console, it sucked, and with the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.060
The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.020
Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?

13:33.020 --> 13:34.020
They could.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.200
I doubt it.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.880
I mean it would be nice to see something like that work.

13:37.880 --> 13:43.760
I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
cool.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.360
I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.360
We shall see.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.180
Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that

13:53.180 --> 13:58.320
pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
anyway.

13:59.320 --> 14:04.680
Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?

14:04.680 --> 14:10.640
You buy a DS regular, oh, here comes the DS Lite, oh, here it comes in prettier colors,

14:10.640 --> 14:11.640
right?

14:11.640 --> 14:12.640
Right?

14:12.640 --> 14:13.640
This happens all the time.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
Well, guess what?

14:14.640 --> 14:18.240
You knew this was going to happen when you saw those pictures of the Wiis at E3, and

14:18.240 --> 14:22.800
then suddenly you saw the Wiis in the different colors, and then now you only have the white

14:22.800 --> 14:23.800
Wii, right?

14:23.800 --> 14:29.000
Well, sure enough, it is, now this is kind of a rumor, but Game Daily, who originally

14:29.000 --> 14:36.640
reported this, gamedaily.com is saying this is confirmed, that Nintendo of America confirmed

14:36.640 --> 14:41.800
that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii,

14:41.800 --> 14:47.240
will be coming to the U.S. sometime during 2007.

14:47.240 --> 14:52.600
Let's see, there's something, quote, Sonic Cineplayer CE DVD Navigator will be bringing

14:52.600 --> 14:57.320
high-quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.720
So kind of interesting, so we already know there's probably going to be a souped-up Wii

15:01.720 --> 15:03.320
somewhere in 2007.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.720
But it's going to be more than $249.99.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.440
I would say it might be, you know, in the mid-300 dollar range.

15:09.440 --> 15:19.840
One billion dollars, not really, but you know, is that many people going to want to get this

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
just for DVD playback?

15:20.840 --> 15:21.840
I mean, it's...

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
I don't think so.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
Who cares?

15:23.840 --> 15:24.840
I'm not.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
I have several DVD players.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.400
I have 60 that works just fine as a DVD player.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.020
I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD

15:31.020 --> 15:33.080
player, and you know, an upscaling DVD player.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.080
Why do I want...

15:34.080 --> 15:35.640
I have a five-disc changer in my living room.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
You want a cookie?

15:36.640 --> 15:38.640
No, I want a donut, though.

15:38.640 --> 15:39.640
Okay.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.640
No, not really.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.840
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to

15:43.840 --> 15:45.000
my main TV.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.120
Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand, doesn't know what the right hand

15:48.120 --> 15:49.320
is doing.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.600
So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there, they don't

15:52.600 --> 15:54.880
know what each other's doing.

15:54.880 --> 15:55.880
Interesting.

15:55.880 --> 15:56.880
All right.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.080
Well, we'll see.

15:58.080 --> 16:01.000
Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
No.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
No.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.480
Now, what if they sweetened the pot with some, like, maybe different colors, like maybe

16:06.480 --> 16:09.960
get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory?

16:09.960 --> 16:10.960
Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?

16:10.960 --> 16:14.640
If they get a pink Wii, they're buying that for my girlfriend, because that's all she's

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
going to want.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.640
I want the pink Wii!

16:17.640 --> 16:18.680
It's so cute!

16:18.680 --> 16:24.000
If it were a big black Wii, maybe.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.360
Just inserting the media into the pink slot is, you know.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.480
I just want you to put this card in my pink Wii slot.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.000
Wow!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.140
Upgrade my memory!

16:38.140 --> 16:39.140
Upgrade my memory!

16:39.140 --> 16:41.400
Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.000
How about some UK release dates?

16:44.000 --> 16:46.940
All right, sure, why not?

16:46.940 --> 16:49.000
We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Let's show them some love.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.180
Dark Sakura, love them all right now.

16:52.180 --> 16:55.680
Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.

16:55.680 --> 17:01.360
Asphalt Urban GT2, Bionicle Heroes on multiple systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty

17:01.360 --> 17:05.560
Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets!

17:05.560 --> 17:06.560
Come out over here!

17:06.560 --> 17:08.560
Hell fucking yes!

17:08.560 --> 17:12.520
Aragon's coming out on damn near everything based off of the unintelligible book of the

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
same name.

17:13.520 --> 17:19.080
Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.

17:19.080 --> 17:24.600
Hotel Duskroom 2-15, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix,

17:24.600 --> 17:28.600
Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Fantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Arrival

17:28.600 --> 17:34.600
Swords, Race the Official WTCC Game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns

17:34.600 --> 17:39.760
the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff

17:39.760 --> 17:41.440
that has unconfirmed dates.

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
Excellent.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
Cool.

17:43.440 --> 17:49.560
Anyways, for the US, we're getting quite a bit of stuff, and of course got to start everything

17:49.560 --> 17:52.360
off with our wonderful exclusive information.

17:52.360 --> 17:56.880
So starting with a few price drops actually, and I'm not too surprised by this, but NBA

17:56.880 --> 18:03.480
Live 07, they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats, the 360 is now

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
$39.99.

18:05.480 --> 18:11.320
I guess NBA Live 07 really didn't sell that well, so that's interesting.

18:11.320 --> 18:17.000
Blazing Angels has been delayed for the Wii to March 14th, and then finally not really

18:17.000 --> 18:23.240
game related, but Final Fantasy Advent Children, the collector's gift set, with a bonus DVD,

18:23.240 --> 18:31.720
script and postcards will be coming to your favorite video outlet on February 6th.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.000
So that'll be pretty fun.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.520
Now for game release dates of course, the big game of course this week would be Superman

18:39.520 --> 18:46.920
Returns, and that's coming out on Playstation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems, and

18:46.920 --> 18:48.200
some of my favorite games though.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.360
Can I interrupt real quick?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
I'm sorry.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.360
Did anyone play the demo?

18:51.360 --> 18:53.720
Because I heard the demo went to live this week, and I haven't heard a lot of chat about

18:53.720 --> 18:54.720
it.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.060
I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.

18:58.060 --> 19:02.080
I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look

19:02.080 --> 19:03.080
that bad.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.080
It looked pretty awesome.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.640
I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.

19:07.640 --> 19:13.760
I watched someone stack cars, and that was pretty funny.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.800
Another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally

19:17.800 --> 19:22.200
coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.

19:22.200 --> 19:27.680
If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will

19:27.680 --> 19:32.360
be coming out on the 360, Africa, the kind of Africa I like.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.760
How about Jambo Safari?

19:33.760 --> 19:35.640
Give me that again.

19:35.640 --> 19:42.360
And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and the Xbox 360.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.560
No one on the Playstation 2, for some reason that one was delayed to December, which is

19:46.560 --> 19:47.560
very interesting.

19:47.560 --> 19:52.120
And then Thrillville will be coming out on Playstation 2 and Xbox, and if you're a fan

19:52.120 --> 19:58.480
of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.960
That's basically the big stuff.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.840
Get a bunch of crappy DS games.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.280
I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.

20:04.280 --> 20:11.400
I want to see some of the movie-based games, like Open Season and Barnyard.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.200
Stuff you probably wouldn't want to pick up anyways.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.360
I might if I had children.

20:17.360 --> 20:22.600
I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me, Happy Feet has a DDR rip-off in it.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.320
But Miklotov told me Happy Feet was the worst movie ever.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.320
But I love penguins.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.440
I know, it looks so cute.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.240
I want to say Miklotov is full of evil, but I don't know.

20:31.240 --> 20:35.240
Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming

20:35.240 --> 20:36.240
out.

20:36.240 --> 20:42.600
Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.920
And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.

20:44.920 --> 20:45.920
Hi there, Japan.

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
How are you guys doing?

20:46.920 --> 20:48.440
You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.

20:48.440 --> 20:53.040
On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2, I know some of you guys are looking forward

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
to that one.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.800
NBA Live 07, X-Men the official game, and you guys are getting the HD DVD player this

20:57.800 --> 20:58.800
week.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.800
This one made me squeal a little bit.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.400
A lot of folks don't remember this game.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.400
It was on the PS2.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.400
It's called Cold Sept.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.760
There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360, and it does look like it's

21:06.760 --> 21:10.080
a sequel to the first game.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.560
It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.320
But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.

21:16.320 --> 21:21.360
They have a trailer up on live for, it was during the E3 thing for that.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.480
Oh, I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.200
Cold Sept, hopefully it's coming out over here.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.200
I'm sure it is.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.200
Eventually.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.200
Eventually.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.880
It's coming out from Japan, which means it will be making its way over here somewhat

21:31.880 --> 21:32.880
soon.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.440
Well, hey, I got some kind of random dimension.

21:35.440 --> 21:36.920
You know Disgaea?

21:36.920 --> 21:40.720
They're actually starting up an anime series for that.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.080
I thought that we reported on that a while ago.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.480
Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.

21:44.480 --> 21:47.040
I noticed it the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.600
In case you didn't know.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.280
Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.

21:51.280 --> 21:57.640
Coming out on the PlayStation 2, hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drummania V2 coming

21:57.640 --> 22:00.400
out this week.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.600
Gonna cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
their Guitar Freaks.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.480
Darsakha, sound like something you might be getting?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.760
Maybe, I don't know.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.960
I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freaks since I have Guitar Hero.

22:10.960 --> 22:11.960
Maybe.

22:11.960 --> 22:18.200
Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation

22:18.200 --> 22:19.200
2.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.360
Let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?

22:21.360 --> 22:23.500
Let's go to another system this week.

22:23.500 --> 22:32.840
We have on the Nintendo DS, Minna no DS Karingu, and this is my favorite title of the week,

22:32.840 --> 22:34.600
and I love the box art, too, as well.

22:34.600 --> 22:40.160
It's like these two little, you know, kawaii girls there, making their little poses there.

22:40.160 --> 22:47.160
The game is called Osare Majo Love and Berry, and it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo

22:47.160 --> 22:48.160
DS.

22:48.160 --> 22:49.160
It's a puzzle game.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.160
It's a puzzle game.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.120
Let's see, is that a game where you, you know, love somebody and then knock them off and

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
bury them in your backyard?

22:55.120 --> 22:59.720
No, it's Berry, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.720
Berry what?

23:00.720 --> 23:03.240
Like cherry or dingleberry?

23:03.240 --> 23:06.840
I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.

23:06.840 --> 23:07.840
Is that the hentai game?

23:07.840 --> 23:08.840
Is it a hentai game?

23:08.840 --> 23:15.120
There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising, like, a hentai dating sim

23:15.120 --> 23:17.360
for the DS.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.660
We have to feel up girls to see who's a- No, that's a different game.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.360
It's from Sega, and it's class- Oh, it's not Sega, then.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.280
It's classified as puzzle, so I don't- I'll say one thing, it sounds right.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.280
Touching is good.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.960
The female body is a puzzle.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.920
The female body is a puzzle, generally.

23:32.920 --> 23:37.160
Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle, in a way, so that could be an appropriate

23:37.160 --> 23:38.160
title.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.160
I don't know.

23:40.160 --> 23:44.000
Anyway, let's get back to the news.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.120
Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.760
There is a new demo- I'm excited already before you even mention

23:51.760 --> 23:52.760
it.

23:52.760 --> 23:53.760
Rob.

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
What?

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Rob.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
What?

23:56.760 --> 23:57.760
Rob.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.760
What?

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
Rob.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
What?

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
Rob.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.760
I will get- Rob.

24:02.760 --> 24:03.760
Rob.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.760
Rob.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.760
I quit, I quit, I quit, I quit.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.760
Rob.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.760
Rob.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.760
Can we keep this show moving, please?

24:08.760 --> 24:09.760
What?

24:09.760 --> 24:10.760
Attention!

24:10.760 --> 24:11.760
What?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.760
Quit dying of fire.

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
Okay.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
Anyway.

24:14.760 --> 24:20.360
A game coming out, it's actually a demo on Xbox Live.

24:20.360 --> 24:29.660
There is a 360 demo of Cars, 450 megawatts of data, so you can play as Lightning McQueen

24:29.660 --> 24:31.440
through Radiator Springs.

24:31.440 --> 24:32.440
Ka-chow!

24:32.440 --> 24:33.440
Ka-chow!

24:33.440 --> 24:34.440
God dammit.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.320
I must be a movie reference, I haven't seen a movie, so.

24:38.320 --> 24:45.160
But anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland,

24:45.160 --> 24:46.160
Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.

24:46.160 --> 24:54.200
I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.

24:54.200 --> 24:58.600
By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.260
I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.

25:01.260 --> 25:04.440
But the good news is, next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.420
Now I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.000
Are you excited about Cars on the 360?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.120
Give me a mic.

25:11.120 --> 25:15.480
You know what, actually I kind of am.

25:15.480 --> 25:21.040
For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.

25:21.040 --> 25:25.520
Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.

25:25.520 --> 25:30.400
So I'm actually excited for it, because Meg Z is the biggest Pixar nut.

25:30.400 --> 25:35.940
I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without picking out every little speck.

25:35.940 --> 25:39.880
So I'm just excited that it's coming out, so I can kind of, I don't know.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.460
She's a big Pixar fan, and her passion makes me excited.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.240
So I'm looking forward to it.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.240
I mean, Cars, come on.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.640
That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.

25:49.640 --> 25:54.080
Rob, we need to have a rainbow conversation.

25:54.080 --> 26:01.040
SSG100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.

26:01.040 --> 26:09.400
I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.880
I can tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.840
We beat people.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.240
I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I

26:19.240 --> 26:22.720
think we need to give Chris and Meg Z their own show where they just talk dirty to us.

26:22.720 --> 26:27.880
We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast, kind of like Rance.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.360
Jamie's going to be in on it.

26:29.360 --> 26:31.360
Just call it Ask a Lesbian.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.560
We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.

26:33.560 --> 26:38.960
We've got to get back to games, games, games, games, games, games, games.

26:38.960 --> 26:45.560
Anyway, so with the whole launches of the big systems and stuff, you've got the PlayStation

26:45.560 --> 26:51.360
3 and Wii bundling going on, and one of those stores actually doing that would be Fry's,

26:51.360 --> 26:56.800
and apparently some of their bundles, they were actually creating eight-game bundles,

26:56.800 --> 27:04.560
and basically bundles as large as, you know, $1,080, $1,080, that's funny.

27:04.560 --> 27:09.680
But anyways, so, I don't know, what do you guys think of these bundles, you know, forcing

27:09.680 --> 27:13.080
people to buy eight games?

27:13.080 --> 27:17.440
On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens, they want to make sure that

27:17.440 --> 27:21.680
people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.

27:21.680 --> 27:26.440
However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit, because if I want to go in there and buy one

27:26.440 --> 27:29.720
console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.

27:29.720 --> 27:35.260
I'll tell you why they do that, because margins on consoles suck.

27:35.260 --> 27:39.600
Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck, especially

27:39.600 --> 27:40.780
the accessories.

27:40.780 --> 27:46.360
Their games are officially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit

27:46.360 --> 27:47.360
this quarter.

27:47.360 --> 27:51.280
Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show, something

27:51.280 --> 27:52.660
kind of last minute that came up.

27:52.660 --> 27:57.240
Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE

27:57.240 --> 28:00.640
because he preordered a Wii, and then they forced a bundle on him.

28:00.640 --> 28:03.760
But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle, he had to get like crap

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760
games.

28:04.760 --> 28:10.040
He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube, and I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube,

28:10.040 --> 28:14.080
but I'm sure if you put in FYE and Wii, it'll come up there somewhere.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.960
It's nothing but text telling his story.

28:15.960 --> 28:21.120
It's kind of sarcastic, so that seems kind of low, to do that to pre-orders.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.400
And something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.

28:24.400 --> 28:29.960
Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the northwest somewhere where

28:29.960 --> 28:32.320
they were trying to do something similar?

28:32.320 --> 28:37.680
And it even opened up this investigation, and I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on trying

28:37.680 --> 28:42.120
to think back that far, but I seem to recall that this bundling thing has been very much

28:42.120 --> 28:46.760
frowned upon before, that you're kind of forcing consumers to buy these things together, so

28:46.760 --> 28:47.760
huh?

28:47.760 --> 28:51.320
Well, it's linked to the, apparently the YouTube link in our channel.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.120
Oh, thank you, Bandit.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.400
Rob White says, well, I don't shop much at FYE anyway.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.520
Robert M. says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.

29:00.520 --> 29:02.000
I know there should be, of course.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.840
You know, I've got to say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.

29:05.840 --> 29:10.520
I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot, and some of the third party, I mean,

29:10.520 --> 29:15.000
yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise, SpongeBob type, well, I can't knock it till

29:15.000 --> 29:16.480
I've played it, so whatever.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.760
There's questionable content there at the launch.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.040
Game 2 ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.920
Yeah, but you know what, Cytruck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.

29:27.920 --> 29:33.920
All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good, so I don't know.

29:33.920 --> 29:37.240
Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch, all things considered, too.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.240
With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out

29:41.240 --> 29:47.880
that are just ports from last generation just kind of being enhanced a little bit, and you

29:47.880 --> 29:53.200
know, you just got to notice them for what they are, and just don't buy them if you don't

29:53.200 --> 29:54.200
want them.

29:54.200 --> 30:00.520
Rob Way says, someday Nintendo will launch with Zelda and Mario.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.960
That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?

30:02.960 --> 30:05.280
Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.

30:05.280 --> 30:06.280
I don't know.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.280
Who am I to know?

30:07.280 --> 30:08.280
Who am I to know?

30:08.280 --> 30:09.280
I'm sorry?

30:09.280 --> 30:11.400
I'm sorry?

30:11.400 --> 30:13.520
They released Mario Bros. on the virtual platform.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.520
Boo!

30:14.520 --> 30:15.520
Boo!

30:15.520 --> 30:16.520
Listen.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:17.520 --> 30:18.520
You shut your mouth.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.520
I love original Mario Bros.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.520
Oh, bullshit, okay?

30:20.520 --> 30:24.360
You put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.280
To be fair, they've put it on every frickin' Advance title.

30:27.280 --> 30:32.760
I am a little bit tired of it at this point, but I do love old school Mario Bros.

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
I mean, come on.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.760
They're virtual.

30:34.760 --> 30:35.760
Pow, pow.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
Soccer and pinball.

30:36.760 --> 30:38.840
Yeah, I know, I know.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
That's fine.

30:39.840 --> 30:40.840
Whatever.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.840
The original Mario Bros., we've got to go in order.

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
That's fine.

30:43.840 --> 30:47.440
Black Boy says, I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream

30:47.440 --> 30:48.440
of games.

30:48.440 --> 30:52.040
So, in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.980
That certainly is fair, right?

30:53.980 --> 31:00.120
You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline and Mario in the pipeline and Super Smash

31:00.120 --> 31:02.320
Bros., absolutely.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.880
It's a good marketing decision because if you release all these franchises at once,

31:05.880 --> 31:09.240
yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the

31:09.240 --> 31:10.240
road?

31:10.240 --> 31:15.640
You're going to have Diddly-O or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.600
You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.400
It's a good business decision by Nintendo.

31:21.400 --> 31:26.360
Nintendo wants to have multiple pleasure, yes, multiples.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.360
Tantric game releases.

31:27.360 --> 31:28.360
Yes.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.360
Thank you.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.360
That's a very good way to put it.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.360
Giggity, giggity, goo.

31:31.360 --> 31:36.080
Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Launch Radio tonight in the chat room.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.080
Good for you, Black Boy.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.080
Pat, pat, pat.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.080
You got a gold star.

31:39.080 --> 31:40.080
All right.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.080
Okay.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.080
All right.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.080
That was a good comment.

31:43.080 --> 31:44.080
It was a good comment.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.080
All right.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.080
Let's see.

31:46.080 --> 31:47.080
Oh, going to the other end of this.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.560
We're going from bundles to the other extreme.

31:48.560 --> 31:51.540
Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?

31:51.540 --> 31:52.540
This is interesting.

31:52.540 --> 31:56.280
There are some numbers coming from Media Create.

31:56.280 --> 32:04.320
Multiple hardware sales, they sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan, 45,000 approximately

32:04.320 --> 32:06.560
of those were the 60 gig models.

32:06.560 --> 32:13.040
But get this, they sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch

32:13.040 --> 32:21.240
title, all the way down to Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.440
Poor Sega.

32:22.440 --> 32:31.800
When you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.040
That's less than one game of consoles.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.520
And there's no bundle like there is with the Wii.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.960
If these figures came out for the Wii, you could go, well, at least there's Wii Sports.

32:40.960 --> 32:45.880
We talked to some people last night, so Drew Nami is sitting in the back going, eBay, maybe.

32:45.880 --> 32:48.600
Or do people just really want a cheap Blu-ray player?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.600
I don't know.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
What do you think?

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
Dark Soccer?

32:51.600 --> 32:56.320
Cheap Blu-ray player.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.000
I don't know.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.320
That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player

33:02.320 --> 33:04.320
in Japan.

33:04.320 --> 33:05.320
It makes sense.

33:05.320 --> 33:11.280
I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.160
What does the average Japanese gamer like to play?

33:14.160 --> 33:15.160
RPGs.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.020
There were none released at launch.

33:17.020 --> 33:18.360
That's why there were no games sold.

33:18.360 --> 33:21.000
But racing games are also hugely popular over there.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.080
So Ridge Racer 7 should have been a big, big title.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.160
Well, Ridge Racer is kind of the sun setting on that franchise.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.720
It's not that good of a franchise anymore.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.120
Oh, then it's Fightin' Words, though.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.440
It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.960
Yeah, that's about right.

33:33.960 --> 33:34.960
Really?

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
That was the last.

33:35.960 --> 33:40.600
The Ridge Racer 4 bundle with the Jogcon, best bundle ever.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.240
Since then, nothing's topped it.

33:42.240 --> 33:47.620
Except for having the Negcon when you play Wipeout.

33:47.620 --> 33:48.880
I like 6.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.560
I didn't love it, but I liked it.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.120
It's all about Ridge Racer DS.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.880
It's a really good deal now for 20 bucks.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.520
All about Ridge Racer DS.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.880
All right.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.440
Act Def says Ridge Racer 5 is good.

34:00.440 --> 34:05.040
Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.880
R4 was the top of it.

34:06.880 --> 34:07.880
All right.

34:07.880 --> 34:11.760
Well, we've got a lot of opinions here tonight, and certainly you have some of your own, and

34:11.760 --> 34:15.480
you like to email those to us at Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.840
And once a week, Dark Soccer likes to dive into Mailbag and pull out some of her favorite

34:18.840 --> 34:23.880
emails to read to you here, live, on air, and it's called our Mailbag Segment.

34:23.880 --> 34:31.200
Dark Soccer, take it away.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.320
First email comes up.

34:32.320 --> 34:37.000
These are sort of being read out of order that I received them, so I'm being random

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
today.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Ooh.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
Hey, random.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.680
First one comes from Robway.

34:42.680 --> 34:47.400
I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.000
Something bothers me in particular.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.640
You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.

34:52.640 --> 34:56.280
This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.

34:56.280 --> 34:59.720
It more or less validates it, saying, we know you won't be able to get one, so buy your

34:59.720 --> 35:02.080
games now and get the system off eBay.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.560
This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the

35:05.560 --> 35:07.580
things won't buy any games.

35:07.580 --> 35:13.080
This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off at the same as a PS3 with no games.

35:13.080 --> 35:21.960
I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.

35:21.960 --> 35:28.040
Another one comes from AZHP, or AsHP, I guess I should say.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
Dear Dark Soccer...

35:29.040 --> 35:30.600
Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?

35:30.600 --> 35:33.280
I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freakbook years ago.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.280
I thought it was Asian hit points.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.280
Oh, well, who cares?

35:35.280 --> 35:36.280
Sorry.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
Okay.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.280
May I continue?

35:38.280 --> 35:41.240
Yeah, so that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.

35:41.240 --> 35:44.800
A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered

35:44.800 --> 35:47.720
100 PS3s at 30 different stores.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.720
I didn't believe him at first and then he sent me this picture and I'll link it in the

35:50.720 --> 35:51.720
chat room.

35:51.720 --> 35:52.800
I've seen this.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.560
I want to say I saw it over on YouN00B.com.

35:55.560 --> 35:59.920
They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.

35:59.920 --> 36:04.880
Listen, with all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000

36:04.880 --> 36:05.880
in a day.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.120
Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm

36:09.120 --> 36:11.840
not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.

36:11.840 --> 36:12.840
Brace yourself.

36:12.840 --> 36:13.840
Dirty.

36:13.840 --> 36:14.840
Dirty.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.840
Dirty.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.840
Dirty.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.840
Freaking ridiculous.

36:17.840 --> 36:18.840
Oh, my God.

36:18.840 --> 36:22.880
Why are you friends with such a lame-ass person, seriously?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.780
I think it's a great idea.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.920
You know what, though?

36:25.920 --> 36:27.320
People are selling them on eBay.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.680
You see an opportunity to make money, go for it.

36:29.680 --> 36:36.000
If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.700
That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like

36:39.700 --> 36:40.700
that.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.700
You know what?

36:41.700 --> 36:45.120
The dumbasses are the ones that paid that kind of money for a PS3.

36:45.120 --> 36:50.580
I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.

36:50.580 --> 36:52.720
It's capitalism at work.

36:52.720 --> 36:53.720
It's filthy.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
It's disgusting.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.780
Jamie, I think I have to agree.

36:56.780 --> 37:00.940
If you've got the means to do it, that's what capitalism is.

37:00.940 --> 37:02.760
It's playing off of people's stupidity.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.380
It's fucking immoral.

37:04.380 --> 37:06.320
Take this in a different direction.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.080
Isn't this really risky?

37:08.080 --> 37:13.100
I mean, because if the PlayStation 3s, the bottom fell out as they're saying is happening

37:13.100 --> 37:16.340
on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going

37:16.340 --> 37:19.940
to, this guy could stand to lose a poop-load of money.

37:19.940 --> 37:28.680
I don't feel comfortable with the idea where I believe that stupid people who buy the systems

37:28.680 --> 37:29.760
deserve what they get.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.820
That was my next question, is how much is the buyer to blame in this scenario?

37:32.820 --> 37:37.920
The buyer is very much to blame, however, I think being responsible for creating that

37:37.920 --> 37:45.880
sort of situation is, I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.

37:45.880 --> 37:51.980
I think it's really disgusting, you know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person

37:51.980 --> 37:53.920
because they are greedy.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.860
And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should

37:58.860 --> 38:00.360
even be an option to begin with.

38:00.360 --> 38:04.680
I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.380
So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.

38:06.380 --> 38:07.380
It's extortion, it is.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.500
But if you're dumb enough to do it...

38:09.500 --> 38:14.120
No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah,

38:14.120 --> 38:18.880
if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked, however, the situation

38:18.880 --> 38:20.680
should not exist to begin with.

38:20.680 --> 38:25.720
Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
sell it.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.660
So either way, justice is done.

38:29.660 --> 38:32.900
I got to read some interesting comments from Chat Room, of course, I got to read the smart

38:32.900 --> 38:34.840
ass ones because this one made me laugh.

38:34.840 --> 38:41.780
Alex of the OL Army says, with 100 PlayStation 3s you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia.

38:41.780 --> 38:48.800
And Rob Way says, I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy

38:48.800 --> 38:51.840
one PlayStation 3.

38:51.840 --> 38:56.360
Rob Way says, I agree with extortion, it's very much like selling concert tickets over

38:56.360 --> 38:57.360
cost.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.360
Scalping?

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
Interesting.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.360
Yeah.

39:00.360 --> 39:01.360
All right.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.640
You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, this should, making that much money

39:05.640 --> 39:11.120
off your eBay sale should count as taxable income.

39:11.120 --> 39:15.520
I would agree with that, but how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.600
I don't, then that gets weird.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.600
I don't know.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.760
It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.

39:21.760 --> 39:25.380
I just think that it's a sad state that our, you know, that our world has basically been

39:25.380 --> 39:26.380
reduced to this.

39:26.380 --> 39:30.520
You know, what happened to making a fucking honest living seriously?

39:30.520 --> 39:35.800
What happened, what happened to going out and

39:35.800 --> 39:40.560
Okay, Chris, repeat your comment though, cause I have a follow up.

39:40.560 --> 39:43.480
That died a while ago, making an honest living.

39:43.480 --> 39:44.480
It's obsolete.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.840
But do you, do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free

39:47.840 --> 39:48.840
donuts?

39:48.840 --> 39:49.840
Why?

39:49.840 --> 39:55.240
Wait, the making honest living is, that's what weirded people out?

39:55.240 --> 39:58.360
Wait, I don't know how to say the questions, I was like, redo your question.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.280
Cause you're saying it's a sad state of the world, you know, I'm just playing devil's

40:01.280 --> 40:02.280
advocate here.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.280
You're saying it's a, you know, it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people

40:04.280 --> 40:08.080
buy into, so I'm thinking is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind

40:08.080 --> 40:12.860
of like, they, they don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded

40:12.860 --> 40:18.000
out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
like them?

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
Oh yeah.

40:20.000 --> 40:26.400
I mean, it's, this is the, I mean, I'm, I'm a very idealistic person.

40:26.400 --> 40:31.200
I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit, but at the

40:31.200 --> 40:35.000
same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.

40:35.000 --> 40:40.560
It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that, all of that stuff in it, you know, and I can

40:40.560 --> 40:41.560
try and be a nice person.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.160
I mean, I am a nice person.

40:43.160 --> 40:47.320
I'm sorry to say though, but just accepting it blindly is what basically produces this

40:47.320 --> 40:48.320
behavior.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.200
You know, just, just to give another, another perspective on this though, and then we'll

40:52.200 --> 40:54.200
keep it moving.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.200
What about eBay?

40:55.200 --> 40:57.400
Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?

40:57.400 --> 40:59.840
Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?

40:59.840 --> 41:00.840
Oh no, I fully...

41:00.840 --> 41:03.200
eBay makes the share of all these, they could end this if they wanted to.

41:03.200 --> 41:07.480
Oh no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this too.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.020
I just think that it's a dirty situation.

41:10.020 --> 41:15.820
The money is not, they're basically taking Sony's work and making a profit off of something

41:15.820 --> 41:19.680
they had no involvement in.

41:19.680 --> 41:24.000
They're basically, they're stealing somebody else's work.

41:24.000 --> 41:28.680
Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.680
If you want to comment.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.680
Oh, Drew, last word.

41:30.680 --> 41:35.480
It is a free market though, if they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.

41:35.480 --> 41:38.960
If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much

41:38.960 --> 41:39.960
money.

41:39.960 --> 41:40.960
Alright.

41:40.960 --> 41:48.520
And one thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?

41:48.520 --> 41:53.880
We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time we should

41:53.880 --> 41:54.880
probably keep it moving.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.720
Do we agree though that it is unethical?

41:57.720 --> 42:01.840
I don't want to say it's unethical, I think the problem is everybody's on a different

42:01.840 --> 42:02.840
page.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.040
I think so, we just have to agree to disagree.

42:04.040 --> 42:09.200
I don't know, but my personal feeling is I feel like to me, and this is me personally,

42:09.200 --> 42:14.000
I'm not going to judge you or whatever, you're going to do whatever you're going to do, but

42:14.000 --> 42:17.240
my thing is I feel like it's the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's

42:17.240 --> 42:18.240
stolen.

42:18.240 --> 42:20.480
I don't know, to me that's...

42:20.480 --> 42:24.600
I've said this before, if Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what

42:24.600 --> 42:28.400
he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.600
But that's you guys, that's between you and him, so.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.720
Alright, we've got to keep it moving folks.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.720
We have more emails?

42:35.720 --> 42:46.640
Okay, we have, I'm only going to read a few more of them because we actually did get quite

42:46.640 --> 42:50.460
a number of them in.

42:50.460 --> 42:57.480
One of them is from AJ Twist, speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of

42:57.480 --> 42:58.480
this email.

42:58.480 --> 43:04.640
I work at KB Toys, I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month,

43:04.640 --> 43:06.360
but they're having a big video game sale.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.960
All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and

43:09.960 --> 43:10.960
DS titles.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
Cool, huh?

43:11.960 --> 43:15.440
Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.440
She told me no.

43:16.440 --> 43:19.360
KB is trying to get away from selling video games.

43:19.360 --> 43:20.360
I wonder why.

43:20.360 --> 43:25.140
Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games cause people to break

43:25.140 --> 43:26.140
into stores.

43:26.140 --> 43:30.720
They are the most stolen item in a robbery, so now KB is trying to get rid of these games,

43:30.720 --> 43:34.880
but they are keeping the Nintendo handhelds because they sell better to younger kids.

43:34.880 --> 43:38.120
So there's an answer to all those people out there who are wondering about KB's lack of

43:38.120 --> 43:44.200
good and new games, and new gen systems, but maybe there's a bigger explanation behind

43:44.200 --> 43:45.200
it.

43:45.200 --> 43:50.320
Yeah, I'll keep it simple, KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.

43:50.320 --> 43:55.120
It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games, and I didn't

43:55.120 --> 43:56.640
really think about it until I heard this email.

43:56.640 --> 44:00.240
I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.600
Yeah, it's like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB to

44:04.600 --> 44:05.600
steal games from them.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.600
There are KB's that are outside malls.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
There was one.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.160
There's plenty of strip malls.

44:09.160 --> 44:11.200
Whatever, it's KB.

44:11.200 --> 44:14.800
Last time, every time I walked past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.

44:14.800 --> 44:20.840
I mean, seriously, it's like, you know, we've lost our lease sale, you know, all toys must

44:20.840 --> 44:21.840
go.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.840
That's what it always looks like.

44:22.840 --> 44:28.920
Rob Roy says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.

44:28.920 --> 44:33.320
It's all about the inflatable pools.

44:33.320 --> 44:38.120
Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop

44:38.120 --> 44:39.500
where there was a Wii.

44:39.500 --> 44:40.920
I was so excited to see it.

44:40.920 --> 44:41.920
It is small.

44:41.920 --> 44:48.520
I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a

44:48.520 --> 44:52.180
month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with a Nintendo's

44:52.180 --> 44:53.360
Wii was there.

44:53.360 --> 44:56.720
No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.

44:56.720 --> 45:00.440
Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it, I've always wanted the first but never had time or money

45:00.440 --> 45:01.440
to buy it.

45:01.440 --> 45:04.760
I actually chose BeatMania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.

45:04.760 --> 45:08.520
Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.

45:08.520 --> 45:12.040
Freeze Pops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.160
Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.400
I've played it once and loved it more than the first.

45:16.400 --> 45:20.720
I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.

45:20.720 --> 45:25.340
I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking

45:25.340 --> 45:27.080
better makes me a happy bunny.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.080
I guess that's all for now.

45:28.080 --> 45:37.160
Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.

45:37.160 --> 45:43.080
Also to state, I am going to be posting My Little Pony Killer's letter in our forums

45:43.080 --> 45:48.240
momentarily as my letter of the week, so as long as it will not be read, it will be on

45:48.240 --> 45:49.240
our forums.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.840
Make sure you go there and read it.

45:50.840 --> 45:59.040
But our other really good email I got from Grin without a Cat is if we're all ready to

45:59.040 --> 46:00.040
listen.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.040
Uh-huh, I'm listening.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.040
Okay.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.040
John's making nasty motions at me.

46:04.040 --> 46:09.120
Hey guys, I thought I'd let you know my thoughts on Gears of War, someone who's not into shooters

46:09.120 --> 46:10.120
in a big way.

46:10.120 --> 46:14.120
I did speak briefly with Sky about it on live, as I know it's a great game for fans of the

46:14.120 --> 46:18.160
genre, but with the 10 out of 10 scores it's been getting, I was wondering if it was something

46:18.160 --> 46:19.160
everyone should try.

46:19.160 --> 46:21.040
I'm certainly not disappointed with the game.

46:21.040 --> 46:23.920
It plays good, it looks good, it sounds good, but I don't think it's quite as good as a

46:23.920 --> 46:25.360
lot of reviews have made out.

46:25.360 --> 46:30.960
I can't see it becoming a milestone in gaming in the same way titles such as Mario 64, Ocarina

46:30.960 --> 46:35.240
of Time, GTA 3, or Halo were.

46:35.240 --> 46:39.860
It's still just a shooter, and there's not a whole lot of variety in what you'll be doing.

46:39.860 --> 46:47.460
The story was a bit, well, non-existent, which I found surprising, as I had heard, they had

46:47.460 --> 46:50.980
the guy who wrote the Halo novels to do it.

46:50.980 --> 46:54.620
I've not read those books, but I heard they were quite good, so assumed having an actual

46:54.620 --> 46:59.140
author to do the story might make it pretty decent, but there's just nothing there besides

46:59.140 --> 47:01.600
a little blurb in the manual.

47:01.600 --> 47:05.400
It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially

47:05.400 --> 47:10.440
the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide and seek than a shooter.

47:10.440 --> 47:16.160
In my first game, I was relieved my teammate, I was revived my teammate only to hear him

47:16.160 --> 47:19.560
tell behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle

47:19.560 --> 47:21.440
by a chainsaw.

47:21.440 --> 47:25.000
I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters,

47:25.000 --> 47:28.820
but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.

47:28.820 --> 47:30.560
Keep up the good work, Gryn, without a cat.

47:30.560 --> 47:34.000
I actually agree with the email that Gears of War, I think, is one of those games I think

47:34.000 --> 47:38.720
you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the

47:38.720 --> 47:40.160
shooter genre.

47:40.160 --> 47:45.080
Be very careful about all this hype behind the game, because it's not for everybody.

47:45.080 --> 47:46.080
Is it a good game?

47:46.080 --> 47:47.080
Yes.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.080
But is it for everybody?

47:48.080 --> 47:49.080
No.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.080
So try before you buy if you're curious.

47:50.080 --> 47:57.520
And a fair warning, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10, it's ultimately

47:57.520 --> 48:01.060
up to you if you're going to like the game or not, so definitely play a demo.

48:01.060 --> 48:03.600
Don't ever let the hype sell the game.

48:03.600 --> 48:07.760
I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.

48:07.760 --> 48:12.500
Don't let the hype sell you a game, because it's not always going to be rewarding.

48:12.500 --> 48:16.040
Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.760
MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.

48:18.760 --> 48:20.360
No demo on live.

48:20.360 --> 48:25.360
So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other

48:25.360 --> 48:27.000
big Xbox 360 games.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.440
Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet, anyway.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.440
Yeah.

48:32.440 --> 48:33.440
All righty.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.200
Any more emails for this week?

48:36.200 --> 48:37.200
That's it.

48:37.200 --> 48:39.560
And I've just posted up My Little Pony Killer's email in our forum.

48:39.560 --> 48:40.560
Sweet.

48:40.560 --> 48:45.680
If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundrader.com is the place to deliver

48:45.680 --> 48:47.520
those lovely little messages.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.520
Excellent.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.620
Well, moving on, talking about the 360.

48:51.620 --> 48:56.720
There's been one cool mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a

48:56.720 --> 49:01.600
VGA AV out on it.

49:01.600 --> 49:07.240
And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the

49:07.240 --> 49:13.720
Xbox 360, as far as AV stuff goes, actually have all the pins for pretty much every video

49:13.720 --> 49:15.600
format you'd possibly want.

49:15.600 --> 49:24.080
So simply re-soldering some of the connectors to a VGA jack caused it to work.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.320
So it's pretty simple.

49:25.320 --> 49:32.800
There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it, and it'll save

49:32.800 --> 49:34.840
you some money that way.

49:34.840 --> 49:36.240
So that's pretty cool.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.240
All right.

49:38.240 --> 49:44.960
Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about controversial methods of

49:44.960 --> 49:49.280
making extra money, but I think we can all agree this is a good thing.

49:49.280 --> 49:54.700
The Entertainment Software Association, also known as the ESA, announced the proceeds from

49:54.700 --> 49:58.480
their 2005 charity game pack.

49:58.480 --> 50:03.960
It was a game pack that consisted of three games, Sony's ATV Off-Road Fury 2, Splashdown

50:03.960 --> 50:07.480
Ride's Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.

50:07.480 --> 50:12.480
They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.

50:12.480 --> 50:18.360
They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.

50:18.360 --> 50:22.080
Good job, ESA.

50:22.080 --> 50:31.960
Good indeed, and also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda

50:31.960 --> 50:40.760
artwork being sold from the old CDI games.

50:40.760 --> 50:48.520
On the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devon, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction

50:48.520 --> 50:53.200
with the original art that inspired these titles.

50:53.200 --> 51:01.120
The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but had signed artwork, a letter from

51:01.120 --> 51:06.700
the artist, a half a dozen CDI games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that

51:06.700 --> 51:10.020
featured the Zelda titles.

51:10.020 --> 51:16.280
The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.

51:16.280 --> 51:22.480
Even though the mention of the Zelda CDI games made us verp a little bit, I think for the

51:22.480 --> 51:29.200
Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so it definitely is something I'd want if

51:29.200 --> 51:34.200
I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, crazed

51:34.200 --> 51:37.920
Link fans.

51:37.920 --> 51:41.640
Thank you.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.240
We actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose, and it's

51:47.240 --> 51:48.240
an interesting game.

51:48.240 --> 51:55.320
It had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the, you know, young

51:55.320 --> 52:02.280
girl on girl action going on there, but anyways, apparently, Rome's mayor is demanding a band

52:02.280 --> 52:11.800
of Rule of Rose, apparently finds that the erotic themes are too strong, and that there's

52:11.800 --> 52:17.320
no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says,

52:17.320 --> 52:20.320
so I don't know.

52:20.320 --> 52:22.440
I own that game?

52:22.440 --> 52:25.200
I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.

52:25.200 --> 52:30.200
I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy

52:30.200 --> 52:31.200
vibe of it.

52:31.200 --> 52:33.320
Was there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?

52:33.320 --> 52:38.040
Yeah, it was very subtle, it wasn't like, you know, all of a sudden they just start

52:38.040 --> 52:42.600
making out and like, getting it on, I mean, that's a little much, so.

52:42.600 --> 52:46.720
You know when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like,

52:46.720 --> 52:50.120
you know when little kids are like, doing stuff that they don't quite understand what

52:50.120 --> 52:56.480
they're doing, they just, that's kind of the vibe I got, and it's not like they're, I mean,

52:56.480 --> 52:59.760
it's really, really subtle, I mean, unless you're looking for it.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.920
The only way this, you know, the only way this is ever going to get bandaged at least.

53:02.920 --> 53:04.560
What it boils down to is that they're all gay.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.560
Yeah.

53:05.560 --> 53:06.560
I'm kidding.

53:06.560 --> 53:07.560
You know what I mean?

53:07.560 --> 53:08.560
The fat chick.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.560
The fat chick was awesome.

53:09.560 --> 53:13.560
Listen, the Pope, he no like either the Rule of Rose, okay, so.

53:13.560 --> 53:15.600
He's not the mayor of Rome.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.560
I don't care, he doesn't like Rule of Rose.

53:17.560 --> 53:22.320
It doesn't matter if he's the mayor of, thank you, Captain Obvious over there in the corner.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.160
The Pope's not the mayor of Rome?

53:24.160 --> 53:25.160
No crap.

53:25.160 --> 53:29.160
No, but he is the god of Rome.

53:29.160 --> 53:36.200
Moving on to a completely different topic, maybe this is something you could drive around

53:36.200 --> 53:41.760
Rome or any other city for that matter, Nintendo recently filed, well, at least back in August,

53:41.760 --> 53:44.440
they filed an in-car gaming system.

53:44.440 --> 53:48.760
It's called a car area network, and what it supposedly does, it beams game information

53:48.760 --> 53:50.640
from the server to the game console.

53:50.640 --> 53:54.760
The wireless network could be between your game server in the trunk and the game console

53:54.760 --> 53:55.760
in the back seat.

53:55.760 --> 53:59.920
It could also possibly download new games and do all those wireless updates like that

53:59.920 --> 54:01.880
whole Wii Connect 24 thing.

54:01.880 --> 54:07.860
The controller looks very similar to what we know as the virtual console classic controller.

54:07.860 --> 54:11.880
Very interesting kind of thing to be marketing.

54:11.880 --> 54:16.140
I hope they just don't promote driving or playing Wii or any of these type of games

54:16.140 --> 54:18.760
while you're in the front seat of your car, because that's not good.

54:18.760 --> 54:21.320
So it sounds like Skymall in your car.

54:21.320 --> 54:25.700
Possibly, because they could probably do this on a plane too.

54:25.700 --> 54:26.700
It would be easy.

54:26.700 --> 54:28.840
I mean, if they patented it for the car, it would be easy to do it on the plane.

54:28.840 --> 54:34.400
If there's anything wireless involved on the plane, then they really can't do it.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.280
It does interfere with the controls.

54:36.280 --> 54:40.320
I was trying to think how they do the satellite TV, maybe they did some type of satellite

54:40.320 --> 54:42.000
thing, because some of the airlines have satellites.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.920
You don't even have car satellite systems.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.840
They got to do something too, because remember the...

54:46.840 --> 54:47.840
How about drive?

54:47.840 --> 54:51.740
Well, what if I have Bratz in the back seat?

54:51.740 --> 54:52.740
Read a book?

54:52.740 --> 54:53.740
Set it is.

54:53.740 --> 54:55.800
I don't know what the DS is for.

54:55.800 --> 54:56.800
Two DSs.

54:56.800 --> 55:01.080
12 gauge, I don't know.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.080
Or ferret.

55:02.080 --> 55:03.080
Sedatives.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.080
Ferret justice.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.080
Ferret.

55:05.080 --> 55:06.080
I don't...

55:06.080 --> 55:07.080
No, no, no.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.300
I don't hate children that much.

55:09.300 --> 55:10.480
I just don't want any.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.480
She loves them.

55:11.480 --> 55:12.560
She wants to squeeze them until they choke.

55:12.560 --> 55:16.400
And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't

55:16.400 --> 55:18.240
be breeding shouldn't breed.

55:18.240 --> 55:21.100
I am not in a position to take care of one right now, and those people shouldn't have

55:21.100 --> 55:22.100
one either.

55:22.100 --> 55:23.100
So there.

55:23.100 --> 55:24.100
I don't want to buy my morals.

55:24.100 --> 55:25.100
You practice what you preach.

55:25.100 --> 55:26.100
I do.

55:26.100 --> 55:27.100
Good for you.

55:27.100 --> 55:28.100
God damn it, I do.

55:28.100 --> 55:29.100
Do you want a cookie?

55:29.100 --> 55:30.100
No, I want another donut.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.480
I think we have donuts.

55:31.480 --> 55:32.480
No.

55:32.480 --> 55:34.480
I want a powdered donut.

55:34.480 --> 55:44.920
Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, um, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday

55:44.920 --> 55:47.400
just like everybody else.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.380
They had less than we got.

55:49.380 --> 55:55.160
They got 500 total for the entire country.

55:55.160 --> 55:56.960
I can top that.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.960
Hong Kong got 200.

55:58.960 --> 56:00.080
Really?

56:00.080 --> 56:07.360
So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries' worth of PS3s because

56:07.360 --> 56:08.360
they got 750.

56:08.360 --> 56:11.480
Well, did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
It doesn't say.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.720
Oh, that's too bad.

56:14.720 --> 56:17.720
Did they have people pushing each other into flag poles like they did here?

56:17.720 --> 56:20.880
Uh, no, they just probably strung them up from the light post.

56:20.880 --> 56:22.320
I got a question.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?

56:24.320 --> 56:26.320
I don't know.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.320
A lot.

56:27.320 --> 56:30.840
It had to have been the comparable amount.

56:30.840 --> 56:34.600
Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.

56:34.600 --> 56:40.640
They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China

56:40.640 --> 56:43.760
are not that rich.

56:43.760 --> 56:49.840
I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of

56:49.840 --> 56:57.840
stupid to give them a system that is overpriced, so maybe that's why they got so little.

56:57.840 --> 56:59.600
I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.

56:59.600 --> 57:05.880
I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order, god damn it!

57:05.880 --> 57:07.880
Anyways, wow.

57:07.880 --> 57:13.600
So as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for

57:13.600 --> 57:14.600
the Wii.

57:14.600 --> 57:15.600
And that is the case.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.280
The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.

57:18.280 --> 57:19.280
Quiet, you!

57:19.280 --> 57:22.440
Listen, I hear you sighing over there.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.280
This is an accurate gripe, okay?

57:24.280 --> 57:29.740
So they are not coming out until December 5th and probably later than that, and also

57:29.740 --> 57:34.120
the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.

57:34.120 --> 57:38.920
So you know what, to be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming

57:38.920 --> 57:42.240
out either, but you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.

57:42.240 --> 57:46.440
So I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight,

57:46.440 --> 57:49.960
because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get

57:49.960 --> 57:50.960
component cables.

57:50.960 --> 57:54.300
I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.280
You said it yourself on the show.

57:56.280 --> 57:58.760
Loki, they're not coming out today.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.720
You had to order them on Nintendo.com.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.800
Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.

58:03.800 --> 58:08.760
Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii, saying, I can't wait

58:08.760 --> 58:11.760
until I get one of these?

58:11.760 --> 58:15.840
I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me

58:15.840 --> 58:22.240
for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.

58:22.240 --> 58:27.280
We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.

58:27.280 --> 58:31.080
My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote

58:31.080 --> 58:37.440
detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's

58:37.440 --> 58:40.520
dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.

58:40.520 --> 58:47.520
All right, anyway, Take-Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.

58:47.520 --> 58:52.720
This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like

58:52.720 --> 58:58.720
myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that

58:58.720 --> 59:00.280
20 are coming from Rockstar.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.920
Of course, Take-Two makes some of those games.

59:03.920 --> 59:08.400
Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles, already has a date, October

59:08.400 --> 59:18.640
16, 2007 in North America, and then, of course, 2K Sports has given NBA 2K7 and NHL 2K7, various

59:18.640 --> 59:25.800
things across 2K, so good job, Take-Two, on keeping the games coming for the PS3 fans.

59:25.800 --> 59:27.200
We salute you.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.200
Absolutely.

59:28.200 --> 59:33.920
Where are the games for the Wii?

59:33.920 --> 59:37.520
There's already a ton of them on shelves, but we know there's more under development.

59:37.520 --> 59:39.400
Yeah, but 2K doesn't make any of those.

59:39.400 --> 59:40.880
Well, then, shame, shame.

59:40.880 --> 59:43.960
If you're a 2K fan, maybe the Wii's not for you.

59:43.960 --> 59:51.760
Well, continuing on, there actually is a leak out there stating that Gears of War may be

59:51.760 --> 59:54.200
coming out on the PC.

59:54.200 --> 59:59.360
PC Gamer inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.080
It's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:07.280
A display stand photographed on a Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.840
PC games.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:15.400
Microsoft would not confirm, but they said they didn't really have any current plans

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
on that.

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.360
However, it was around disgusting Windows Vista and the new things supported, so it

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.320
could happen.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:32.280
It should be also noted that I think that was the first issue of their name change,

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.280
right?

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.280
Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.280
Am I mixing up magazines?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.280
I don't know.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:37.280
Is it?

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.280
No?

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280
Okay.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.280
Interesting.

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.480
Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.720
You think it's for real?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.400
Think it would sell pretty good on PC?

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400
No.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400
No?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400
Why not?

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.160
Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:57.980
Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based thing.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:00.780
There's one PC game that's selling right now.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.800
It's called World of Warcraft.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:04.800
Civ IV?

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.200
Black Boy says, by the way, it's Computer Gaming World that is now Games for Windows,

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
not PC Gamer.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200
Oh, my bad.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200
Sorry.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.680
I'm going to be, I'll just be honest, I'm not a huge PC gamer.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:21.520
I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.240
I like Mac games.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.120
I'm playing one right now.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.680
Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:33.120
Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120
I need it.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120
No.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
I'm just teasing, of course.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.120
I'm just teasing.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.120
All right.

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.400
Let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.040
Somebody said, ooh?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.920
I said, ooh, because I'm going to call in.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.920
I'm going to call in right now.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:49.920
No, you're not going to call.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.920
I'm not picking up your call.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920
All right.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.920
Yeah, you can call in right now.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:02:01.000
The number is 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our user name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, so we're

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.840
going to head on over to the telephone and take some calls.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.840
Hi.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
Who's this?

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840
This is Meg Z.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840
Hi, Meg Z.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.840
Hi, baby.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.840
Hey.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:13.960
You got through.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.920
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.400
Wii.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.760
Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.920
I have been playing with my Wii all day long.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
Yes.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.920
Have you been stroking it?

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.920
Yeah.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:29.680
What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.400
I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.600
Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.240
What do you think?

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:45.320
Wii Sports is fun.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320
It's cute.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.960
It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.880
hit the putter or whatever.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.520
I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:01.920
Do you have friends that you're having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.280
I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280
I see.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:11.160
So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports, and there's not a lot of people around.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160
Yeah, pretty much.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.440
Well, you need to have a Wii orgy, my friend.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:15.440
I know, right?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:16.440
Hey, Chris.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.440
Yeah?

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:18.440
Want to come over?

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.440
Oh, yeah.

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.440
Right now.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.720
I think you guys need to take this conversation off the line, because I know a lot of folks

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.560
getting pretty hot about this.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.960
What do you think about PlayStation 3, Megzi?

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.840
That didn't sound too promising.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.320
What's wrong with the PS3?

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.680
Why no love for the PS3?

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.680
Just too expensive?

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:39.680
Too expensive.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:44.360
Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.720
out for it are out right now.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:49.600
You know how I feel about Sony in general, so meh.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.600
Hey, Megzi.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.600
Megzi.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.760
What is your favorite color?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.760
Lime green.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760
Yes.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.760
Wait.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.760
Wait.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.480
It's no good if you answer the question for her.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:01.480
That's cheating.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480
No.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.480
That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.880
Your favorite color is green.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.120
This is the capital of California.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120
Sacramento.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120
Answer.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120
I don't get it.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120
All right.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120
Sorry.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120
All right.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120
I know her favorite color.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.600
Megzi, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:21.120
Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.240
Ah, Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.120
Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:34.840
You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:36.360
Hell yes.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:39.340
He would make such a great Super Smash Brothers character.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:44.120
You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the Virtual Console, so you never know.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.120
We get tired.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120
I heard that.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.120
I was so excited.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120
I'll be very hot.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.120
Yeah.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.120
She told me all about it.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.120
Very hot.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120
All right.

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.440
Who are our listeners today?

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440
Hey, Chris.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440
Chris.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440
Chris.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440
What?

01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:00.240
We totally owned those army guys down the hall.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.760
Yes, we did.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.760
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.760
I don't know.

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760
I'll tell you later.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760
All right.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.760
Tell me later.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.760
Megzi.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
Jamie says hi.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760
Amy.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760
I've got a microphone.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.760
She heard me.

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.760
Oh, yeah, huh?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760
Megzi.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760
Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.760
We have our...

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.760
We have a Wii-some.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:18.760
This show is growing a vagina.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.760
I want to be part of the Wii-some.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:20.760
Rob, you are a vagina.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.760
All right.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:22.760
No, no, no.

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:27.040
We have like the weird-looking horn-shaped Wii-some.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.200
I have no idea what that is.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.200
All right.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.200
Just look at the map.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.200
Megzi, thanks for calling.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.200
Come back to California, you hear?

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200
Oh, yeah.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200
All right.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.200
Later, babe.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200
Bye, baby.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Bye.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200
Bye.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.200
All right.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200
Let's go to another phone call.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200
We'll go to this call right here.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.200
Hi.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Who's this?

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
This is Riella.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.720
I'm in the chat room right now.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.720
Hi, Riella.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.360
What's on your mind, buddy?

01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:00.920
I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting with all the Wii

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.320
stuff going on tonight.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.320
Okay.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:04.320
What's up?

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.520
I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520
Okay.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.000
I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Yes!

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Wow.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
How did that happen?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.280
When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.200
I was doing some kind of math homework, and I was listening to Radio Disney because I

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.440
used to have horrible taste in music, and so they were saying, �Hey, you�

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440
Oh, be careful.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.920
Chris still listens to Radio Disney, and you're offending her.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:29.920
Be careful.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:30.920
Wait, wait.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Hold on.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.920
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920
I'm so sorry, Riella.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.920
Come on, Chris.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
Oh, sorry.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.920
Okay.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:42.960
Now this show is just turning into a preschool.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960
Sorry, Riella.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960
Finish your story.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960
Don't worry about it.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.560
But anyways, they had this thing called the codeword of the day, where if you remembered

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:55.880
it and you were the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the codeword, you would win something.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:01.100
And so in November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.400
were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:08.360
So I called in, and I was the seventh caller, and I got a GameCube.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.360
Well, go you.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:11.400
So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400
Does this just bring back memories?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.440
It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away, and it was

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.440
Nintendo-related.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.640
Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.640
Yeah.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640
Did you enter the contest?

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.640
Yeah, I did.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.400
Are you bitter that you didn't win?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.720
I am very bitter.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.160
Well, get over it.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.360
I don't know what else to tell you.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.560
I'm just messing with you.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.600
You can try next time.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.240
There might be something even better next time.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240
Who knows?

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.240
You can win a date with Rob.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.600
Dude, okay, dude, hold on.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:43.600
Not cool.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.720
If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720
When you're 18.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720
Okay.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720
15.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720
Okay, wait three years.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720
We'll have the...

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.720
Anyway.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720
We'll wait for you.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720
Anyway.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:00.200
Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:06.480
Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480
to sell my PSP.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.040
You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040
Yes.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040
Huh.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.040
What goods do you have with your PSP?

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.000
I have nothing for my PSP.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.760
It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760
You know what?

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.160
How much are you selling it for?

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.160
I don't know.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.480
However much GameStop takes it for.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.480
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.800
You know what?

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.800
Talk to me online.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:33.800
Like, when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.480
I know you have two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.440
Rob might have sold me on the PSP at Luminous, too, so we'll talk.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:43.560
Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.600
Oh, look at this.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.720
Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.040
This might be good news for you, Ryoma.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040
I'll sign you down!

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040
Yes!

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
All right.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.760
Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760
All right.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760
All right.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:56.760
All right, have a good one, Ryoma.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.760
Thanks for what you're calling.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.760
You, too.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.760
All right, later.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.760
All right, have a good one.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.640
Hitstunna says, don't sell things to GameStop.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.920
Loki says...

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.640
You will get kind of jacked.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.640
$1.30 for...

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:13.800
I had a brand new PSP, and I was just curious, because I got one from a work promotion thing

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.920
or something, and I was like, okay, well, let me see how much they're going to take

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920
it for.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.160
I think they said like $1.13 or something.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.840
They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840
Ouch.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.500
Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.500
take it.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500
We got another call.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.500
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:30.500
Who is this?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500
It's Rama.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.500
What's up, guys?

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.500
Hey, girls.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.500
Hey, Rama.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:35.500
How you doing?

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500
Hey, everyone.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.640
I saw your picture on Joystick today.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.000
Sweet.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.360
You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360
Yep.

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
Yeah.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:45.360
You know what the caption said on Joystick?

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.360
Did you see it?

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360
No, I missed it.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.360
Oh, you'll love this.

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.840
It said, here's a Super Mario brother.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.280
Do you know what the funny thing is?

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.360
Someone's like, hey, Luigi's not black.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.600
I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600
Hey.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.320
I'm Luigi, motherfucker.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.320
You know what?

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.440
You're just having fun with it.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.120
Who cares if you're not, oh, my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.360
You can't dress up as Barrett your entire life.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.040
I mean, it's not your fault that you're underrepresented in video games.

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.200
90% of the roster in NBA Live.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.200
Shut up, John.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.840
I'll just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.840
There you go.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.840
There you go.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:25.840
Cosplay for the win.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:26.840
What?

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:27.840
Cosplay for the win.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.840
All right.

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:29.840
So what happened?

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.840
You were at the NYC.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.840
Now, what happened?

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.040
Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.600
out at a Nintendo World store.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.220
What happened?

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.760
The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:45.400
some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures,

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.400
you know?

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.920
People are like, Luigi, let me get your picture, let me get your picture.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.680
And people are shouting, where's Mario?

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:56.120
And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.000
Wow.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.080
Mario was getting his link on.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.680
So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.800
No, and I'm really pissed off about that.

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.680
Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.800
the damn line at Nintendo World.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800
Ouch.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800
They wanted it so badly.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.960
I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.920
I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time playing the Wii.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.220
Were you originally planning on getting a Wii?

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.220
Not really.

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.220
Oh, okay.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.160
Because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.720
down, and I'm like, okay, sure.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.760
So you were just going along for, like, moral support?

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760
Yes.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760
All right, well, that's cool.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
Did you meet Reggie?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.760
Did you meet my boss?

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.560
No, I did not.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.760
I saw this hair.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760
He saw the hair?

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760
There he is.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760
All right.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760
What?

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.760
Oh, do we see a picture of him?

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760
Oh, that's great.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760
Somebody posted it in the chat there.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760
What are you doing with that poor woman?

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760
I'm sorry.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.760
Oh, there it is.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.760
It says, folks love this Super Mario brother.

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.080
Because you're a brother.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080
Get it?

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080
Ha, ha, ha.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080
All right.

01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080
Yeah, I know.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.080
It's a great costume.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.880
You know, when we made Dark Soccer, Loki and I had little hats, very similar to the one

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.880
he has on in that picture.

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.240
Or at least, well, you didn't make them, but you had them made by one of your friends or

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
something, right?

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240
Yes.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.240
Who made those?

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.240
My friend Carrie Wink.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.600
She has a, she runs Wearable Wink, and she does all types of custom hats and cosplay

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600
commissions.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.840
Well, good job to you, Miss Wink.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.840
I applaud you.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.560
Hey, email me your information, I might have a commission for her.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560
God, I will.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.560
Oh, Rob, you're going to be mad with me.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560
Why?

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.560
I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:31.360
Shut up on them, traitor.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.360
No.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.360
They asked for me.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.640
I'm like, okay, sure.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.240
I didn't know until after the fact.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.080
Were you, did you pimp our show?

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.600
Did you have a button on?

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.600
No.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.600
I had nothing.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600
I was caught on right there.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.600
No, no, no.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.600
Don't, don't.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:45.600
No.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.600
Rama, it's fine.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.600
Do we really want that crowd?

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
I mean, people that are still watching G4.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
Exactly.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600
Do you really want them listening?

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.600
Do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.600
No.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.280
So, Rama, enjoy your 15 minutes.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280
I always do.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.280
Tick tock, tick tock.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280
Clock's ticking.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.720
But here's the thing, though.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.960
I wake up getting ready to, you know, line up to get the wheeze.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960
I turn around.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:08.800
There's like a hundred people that jump on because they have everybody lining up up against

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:09.800
the street.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800
Didn't they have cops?

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800
Didn't they have the NYPD out there?

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:12.800
Yeah.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.800
But cops didn't do nothing.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:14.800
I mean.

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.800
They should have had the LAPD.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:19.600
They would have taught him a lesson.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.840
And then one of the guys on the line starts screaming, what the hell are you doing?

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.960
I turn around.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:28.040
The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.640
And I'm like, what the hell, dude?

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.440
He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.200
And I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.600
Nobody was changing.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.940
I want to say I saw some video on, like, Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.760
were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760
us.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760
It was crazy.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
That's exactly what happened.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760
Rama, I got to end this call.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:50.280
Any other final thoughts for us?

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.280
Fuck you, Sony.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.280
All right.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280
Have a good one, Rama.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:54.280
All right.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.280
Don't hold back.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.920
We have very, very angry people against Sony here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.920
Well, let's see.

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920
Maybe our next caller might have some good things to say about Sony.

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.920
Who knows?

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:03.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920
Who's this?

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.960
Like, I'd have good things to say about Sony.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:07.960
Who is this?

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:08.960
This is Miklotov.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.680
Oh, Miklotov, our old buddy.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.080
I still have your wee Miklotov.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.080
Mr. Miklotov.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.680
You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.400
Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.400
to oblige him.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.160
I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.800
I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.280
Can you tell us his name on air?

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.280
No, I'm not going to, sorry.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.040
But we all know now, see, if you work with Miklotov, you know that he has a crush on

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.040
one of his co-workers.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.520
No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.520
What's on your mind?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:48.480
I just wanted to say how amazing the wee is and how much I'm big in Zelda.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.800
You are loving the wee in Zelda?

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:53.960
What's so great about Zelda in your mind?

01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.160
I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:06.160
go into the Twilight World for the first time, and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.640
Even without component cables?

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.000
Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:17.720
I will be picking them up once they come in, but yeah, I can make do with this for another

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.720
month.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.840
It's still beautiful.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.400
What else did you pick up besides Zelda?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.400
Anything?

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:29.960
Oh, I got some wee points, and I picked up Solomon's Key, is that what it was?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.520
Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.480
Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.000
I forgot how awesome that was.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.660
It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:38.660
very soon, hopefully.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:39.660
You know what?

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.240
As soon as I get a wee classic controller, I will be picking up SimCity, because that's

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.620
actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:47.620
Very cool.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.720
We'll lend you a GameCube controller.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.640
Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.360
Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
That's good.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.520
Because I have like 50 of them.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:03.480
She's offering to borrow a GameCube controller.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.160
Oh, yeah, thank you.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:08.520
Well, now you have a reason to come up again.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.200
Yeah, well, I always have a reason.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.240
Anything that came in, I'll beat all the Silent Oaks for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.880
Shane says he'll be all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.880
Okay.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:22.880
Tomorrow.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.880
Thanksgiving.

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:30.520
I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway, so I'm going to be gone.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.800
I'm going to be gone during the next show.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.080
Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.160
Well, I'm actually going to go have it with X to First Family, because his mom invited

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160
me.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:43.040
How about that weekend?

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040
That weekend?

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040
Totally.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.040
Okay.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.040
Four-day weekend.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.360
I'm going to be gone during the GameCube controller.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.360
Not cool.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360
I'm going to be gone all next weekend.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360
I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.360
And you can play it on my TV.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.360
Cool.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360
All right.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.360
Well, I do want to throw one other thing in real quick, Rob, if I could.

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:00.360
Yes, yes.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.360
Okay.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.680
I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:07.680
Why?

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.680
What happened?

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.840
They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:20.680
And they promised me classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:26.760
And I'm sick of going in there and pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760
in the store.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.560
And they sell everything five dollars higher.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.380
So they didn't suck it, and I hate them.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.560
Do I have an offer for you?

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:41.800
We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.600
Yeah, okay.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.680
To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they...

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:55.880
I don't know about the lost reserves, but if they don't get the stuff in when Sony tells

01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.040
them or whatever they tell them they're going to get in, it's not their fault.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.320
I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just...

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:06.640
You put up with so much from them, and then you're like, okay, that's just...

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.840
I know, but for someone who's dating someone who works at GameStop who constantly gets

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.400
harassed, it's like somebody comes and it's like, why don't you have this?

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400
Why don't you have this?

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400
And she's like, I don't know.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400
They didn't send it to us.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.920
Well, it's not her fault.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.080
There's a management or district...

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.680
It's just like how it changes from store to store.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:30.280
And GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.520
It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.120
I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management.

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.800
So they can all bite my ass.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.000
The employees are awesome.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.960
Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.640
Left cheek or right cheek?

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640
All right, wow.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640
Harsh words.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640
Both.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.640
With the flaming corn cob stuff up it.

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:50.640
Wait, what?

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640
Meikle Top, what?

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.920
Everybody go by Sneaking, because Sneaking is the best.

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.640
All right, now Meikle Top, we're going to line right now.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.700
Seriously, I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball Cheap.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:05.240
This show is not for you to hawk your canes on.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.740
Okay, well, I'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.740
Talk about it later, Shane.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:10.740
I got to go.

01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:11.740
Okay.

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.740
All right, bye.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:13.740
Fine, whatever.

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.740
I got to play Zelda.

01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:15.740
Bye.

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:16.740
Bye.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.740
I'll send you a message.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:18.740
Yeah, send him a Wii mail.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:19.740
Exactly.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:20.740
That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today was Wii mail.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:21.740
Hey, I'll tell you what.

01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:27.240
You friend me on the Wii console thing, because we do have a thread going on in the OLR army

01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.000
forum.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.040
If you do friend me, I will send you a bunch of memes.

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.040
Oh, snap.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.040
Oh, well, here we go.

01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:35.040
Here's another call.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.040
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.040
Who's this?

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.880
Obviously, the one and only Legend of Zaku.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880
Obviously.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.240
Now, you're in New York City, too.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.160
Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.160
I stayed home.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.160
That's all I have to say.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.160
You stayed home?

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160
Why?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.160
Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160
No.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.440
No, I didn't want to deal with it.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.240
I've already seen the massive lines with the PS3 around my way.

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.280
I'd just rather just take a break from it.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:03.280
Yeah, but those were quote, unquote, business people.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.200
Oh, yeah.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.200
The greed monsters?

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.200
Oh, yeah.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.160
What possessed you to call in tonight, Zaku?

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.540
You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:20.360
30 seconds of just stopping on a soft pad.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.520
I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.860
teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:32.800
the shark already, something to that effect, but I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.080
Total Request Live.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.080
So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080
Good thing you didn't.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.360
They made him play Fallout Boy, and they only showed it for 30 seconds, and from what I

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.680
hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had to

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.680
play on soft pads.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.680
And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:59.440
No YouTube link, as far as I know, and it's a good thing, because it's just not worth

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.440
it.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:06.560
But on the flip side, it might draw more people into DDR, because if they see Fallout Boy

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.720
on the dance pad, they'll drive into it.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:15.920
I don't know, it's basically, some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.920
of it.

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:22.720
The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls,

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.720
thank you.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.720
All right.

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.840
But think about it, you can't-

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.640
There's no need to think about it.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.640
You don't have to-

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:31.640
Look-

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.520
I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we've got to wrap it up, because we've

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.600
got to start ending this show, because we're running super long tonight, but how do you

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:41.600
feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.600
Overall?

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.240
I mean, it really depends.

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.120
Some of it might be stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:56.800
of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:02.040
play the game, but also live lives and make friends out of the thing.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:07.700
DDR is not just about arrow stomping, it's about, in certain communities, you meet people

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:14.120
and you make good and long friendships out of it.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.440
I was going to say one other thing real quick.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:20.040
Whatever happened to La Maschine del Bailar, or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.040
about DDR?

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:22.040
That just randomly crossed my mind.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040
What ever happened to that?

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:24.040
I downloaded it.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:28.000
I actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.080
What I heard is they didn't even, I don't know, I wouldn't say they bastardized it,

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:40.320
but from what I hear, they only played, like the demo mode is just about, the whole story

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.760
was revolving about just winning this competition.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:51.600
Would you say that La Maschine del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.600
restaurants?

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.400
I would say it's more like you got served.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.680
All right, fair enough.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.240
All right, Zaku, we got to let you go.

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.240
Have a good one, buddy.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.240
All right.

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.240
Have fun.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.240
Peace out.

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.240
Bye.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.240
I love our colors.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.960
You guys are funny, but no more time tonight, I'm sorry to say.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.680
So sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:15.320
We're getting kind of hammered tonight, so sorry kids, I'll try again next week.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.280
Late last minute stories here in studio.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:18.520
Last minute stories.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.520
Last call for alcohol.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.640
I've got some quick ones.

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.280
I'll make them very, very quick.

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:30.000
Anyways, first off, I'd like to start by seeing, there's this one post on GoNintendo.com, they

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.600
actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii, because

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.480
apparently his company did not hook him up.

01:23:39.480 --> 01:23:41.240
I just thought it was funny.

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:47.000
To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
on the TV.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
No, it's not at all.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.080
But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.080
we did?

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.080
Maybe.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.080
I don't know.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.040
Anyways, so of course, amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3,

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:13.240
the Boston mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino, is going to charge Sony for the police manpower

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:21.920
that it took to bring this whole chaotic situation to order, so I thought that was kind of funny.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:28.600
Wii Play has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S. in January, according to Reggie,

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:34.440
and that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a controller

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:38.040
for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:45.480
And then, some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360,

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:50.560
apparently aren't 720p when they say they are, and the resolution's a little bit less

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.360
than that, which I think is kind of interesting, kind of getting gipped there.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:02.120
Let's see, Killzone 2 is going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.960
Not a big surprise there.

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:13.400
EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.280
policy, and it says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites,

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.520
and those websites are making money by selling advertising.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.580
They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:31.120
I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.560
to be able to access content they want.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:39.640
To be honest though, I think that's still stupid, dumb excuse.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:46.440
Let's see here, Ken Kutaragi said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:51.280
storage system for the Playstation 3, and he's crazy.

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:57.080
CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you buy a 40 inch HDTV, you get the reserve

01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:01.480
of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.780
Let's see, oh the Playstation 3, this was the best one I read this week.

01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:13.240
Apparently if you do not have, or if you do have HDMI cables, or not HDMI, if you have

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:20.080
an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i, instead

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:25.640
will downscale it to 480p, which I thought was very interesting, so if you have just

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:32.920
a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.720
the Playstation 3.

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:39.240
And by the way, the HDMI for the Playstation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.240
interesting.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:48.440
And then finally, a couple last ones here, Sony's vice president of marketing was talking

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:53.300
about the crying babies commercial that they have for the Playstation 3, and basically

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:58.200
saying it's like a Rorschach test, whatever you think about the commercials, which you

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:04.600
think about the Playstation 3, so I guess my take on the Playstation 3 would be I don't

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:07.760
get it, and it's slightly creepy.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.080
Also apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense, I've noticed that

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:14.920
with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.120
I can see that, I can see that.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:22.040
And then finally, the last one, did you say that on the last one?

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.600
Forget it, forget it.

01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.600
Shut up.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.720
Okay, this is the very last one.

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:35.360
Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.360
in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:47.080
Apparently a nearby apartment had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080
their line.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080
Oh god.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:53.640
This is, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young

01:27:53.640 --> 01:28:02.400
girls became apparently underaged girls, and somebody called the cops.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.080
They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3 apparently, or whatever

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.800
F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.600
Alrighty, anything else?

01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:13.600
Anyone?

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.600
Anyone?

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:15.600
Wow.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.600
DMN.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600
Yes, DMN?

01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.600
I motion to adjourn.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:19.600
Alright.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.600
I agree.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:21.600
I think it's time to wrap up the show.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.520
We've been running very long tonight, so thanks of course to all you guys who download us

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.800
in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:31.800
You guys are awesome.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:32.800
We love you very much.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.800
Mwah, mwah.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.560
And thanks of course to our guests, DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way to

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560
Seattle.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560
Again, thank you for having me.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560
I had a great time.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.000
Chris, thank you for being here, and of course, thanks again for whoring out Orange Lodge

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.120
Radio the way you did last night.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.120
Oh, no problem.

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120
I enjoyed it.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.120
Thanks for having me on.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.120
No problem.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:52.320
Thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always, it's time to go around and get everybody's final

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320
thought.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320
We'll start with our guests.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.720
DMN, your final thought.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.720
I'm hungry.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:00.720
Chris, your final thought.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720
I'm not hungry.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.640
I just had a donut.

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.840
Dark Sakura, your final thought.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.840
Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.800
My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.800
Cry.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:21.040
I don't want any more orange soda.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:25.240
I've already had four cans of it, and that's more orange soda.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:29.760
All right, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:30.760
You guys rock.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.720
Oh, next week on Orange Lodge Radio, I do not believe we're going to be live.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.160
Did we already talk about that?

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160
I'm not sure.

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.560
We're not going to be live during the holiday.

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.080
Yeah, we're not going to be live during the holiday.

01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:42.440
Are we pre-taping?

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440
I don't know.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440
We have to talk about that.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440
Yeah.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.440
There'll be a pre-taping at some point.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.880
You can go to our website, orangelodgeradio.com.

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.840
So sorry to our live listeners, but it is kind of a holiday weekend.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.280
Some of us are going out of town.

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.840
And rejects false icons.

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:54.840
Thank you.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.880
And yeah, have a great turkey day for those of you guys in the U.S. that celebrate that.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:04.700
And certainly, we here at OLR are thankful for just you guys that support us and have

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.140
been spreading the word about our little program.

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:10.700
Like we said at the top of the show, we don't get paid for this yet.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:15.040
We don't really get a whole lot of reward except for the fact that we get to meet other

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:19.800
geeks in the process, and it's pretty rad to know that we're not alone in our hardcoreness

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:21.040
for games.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.040
So that being said, hmm.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040
Nothing.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.040
Oh, okay.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.040
That being said, have a great week.

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040
We'll see you next time on OLR.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:27.040
