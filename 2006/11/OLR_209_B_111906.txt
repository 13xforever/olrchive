Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and released to our podcast stream twice weekly To listen to the first half of this episode visit www.orangeloungeradio.com for links to websites with listings of past episodes Now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 209 for this November the 19th of 2006.
Happy launch weekend to those of you folks that picked up a PS3 or a Wii this weekend, or if you are a 360 user that's just holding out, or a current-gen user who's not upgrading to next-gen, then happy weekend to you, I guess, or whenever you're listening to this program.
We, here at Orange Launch Radio, are getting into the Wii Launch Madness, and we're giving away a Wii live tonight on our program, and that's how we're going to kick off Part B. If you want to know the details, you have to listen to Part A. Remember, Orange Launch Radio in our audio archive is released in two different parts.
There's Part A, which comes out on Monday, and Part B, which comes out now late on Tuesday instead of Wednesday, so that's another change.
Our chat room is eagerly standing by.
This is something special we did for our live listeners only.
We only advertise this on our LiveJournal and our MySpace communities, so if you want to find out about future contests before anyone else does, you might want to sign up.
LiveJournal, our username is OrangeLounge, and on MySpace, we're MySpace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
All right, we should stop stalling, huh, DMN?
Yeah, God.
And DMN, a.k.a.
John, is just doing this out of the goodness of his heart.
Yeah.
So there's no other reason for it.
All right, let's stop stalling.
Let's get to the winner.
All right, here we go.
I'm now going to pull up random.org.
So, John, you're going to be picking.
I'm pulling ten random numbers from random.org, and John is looking away.
Okay.
And he is going to tell me which one of the ten numbers I'm picking right now.
Rob.
Yes.
Yes.
Whatever email is number six on that list.
Number five, six.
Oh, this is great.
All right.
Guess what number six is?
What?
It was email number 37.
Okay.
In a row?
In a row?
I know how it's coming.
All right.
Let's count them out.
And I just have to verify it's not an employee of OLR or any of that stuff.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six, twenty-eight, thirty-nine,
32, 34, 36, here it is, 37.
Oh, look who won it.
Oh, they're going to be.
You know what?
This is somebody who I know has been supporting the show for a long, long time.
This person is going to be very excited.
Let's give him a call right now.
All right, let's give him a call right now.
It's connecting.
Yeah, it's ringing right now, boys and girls.
Let's hope it works.
Here it goes.
It's ringing.
Hello?
Hi, did somebody order a pizza?
We're kidding.
Is this Raven's Dolphin?
Just kidding.
This is Orange Lounge Radio calling.
You just won a Wii!
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
No, you won the Wii, my friend!
We're kidding!
No, no, no!
Congratulations!
No, we are joking.
Oh my God, I won a Wii!
Yep, you won the Wii, my friend!
Oh my God!
Dude, I gotta say, I'm jazzed for you.
You call into this show all the time.
Every once, we're Skyping you.
Every once, we're calling you to tell you that you won a Wii.
You did it.
You were email number 37 in the inbox.
Oh my God!
I'm literally speechless.
I know.
I'd go crazy too if I were you.
So congratulations.
So what are you going to do?
What are you going to do with your Wii?
Do you already own a Wii?
No, uh...
No, sort of.
What?
Sort of?
What's that mean?
All right, I do, but I have plans for this.
Oh, what's the plans for this?
All right, I was going to do something similar to DMN.
Uh-huh.
I wonder we, I'm happy about that.
It's just the question is, I'm not going to sell on eBay.
Good.
Just in case someone at Christmas time can't find one, I'm going to give it to someone.
That's very generous.
That's very cool.
That's very cool.
So someone's going to get it, so.
That's awesome!
Well, congratulations, Raven Stolfen.
And you need to get in touch with DMN.
You know my personal email on the site, right?
Just send me an email and we'll get your shipping address and get it taken care of, alright?
Oh, one more thing, Rob.
Yes.
As long as I have you on the line.
Yes.
Rayman's Raving Rabbits.
Yes.
What about it?
Rayman's Raving Rabbits.
What about it?
Alright.
There's this DDR team that you drum the stick with it and you
and you beat the little rabbits to death and it reminds me so much of you and I enjoy it because they play girls that want to have fun and it's such enjoyable alright I haven't played that minigame yet, I'm sorry I guess you did would girls just want to have fun?
it was Misery Lou that played yeah, but we played that one alright, Ravenstaff, we've got to get back into the show but thanks so much for entering and supporting Orange Launch Radio and now we're giving something back to you
I can't believe I won.
Over the fact that he may or may not already own a Wii.
But you know what?
Hey, it's fair and square.
We said it at the front.
You know, whoever wants to enter the contest can.
And it sounds like he's got really good plans for the Wii.
That he's going to, you know, give it back to someone who really is needy come Christmas time.
So, you know what?
I can't argue with that.
You guys stop being Scrooges.
That's right.
You guys are just Scrooges.
You're bitter.
You're bitter old queens because you didn't win in Kings.
So, just, you know...
Maybe next time.
We've got other stuff to give away.
Oh, you know what?
I was going to tell people about this.
If you've been reading the forums, it's going to be ongoing whenever it happens.
But we're going to have a new contest called Early Release.
Get your mind out of the gutter.
We get games a little early where I work.
So what I'm going to do is have random contests here and now.
Announcing games, and we'll probably do the same thing as we did here.
If a game comes out, I think we may start it either in December or January, because I'm thinking WarioWare, because a lot of people love that.
We're going to give away the game before it comes out, so you can rub it in people's faces.
I played it before it came out.
Bitches.
Alright, we'll look forward to that.
So those of you guys that are all huffy because you didn't win tonight, you have another chance later on.
And for those of you guys that are listening on our audio archive, of course we're going to have some cool stuff for you guys too.
We don't want to leave you out just because you might be international and can't really catch the show on Sunday night or whatever the case may be.
Anyway, enough excitement here about the Wii giveaway.
Let's go back to the show, shall we?
And talk about some more gaming news.
Alright, let's.
So next week, of course, being Thanksgiving...
And we all know what comes after Thanksgiving, other than falling asleep from overeating.
Black Friday.
And of course, with Black Friday, there's always going to be great deals on games and stuff.
And some of those you might be looking out for, for example, Best Buy.
They're having a pretty good sale on some 360 games.
For $18.99, you can score a copy of either Amp 3, Condemned, NBA Live 06, Rockstar Games,
Table Tennis, and The Outfit, which is actually going to be $9.99 if you get it in the store before noon.
And trust me, that game is not worth the $9.99.
Circuit City, on the other hand, is offering Full Auto, Gun, Perfect Dark Zero, Quake 4, and Tony Hawk's American Wasteland for $16.99.
So that's not bad either.
I mean, those are some pretty good games.
Full Auto is fun.
All right.
Well, you know, it's been a lot of Nintendo versus Sony this week, and some people are taking out their aggressions on Wikipedia.
I'm glad no one's decided to vandalize our entry, and no, that's not encouraging you to do it.
But yeah, did you know people wrote an Orange Launch Radio entry on Wikipedia?
It's pretty rad.
But of course, Sony and Nintendo are entries that are much, much more visited over on Wikipedia, and people are editing these articles to just say, Nintendo sucks, 1-1-1-1-1, or Sony sucks, and Ken Kutaragi eats crayons, 1-1-1-1-1, DarkSakura, we all know you've been editing on Wikipedia to add on Ken Kutaragi's bio, PS, eats crayons.
or maybe it's Macy, who knows so anyway, Wikipedia has decided to put the smacketh down they've decided to lock those articles, Nintendo and Sony until further notice so that you cannot edit these entries unless you are a registered user I'm assuming of some standing there on Wikipedia because if you're registered then they can track what you do and give you the ban of death, the banhammer isn't that a game that's coming out on the Wii, Banhammer?
no, Project Hammer, I know
Super Mario Bros.
No, Rainbow Islands is heading to the PSP.
Really?
It will be in Rising Star Games Evolution series.
Those are the PSP remakes.
Their DS ones are Revolution.
And it's to follow Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble.
It should be out in first quarter 2007, although they haven't really stated much else about it.
And for anyone who's bitching that it wasn't out on DS, yeah, it was.
You know, Rainbow Islands, is that the one I'm thinking of where you shoot?
I thought it was Rainbow Stars.
That's the one where you shoot the little rainbows?
That's Parasol Stars.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm confusing Parasol Stars and Rainbow.
I love Rainbow Islands.
That one's fun.
That's the one where you shoot the rainbows.
Yeah, that's fun.
I have that on one of the collections I have on Xbox.
See, I actually have it on TurboGrafx, but I would love to have a handheld Parasol Stars.
Now, of course you don't.
Well, I mean, technically I do since I have one of the portable TurboGrafx, but I would love to have it on, you know,
See, but Rainbow Islands is a classic.
Not as many people play Parasol Stars.
You know, I have to ask this question, though.
Will I be able to get past level 30?
Well, hopefully they will have, you know, starved off the diet of crayons and maybe eaten some Copics so that the alcohol will have dried quickly and their brains might function for a little bit long enough to program in the boss.
Huh.
Robway in our chat room over at chat.orangenautorated.com said almost the same thing I did when I said it.
It said, but can you actually beat the mid-boss on Rainbow Islands?
So, very cool.
Ranma agrees.
Parasol Stars owns.
I think the first time I ever saw Parasol Stars, I want to say, was on Supercade or whatever that game show.
No, Supercade.
Ultracade?
Oh, no, the game show.
God, it was Starcade.
No, Supercade was an actual arcade here in town.
Starcade was the name of that show.
They showed the reruns on G4 back when it was good.
Remember?
Yeah.
That was a great show.
When G4 first launched, they used to show reruns of Starrcade.
It was awesome.
That's just craziness.
Crazy!
Craziness.
Crazy!
Okay, maybe not that crazy.
Anywho, okay, so, of course, with each update for the PSP, someone's got to break it.
And they have, with the brand new eLoader for firmware 2.80.
You can actually launch most homebrew stuff on there as well as stuff made from XMB.
And they have a wonderful application to easily install it on there for you.
So homebrew on 2.8.
I can't wait to see that stuff on the PlayStation 3 when they're going to have to constantly upgrade the firmware to stop pirates.
And are you still doing a little bit of playing around with the firmware on your PSP, Loki?
Have you been following this at all?
No, I just keep upgrading.
You just keep upgrading.
It's kind of lost now wanting to do the whole NES games.
I just don't care anymore.
I know.
I don't hardly play.
I've sold all my PSP games except for Grand Theft Auto, and I honestly don't play anything.
The only other game I do have on order for the PSP is The Warriors coming out.
But really, I mean, that's not much of a stretch from Grand Theft Auto.
Yeah, I still like my PSP for web browsing for my bed and things like that and downloading shows and playing Luminous, of course.
But, you know, I don't know.
John, was this you telling me the other day that you think the PSP's a done deal in 2007?
Yes.
Why?
Even with all the PS3 support?
It doesn't matter.
It's gimmicky.
No, no, no.
This is honestly what I'm thinking.
Even with my own company that I work for, if you look at the portable connectivity to the Big Daddy console, it sucked.
With the exception of Super Game Boy, it sucked.
The Game Boy Advance link thing to the GameCube was horrible.
Could they possibly learn from these mistakes?
They could.
I doubt it.
I mean, it would be nice to see something like that work.
I know Nintendo said that they may try to do DS and Wii connectivity, which would be cool.
I don't know how that would work, but we'll see.
We shall see.
Well, speaking of Nintendo and things coming up in the future, you know the thing that pisses us off most about Nintendo, yet we are suckers for it and we keep going back anyway.
Nintendo is notorious for getting you to buy the same damn thing multiple times, right?
You buy a DS regular.
Oh, here comes the DS Lite.
Oh, here it comes in prettier colors, right?
Right?
This happens all the time.
Well, guess what?
GameDaily.biz
I'm sorry, GameDaily.com, biz.game.com is saying this is confirmed.
That Nintendo of America confirmed that they are going to be re-releasing the Wii, supposedly, or it's a DVD-enabled Wii, will be coming to the U.S.
sometime during 2007.
Let's see, there's something, quote, SonicCinePlayerCEDVDNavigator.com.
I'll be bringing high quality DVD movie viewing to a future version of the company Wii Gaming Console.
So, kind of interesting.
So we already know there's probably going to be a souped up Wii somewhere in 2007.
But it's going to be more than $249.99.
I would say it might be, you know, in the mid $300 range.
One billion dollars!
Not really.
But you already have yours.
But, you know, is...
That many people are going to want to get this just for DVD playback?
I don't think so.
Who cares?
I'm not.
I have several DVD players.
I have an Xbox 360 that works just fine as a DVD player.
I have two DVD players in my house, a PS2, which I don't really use that much for a DVD player, and an upscaling DVD player.
I have a five-disc changer in my living room.
You want a cookie?
No, I want a donut, though.
No, not really.
Our good buddy Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I only have four DVD players hooked up to my main TV.
Legend of Zaku says, Sky, it's called the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
So maybe insinuating that something is kind of going on in Nintendo there.
They don't know what each other's doing.
Interesting.
All right.
Well, we'll see.
Would anybody be interested in buying a Wii that has DVD playback?
No.
No.
Now, what if they sweeten the pot with some, like, maybe different colors?
Like, maybe get a pink Wii and some upgraded internal memory.
Would that sweeten the pot for anybody?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Upgrade my memory!
Upgrade my memory!
Speaking of upgrading, let's upgrade the show, shall we?
How about some UK release dates?
Alright, sure, why not?
We've been neglecting our poor buddies over in the UK.
Let's show them some love.
DarkSakura, love them all right now.
Coming out in the UK is a crap load of games.
Asphalt Urban GT 2, Bionicle Heroes on Multiple Systems, Call of Duty 3, Cats 2006, Krusty Demons, Dogs 2006, EA Sports Cricket 07, I want crickets, come out over here!
Um, Eragon's coming out on Damn Near Everything based off of the unintelligible book of the same name.
Guitar Hero 2, make sure you buy this game, every single person, and unlock Trogdor.
Um...
Hotel Dusk Room 215, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor Heroes, Mercury Meltdown Remix, Neo Geo Battle Call of C and Phantasy Star Universe, also a fun game, Prince of Persia Rival Swords, Race the Official WTCC game, Rule of Rose, Sonic the Hedgehog, Superman Returns the Video Game, Thrillville, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas, and a bunch of other stuff that has unconfirmed dates.
Excellent.
Cool.
Anyways.
for the US.
We're getting quite a bit of stuff and of course got to start everything off with our wonderful exclusive information.
So starting with a few price drops actually and I'm not too surprised by this but NBA Live 07 they've already dropped the price on the 360 and other formats.
The 360 is now $39.99.
I guess it
NBA Live 07
The big game, of course, this week would be Superman Returns.
And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, 360, and the portable systems.
And some of my favorite games, though...
Can I interrupt real quick?
I'm sorry.
Did anyone play the demo?
Because I heard the demo went to live this week and I haven't heard a lot of chat about it.
I haven't gotten to play the demo yet, but I watched a funny video of it.
I've been reading negative reviews online, but I seem to remember at E3 it didn't look that bad.
It looked pretty awesome.
But I guess Sonic looks good, but it plays poopy on the next one.
I watched someone stack cars and that was pretty funny.
But anyway, so another game that's actually received another demo recently, Rainbow Six Vegas will be finally coming out on the 360 this week, which is pretty awesome.
If you're into hunting elephants and stuff of that nature, Cabela's African Safari will be coming out on the 360.
Africa.
The kind of Africa I like.
How about Jombo Safari?
Give me that again.
And then finally, College Hoops 2K7 is going to be coming out on Xbox and
The Xbox 360.
No one on the PlayStation 2.
For some reason, that one was delayed to December, which is very interesting.
And then Thrillville will be coming out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
And if you're a fan of the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, that might be one for you.
And that's basically the big stuff.
Get a bunch of crappy DS games.
I think there's a couple Wii games coming out.
I want to see some of the movie-based games like Open Season and Barnyard.
I didn't notice until John pointed it out to me.
Happy Feet has a DDR ripoff in it.
But Miklatov told me Happy Feet was like the worst movie ever.
But I love penguins.
I know, it looks so cute.
I want to say Miklatov is full of evil, but I don't know.
Well, I was going to say also that there's going to be two brain training games coming out.
Brain Boost, Gamma Wave, and Beta Wave are going to be coming out for the DS as well.
So,
Anyways.
And let's move on to our Japanese release dates.
Hi there, Japan.
How are you guys doing?
You guys have some games coming out pretty soon.
On the Xbox 360 this week, Dead or Alive Extreme 2.
I know some of you guys are looking forward to that one.
NBA Live 07, an X-Men the official game.
And you guys are getting the HD DVD player this week.
This one made me squeal a little bit.
A lot of folks don't remember this game.
It was on the PS2.
It's called Cold Sept.
There's a game called Cold Sept Saga coming out on Xbox 360.
And it does look like it's a sequel to the first game.
It's like Magic the Gathering mixed with Monopoly, I guess is the best way I could explain it.
But it was kind of a fun game I used to play with somebody I knew.
They have a trailer up on live.
It was during the E3 thing for that.
Oh, cool.
I totally missed it somehow, so I'm very excited.
Coldstep, hopefully it's coming out over here.
I'm sure it is.
Eventually, one day.
Well, it's out in Japan, which means it'll be making its way over here somewhat soon.
Well, hey, I got something kind of random to mention.
You know Disgaea...
They're actually starting up an anime series for that.
They already did.
I thought that we reported on that a while ago.
Whatever, okay, so I'm behind the times.
I noticed that the other day when I was ordering anime for somebody.
In case you didn't know... Welcome to the show, Loki, nice to have you.
Coming out on the PlayStation 2.
Hey, Bomani fans, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drum Mania V2 coming out this week.
It's going to cost you well over $60 to import it, though, but I know a lot of folks are into their Guitar Freaks.
Dark Sakura, sound like something you might be getting?
Maybe, I don't know.
I've sort of gotten out of Guitar Freak since I have Guitar Hero.
Maybe.
Winning 11-10, plus Europe League 6 and 7 coming out there as well on the PlayStation 2.
And let's see, what else is coming out here over in Japan?
Let's go to another system this week.
We have on the Nintendo DS...
Mina no Diaz Karingu
Osare Majo Love and Bury.
And it's coming out from Sega for the Nintendo DS.
And it's a puzzle game.
It's a puzzle game.
I was going to say, is that a game where you love somebody and then knock them off and bury them in your backyard?
No, it's bury, like a raspberry or a blueberry type thing.
Like berry what?
Like cherry or dingleberry?
I don't know how else I can explain this to you people.
Is that the hentai game?
Is it a hentai game?
Is it a hentai game?
There was a Japanese site a really long time ago advertising a hentai dating sim for the DS.
We have to feel up girls to see who's a... No, that's a different game.
It's from Sega and it's classified as puzzle.
I'll say one thing.
Touching is good.
The female body is a puzzle.
The female body is a puzzle, gentlemen.
Trying to date a woman or a man is a puzzle in a way, so that could be an appropriate title.
I don't know.
Anyway...
Let's get back to the news.
Well, this is something that I know a lot of people will be excited about.
There is a new demo.
I'm excited already before you even mention it.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
I will get... Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
I quit.
I quit.
I quit.
I quit.
I quit.
Rob.
Rob.
Can we keep this show moving, please?
What?
What?
What?
Go die in a fire.
Okay.
Anyway.
Game coming out.
It's actually a demo on Xbox Live.
There is a 360 demo of Cars.
450 megaworth of data.
So you can play as Lightning McQueen through Radiator Springs.
I must be a movie reference.
I haven't seen a movie.
Anyway.
Anyway.
Anyway, it's not yet available, though, in Asia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, or Switzerland.
I thought you were starting the Animaniacs country song there for a second.
By the way, I'm going to be opening up SmashMyDarkSakura.com in coming weeks.
I'm smashing Rob with a ferret.
But the good news is next week you get to see me in a pimp outfit, so it works out.
Now, I know you're a big Disney fangirl, Chris.
Are you excited about Cars on the 360?
You know what?
Actually, I kind of am.
For those of you who know, Pixar and Disney are not quite the same.
Pixar is considered a bigger league than Disney, but they're technically the same thing.
So I'm actually excited for it because Megzi is the biggest Pixar nut.
I mean, you can't watch a movie with her without she picking out every little speck.
I'm looking forward to it.
I mean, cars, come on.
That's kind of sweet in a really gay way.
Rob.
We need to have a rainbow conversation.
SSJ100Mac gets my kudos for going United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama, India, Jamaica, Peru.
I'm sorry, the straight guy in me only heard her passion will make me excited.
I could tell you stories about the hotel in Madison that we stayed at.
We beat people.
I think we need to give, since we're kind of making this shift towards nerd radio, I think we need to give Chris and Megsy their own show where they just talk dirty to us.
We're actually thinking about doing our own podcast of kind of like rants.
Jamie's going to be in on it.
Just call it Ask a Lesbian.
We're going to call it Smoothie Talk.
We've got to get back to games, games, games, games.
Anyway, so...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
On one side, I have worked in the retail when this happens.
They want to make sure that people are going in there to buy the system so they play it and not to sell it on eBay.
However, as a consumer, I think it's bullshit because if I want to go in there and buy one console, one game, and one controller, I should be able to.
I'll tell you why they do that.
Because margins on consoles suck.
Margins from Nintendo's console this time around really, really, really suck.
Especially the accessories, their games...
Artificially inflating their prices to be able to make more of a profit this quarter.
Now, TigerClaw sent me an interesting link when we first started the show.
Something kind of last minute that came up.
Apparently there's this thing on YouTube going around where some guy's very angry at FYE because he pre-ordered a Wii and then they forced a bundle on him.
But he couldn't even get Zelda and Excite Truck in the bundle.
He had to get, like, crap games.
He's making this boycott FYE movement on YouTube and...
I'm sorry, I don't know the link on YouTube, but I'm sure if you put in like FYE and WE, it'll come up there somewhere.
It's nothing but text telling his story.
It's kind of sarcastic.
So that seems kind of low to do that to pre-orderers.
That's something that actually needs to really be sent to the Better Business Bureau.
Well, I want to say, didn't something happen to a Best Buy in the Northwest somewhere where they were trying to do something similar?
And it even opened up this investigation.
And I'm sorry, I'm kind of sketchy on this.
Rob White says, well I don't shop much at FYE anyway.
Robert M says, I'm really hoping there's even better Wii titles in the future.
I know there should be, of course.
You know, I gotta say all in all, though, Wii's launch, not too shabby.
I mean, to get a Zelda game at launch is pretty hot.
And some of the third party, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of crap movie franchise Spongebob type games.
Well, I can't knock it till I've played it, so whatever.
There's questionable content there at the launch.
GameCube ports that are just getting the Wii treatment, basically.
But you know what?
Excite Truck's pretty fun, and I like Trauma Center.
All things considered, to get some solid games at launch is pretty good.
Xbox 360 had a pretty decent launch.
With their launch, and even still true today, there's still a lot of games that come out that are just ports from last generation, just kind of
Robway says, That's what they were going for this round, though, with Mario Galaxy, right?
Probably just didn't get finished in time for the Christmas season.
I don't know.
Who am I to know?
Who am I to know?
I'm sorry?
They released Mario Bros.
on the Virtual Console.
Boo!
Boo!
Listen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You shut your mouth.
I love original Mario Bros.
Oh, bullshit.
Okay, they put that on every single goddamn Game Boy Advance game.
To be fair, they put it on every freaking Advance title.
I am a little bit tired of it at this point.
But I do love old school Mario Bros.
I mean, come on.
They're virtual.
Pow, pow.
Soccer and pinball.
I think they intentionally held back on Mario to have a steady stream of games.
So in other words, and pardon my vulgarity, they didn't want to blow their load at once.
That certainly is fair.
You know there's Metroid Prime 3 in the pipeline, and Mario in the pipeline, and Super Smash Bros., absolutely.
It's a good marketing decision, because if you release all these franchises at once, yes, you're going to sell a lot of games, but then what are you going to have down the road?
You're going to have Diddleio or Squat, or both, and you don't want that.
You want a steady stream of games in the market to keep you occupied.
It's a good business decision by Nintendo.
Nintendo wants to have multiple franchises.
Pleasure.
Yes.
Multiples.
Tantric game releases.
Yes.
Thank you.
That's a very good way to put it.
Giggity, giggity, goo.
So, Black Boy gets a gold star from Orange Lounge Radio tonight in the chat room.
Good for you, Black Boy.
Pat, pat, pat.
You got a gold star.
All right.
All right.
That was a good comment.
It was a good comment.
All right.
Let's see.
Oh, going to the other end of this.
We're going from bundles to the other extreme.
Did you hear about the Japanese PlayStation 3 sales?
This is interesting.
There are some numbers coming from MediaCreate.
Total hardware sales.
They sold 81,639 PlayStation 3s in Japan.
45,000 approximately of those were the 60 gig models.
But get this.
They sold 21,000 about of Ridge Racer 7, which was the most popular launch title, all the way down to... Thank you.
Sega Golf Club, which sold 1,410 copies, but when you add it all together, that's 66,684 games and 81,639 consoles.
DarkSakura, Loki, anyone?
Blu-ray player.
I don't know.
That was really the big reason why the PS2 sold was because it was a cheaper DVD player in Japan.
So it makes sense.
I agree with that, but let's be a little more real here.
What, and I don't want to sound stereotypical, but what does the average Japanese gamer like to play?
RPGs.
There were none released at launch.
That's why there were no games sold.
But racing games are also hugely popular over there, so Ridge Racer 7 should have been, you know, a big, big title.
Well, Ridge Racer's kind of the sun setting on that franchise.
It's not that good of a franchise anymore.
Ooh, them's fighting words, though.
It hasn't been good since Ridge Racer 4.
Yeah, that's about right.
That was the last.
The Ridge Racer 4 bundled with the JogCon.
Best bundle ever.
Since then, nothing's topped it.
Except for having the NegCon when you play Wipeout.
I like 6.
I didn't love it, but I liked it.
It's a good deal now.
It's a really good deal now for $20.
It's all about Ridge Racer DS.
All right.
Actdeft says Ridge Racer 5 is good.
Ridge Racer 5 was good, but I don't think it topped Ridge Racer 4.
R4 was the top of it.
All right.
DarkSakura, take it away.
DarkSakura, take it away.
First email comes up.
These are sort of being read out of order that I receive them, so I'm being random today.
Yay, random.
First one comes from Robway.
I have a lot of problems with the way things are being done with next-gen console launches.
One thing bothers me in particular.
You can pre-order games for both systems, but not the systems themselves.
This encourages the whole eBay thing if they're trying to avoid.
It more or less validates it, saying, We know you won't be able to get one, so buy your games now and get the system off eBay.
This also hurts the console manufacturers because the buyers who will just resell the things won't buy any games.
This is because a PS3 for one game will auction off it the same as a PS3 with no games.
I see no reason to buy games for a console I don't have and will be of limited availability.
That makes sense.
Another one comes from AZHP.
or as HP, I guess I should say.
Isn't that short for Asian Harry Potter?
I soon remember it's that nickname on DDR Freak like years ago.
Oh, well, who cares?
Sorry.
Okay, may I continue?
Yes, if that's how he signs his emails and that's how it's read.
A few months ago, my friend and a bunch of his friends in Japan got together and pre-ordered 100 PS3s at 30 different stores.
I didn't believe him at first, and then he sent me this picture, and I'll link it in the chat room.
I've seen this.
I want to say I saw it over on YouNoob.com.
They ran a blog post about it, the picture of the 100 PlayStation 3s.
With all 100 in his house, he's going to resell them all on eBay and make $100,000 in a day.
Please reassure me that he's making dirty money and I shouldn't be troubled that I'm not profiting off this PS3 like he and his friends are.
Brace yourself.
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty.
Freaking ridiculous.
Oh my god, why are you friends with such a lame-ass person?
Seriously.
I think it's a great idea.
You know what, though?
People are selling them on eBay.
You see an opportunity to make money.
Go for it.
If I had the kind of money, I'd be buying 100 PS3s to sell on eBay to make $100,000.
That's a lot of money that I can spend to maybe buy myself a house or something like that.
And you know what?
The dumbasses are the ones that pay that kind of money for PS3.
I would feel horribly filthy using dirty money like that.
It's capitalism at work.
It's filthy.
It's disgusting.
Jamie, I think I have to agree.
If you've got the means to do it,
That's what capitalism is.
It's playing off of people's stupidity.
It's fucking immoral.
To take this in a different direction, isn't this really risky?
I mean, because if the PlayStation 3's bottom fell out, as they're saying is happening on the Japanese auctions, that they're not going for what they thought they were going to, this guy could stand to lose a poop load of money.
I don't feel comfortable with the idea... Where I believe that stupid people...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I mean, it's really a very massive downfall in society.
I think it's really disgusting.
You know, oh, I'm going to take advantage of this person because they are greedy.
And true, where I do agree with the punishment aspect of it, I don't agree that it should even be an option to begin with.
I think, I believe, I believe in fair trade.
So you're saying it's like extortion, pretty much.
It's extortion, it is.
But it's dumb enough to do that.
No, I'm not saying, you know, the people that are dumb enough to buy it, I agree, yeah, if they're dumb enough to buy it, then they deserve to get jacked.
However, the situation should not exist to begin with.
Look, either way, someone pays for it, either the person buying or the person who doesn't sell it.
So either way, justice is done.
I gotta read some interesting comments from chatroom of course I gotta read the smart ass ones because this one made me laugh Alex of the OL Army says with 100 Playstation 3's you could cast Meteor without a Black Materia and Robway says Robway says I'll have to cast Black Materia in 2009 or so when I can even buy one Playstation 3 Robway says I agree with extortion it's very much like selling concert tickets over cost scalping interesting
All right.
You know, I think, and on top of that, this should, making that much money off your eBay sales should count as taxable income.
It is taxable.
I would agree with that.
But how does it work when you're Japan selling them overseas?
I don't, then that gets weird.
I don't know.
It's just like people who import cigarettes to get around taxes.
Yeah.
I just think that it's a sad state that our world has basically been reduced to this.
What happened to making a fucking honest living, seriously?
What happened to going out and... Okay, Chris, repeat your comment, though, because I have a follow-up.
That died a while ago, making an honest living.
It's obsolete.
But do you think that's why people were weirded out when you were offering free donuts?
Why?
Wait.
The Making Honest Living is... That's what weirded people out?
Wait, I don't know how to say the question.
I was like, read it.
Because you're saying it's a sad state of the world.
I'm just playing devil's advocate here.
You're saying it's a sad state of the world that we're in that people buy into.
So I'm thinking, is it somehow related to maybe the reason why people are so kind of like... They don't expect anything for nothing ever, which is why they're weirded out that you gave free donuts and just wanted to be a fun, nice person that liked games like them?
Oh, yeah.
I mean...
It's, this is the, I mean, I'm a very idealistic person.
I think everyone should be, you know, candy and gumdrops and all that shit.
But at the same time, it's, I'm sorry, this is the way the world is.
It's capitalism, it's extortion, all of that stuff in it.
And I can try and be a nice person.
I mean, I am a nice person.
I'm sorry to say, though, but just accepting it blindly is what
Basically produces this behavior.
You know, just to give another perspective on this, though, and then we'll keep it moving.
What about eBay?
Isn't eBay's hands dirty in this?
Because who's directly profiting off of this markup?
eBay makes a share of all these.
They could end this if they wanted to.
Oh, no, I fully believe that eBay has a degree of responsibility in this, too.
I just think that it's a dirty situation.
The money is not... They're basically taking Sony's work...
and making a profit off of something they had no involvement in.
Basically, they are stealing somebody else's work.
Certainly a hot topic we're going to get more emails on in the future.
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to comment.
It is a free market, though.
If they don't want to pay that, they don't have to buy it.
If they do, they're just as stupid as the people who are reselling them for that much money.
All right.
One thing to think about is if Sony marked up a PS3 to $1,000, would you still buy it?
We could probably do a whole show on the ethics of this, but in the interest of time, we should probably keep it moving.
Do we agree, though, that it is unethical?
I don't want to say it's unethical.
I think the problem is everybody's on a different page.
I think so.
We just have to agree to disagree.
My personal feeling is...
I feel like to me, and this is me personal, I'm not going to judge you or whatever.
You're going to do whatever you're going to do.
But my thing is I feel like it's like the equivalent of buying a car stereo when you know it's stolen.
I don't know.
To me, that's... I've said this before.
If Dan turned around and tried to sell our PS3 for more than what he paid for it, I would have serious questions about my relationship with him.
But that's you guys.
That's between you and him.
All right.
We've got to keep it moving, folks.
We have more emails?
AJ Twist
Speaking of work, that brings me to my first topic of this email.
I work at KB Toys.
I don't know if anyone has stepped into one within the last month, but they're having a big video game sale.
All video games, and I think accessories, are 50% off, including Game Boy Advance and DS titles.
Cool, huh?
Before the sale, I asked my manager if we will be getting any Wii's or PS3's.
She told me no.
KB is trying to get away from selling video games.
I wonder why.
Mrs. Manager told me KB is doing this because a lot of these games...
KB doesn't make any sort of freaking money.
It's interesting because I remember when KB used to sell a lot of games and I didn't really think about it until I heard this email.
I haven't really heard them as a serious video game contender in a long time.
Yes, like I'm sure people are going to break into a mall to break into a KB.
There are KBs that are outside malls.
There was one.
There's plenty of strip malls.
Whatever, it's KB.
Every time I walk past a KB, it looks like they're closing out.
Seriously, it's like we've lost our lease sale.
All toys must go.
That's what it always looks like.
Robway says, if I broke into KB, I'd steal all the Pop Rocks.
It's all about the inflatable pools.
Moving on, to me being able to play the Wii 10 days before launch, I went to a GameStop where there was a Wii.
I was so excited to see it.
It is small.
I had to hand in a photo ID and credit card to play, just like it was rumored nearly a month ago, but I didn't care because that option of being able to play with the Nintendo Wii was there.
No one will care about my story a week from now, so moving on to what I've been up to.
Guitar Hero 2, crazy, love it.
I've always wanted the first, but never had time or money to buy it.
I actually chose Beatmania over Guitar Hero when I did have the chance.
Love that game just as much, but it's much harder to play than Guitar Hero, in my opinion.
Freespops, Less Talk, More Rock, Kick Sass, as well as Trogdor.
Luminous 2 for PSP, my friend owns it.
I've played it once and loved it more than the first.
I actually love the fact that all the old skins are back in this one's sky.
I love all the skins and music in the first, so having them back with some skins looking better makes me a happy bunny.
I guess that's all for now.
Keep gaming and continue to be the crazy and great source of gaming news and fun.
Yay, Guitar Hero.
Yay, Guitar Hero.
Um...
Also to state, I am going to be posting my little Ponykillers letter in our forums momentarily as my letter of the week.
So as it is long, it will not be read.
It will be on our forums.
Make sure you go there and read it.
But our other really good email I got from GrinWithoutACat is if we're all ready to listen.
I'm listening.
Okay.
John's making nasty motions at me.
or HaloWare.
It's
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It is a fun game, though, even for someone who doesn't normally play these games, especially the multiplayer, which is really more like a game of hide-and-seek than a shooter.
In my first game, I was revived my teammate only to hear him tell, behind you, I had just enough time to turn around before being sliced down the middle by a chainsaw.
I think I would recommend most people to try it out unless you really dislike shooters, but I'll probably be paying Viva Pinata a lot longer than Gears of War.
Keep up the good work, grin without a cap.
I actually agree with the email that Gears of War I think is one of those games I think you definitely should try before you buy, especially if you're not primarily into the shooter genre.
Be very careful about all this hype behind the game because it's not for everybody.
Is it a good game?
Yes.
But is it for everybody?
No.
So try before you buy if you're curious.
And a fair warning, I mean, no matter if X amount of reviewers say, oh, 10 out of 10.
You know, it's ultimately up to you if you're going to like the game or not.
Absolutely.
So definitely play a demo.
Don't ever let the hype sell the game.
I know I've personally made that mistake, so I'm giving you advice.
Don't let the hype sell you a game because it's not always going to be rewarding.
Let's not forget the legend of Daikatana.
And MikeW0440 gives a very interesting point.
No demo on live.
So it's kind of like there's no way to really try it out in comparison to a lot of other big Xbox 360 games.
Kind of interesting that they chose not to do that yet anyway.
So, alrighty.
Any more emails for this week?
That's it, and I've just posted up my little pony killer's email in our forum.
Sweet.
If you want to send us more emails, mailbag at orangelaundryader.com is the place to deliver those lovely little messages.
Excellent.
Well, moving on, talking about the 360, there's been one cool little mod that's come out for your 360 where you can actually add a VGA AV out on it.
And basically, since the way they did it was because all the cables that come out for the Xbox 360 as far as AV stuff goes actually have all the pins for pretty much every video format you'd possibly want.
So simply re-soldering some of the connectors...
to a VGA jack, you know, caused it to work.
So it's pretty simple.
There is a little how-to on Engadget if you want to know how to do it.
And it'll save you some money that way.
So that's pretty cool.
All right.
Well, earlier during the mailbag, we certainly were talking about, you know, controversial methods of making extra money.
But I think we can all agree this is a good thing.
and DarkSakura.
Sony's ATV Offroad Fury 2, Splashdown Rides Gone Wild, and EA's Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2.
They bundled it all together for $19.99 and donated the proceeds to charity.
They raised $1.5 million for various children's organizations across the U.S.
Good job, ESA!
Good, indeed.
And also in regards to some charity events going on, there is a bit of rare Zelda artwork being sold from the old CD-i games.
Sorry.
From the Black Moon Project, one of their people, Devin, has created a one-of-a-kind eBay auction with the original art that inspired these titles.
The auction actually expired today, sadly, Sunday, but has signed artwork, a letter from the artist, a half a dozen CD-i games, and a signed copy of the Retro Gamer issue that featured the Zelda titles.
The letter from the artist, all it says is, sorry.
Even though the mention of the Zelda CD-i games made us verp a little bit, I think it's, you know, for the Zelda collector, it is the ultimate thing, so, you know, definitely something I'd want if I were a crazed Link fan, like some of those people we saw online the other night, yeah, crazed Link fans.
Anywho, um,
So, we actually talked about this game a little bit back in September, Rule of Rose.
And it's an interesting game, had a little bit of a controversial aspect to it, a little bit of the young girl on girl action going on there.
But anyways, apparently Rome's mayor is demanding a ban of Rule of Rose.
Apparently finds that the erotic themes are too...
Too strong and that there's no way that a violent video game should be sold and distributed in our country, he says.
So, I don't know.
I own that game.
I didn't, to be honest, when I played the game, I didn't see it.
I mean, there was some strange stuff, but I think it just kind of went towards the creepy vibe of it.
Wasn't there a very subtle Lolita thing going on?
Yeah, it was very subtle.
It wasn't like, you know...
All of a sudden they just start making out and getting it on.
I mean, that's a little much.
You know, when I was playing it, I didn't play a lot of it, but what I gathered, it's like, you know when little kids are doing stuff that they don't quite understand what they're doing?
That's kind of the vibe I got.
And it's not like they're... I mean, it's really, really subtle.
I mean, unless you're looking for it.
Fucking sickos.
You know, the only way this is ever going to get banned... What it boils down to is that they're all gay.
I'm kidding.
The fat chick.
The fat chick was awesome.
Listen, the Pope, he no like the rule of Rose, okay, so.
He's not the mayor of Rome.
I don't care, he doesn't like rule of Rose.
It doesn't matter if he's the mayor.
Thank you Captain Obvious over there in the corner.
The Pope's not the mayor of Rome.
No crap.
No, but he is the God of Rome.
Alright.
Um.
Um.
Car Area Network
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Two DSs.
Twelve gauge, I don't know.
Or ferret.
Sedatives.
Ferret justice.
No, no, no.
I don't hate children that much.
I just don't want any.
She loves them.
She wants to squeeze them until they choke.
And the reason I don't want any is for the same reason that I think people who shouldn't be breeding shouldn't breed.
I am not in a position to take care of one right now.
And those people shouldn't have one either.
So there.
I live by my morals.
You practice what you preach.
I do.
Good for you.
God damn it, I do.
Now I want another donut.
I think we have donuts.
I want a powdered donut.
Anyway, speaking of the disappointment though, Taiwan got their PS3 shipments on Friday just like everybody else.
They had less than we got.
They got 500 total for the entire...
I can top that.
Hong Kong got $200.
Really?
So the Sony store in San Francisco got more than two countries worth a piece.
Because they got $750.
Did they have people lining up in Taiwan like they did here?
It doesn't say.
Oh, that's too bad.
Did they have people pushing each other into flagpoles like they did here?
No, they just probably strung them up from the light post.
I got a question.
How much were they selling for in Hong Kong?
I don't know.
A lot.
It had to have been the comparable amount.
Well, because Megzi told me an interesting story about Starbucks that came over there.
They're selling it for the equivalent of what it would be in America, and people in China are, you know, not that... They're not that... I mean, one Starbucks coffee is like two weeks of work for most of them, so it's kind of stupid to give them a system that is overpriced and, you know... So maybe that's why they got so little...
I wonder if they screw up coffee orders there.
I worked two weeks for this and you fucked up the order.
God damn it.
Anyways.
Wow.
So, as I mentioned in part A, I'm not too happy about component cables coming out late for the Wii.
And that is the case.
The official cables are not coming out until December 5th.
Quiet, you.
Listen, I hear you sighing over there.
This is an accurate gripe, okay?
So, they are not coming out until December 5th, and probably later than that.
And also, the third-party cables will not be coming out until then either.
So, you know what?
To be fair, the PlayStation 3 ones, the official ones, are not coming out either.
But, you can still use the PlayStation 2 ones on that.
So...
I just want to point out there's a reason why Loki had to cover this story tonight because last night he's like, I should stand in the line at Best Buy just so I can get component cables.
I'm like, Loki, they're not going to be out until the first week of December.
You said it yourself on the show.
Loki, they're not coming out today.
You had to order them on Nintendo.com.
Loki, Perrin Kaplan didn't know what she was talking about.
Weren't you going to stand out with your Wii in the line for the Wii saying, I can't wait until I get one of these.
I thought about that, but then we thought about the fact that someone might jump me for it, so I figured I'd play it safe.
We also thought about smashing the box, too, but we opted out of that.
My thought was to sit in the middle of the parking lot and put an M80 in it with a remote detonator and then just watch people run towards it and then blow it up, but apparently that's dangerous, so we couldn't do that either.
Take Two announced over 20 PlayStation 3 games in development.
This is good because folks that are saying PlayStation 3 is very weak right now, like myself, this is good news for the future of the console because seven titles out of that 20 are coming from Rockstar.
Of course, Take Two makes some of those games.
Grand Theft Auto IV, of course, one of those big, big titles.
We salute you.
Absolutely.
Where are the games for the Wii?
PC Gamer
uh inadvertently announced Gears of War for Windows it's on page 28 of the Holiday 2006 issue a display stand photographed on the Microsoft campus shows Gears of War among several upcoming PC games Microsoft would not confirm um but they said they didn't really have any current plans on that however it was you know it was around discussing Windows Vista and the new things supported so it could happen
It should be also noted that that's, I think, that was the first issue of their name change, right?
Aren't they called, like, Games for Windows?
Or am I mixing up magazines?
I don't know.
Is it?
No?
Okay.
Very interesting.
Interesting little tidbit to be dumping in your new issue of the new magazine.
You think it's for real?
Think it would sell pretty good on the PC?
No.
No?
Why not?
Because I don't think many PC games nowadays sell well.
Oh, but a PC gamer who's hardcore into strategy and the turn-based things.
There's one PC game that's selling right now.
It's called World of Warcraft.
Civ IV?
Black Boy says, by the way, it's computer gaming world that is now games for Windows, not PC gamer.
Oh, my bad.
Sorry.
I'll just be honest.
I'm not a huge PC gamer.
I respect PC games, but I'm not huge on them, so I don't follow the magazine scene.
I like Mac games.
I'm playing one right now.
Actually, but the Mac games don't have a magazine, they have a newsletter.
Yeah, well, I cling to my newsletter.
I need it.
No, I'm just teasing, of course.
I'm just teasing.
All right, let's go to you guys and get your thoughts on tonight's program.
Somebody said ooh?
Ooh?
I'm gonna call in.
I'm gonna call in right now.
Have you been playing with your Wii all day long?
I have been playing with my Wii all day long.
Have you been stroking it?
Yeah.
What kinds of stuff have you been playing on your Wii?
I only picked up Zelda because of an extreme lack of fundage, but I've also been playing Wii Sports, like Chris mentioned earlier.
What do you think?
Wii Sports is fun.
It's cute.
It gets old real fast, though, because there's only so many times you can throw a ball or hit the putter or whatever.
I imagine it's got to get pretty boring if you're just playing it yourself.
Do you have friends?
Are you having group Wii fests, or have you just been playing yourself?
I'm the only one of my friends who's got a Wii.
I see.
So maybe not a lot of fun with Wii Sports when there's not a lot of people around.
Yeah, pretty much.
Well, you need to have a Wii Orgy, my friend.
I know, right?
Hey, Chris.
Yeah?
Want to come over?
Oh, yeah.
Right now.
I think you guys need to take this conversation offline, because we're going to have a lot of folks getting pretty hot about this.
What do you think about PlayStation 3 magazine?
That didn't sound too promising.
What's wrong with the PS3?
Why no love for the PS3?
Just too expensive?
Yeah.
Too expensive.
Well, I guess for me, personally, none of the games that are supposedly going to come out for it are out right now.
You know how I feel about Sony in general, so, meh.
Hey, Megzy, Megzy, what is your favorite color?
Lime green.
Yes.
Wait, wait, it says no good if you answer the question for her.
That's cheating.
No.
That's like Alex Trebek getting up there on Jeopardy and going, you know...
Your favorite color is green.
This is the capital of California.
Sacramento, answer.
I don't get it.
All right.
I know her favorite color.
Megzy, what other Wii game are you most looking forward to outside of Zelda?
Outside of Zelda, it's got to be Brawl.
Ah, Smash Bros.
Brawl.
Which character will be the first one you get your hands all over when you open up Brawl?
You know, I am still hoping that they put Geno in there from Mario RPG.
Hell yes.
He would make such a great Super Smash Bros.
character.
You know, rumor is Super Mario RPG is on its way to the virtual console, so you never know.
I heard that.
I was so excited.
I'll be very hot.
Yeah, she told me all about it.
Very hot.
All right.
Well, Maisie, any other thoughts for our listeners today?
Hey, Chris.
Chris.
What?
We totally owned those army guys down the hall.
Yes, we did.
Blink, blink, blink, blink.
I don't know.
I'll tell you later.
All right, tell me later.
Jamie says hi.
Amy!
I've got a microphone.
She heard me.
Oh, yeah, huh?
Oh, yeah, you're a host, huh?
We have a weesom.
This show is growing a vagina.
I want to be part of the weesom.
Rob, you are a vagina.
All right.
No, we have the weird-looking, horn-shaped weesom.
I have no idea what that is.
All right.
Just look at the map.
Macy, thanks for calling.
Come back to California, you hear?
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Later, babe.
Bye, baby.
Bye.
All right.
Let's go to another phone call.
We'll go to this call right here.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Who's this?
This is Ryoma.
I'm in the chat room right now.
Hi, Ryoma.
What's on your mind, buddy?
Um, I just wanted to share a story because I felt that it was very fitting, um, with all the Wii stuff going on tonight.
Okay, what's up?
Um, I have a funny story about how I got my GameCube.
Okay.
I got my GameCube off of Radio Disney.
Yes!
Wow, how did that happen?
When I was nine years old, I remembered this incredibly clearly.
I was...
Like doing some kind of math homework And I was listening to Radio Disney Because I used to have horrible taste in music And so they were saying, hey Be careful, Chris still listens to Radio Disney And you're offending her, be careful But, so anyways Wait, wait, hold on, I'm so sorry Hey, come on Chris Zippity-doo-dah, zippity-ay Oh, sorry, okay Now this show is just Turning into a preschool Sorry, Ranma, finish the story
Don't worry about it.
But so anyways, they had this thing called the code word of the day, where if you remembered it and you were like the seventh caller to Radio Disney with the code word, you would win something.
And so like November of 2000 or whenever, they were doing this promotion where every day they were selling either a GameCube or an Xbox.
So I called in and I was the seventh caller and I got a GameCube.
Well, go you.
So how does this tie into the whole Wii thing?
Does this just bring back memories?
It was just one of those crazy things where somebody was giving stuff away and it was Nintendo related.
Oh, so like everything we were doing tonight?
Yeah.
Did you enter the contest?
Yeah, I did.
Are you bitter that you didn't win?
I am very bitter.
Well, get over it.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I'm just messing with you.
You can try next time.
There might be something even better next time.
Who knows?
You can win a date with Rob.
Dude, okay, dude, hold on.
Not cool.
If he won the GameCube when he was nine, that makes him like 14 or 15 now at best.
When you're 18.
15.
Okay, wait three years.
We'll wait for you.
Anyway.
Any other appropriate thoughts for our listener, Ryoma?
Yeah, actually, I've been thinking about getting a Wii, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell my PSP.
You're going to sell your PSP to get a Wii?
Yes.
What goods do you have in your PSP?
I have nothing for my PSP.
It's actually almost a brand new PSP because I got it off of a warranty.
You know what... How much are you selling it for?
I don't know.
However much GameStop takes it for.
Hey, hey, hey, you know what...
Talk to me online, like when I get back up to Seattle, we might have to talk.
I know, you got two people here in studio that might be interested in the sale.
Rob might have bought me, might have sold me on the PSP of Luminous 2, so we'll talk.
Dude, Q Entertainment owes me money.
Oh, look at this, Chris and John are getting into a bidding war.
This might be good news for you, Ryoma.
Yes!
Alright, Ryoma, maybe you want to post about it on the forums.
Alright.
Alright, have a good one, Ryoma, thanks so much for calling.
You too.
HitStun says don't sell things to GameStop.
Loki says $130.
I had a brand new PSP and I was just curious because I got one from a work promotion thing or something and I was like okay well let me see how much they're going to take it for.
I think they said like $130.
13 or something.
They're basically going to chop the price almost in half.
Well, maybe you can get a better sale, Ryoma, but if nothing else, at least you know they'll take it.
We got another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
Who is this?
It's Ranma.
What's up, guys?
Hey, Ranma.
How you doing?
I saw your picture on Joystick today.
Sweet.
You dressed up as Luigi for the Wii launch, didn't you?
Yep.
Yeah, you know what the caption said on Joystick?
Did you see it?
No, I missed it.
Oh, you'll love this.
It said, here's a Super Mario brother.
Do you know what the funny thing is?
I was like, hey, Luigi's not black, and I'm shouting back, hey, Luigi's a Sicilian, hey!
I'm Luigi, mother... You know what?
You're just having fun with it.
Who cares if you're not... Oh my gosh, he has the wrong skin color.
You can't dress up as Barret your entire life.
I mean, it's not your fault that, you know...
You're underrepresented in video games.
You could be 90% of the roster in NBA Live.
Shut up, John.
I just tell people I just came out a little bit overdone.
There you go.
There you go.
Cosplay for the win.
Cosplay for the win.
All right, so what happened?
You were at the NYC.
Now, what happened?
Because I saw you in pictures for the Toys R Us launch, but you told me you were camped out at Nintendo World Store.
What happened?
The stores over there were closing, and I was hungry, so I walked up the street to find some soup, and next thing you know, I'm over by Toys R Us, and I'm getting raped by pictures, you know?
People are like, Louise, let me get your picture, let me get your picture!
And people are shouting, where's Mario?
And I'm saying, Mario's over at Nintendo World with two links.
Wow.
Mario was getting his link on.
So did you actually pick up the Wii last night?
No, and I'm really pissed off about that.
Not because of the fact that I didn't get a Wii, it's the fact that people were jumping the damn line at Nintendo World.
They wanted it so badly.
I mean, I went down there to go with my friends just to have fun.
I've been down there since Friday night, hanging out, having a good time, playing the Wii.
Wait, were you originally planning on getting a Wii?
Not really, because, you know, I'm getting ready to move, so, you know, a friend of mine asked me, come down, and I'm like, okay, sure.
So you were just going along for, like, moral support?
Yes.
Alright, well, that's cool.
Did you meet Reggie?
Did you meet my boss?
No, I did not.
I saw this hair.
He saw the hair.
There he is.
Oh, do we see a picture of him on Joystick?
What are you doing to that poor woman, Ranma?
Oh, there it is.
It says, Folks love this Super Mario brother.
Because you're a brother, get it?
All right.
Rob, you're going to be mad with me.
Why?
I'm going to be on G4 tomorrow.
Get up on him, traitor.
They asked for me, and I'm like, okay, sure.
I didn't know until after the fact.
Did you pimp our show?
Did you have a button on?
I had nothing.
I was just caught on right there.
No, no, no.
It's fine.
Do we really want that crowd?
I mean, people that are still watching G4, do you want those pompous asses listening to you guys?
So, Ranma, enjoy your 15 minutes.
I always do.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
Clock's tickin'.
But here's the thing, though.
I wake up getting ready to line up to get the wheeze.
I turn around.
There's like 150 people that jump in line because they have everybody lining up up against the street.
Didn't they have cops?
Didn't they have the NYPD out there?
Yeah, but cops didn't do nothing.
I mean... They should have had the LAPD.
They would have taught them a lesson.
And then...
One of the guys on the line started screaming, what the hell are you doing?
I turned around.
The guy that's number six had about three, four people jump in front of him.
I'm like, what the hell, dude?
He's like, oh, we're changing shifts.
I'm like, dude, I saw you here since Friday night.
Nobody was changing.
I want to say I saw some video on Destructoid where they actually filmed people saying they were right in the front line saying, those people right in front of us cut in front of us.
It was crazy.
That's exactly what happened.
Rama, I got to end this call.
Any other final thoughts for us?
I still have your wee Miklatov You didn't come up here this weekend to meet DMN
Well, it's not my fault that the hot guy at work asked for overtime this week, so I had to oblige him.
I hope one of your co-workers plays this for him.
I hope whatever you got from seeing him toppled your desk over.
Can you tell us his name on air?
No, I'm not going to.
But we all know now, see, if you work with Mikotov, you know that he has a crush on one of his co-workers.
No, I'll stop giving you a hard time.
What's on your mind?
I just wanted to say how amazing the Wii is.
and how much I'm big in Zelda.
You are loving the Wii and Zelda?
What's so great about Zelda in your mind?
Well, I just got to the part, and this won't spoil too much, but I got to the part where you go into the Twilight World for the first time and I was like, holy crap, it's amazing.
Even without component cables?
Yeah, it looks okay without component cables.
I will be picking them up once they come in.
I can make do with this for another month.
It's still beautiful.
What else did you pick up besides Zelda?
Anything?
Oh, I got some Wii points and I picked up Solomon's Key.
Is that what it was?
Oh yeah, Solomon's Key, yeah.
Yeah, that's the coolest game ever.
I forgot how awesome that was.
It is awesome, but it's not as awesome as SimCity, which I'm going to be picking up very soon, hopefully.
You know what?
As soon as I get a Wii Classic controller, I will be taking up SimCity because that's actually the one I'm looking forward to the most.
I'll probably lend you a GameCube controller.
Yeah, I don't have a regular GameCube controller, though.
Well, isn't that nice of Jamie to offer?
That's good.
Because I have like 50 of them.
She's offering to let you borrow a GameCube controller.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
Well, now you have a reason to come up again.
Yeah, well, I always have a reason.
I'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day, Jamie.
Shane says he'll beat all the Silent Hills for you if you just pick a day.
Tomorrow.
Thanksgiving.
I'll be up for Thanksgiving anyway.
I'm going to be gone.
I'm going to be gone during the next show.
Do you want to have Thanksgiving with us?
Well, I'm actually going to
Go have it with Extifer's family because his mom invited me.
How about that weekend?
That weekend?
Totally.
Okay, I will bring you a GameCube controller.
Not cool.
I'm going to be gone all next weekend.
I'm going to Magic Mountain before they close.
And you can play it on my TV.
Cool.
All right.
Do you want to throw one other thing in real quick?
Yes, yes.
If I could.
Okay, I'd like to say that GameStop and EB are the worst companies ever now.
Why?
What happened?
They lost my pre-order for Monkey Ball and Final Fantasy III, and they promised Wii Classic controllers today, and they did not deliver.
and I'm sick of going in there and them forcing me to, not forcing me, but pushing me to pre-order something just because I walked in the store and they sell everything $5 higher.
So, they can suck it and I hate them.
Do I have an offer for you?
We have one slightly used copy of Super Monkey Ball that is just gathering dust.
Yeah, okay.
To be GameStop's defense, it's really not their fault that they, you know, I don't know about the Lost, you know,
I don't totally blame them for that, but it's just
GameStop is only as good as the employees that work inside of it.
It's not blame the employees, it's blame the company.
I no longer have any respect at all for GameStop upper management, so they can all bite my ass.
The employees are awesome.
Upper management needs to die in a burning fire.
Left cheek or right cheek?
Both.
With a flaming corncob stuck up it.
Wait, what, Miklotov, what?
Everybody go buy Sneak King, because Sneak King is the best.
We're going to line right now.
Seriously.
I would be willing to sell you my copy of Super Monkey Ball cheap.
This show is not for you to hock your games on.
Okay, we'll talk to you when you come up next weekend.
Talk about it later, Shane.
We gotta go.
Okay.
Alright, bye.
Fine, whatever.
I gotta play Zelda.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll send you a message.
Yeah, send him a WeMail.
Exactly.
That's what somebody on LiveJournal said today.
It was WeMail.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
You friend me on the WeCons thing because we do have a thread going on in the OLR Army forum.
If you do, friend me.
I will send you a bunch of memes.
Oh, snap.
Oh, well, here we go.
Here's another call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lodge Radio.
Who's this?
Obviously, the one and only Legend of Sakurama.
Obviously.
Now, you're in New York City, too.
Are you in the midst of all that Toys R Us hype and all that crap?
I stayed home.
That's all I have to say.
You stayed home?
Why?
Are you poor, or you just didn't want to deal with it?
No, I didn't want to deal with it.
I've already seen the massive lines for the PS3 around my way.
I'd just rather just take a break Yeah, but those were quote-unquote business people Oh, yeah, the greed monsters Alright, what possessed you to call in tonight, Zagu?
You know that MTV had this little TRL thing, which wasn't even a whole segment, more like 30 seconds of just stomping on a soft pad.
I'd read the article on DDR Freak that it was going to be on MTV, because I think I teased it a little bit, saying something to the effect of, well, if DDR hasn't jumped the shark already, something to that effect.
But I don't watch crap, so I didn't watch Total Request Live.
So what happened, for those of you that didn't see it?
Good thing you didn't.
They made him play Fallout Boy and they only showed it for 30 seconds.
And from what I hear from one of the persons that actually did the thing, he told me that they had a play on Softpads.
And let me guess, it's all up on YouTube already?
No YouTube link as far as I know.
Really?
And it's a good thing because it's just not worth it.
But on the other hand, but on the flip side, it's just,
It might draw more people into DDR because if they see Fall Out Boy on a dance pad, they'll drive into it.
I don't know, it's kind of... It's basically... Some of us might not like it, but I think we're not the target of it.
The last kind of people I ever want to be involved or playing with DDR are MTV fangirls, thank you.
Alright, but think about it.
There's no need to think about it.
You don't have to... Look,
I got a real quick question, Zaku, for you, because we gotta wrap it up, because we gotta start ending this show, because we're running, like, super long tonight, but how do you feel about DDR's portrayal in the media today?
Overall.
I mean, it really depends.
Some of it might be, like, stereotypical, but on the other hand, there's not really that much of, you know, of another side to it, an alternative side, like regular hardcore players who not only play the game, but also live lives, and have, you know, and make friends out of the thing.
DDR is not just about arrow stopping.
It's about, you know, in certain ways, you meet people and you make, you know, make good and long friendships out of it.
I was going to say one other thing real quick.
Whatever happened to La Machina del Bailar or whatever that thing was, the Spanish movie about DDR?
That just randomly crossed my mind.
Whatever happened to that?
I downloaded it.
I've actually seen the movie, but I didn't hear about it.
And?
What I heard is, like, they didn't even...
I don't know, they kind of like, I wouldn't say they bastardized it, but from what I hear, they only played like the demo mode is just about, you know, the whole story was revolving about just winning this competition.
Would you say that La Machina del Bailar is to DDR what Good Burger is to fast food restaurants?
Maybe.
10K commotion in the movie.
I would say it's more like you got served.
Alright, fair enough.
Alright, Zaku, we gotta let you go.
Have a good one, buddy.
Alright, peace out.
Bye.
First off, I'd like to start by saying there's this one post on GoNintendo.com.
They actually have a picture of Adam Sessler from G4's X-Play waiting in line for a Wii because apparently his company did not hook him up.
I just thought it was funny.
To his credit, because when those shows get poopy, I don't blame the faces that you see on the TV.
No, it's not his fault.
But could it have been that he just wanted to go out there and meet some people like we did?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Anyways, so of course amongst all the chaos that was happening for the PlayStation 3, the Boston Mayor, Thomas, looks like a Molino,
is going to charge Sony for the police manpower that it took to basically bring this whole chaotic situation to order.
So I thought that was kind of funny.
WePlay has been confirmed to be coming to the U.S.
in January, according to Reggie.
And that's that one with the fun little tech demos from E3 and bundled with a
controller for $49.99, so that's pretty cool.
And then some other things, Call of Duty 3 and Tony Hawk's Project 8 for the Xbox 360 apparently aren't 720p when they say they are.
The resolution's a little bit less than that, which I think is kind of interesting.
You kind of get gypped there.
Let's see, Killzone 2's going to be shown at E3 this year, or next year I should say.
Not a big surprise there.
EA actually was interviewed by Major Nelson, one of the guys from EA, about their microtransaction policy.
It says there are places where cheat codes are free, but those are on websites, and those websites are making money by selling advertising.
They'll still be a healthy business around hint guides, magazines, and websites.
I just look at the marketplace as yet another extension of ways in which consumers are going to be able to access content they want.
To be honest though, I think that's still stupid.
Dumb excuse.
Um, let's see here.
Ken Kuduragi, um, said that he wants to release a multi-terabyte network storage system for the PlayStation 3.
And he's crazy.
Um, CompUSA apparently had a deal going where if you, um, buy a 40 inch HDTV, um, you get the reserve of PS3, which is kind of ridiculous.
Um,
Oh, the PlayStation 3.
This was the best one I read this week.
Apparently, if you do have an older TV that does not support 720p, it will not upscale the game to 1080i.
Instead, it will downscale it to 480p.
Which I thought was very interesting.
So if you have just a slightly older HDTV, you're going to get fucked on some of these upcoming games for the PlayStation 3.
And by the way, the HDMI for the PlayStation 3 doesn't like some TVs as well, which is interesting.
And then finally, a couple last ones here.
Sony's Vice President of Marketing was talking about the Crying Babies commercial that they have for the PlayStation 3 and basically saying it's like a rough shot test.
Whatever you think about the commercials, what you think about the PlayStation 3.
So I guess my take on PlayStation 3 would be I don't get it and it's slightly creepy.
Also, apparently glass tables interfere with the Wii, which makes sense.
I've noticed that with my Wii, the pointer kind of bounces around a little bit.
I could see that, I could see that.
And then finally, the last one.
Didn't you say that on the last one?
Forget it, forget it.
Shut up.
Okay, this is the very last one.
Apparently in one of the Wii lines for Toys R Us, in New York actually, there was some in-line entertainment, some debauchery as you would put it.
Apparently a nearby apartment
I had a few young girls that had taken upon themselves to entertain their line.
Oh, God.
And it says, according to some, it was quite enjoyable, but when one of them flashed the crowd, young girls became underage, or apparently underage girls, and somebody called the cops.
They were looking forward to Paris Hilton's Jewel Jam on the PS3, apparently, or whatever the F that game is that nobody cares about by Paris Hilton.
Alrighty, anything else?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Wow.
Yes?
DMN?
I motion to adjourn.
All right.
I agree.
I think it's time to wrap up the show.
We've been running very long tonight.
So thanks, of course, to all you guys who download us in the audio archive and listen to us live as well and supporting independent podcasting.
You guys are awesome.
We love you very much.
And thanks, of course, to our guests.
DMN, thank you very much for being here all the way from Seattle.
Again, thank you for having me.
I had a great time.
Chris, thank you for being here.
And, of course, thanks again for...
Horring Out Orange Lingerie the way you did last night.
No problem.
I enjoyed it.
Thanks for having me on.
No problem.
And of course, thanks to my fellow co-hosts as always.
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
We'll start with our guests.
DMN, your final thought.
I'm hungry.
Chris, your final thought.
I'm not hungry.
I just had a donut.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Getting a migraine towards the end of the show is not good.
My final thought is I have way too much leftover orange soda.
Cry.
Loki.
I don't want any more orange soda.
I've already had four cans of it and that's... More orange soda.
Alright, thanks once again everybody for tuning in to us and supporting us.
You guys rock.
Oh, next week on Orange Launch Radio, I do not believe we're going to be live.
Did we already talk about that?
We're not going to be live during the holiday
