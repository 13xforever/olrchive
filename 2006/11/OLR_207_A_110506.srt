00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:25,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and are HD movies coming to the Xbox Marketplace?

2
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:37,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,343
[SPEAKER_05]: We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming related.

4
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:44,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Culture, Gaming Lifestyle, etc.

5
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:10,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, you redid the hair, though.

6
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this new hairstyle.

7
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:13,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my hair is pretty now.

8
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:17,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We need the new promo pics for OLR, because you have way different hair now, and I've got the facial hair.

9
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:24,279
[SPEAKER_00]: The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very curly.

10
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I straightened my hair, and it's cherry red and black.

11
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll tell you what, chat room.

12
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:34,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone earlier.

13
00:01:35,624 --> 00:01:37,085
[SPEAKER_00]: And hooray for being vulgar and offensive.

14
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:37,665
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

15
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: VULGAR AND OFFENSIVE

16
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:08,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XBStream.

17
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:13,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program, and through iTunes we're always getting new people.

18
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:17,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because of it.

19
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:23,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact with...

20
00:02:25,094 --> 00:02:54,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot So yeah, every now and then we do this annual sales conferencing with the game publishers And they bring us free stuff Not so much this year though, they didn't bring us as much free stuff Poor baby Yeah, I did get a free shirt from Eidos, so for just cause And Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda shirt Or like a communist propaganda shirt, that's what it looks like

21
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,035
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an interesting shirt.

22
00:02:56,095 --> 00:03:00,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.

23
00:03:01,619 --> 00:03:01,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

24
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's just me.

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just crazy.

26
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:07,857
[SPEAKER_05]: In all seriousness, we have no guest right now.

27
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:14,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Miklatov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show people that hang out here at the apartment.

28
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,343
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

29
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on chat.

30
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:22,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar and offensive.

31
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.

32
00:03:25,347 --> 00:03:27,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they love it.

33
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:31,591
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.

34
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you will see it in a few.

35
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:34,833
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

36
00:03:34,853 --> 00:03:35,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

37
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:44,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.

38
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:47,347
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

39
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:47,847
[SPEAKER_05]: We always do.

40
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

41
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:53,150
[SPEAKER_00]: My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.

42
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.

43
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get new games today.

44
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I got...

45
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,859
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the name of that game again?

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,860
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was... I can't believe I can't... I forgot the name of it already.

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, Trauma Sensor Under the Knife.

48
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:19,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I can, you know, cut into people and be the uber surgeon.

49
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:32,624
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.

50
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,423
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

51
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get back and, you know, because she picked up my trauma center at the time, which I need to sort of pay her back for.

52
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:14,837
[SPEAKER_00]: But she hands me the bag, and it's heavy.

53
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:16,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?

54
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,999
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she starts running out the door.

55
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, my God.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.

57
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:22,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot.

58
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:24,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, whatever.

59
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:29,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And then don't let me forget during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's Witness I own today.

60
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's very nice, though, of, you know,

61
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:33,474
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very nice of her.

62
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,655
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a very sweet friend.

63
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:34,915
[SPEAKER_00]: She is.

64
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:35,635
[SPEAKER_00]: She's very good.

65
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,535
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could, I would do all the same for her.

66
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm making her a special Christmas present.

67
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:39,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.

68
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:41,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making it with finger paints.

69
00:05:43,237 --> 00:05:44,157
[SPEAKER_05]: How four years old of you.

70
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:44,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

71
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:45,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

72
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay.

73
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally got that to work.

74
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.

75
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:02,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.

76
00:06:03,314 --> 00:06:32,121
[SPEAKER_04]: and then of course I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this and none of them have covered multiplayer very well and because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is and why they did a lot of things badly for one

77
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:43,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice City or Vice City Stories will know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.

78
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,222
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.

79
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that in mind, the multiplayer I was really surprised because they had six different maps to choose from.

80
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:57,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least that's what I thought that meant.

81
00:06:57,644 --> 00:07:02,445
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points

82
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,380
[SPEAKER_04]: on the same map.

83
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:17,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks because when you're playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.

84
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.

85
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:28,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead and let everyone run around the full map.

86
00:07:29,058 --> 00:07:30,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that sucks right there.

87
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

88
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:54,388
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

89
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:15,888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

90
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:52,224
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they spawn about 50 miles away, so you'll never get to the power-up anyways.

91
00:08:53,064 --> 00:09:02,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except the Hunter controls are crap, but I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around in the helicopter.

92
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But multiplayer is pretty good overall.

93
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,173
[SPEAKER_04]: If they had only made the maps a little bit smaller, hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better.

94
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, you know...

95
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:16,257
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid.

96
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff.

97
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,260
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

98
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Some comments from our chat room.

99
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:24,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Zappy seems to agree with you.

100
00:09:25,202 --> 00:09:26,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Bleh, Vice City is meh.

101
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:27,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Same old GTA.

102
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:30,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you.

103
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think having the full map and multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.

104
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:33,846
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

105
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:37,908
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelaunchradio.com Trust me, I play multiplayer every single day.

106
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not make it more fun because you have to... Say, for example, you're playing a 13-minute game.

107
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,431
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to spend a lot of time getting to where the other people are.

108
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:51,554
[SPEAKER_04]: They also retweaked the weapons and how much damage they do.

109
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the remote grenades, which used to be really devastating.

110
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:56,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody.

111
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:57,418
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

112
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes like four of them to blow up somebody.

113
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,144
[SPEAKER_04]: And before, you can get hit from one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome.

114
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:06,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

115
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:08,466
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like how they retweaked everything.

116
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:11,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really wish they had thought more about the multiplayer stuff.

117
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:34,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute but they really if they're going to put multiplayer in the game at least spend some time actually working out the tweaks working out the bugs in it because all those same bugs that were there in the first one are still there in this one so obviously they weren't working very well you know on this and we're going to probably beta test them more than they did

118
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:36,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't they fucking consult me?

119
00:10:36,905 --> 00:10:37,945
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

120
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:45,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played this game more than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet they do not consult me when it comes to their multiplayer in their game.

121
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:50,155
[SPEAKER_04]: I can at least give them some simple advice like, maybe put an option where you can turn off the power-ups.

122
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:51,136
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be smart.

123
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: No one cares what you think, Loki.

124
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,500
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just some dumb podcaster, amateur...

125
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Internet Journalist.

126
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:00,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories.

127
00:11:00,612 --> 00:11:01,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I will fucking kick your ass.

128
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:02,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody.

129
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,873
[SPEAKER_04]: In the face of the world, anybody.

130
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:05,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I will beat them down.

131
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,494
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games.

132
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:11,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I would kick their ass.

133
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:11,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

134
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:12,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong words there.

135
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:13,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Challenge to anybody.

136
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:14,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Strong words there.

137
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:18,295
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're just begging for an ass kicking with a statement like that.

138
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:19,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, I'm not.

139
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:20,496
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

140
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it for your gaming week?

141
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:23,520
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

142
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,478
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

143
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:17,217
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, graphics are only so much of a game, so that's really a minor bitch, all things considered.

144
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:23,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series, in my opinion.

145
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:26,507
[SPEAKER_05]: But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.

146
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,808
[SPEAKER_05]: The game is fabulous.

147
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:30,871
[SPEAKER_05]: The combat system is genius.

148
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,474
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo doesn't give...

149
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,895
[SPEAKER_05]: you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.

150
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:47,801
[SPEAKER_05]: The combat system is great because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final Fantasy XI except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want and you don't have to put up with retards.

151
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:48,401
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

152
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:48,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

153
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So the combat system is brilliant.

154
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:51,802
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

155
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:56,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's probably going to turn off some old school fans of the Final Fantasy series but it's a nice change.

156
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's great.

157
00:12:57,965 --> 00:12:59,326
[SPEAKER_05]: The characters are awesome.

158
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,127
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is awesome and

159
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:10,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great, and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.

160
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:16,962
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story, because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but

161
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy VII

162
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,677
[SPEAKER_05]: and I guess he got a prize for it.

163
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:50,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever.

164
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,501
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it was kind of anticlimactic.

165
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:54,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook.

166
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, I have a game.

167
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:56,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I have GameFAQs.

168
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:57,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The guidebook is sexy.

169
00:13:57,908 --> 00:14:01,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the guidebook looks nice, but I just, I couldn't justify paying the money for it.

170
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, when GameFAQs.com is available.

171
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:03,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

172
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:06,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I can say.

173
00:14:07,507 --> 00:14:10,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Ranma in our chatroom says Gambits and License is crap.

174
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:11,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.

175
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: The License board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambits is really what makes the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.

176
00:14:21,075 --> 00:14:24,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the Gambits is basically... For those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambits system basically...

177
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,679
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

178
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:52,277
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority.

179
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:55,217
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.

180
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:59,738
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.

181
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:02,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she will automatically cure silence.

182
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,159
[SPEAKER_05]: She'll automatically cure poison.

183
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:07,519
[SPEAKER_05]: Then her priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.

184
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, under that, the logic is that she casts protect on my main character, Vaan, who I use as my main character right now.

185
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:15,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

186
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:22,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like, so it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle, so she's not wasting MP.

187
00:15:22,253 --> 00:15:24,033
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great, so you can kind of play with this.

188
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:27,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic available to you.

189
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:32,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, for instance, you start with, like, only a few commands, like, hit points below 70%.

190
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:37,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have to buy that.

191
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:41,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you want to get, like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.

192
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,098
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's kind of interesting, the way that all works.

193
00:15:44,158 --> 00:15:45,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I kind of think it's cool.

194
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:46,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.

195
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:48,492
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion.

196
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,893
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the game is great.

197
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.

198
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a 9.9 out of 10.

199
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's wonderful.

200
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,401
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get it.

201
00:15:56,481 --> 00:16:03,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you don't like RPGs usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in this will get you into it.

202
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:03,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

203
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,691
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my thoughts.

204
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:13,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but I realized that... I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.

205
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:14,748
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

206
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo didn't do it justice because it didn't show you the depth of it.

207
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:23,274
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like, run up to a monster and rely on the auto-attack thing and maybe use the magic.

208
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:24,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't do it justice.

209
00:16:24,676 --> 00:16:25,076
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like...

210
00:16:25,556 --> 00:16:26,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the stupid thing off the screen.

211
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I want my cutscene.

212
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:31,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.

213
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:32,981
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I meant, though?

214
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:34,082
[SPEAKER_00]: I meant the cut to battle.

215
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:34,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

216
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,364
[SPEAKER_00]: The battle screen, I guess.

217
00:16:36,384 --> 00:16:38,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's interesting because it means you have no random battles.

218
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:40,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasies.

219
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:43,929
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, God damn it, I need to get to a save point because I need to go.

220
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,750
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you had.

221
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,612
[SPEAKER_05]: You're walking towards a save point and then...

222
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:55,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.

223
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.

224
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:59,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.

225
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:00,159
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

226
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,220
[SPEAKER_05]: But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.

227
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is one other kind of minor.

228
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:07,723
[SPEAKER_05]: You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.

229
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:09,924
[SPEAKER_05]: The areas are massive.

230
00:17:11,404 --> 00:17:12,165
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same with X.

231
00:17:13,504 --> 00:17:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say was like the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie?

232
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:19,308
[SPEAKER_05]: When you played Final Fantasy XI, what was the worst thing about it?

233
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:20,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a white mage.

234
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:28,515
[SPEAKER_05]: See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.

235
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,176
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you set the gamuts and they do it.

236
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.

237
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.

238
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:36,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one yells at you to cure them.

239
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll just die.

240
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

241
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:41,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger.

242
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:44,143
[SPEAKER_00]: without Toriyama's artwork.

243
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:30,711
[SPEAKER_05]: so no other games for me to review this week and probably for the next few weeks there won't be a lot that I'm playing although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents and I did go to we were at the mall today and of course I had to look to see if they had Luminous 2 because I still kind of want it even if I am a little even if I am a little bit like see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week I got mixed up so I have to wait for Tuesday but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous right now because the Xbox one was not all that I still really want Luminous 2 and somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week and you know

244
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:32,512
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

245
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:56,859
[SPEAKER_05]: or maybe somebody will get married or they'll have a baby.

246
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Something really big happens.

247
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:05,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey, maybe we'll get involved in November Sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.

248
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,163
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight we have a surprise for you guys.

249
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:09,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something we've been hinting at for a little while.

250
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:17,328
[SPEAKER_05]: But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes or XBStream or however you're doing it,

251
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:23,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is actually a live streaming radio station, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

252
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:29,750
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then, you know, broadcasted over the MP3s.

253
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,771
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have live-only shows that air throughout the week.

254
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:35,652
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, Tuesday night, DarkSakura does her Pump Up the Volume.

255
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just her, and she plays some indie band music for you guys.

256
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:44,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is kind of about pop culture stuff.

257
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:49,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.

258
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:50,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go to the tape.

259
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to listen to me?

260
00:19:59,736 --> 00:20:01,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do, then I should warn you.

261
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:06,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you do, I should warn you.

262
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:08,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to hear all sorts of things.

263
00:20:09,837 --> 00:20:10,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Hits from the past.

264
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:12,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap from the future.

265
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis Donovan Live, coming to Orange Lounge Radio

266
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:37,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio

267
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:04,521
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

268
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching.

269
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:22,937
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next time.

270
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:51,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Halo 3 Halo 3 Halo 3

271
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:38,582
[SPEAKER_04]: With such a date like this, you have to kind of wonder, okay, well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, you know, we haven't gotten, according to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement.

272
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:46,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Microsoft hasn't made an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside Microsoft, March 14th.

273
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:51,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes sense, because that's when the big games came out last year.

274
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:56,304
[SPEAKER_04]: March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies, including Microsoft.

275
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,768
[SPEAKER_04]: So, March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo.

276
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:04,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.

277
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:05,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now wait a minute.

278
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:08,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing you're saying there.

279
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, let's look at the evidence and why, you know, because most people are assuming that Christmas window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3.

280
00:23:17,186 --> 00:23:23,370
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we've had several, like, random things pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?

281
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:28,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I remember a few episodes ago you had the marketing folks that came to your work and they told you spring, right?

282
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:29,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this wasn't the marketing guy.

283
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,516
[SPEAKER_04]: This is their head of sales at Microsoft.

284
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:35,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember his name.

285
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:35,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say Dave.

286
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:42,181
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, he said March or April was the target date for Halo.

287
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:54,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And this makes sense because, you know, how would you love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really good.

288
00:23:56,448 --> 00:24:00,791
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways, Halo Wars.

289
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:03,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.

290
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:05,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

291
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:08,232
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's interesting?

292
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:16,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, when you posted this in the show role thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different source, let's just say I have a friend.

293
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you all hate these friend of a friend things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place, right?

294
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,382
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain company.

295
00:24:26,742 --> 00:24:33,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Large Magazine Company, who's had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to be spring of 07.

296
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course it's going to be spring of 07.

297
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, and I would think this makes very good sense.

298
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:45,609
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be February, because I thought originally it might be February or something like that, but February's usually dead.

299
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:52,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of still that dead point from December to March, where nothing really comes out.

300
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:52,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

301
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:54,139
[SPEAKER_04]: E.A.

302
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:54,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Replay 2 E.A.

303
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:54,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Replay 2

304
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:29,516
[SPEAKER_04]: MVP07, NCAA Baseball, also that same date.

305
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:39,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, Two Worlds for Xbox 360, which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th.

306
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of good stuff.

307
00:25:42,781 --> 00:25:48,624
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, Home Court, but I think the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.

308
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,505
[SPEAKER_04]: But fun stuff.

309
00:25:51,065 --> 00:25:51,325
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

310
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:55,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?

311
00:25:56,134 --> 00:25:57,616
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I saw it on a blog somewhere.

312
00:25:58,237 --> 00:25:58,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

313
00:25:58,958 --> 00:25:59,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting.

314
00:25:59,598 --> 00:26:02,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have that pre-ordered because I want that for my desk.

315
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:04,204
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

316
00:26:05,222 --> 00:26:06,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that turns out to be true.

317
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:09,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of signs point to that.

318
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:15,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3?

319
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

320
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:19,594
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot of things that kind of make that look probable.

321
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we might be wrong.

322
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:24,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.

323
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,960
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong.

324
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,223
[SPEAKER_04]: There are delay issues for different reasons.

325
00:26:30,263 --> 00:26:31,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just like, you know...

326
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:35,065
[SPEAKER_05]: or folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray.

327
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:42,727
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, if these magazines are getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate to me the game is pretty close to completion.

328
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:43,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

329
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing about it, though.

330
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:53,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one seems to pay attention to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big chunks.

331
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,691
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the spring releases, which take place mostly in March.

332
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,752
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

333
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:33,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for the holiday season, you've still got your Halo Wars that you can also push out there as well.

334
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:36,646
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're covered in both sections of the year.

335
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:38,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, that makes sense to me.

336
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,190
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

337
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see you all in time.

338
00:27:58,383 --> 00:27:58,864
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

339
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:32,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong But what's interesting, Japan is getting some exclusives They are the only ones that are getting Gradius And what's very interesting, I think, is that they're the only ones getting Super Mario Bros.

340
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:36,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So, kind of strange there Oh, also, how could I forget this one?

341
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:48,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Solomon's Key I played that game a lot I think those are launch games I thought it was until the end of the year I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than us And I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for us

342
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:50,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

343
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:52,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Europe is getting some games that we're not either.

344
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:53,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

345
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:57,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that, I don't know, it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.

346
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:58,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, alright.

347
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:04,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey Kong Country, but the other two regions are.

348
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:16,845
[SPEAKER_05]: All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and SimCity, but then Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra 3, Super Castlevania 4, Street Fighter 2, and Zelda A Link to the Past.

349
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:22,087
[SPEAKER_05]: The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.

350
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:26,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go over to Sega Genesis and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.

351
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same game anyway.

352
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:46,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Sonic the Hedgehog, ToeJam & Earl The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?

353
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:51,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was the one with the dog That game was freaking awesome But yet there's no Shinobi listed, that's kind of weird

354
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:53,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Shadow Dancer was a better game.

355
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:54,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, whatever.

356
00:29:55,235 --> 00:30:09,562
[SPEAKER_05]: On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions getting Bonks Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and Superstar Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman 94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.

357
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:14,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Victory Run, not coming to the U.S., but is coming to Japan.

358
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:18,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, not going to Europe, but is going to Japan and the U.S., so.

359
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also going, where's Dracula X?

360
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:46,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.

361
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:57,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the one in Japan, so... Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, you know, while they're looking at the... And they could easily encode it, you know, memory storage being what it is now.

362
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:07,509
[SPEAKER_00]: They could easily move a whole CD game into... Because the thing that took up the most room on those discs was the Red Book Audio.

363
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.

364
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?

365
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:18,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia.

366
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:19,336
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.

367
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so that's all I've got to say on the Virtual Console.

368
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got news.

369
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.

370
00:31:35,164 --> 00:31:44,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.

371
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:50,256
[SPEAKER_00]: In the magazine it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.

372
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,717
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a typo.

373
00:31:53,137 --> 00:31:56,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they went back and Nintendo themselves said that.

374
00:31:57,298 --> 00:32:11,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released at launch in the UK.

375
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,002
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should have no problem getting that.

376
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:14,342
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't have to import that.

377
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:18,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty cool.

378
00:32:19,368 --> 00:32:21,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are some other secrets out there.

379
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:28,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us some high def later on or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy.

380
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Who says they can't?

381
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:36,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft upgraded their display output, so why not?

382
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:37,676
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do stuff.

383
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:39,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's just not their thing.

384
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:40,858
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not their thing right now.

385
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:48,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher can say, I want to make my game 720, damn it!

386
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,441
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

387
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:51,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

388
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:57,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's some other stuff released this week, actually, about the Virtual Console.

389
00:32:57,207 --> 00:33:01,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.

390
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,573
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be interesting to find out, actually, that

391
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:13,996
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to store your games to the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.

392
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:23,840
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, where you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your Mario Brothers there.

393
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:32,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can, however, re-download the games, kind of typical with Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.

394
00:33:33,673 --> 00:34:01,470
[SPEAKER_04]: and um some interesting stuff they're talking about how the virtual console stuff you'll be able to use um the standard Wii Remote actually for NES games by turning it on its side which you know ever since I saw that Wii Remote and they announced the virtual console I knew they were going to be able to do that and as well as using the GameCube pads also if you don't want to spend money on the uh classic controller you can use that as well so that's kind of neat and um

395
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

396
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:06,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all about the information that they have on that.

397
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments regarding high definition from our chatroom.

398
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:13,090
[SPEAKER_05]: PooEater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.

399
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:19,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I could give a crap less about $1,296,000,000 or whatever.

400
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.

401
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:24,094
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.

402
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:25,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of neat.

403
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:26,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that is kind of neat.

404
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:28,776
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like the iTunes books you get.

405
00:34:29,941 --> 00:34:38,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there something a while ago about how Nintendo totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming type thing?

406
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:41,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.

407
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Sony?

408
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:42,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

409
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody wanted to use iTunes as a model?

410
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:49,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.

411
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,218
[SPEAKER_04]: My bad, I got it mixed up then.

412
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:54,110
[SPEAKER_05]: and DarkSakura.com

413
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:28,944
[SPEAKER_05]: and it shows in the sound options menu that there's an SD card option in the menu and so it's being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as custom soundtracks in the game.

414
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:42,749
[SPEAKER_05]: No official word from Nintendo just yet, but this screenshot sure does make things look interesting and since Nintendo has said that there's still some secrets yet to be revealed, this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.

415
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:44,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

416
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:45,329
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be kind of neat.

417
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:50,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to use custom soundtracks on 360, unless I'm playing DDR or something.

418
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:50,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh wait, no, just kidding.

419
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:51,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't play DDR on 360.

420
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:56,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that, because that kind of would break the game.

421
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:59,758
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.

422
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:10,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of a character in Super Smash Bros.

423
00:36:10,926 --> 00:36:11,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Brawl.

424
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:12,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox McCloud is showing up.

425
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:19,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I can tell, I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.

426
00:36:20,283 --> 00:36:27,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time zero suit.

427
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:33,211
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Solid Snake and Wario.

428
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I am going to have that game so fast.

429
00:36:39,778 --> 00:36:42,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I was kind of disappointed that they didn't announce something new.

430
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,861
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we've had Fox before.

431
00:36:44,881 --> 00:36:46,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in every single game.

432
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:47,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but, I mean, okay, big deal.

433
00:36:47,963 --> 00:36:51,045
[SPEAKER_05]: They gave them a staff this time, so... Ooh, staff!

434
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:53,267
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.

435
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so they gave us a crappy game, Fox.

436
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:59,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you for reminding us that they made that game.

437
00:36:59,331 --> 00:36:59,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

438
00:37:02,934 --> 00:37:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.

439
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:14,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We were hoping to... Well, I know you didn't plan it, Jamie, but... I was like, I didn't think that story... We did that on purpose.

440
00:37:14,883 --> 00:37:17,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the game anyway, but I personally don't care about Fox News.

441
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:23,749
[SPEAKER_05]: We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character... Because they've said that there are going to be other third-party characters.

442
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:28,512
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi.

443
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't see that coming.

444
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:32,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Raiden to be in it.

445
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:33,753
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be funny.

446
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:42,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Our new secret character is... A defective NES card where you have to blow on it.

447
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:44,699
[SPEAKER_00]: The new fighter is Pantsless Rage.

448
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:45,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

449
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

450
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:47,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

451
00:37:48,702 --> 00:38:00,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week, in fact, in the form of an episode of South Park where Cartman's actually waiting for the Wii to come out at... It was quite funny.

452
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:01,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And a...

453
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:02,077
[SPEAKER_04]: E.L.

454
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:02,237
[SPEAKER_04]: or E.B.

455
00:38:30,305 --> 00:38:31,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried.

456
00:38:31,326 --> 00:38:35,107
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried the last... I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal.

457
00:38:35,388 --> 00:38:39,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the last minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up.

458
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I about cried.

459
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so funny.

460
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,011
[SPEAKER_00]: This is making me laugh.

461
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:47,613
[SPEAKER_00]: GS68 in the chatroom says a new secret character, Ken Kudaragi.

462
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:48,834
[SPEAKER_00]: He wields a crayon sword.

463
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:51,255
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't.

464
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:51,915
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to eat it.

465
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:53,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Cartman's the secret character.

466
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:54,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?

467
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:55,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the joke.

468
00:38:55,983 --> 00:39:10,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that would probably be the big joke.

469
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:14,054
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.

470
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:23,080
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty funny.

471
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So, anyway.

472
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:27,029
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

473
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,461
[SPEAKER_05]: GameCube component cables

474
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:17,188
[SPEAKER_05]: in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will component cables be available on day one?

475
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Kaplan said, yes, at retail and online.

476
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:24,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com if you still want to go the online route.

477
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:31,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing to lattes.

478
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't get that, but whatever.

479
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:37,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.

480
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,695
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes me very happy.

481
00:40:41,593 --> 00:40:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: She's insane.

482
00:40:42,554 --> 00:40:43,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make you a happy panda?

483
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:44,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

484
00:40:45,715 --> 00:40:47,296
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a crazy, crazy person.

485
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:48,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

486
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:50,918
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell was that?

487
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:57,322
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.

488
00:40:57,342 --> 00:41:03,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I love Gnarl Sparkly as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing that damn song every time I open up my AIM.

489
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:04,966
[SPEAKER_05]: You must not like them very much because I don't like them.

490
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:09,028
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.

491
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:10,489
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Danger Mouse.

492
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:22,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play sounds when you don't expect it to, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.

493
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:24,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Frightening.

494
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:25,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool!

495
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:26,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Silent Hill 5, finally?

496
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:28,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Confirmation?

497
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:28,880
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

498
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,005
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Otonari Yoku, which means adult power.

499
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:37,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Adult Power, huh?

500
00:41:37,168 --> 00:41:38,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So is this one of, like, those games?

501
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:43,833
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a self-help guide to improving your relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.

502
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Boring!

503
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:56,262
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin'... I don't have... It's gonna sell like... Not in this country.

504
00:41:56,702 --> 00:41:57,083
[SPEAKER_00]: In Japan.

505
00:41:58,284 --> 00:41:59,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like, five people will import it.

506
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:01,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And go, I can't read Japanese!

507
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:05,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?

508
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:07,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.

509
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, kind of like how he feels like... He's scared us from here.

510
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:22,271
[SPEAKER_05]: He feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know, like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.

511
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,052
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell do you do in adult training?

512
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:30,615
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that it'll do, like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, sirens go off, the world gets dark.

513
00:42:31,156 --> 00:42:34,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends.

514
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:38,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what exactly is going to be trained in this game?

515
00:42:40,177 --> 00:42:45,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's accidental.

516
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:46,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, I crapped my pants.

517
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not a good comparison.

518
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:51,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonsense.

519
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,607
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about control.

520
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,149
[SPEAKER_00]: The thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.

521
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult, never mind, forget it.

522
00:43:00,532 --> 00:43:03,074
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, I was going to ask for Saturday Night Live.

523
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, I crapped my pants.

524
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:05,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind, forget it.

525
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:06,617
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.

526
00:43:08,238 --> 00:43:12,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for elementary school kids.

527
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:15,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in America.

528
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:17,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So that everyone gets good manners.

529
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:21,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.

530
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:22,789
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

531
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,971
[SPEAKER_00]: I have really good freaking manners, okay?

532
00:43:25,632 --> 00:43:26,832
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so polite.

533
00:43:27,713 --> 00:43:33,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold the doors open for people, I smile and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when I think they're being retards.

534
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,720
[SPEAKER_05]: You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.

535
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:36,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I did!

536
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:37,741
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I'm nice!

537
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:40,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the nicest person.

538
00:44:01,736 --> 00:44:09,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?

539
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything possible.

540
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:14,483
[SPEAKER_04]: They are shipping it by any means possible.

541
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:19,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name it.

542
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:20,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Horseback?

543
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:22,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

544
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Little immigrants too, pulling the crates, you know.

545
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so any means necessary.

546
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:31,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a huge surprise, but it's nice to

547
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:32,841
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

548
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:56,197
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, Miklatov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit because you have certain fears you've expressed to me before.

549
00:44:56,678 --> 00:45:01,141
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you feel if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?

550
00:45:01,542 --> 00:45:03,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I would cry because I hate UPS.

551
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS.

552
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:08,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You've told me you have a fear of UPS.

553
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:09,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit of both.

554
00:45:09,828 --> 00:45:10,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all from high school.

555
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us your fears.

556
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:13,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my fears?

557
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, UPS, water, sheep.

558
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:18,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Flying Bugs.

559
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:19,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so water, sheep, and flying bugs.

560
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:27,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a UPS man ever delivered you a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.

561
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:30,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I would probably just die on the spot.

562
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:30,960
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like Silent Hill to you.

563
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so why the UPS fear?

564
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:34,461
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with video games.

565
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:35,502
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I'm curious.

566
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:36,902
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like...

567
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:51,995
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in high school, my bus stop was next to UPS Center, and I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.

568
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:56,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get much more stupid than I have.

569
00:45:56,858 --> 00:45:58,960
[SPEAKER_00]: What would that be, Universal Pwnage Service?

570
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:01,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I just hate them, and they frighten me.

571
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:07,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought maybe like a UPS man beat you up once or something.

572
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:11,593
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop watching all the trucks go by.

573
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:14,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part was it was apparently next to a UPS center.

574
00:46:15,217 --> 00:46:16,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know that, but I still figured.

575
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:19,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.

576
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:20,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Show me on the doll.

577
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:20,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowhere.

578
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:23,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.

579
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Usagi in our chatroom agrees UPS is the spawn of Satan.

580
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:31,683
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had a problem with UPS.

581
00:46:31,903 --> 00:46:32,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate them.

582
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,885
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.

583
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:36,545
[SPEAKER_05]: No such thing.

584
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:36,966
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

585
00:46:37,046 --> 00:46:40,167
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're attractive... At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

586
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:41,408
[SPEAKER_05]: This is years before my current job.

587
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

588
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:47,171
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're hot, that means they're really evil.

589
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:49,112
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

590
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.

591
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:52,862
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I said.

592
00:46:53,002 --> 00:46:53,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know.

593
00:46:53,983 --> 00:47:02,870
[SPEAKER_05]: If people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can listen to.

594
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:06,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would you listen to fears about insects and sheep and water?

595
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:07,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

596
00:47:07,634 --> 00:47:14,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to do with gaming.

597
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, you're going to make me cry.

598
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,183
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I cry, I get stabby.

599
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:21,663
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.

600
00:47:21,783 --> 00:47:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, they're close enough.

601
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:23,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Did goats scare you?

602
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:26,707
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I haven't been... What about llamas?

603
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:27,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Llamas, no.

604
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:30,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, no, I'm really ready to get back in the game now.

605
00:47:30,189 --> 00:47:33,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Llamas have to do with Tempest, so there you go.

606
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:34,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Where were llamas in Tempest?

607
00:47:35,072 --> 00:47:37,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that one guy that makes Tempest something to do with a llama?

608
00:47:37,934 --> 00:47:39,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here.

609
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:40,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, no, I have a question.

610
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:43,898
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?

611
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that they deserve to buy things.

612
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:47,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

613
00:47:47,879 --> 00:47:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.

614
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.

615
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:56,781
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

616
00:47:57,141 --> 00:48:03,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

617
00:48:03,623 --> 00:48:07,144
[SPEAKER_05]: If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.

618
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Best Buy employees aren't shut out.

619
00:48:10,402 --> 00:48:11,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Circuit City and CompUSA

620
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:34,313
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

621
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:02,770
[SPEAKER_05]: or Kmart.

622
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart.

623
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:06,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And with good reason.

624
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:10,635
[SPEAKER_05]: But Kmart, I'm telling you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.

625
00:49:10,935 --> 00:49:11,315
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

626
00:49:11,355 --> 00:49:14,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to camp out for a PlayStation 3.

627
00:49:15,357 --> 00:49:16,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't either because I'm not getting one.

628
00:49:17,218 --> 00:49:18,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.

629
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:28,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to know what's funny is that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else because our credit card was special.

630
00:49:29,346 --> 00:49:32,467
[SPEAKER_05]: But speaking of special... Actually, I wanted to say real quick.

631
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:32,887
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

632
00:49:33,248 --> 00:49:40,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Neologism, totally mispronouncing his name, 82, says Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.

633
00:49:41,131 --> 00:49:42,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.

634
00:49:43,912 --> 00:49:44,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So what does it matter?

635
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:48,354
[SPEAKER_00]: But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, Ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.

636
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:48,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.

637
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,335
[SPEAKER_00]: You open your mouth.

638
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,736
[SPEAKER_05]: If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.

639
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.

640
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,720
[SPEAKER_05]: You better back that up.

641
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:58,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to the one on How.

642
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.

643
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:04,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.

644
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:05,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Never mind, forget it.

645
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,623
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was actually, I was like, oh, Rob is being clever.

646
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:08,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to me.

647
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:09,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.

648
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:10,523
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the JV show.

649
00:50:10,803 --> 00:50:16,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on, there's still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?

650
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:17,405
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I'm going to.

651
00:50:17,525 --> 00:50:18,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that's the ticket.

652
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:19,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Go there.

653
00:50:20,305 --> 00:50:21,686
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not on Antelope, it's Auburn.

654
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:23,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever, whatever, anyway.

655
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, here's your Sacramento direction thing.

656
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:32,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well, back to the PS3.

657
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate you, Best Buy, you bitches.

658
00:50:37,086 --> 00:50:40,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I really don't hate any... Okay, I will rephrase that.

659
00:50:40,586 --> 00:50:43,427
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.

660
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:46,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.

661
00:50:47,332 --> 00:50:53,454
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3 and they're not doing anything for the Wii.

662
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:54,594
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why?

663
00:50:54,654 --> 00:50:55,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Nintendo loves us.

664
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,195
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.

665
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,676
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are 18 stores total.

666
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be in these cities.

667
00:51:04,616 --> 00:51:05,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Park Lane, Texas.

668
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:09,097
[SPEAKER_00]: West Los Angeles, California.

669
00:51:09,617 --> 00:51:10,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Chesterfield.

670
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:11,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that... Is M.O.

671
00:51:11,498 --> 00:51:11,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana?

672
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:12,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

673
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:14,179
[SPEAKER_05]: No, M.O.

674
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:14,619
[SPEAKER_05]: is Missouri.

675
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:14,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Missouri.

676
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:15,819
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I thought that.

677
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:43,076
[SPEAKER_00]: El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria, Texas, Butterfield, Illinois, West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York,

678
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Landmark Massachusetts, and Midtown Manhattan.

679
00:51:49,013 --> 00:51:50,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously kids, why bother though?

680
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:51,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Why bother?

681
00:51:51,615 --> 00:51:51,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Because...

682
00:51:52,797 --> 00:52:06,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games all day long that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can I get Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.

683
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:08,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're screwed.

684
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:09,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So why bother?

685
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:14,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing it, people are going to be driving in from far away.

686
00:52:15,195 --> 00:52:16,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody is going to beat you to it.

687
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:17,937
[SPEAKER_05]: So I say why bother?

688
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:25,487
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.

689
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:29,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Just go to any big blog you look at.

690
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:29,830
[SPEAKER_05]: They all have the list.

691
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:34,732
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.

692
00:52:36,493 --> 00:52:38,634
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.

693
00:52:38,754 --> 00:52:39,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun waiting in line.

694
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:41,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I don't know.

695
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid?

696
00:52:48,103 --> 00:52:49,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, wait for PlayStation 3.

697
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:50,385
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can make fun of them.

698
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:51,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we really got to do that?

699
00:52:51,665 --> 00:52:53,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, everybody else says that.

700
00:52:54,107 --> 00:53:00,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, that's like reporting on the fucking groundhog, you know, and seeing his shadow or not.

701
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:01,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's just retarded.

702
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:04,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone to steal it.

703
00:53:05,153 --> 00:53:06,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a good idea for a parody.

704
00:53:06,754 --> 00:53:09,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, to answer questions from the chat room, um, uh,

705
00:53:10,014 --> 00:53:19,277
[SPEAKER_00]: The Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is $6.09, and the Midtown one is $10.28, so that you can look online and see what stores those are.

706
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:19,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

707
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:22,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I just whispered my parody to Loki.

708
00:53:22,258 --> 00:53:22,638
[SPEAKER_05]: You like that?

709
00:53:23,138 --> 00:53:23,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

710
00:53:23,518 --> 00:53:25,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to do that instead, okay?

711
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:25,559
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

712
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:26,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.

713
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:29,900
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

714
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally missed it because I was doing my job.

715
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:38,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, there's some interesting things in, you know,

716
00:53:39,161 --> 00:53:49,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Japan might be waiting a little longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another one-fifth of their initial launch PS3s.

717
00:53:49,524 --> 00:53:54,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of getting 100,000 units at launch, they're going to be getting closer to 80,000.

718
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:57,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of sucks.

719
00:53:57,486 --> 00:54:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United States.

720
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,789
[SPEAKER_04]: So, oh well, kind of seemed

721
00:54:07,446 --> 00:54:12,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week, so... Yeah.

722
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:14,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be them.

723
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:17,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks to be UK even more, though, because they have to wait until March.

724
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:26,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City, because that's the only place right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing this.

725
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:31,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America, and we'll hit a store near you soon enough.

726
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:34,719
[SPEAKER_05]: But this week it hit YouTube.

727
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:42,621
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.

728
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:44,302
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.

729
00:54:44,562 --> 00:54:47,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I freaking missed the Wii's and Nintendo World by a week.

730
00:54:47,223 --> 00:54:48,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed this by a week.

731
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,740
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.

732
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't plan for shit.

733
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate my life.

734
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming blogs.

735
00:54:58,761 --> 00:55:04,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And if this is showing up at the Times Square Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.

736
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:07,383
[SPEAKER_05]: So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.

737
00:55:08,323 --> 00:55:11,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.

738
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:16,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.

739
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: My informed decision is poo.

740
00:55:18,385 --> 00:55:18,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

741
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Disney is having a cow.

742
00:55:23,502 --> 00:55:26,785
[SPEAKER_00]: They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.

743
00:55:27,726 --> 00:55:34,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.

744
00:55:34,993 --> 00:55:37,795
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you get the new...

745
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:41,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it right now though

746
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, hold on.

747
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:17,142
[SPEAKER_05]: You just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out, you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl!

748
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:19,262
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't be PS3 fangirl.

749
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:20,922
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.

750
00:56:22,223 --> 00:56:23,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not care what the platform is.

751
00:56:24,003 --> 00:56:27,264
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to play the game I want to play.

752
00:56:27,704 --> 00:56:30,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the system that is good.

753
00:56:30,464 --> 00:56:34,325
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the game that is good, that maximizes how well it uses the system.

754
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,945
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is the tool.

755
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:39,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.

756
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:43,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, my only problem with PlayStation, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier.

757
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:45,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a year from now, PlayStation 3 will be just fine.

758
00:56:45,675 --> 00:56:49,420
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now at launch, there is zero, zip, nada, nothing I want.

759
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Because half the launch games you can get, and more than half you can get on another system.

760
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:56,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh.

761
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Meh.

762
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:01,965
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this and Final Fantasy XIII.

763
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:05,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And, yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year.

764
00:57:05,846 --> 00:57:09,027
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now, I see no need to do this crazy campout crap.

765
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:10,107
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just no need.

766
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:19,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the need to get the PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or whatever.

767
00:57:19,629 --> 00:57:20,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

768
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:20,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

769
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:24,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I've kind of gone that route anyways.

770
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:25,491
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too expensive, and it's...

771
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what?

772
00:57:27,369 --> 00:57:29,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Motorstorm is kind of the only thing I'm looking forward to.

773
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this.

774
00:57:33,472 --> 00:57:34,893
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just gamers like you.

775
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:35,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what?

776
00:57:36,034 --> 00:57:41,317
[SPEAKER_05]: If the real list is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the listeners will forgive us a little bit.

777
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:42,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

778
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you're special.

779
00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:46,000
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.

780
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:46,540
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

781
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.

782
00:57:50,763 --> 00:57:50,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

783
00:57:51,783 --> 00:57:52,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Lord help us all.

784
00:57:52,544 --> 00:57:52,804
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

785
00:57:53,767 --> 00:57:56,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.

786
00:57:56,989 --> 00:57:58,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So I played Sonic.

787
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:58,990
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap.

788
00:58:01,072 --> 00:58:02,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Gran Turismo.

789
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:03,593
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap.

790
00:58:04,634 --> 00:58:05,555
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

791
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:13,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadowslayer would like to point out they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts 3 is for yet.

792
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:18,824
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really said exactly which platform it's going to be.

793
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,986
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.

794
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:24,019
[SPEAKER_05]: JV Mon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.

795
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

796
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:25,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.

797
00:58:25,941 --> 00:58:26,821
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be what?

798
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:27,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii World?

799
00:58:28,343 --> 00:58:28,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whatever.

800
00:58:31,505 --> 00:58:33,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

801
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:41,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not so soon, but Castlevania.

802
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: The film's in the works right now and unfortunately it's being directed by Paul W.S.

803
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:48,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Anderson who has

804
00:58:49,639 --> 00:59:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.

805
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:04,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So, is he going to take a big poop?

806
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:07,725
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two winners to be influenced, but actually Blade's kind of cool.

807
00:59:08,105 --> 00:59:16,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.

808
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,549
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like Van Helsing.

809
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably... That was a waste of a movie.

810
00:59:24,054 --> 00:59:24,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

811
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:25,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me put it this way.

812
00:59:25,554 --> 00:59:29,856
[SPEAKER_04]: In the spectrum of video game movies, he's not the bottom.

813
00:59:30,156 --> 00:59:31,596
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's good.

814
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:34,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.

815
00:59:34,157 --> 00:59:35,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat was Resident Evil.

816
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:36,677
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of fans of that.

817
00:59:36,777 --> 00:59:38,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Resident Evil, eh, not so great.

818
00:59:38,338 --> 00:59:40,978
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Mortal Kombat was cheesy, but, you know, whatever.

819
00:59:41,058 --> 00:59:41,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It was effective.

820
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:42,259
[SPEAKER_05]: It got the job done.

821
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:43,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so...

822
00:59:43,692 --> 00:59:43,852
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

823
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:44,032
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

824
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:44,132
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

825
01:00:10,765 --> 01:00:11,906
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have Kylie Minogue in it?

826
01:00:12,426 --> 01:00:12,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.

827
01:00:13,086 --> 01:00:16,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.

828
01:00:17,208 --> 01:00:19,309
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just another Street Fighter movie.

829
01:00:19,569 --> 01:00:22,170
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.

830
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe they'll get Ming-Na Wen back.

831
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:24,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

832
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:25,872
[SPEAKER_05]: She's still on ER?

833
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:27,052
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a cute Chun-Li.

834
01:00:27,092 --> 01:00:27,872
[SPEAKER_05]: She was a cute Chun-Li.

835
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:28,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe she'll come back.

836
01:00:28,653 --> 01:00:28,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

837
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:29,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Is she too old now?

838
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:30,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

839
01:00:30,434 --> 01:00:30,974
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a few years.

840
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,254
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see why she would.

841
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:33,475
[SPEAKER_05]: She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?

842
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:35,710
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't watch TV.

843
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,191
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

844
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,492
[SPEAKER_05]: Mikotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do this.

845
01:00:38,512 --> 01:00:41,913
[SPEAKER_04]: All they're going to do is just try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.

846
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:46,295
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Tide, Zhang Ji, or whatever her name is.

847
01:00:46,535 --> 01:00:47,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Zhang Ji?

848
01:00:47,295 --> 01:00:47,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, her.

849
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:51,017
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be cool, actually, because she's...

850
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:54,110
[SPEAKER_00]: She looks way too innocent.

851
01:00:54,330 --> 01:01:00,353
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news because, you know, it's Hyde Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this.

852
01:01:00,693 --> 01:01:06,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter, they want to get this movie out in time for.

853
01:01:06,136 --> 01:01:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?

854
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:13,159
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.

855
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:18,762
[SPEAKER_00]: We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with, you know, a Hadouken.

856
01:01:20,673 --> 01:01:21,794
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what happens.

857
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:23,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

858
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:26,596
[SPEAKER_05]: GS68 in our chatroom says, New Street Fighter movie?

859
01:01:26,796 --> 01:01:27,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not want.

860
01:01:28,397 --> 01:01:32,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And Justin says, Hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.

861
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:36,180
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?

862
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:36,680
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

863
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,121
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Raul Julia's last role.

864
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was kind of sad.

865
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:41,242
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, he's going to die.

866
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:44,597
[SPEAKER_00]: with that being his last movie.

867
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:48,978
[SPEAKER_05]: But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards.

868
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:55,479
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the HBO movie may have technically been... Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter thing.

869
01:01:55,539 --> 01:02:00,260
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his last movie.

870
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say he did make a good bison.

871
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,481
[SPEAKER_05]: He made a great Gomez Adams.

872
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

873
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll always remember him for it.

874
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:07,101
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.

875
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:08,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, never saw it.

876
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:09,482
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

877
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:19,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Addams Family, but has everything to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.

878
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:25,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.

879
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:32,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.

880
01:02:34,662 --> 01:02:40,005
[SPEAKER_00]: They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3.

881
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:42,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the Halo movie, I'm sorry.

882
01:02:43,086 --> 01:02:47,269
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.

883
01:02:48,029 --> 01:02:55,453
[SPEAKER_00]: They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for it.

884
01:02:58,434 --> 01:02:59,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's too bad.

885
01:02:59,695 --> 01:03:01,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is stupid, because...

886
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:06,567
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a market for these type of sci-fi fantasy.

887
01:03:07,508 --> 01:03:10,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made but Halo can't?

888
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:16,820
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll bet you the problem is you got Peter Jackson attached and they probably want a budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie is going to cost to make.

889
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,605
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses.

890
01:03:21,669 --> 01:03:23,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no short dresses in Halo.

891
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox live release of Street Fighter.

892
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.

893
01:03:43,628 --> 01:03:46,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day.

894
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:49,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody was posting, where's Street Fighter?

895
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We want Street Fighter.

896
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:53,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week.

897
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:56,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it was like, where's Luminous?

898
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:57,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's Luminous?

899
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's Mortal Kombat 3?

900
01:04:00,413 --> 01:04:03,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say, though, that Sharon is my hero right now.

901
01:04:04,014 --> 01:04:04,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.

902
01:04:04,938 --> 01:04:05,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

903
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:34,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in... What was that game?

904
01:04:34,165 --> 01:04:35,685
[SPEAKER_05]: The motorcycle game with the chain?

905
01:04:35,925 --> 01:04:36,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Road Rash.

906
01:04:36,886 --> 01:04:38,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Road Rash, was the game.

907
01:04:38,866 --> 01:04:39,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I like Road Rash.

908
01:04:40,646 --> 01:04:42,607
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.

909
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:42,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we?

910
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:43,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting.

911
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.

912
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GamePro Expo.

913
01:04:53,129 --> 01:04:54,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the new E3?

914
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:55,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

915
01:04:55,769 --> 01:04:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the

916
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Big Show Event E3 General Mission or Industry Only

917
01:05:20,103 --> 01:05:20,603
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

918
01:05:41,215 --> 01:05:50,043
[SPEAKER_05]: By October, their Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having to build in April.

919
01:05:50,063 --> 01:05:58,311
[SPEAKER_04]: They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?

920
01:05:58,391 --> 01:06:01,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not really any extra work that they have to do.

921
01:06:02,543 --> 01:06:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're saying that's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.

922
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:11,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well, like tournaments and that sort of thing.

923
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:16,668
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's what makes me think it's general mission, because why would you do industry-only tournaments?

924
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:17,729
[SPEAKER_05]: That kind of defeats purpose.

925
01:06:17,949 --> 01:06:22,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.

926
01:06:24,551 --> 01:06:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just L.A.

927
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:26,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll probably go.

928
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:28,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds kind of exciting.

929
01:06:28,793 --> 01:06:29,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

930
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:29,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there.

931
01:06:29,994 --> 01:06:30,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

932
01:06:30,514 --> 01:06:31,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean.

933
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:41,652
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully we're able to get in hopefully it's not, you know, by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be but we'll see, we'll see alright, well

934
01:06:42,062 --> 01:06:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for the news here in this part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

935
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:49,969
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
