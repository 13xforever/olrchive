00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,260
Tonight, November 5th, 2006, more details on Wii's Virtual Console, movie news for

2
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:33,040
Halo, Castlevania, and yes, Street Fighter, and our HD movies coming to the Xbox marketplace.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,320
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Radio.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,880
We are that internet radio program dedicated to all things video games and video gaming,

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,200
the gaming culture and the gaming lifestyle, so on and so on.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,200
We've been here for the past four and a half years serving you.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,460
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only, the lovely Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,920
I got a snake, Meng.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Maybe she's not so lovely, actually.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Last night I fed my snake some beer.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,560
I was slithering this way and that.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,680
Come to think of it, she's rather vulgar, actually, and kind of offensive.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
You redid the hair, though.

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
I like this new hairstyle.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,480
Yeah, my hair is pretty now.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,080
We need the new promo pics for OLR because you have way different hair now and I've got

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,080
the facial hair.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,680
The old picture is when I had fuchsia hair, when it was that bright pink and very, very

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
curly.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,360
Now I straighten my hair and it's cherry red and black.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,240
I'll tell you what, chat room, I'll put up the picture that I took with my smell phone

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
earlier.

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm great for being vulgar and offensive.

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,160
All right.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Speaking of vulgar and offensive, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,160
Hello.

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,160
How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm okay.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Yeah?

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,400
No new hairstyle for you, though.

34
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,800
You still look the same as always.

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Yes.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Yeah.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
But I do notice you're wearing a gaming-related shirt today.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Where did you come across this?

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
From work, actually.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,800
Got it from Eidos.

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,760
It's a shirt for just cause.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,320
Remind the listeners, for those that are listening to Orange on Australia for the first time,

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,640
because we get a lot of new listeners every week, especially thanks to XB Stream.

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,760
We show up on these random Xbox 360s of people who download the program and through iTunes

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,060
we're always getting new people.

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,980
Remind folks what it is you do for a living and how you get some interesting insight because

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
of it.

48
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:23,320
I work at a video distributor and a video game distributor, so we have a lot of contact

49
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,920
with big publishing companies out there like Microsoft and whatnot.

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,240
So yeah, every now and then we do this annual kind of sales conferencing with the game publishers

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,420
and they bring us free stuff.

52
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Not so much this year, though.

53
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,080
They didn't bring us as much free stuff.

54
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,400
But I did get a shirt from...

55
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Poor baby.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Yeah.

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,220
I got a shirt from Eidos, so for just cause, and Nelly says this is a Russian propaganda

58
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,920
shirt or a communist propaganda shirt.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
That's what it looks like.

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
It's an interesting shirt.

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,600
I don't know why, but the look of it reminds me of those Che Guevara posters that you see.

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
I don't know.

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Maybe it's just me.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm just crazy.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
All right.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,880
Anyway, in all seriousness, we have no guest right now.

67
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,580
I think Miklotov's going to come in for part B. He's out eating food with some of the non-show

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,040
people that hang out here at the apartment.

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,480
But we do have our chat room over at orangeloungeradio.com.

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Click on chat.

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Always filled with lots of exciting people who apparently were cheering on the vulgar

72
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
and offensive.

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,400
I see DMN was saying, yay, vulgar and offensive.

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
So they love it.

75
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,460
Just to let the chat room know, I am sending that picture to myself now via my email.

76
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,720
And so you will see it in a few.

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
All right.

78
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Sounds good.

79
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,160
Anyway, by the way, the reason why I had Loki kind of tell what he does is because we have

80
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,620
some interesting juicy tidbits tonight, some real good stuff.

81
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,360
But before we get to that, we have to talk about our gaming weeks.

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
We always do.

83
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,640
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,000
My gaming week, I didn't actually play anything.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,440
I tried to play a little bit more PSU, but kind of got sidetracked.

86
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,560
I did get new games today.

87
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
I got...

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,800
What was the name of that game again?

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,360
No, I can't believe I forgot the name of it already.

90
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Oh, yeah.

91
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,080
Trauma Center Under the Knife, so that I can cut into people and be the Uber surgeon.

92
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,120
And I also, thanks to my dear, dear, dear, dear friend who I hope is listening, have

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,960
the Final Fantasy XII special pack with the collector art book.

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Very cool.

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
That's a lot of money.

96
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
I didn't buy the collector art book.

97
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,160
We went to a GameStop in San Jose, and she's like, go look in the back and price this game

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
for me.

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
Okay, but you can just...

100
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Go in the back!

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay.

102
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,200
So I look back, and she's huddled over the counter, and I'm like, oh shit.

103
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,720
Because I know when she tells somebody to go look at something, and then starts huddling

104
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
over the counter, that I'm in trouble.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,000
So I get back, because she picked up my Trauma Center at the time, which I need to sort of

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,920
pay her back for it, but she hands me the bag, and it's heavy, and I'm like, what?

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,080
And then she starts running out the door, I'm like, oh my god.

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,880
So I chased her down and tackled her in the hall and gave her a big hug.

109
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Hot.

110
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,480
Okay, whatever.

111
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,280
And then, don't let me forget, during the FUs, I have to tell the story of the Jehovah's

112
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,840
Witness I owned today.

113
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,800
That was very nice, though, of...

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
You know.

115
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
That was very nice of her.

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
She's a very sweet friend.

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
She is.

118
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
She's very good.

119
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,000
And if I could, I would do all the same for her, so I'm making her a special Christmas

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
present.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Right on.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm making it with finger paints.

123
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,600
How four years old are you?

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Yeah.

125
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Loki, how was your gaming week?

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
It was okay.

127
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
I...

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Ooh, finally got that to work.

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
Anyways, I tried playing as much as possible, but that did not happen.

130
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,400
So what I did play was Saints Row, which is pretty usual for the week.

131
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,120
And then, of course, I played this new game called Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories.

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,800
I gotta tell ya, I've read a lot of reviews on this, and none of them have covered multiplayer

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
very well.

134
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,680
And because I play multiplayer on a consistent basis and I know everything there is to know

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,840
possibly about Grand Theft Auto for the PSP, I'm gonna tell you how the multiplayer is

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,720
and why they did a lot of things badly.

137
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,720
For one, anyone that's played Grand Theft Auto Vice Cities or Vice City Stories will

138
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,080
know that the island that you start off on in Vice City is huge.

139
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,000
It is a lot bigger than the three islands combined in Liberty City.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Okay, that in mind.

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,480
The multiplayer, I was really surprised because they had six different, you know, maps to

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,720
choose from, or at least that's what I thought that meant.

143
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,680
But apparently it's six different sets of spawn points on the same map.

144
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,920
So no matter what you pick, you're on the full-size map, which sucks, because when you're

145
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,680
playing with six players or whatever, you may spawn on the other side of the goddamn

146
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,060
island and it takes you like two to three minutes to get to the other side of the island.

147
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,440
Why the fuck they chose to do that is retarded.

148
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,900
I don't understand why they went ahead and decided, okay, it's a great idea to go ahead

149
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,320
and let everyone run around the full map.

150
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
That sucks right there.

151
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Second of all, the map design has a lot of fences that aren't on the map, so you don't

152
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,360
know, you know, you're trying to go to one spot and you don't realize that, oh wait,

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,600
there's gonna be a chain link fence that I can't go through.

154
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,920
Wait, you can beat up hookers, you can steal cars, but you can't hop a goddamn fence?

155
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
No, I'm sorry, that was in San Andreas.

156
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,800
You see Vice City, you can't have, there is no hopping fence technology yet, nor, you

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,520
know, we're lucky enough to actually be able to swim for about a minute, you know, let

158
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
alone...

159
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
In the 80s, we didn't know how to climb.

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,280
So, it's just retarded, because the chain link fence is in Liberty City, you can smash

161
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,400
a car through and then, you know, be able to go right through, but, so basically the

162
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,240
whole game is flawed in the sense that there's, the maps are too big, and I mean, granted,

163
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,080
you can kind of get by it a little bit, you know, just picking the section of the map,

164
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,520
but it would have been a lot better if they had put some sort of artificial wall blocking

165
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,480
you into a certain section of the map.

166
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,240
That would have worked a lot better, and I would have rather seen that.

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,820
The second thing that sucks about the multiplayer in the game, though, is the option to turn

168
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,020
off power-ups.

169
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,800
You cannot turn the power-ups off in the game, whereas you could in the first one, which

170
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,760
I don't understand why they took that feature out, because that makes no sense, but anyways,

171
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,440
so you can't turn the power-ups off, but that doesn't really matter anyways, because they

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,160
spawn about 50 miles away, so, you know, you'll never get to the power-up anyways.

173
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,240
Some of the new game modes, though, like with the Hunter, are actually pretty fun, except

174
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,960
the Hunter controls it crap, but, I don't know, it's still kind of fun to fly around

175
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,680
in the helicopter.

176
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,960
But multiplayer is pretty good overall, if they had only made the maps a little bit smaller,

177
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,160
and hopefully when we get to the next island, it'll be a lot better, but right now, you

178
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,520
know, they don't really spend that much time working on the multiplayer, I'm afraid, and

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:22,440
all these reviews that have reviewed the multiplayer did not cover any of this stuff, so, whatever.

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,680
Some comments from our chat room, Zappy seems to agree with you, bleh, Vice City is meh,

181
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,220
same old GTA, whereas SSJ100Matt seems to disagree with you, I actually think having

182
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,360
the full map in multiplayer makes it a lot more fun.

183
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
No!

184
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,040
If you want to join our chat, by the way, chat.orangelunchradio.com.

185
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,060
Trust me, I've played multiplayer every single day, it does not make it more fun, because

186
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,280
you have, say for example, you're playing a 13 minute game, you have to spend a lot

187
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,600
of time, you know, getting to where the other people are, and they also retweet the weapons

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,560
and how, you know, much damage they do, like the remote grenades, which used to be really

189
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,880
devastating, now they're just like throwing a firecracker at somebody, it's ridiculous.

190
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,680
It takes like four of them to blow up somebody, and before, it's like, you can get hit from,

191
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,560
one of them from across the street and you're dead, which is awesome, but, I don't know,

192
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,680
I don't like how they retweeted everything, and I really wish they had thought more about

193
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,440
the multiplayer, I understand this is probably kind of an added on thing last minute, but,

194
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,720
they really, if they're going to put multiplayer in the game, at least spend some time actually

195
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,120
working out the tweaks, working out the bugs in it, because all those same bugs that were

196
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,740
there in the first one are still there in this one, so, obviously they weren't working

197
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,760
very well, you know, on this, and we're going to probably beta test them more than they

198
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
did.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
They don't fucking consult me, that's what I want to know, I've played this game more

200
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,880
than anyone on the face of the fucking earth, and yet, they do not consult me when it comes

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,260
to their multiplayer in their game, I can at least give them some simple advice, like,

202
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,320
maybe put an option where you can turn off the powerups, that might be smart.

203
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,660
No one cares what you think, Loki, you're just some dumb podcaster, amateur internet

204
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
journalist.

205
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,680
I will take anyone on in Grand Theft Auto, Vice City Stories, Liberty City Stories, I

206
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,620
will fucking kick your ass, anybody, in the face of the world, anybody, I will beat them

207
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,500
down, and this includes the development team of both Grand Theft Auto games, I would kick

208
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,500
their ass.

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Wow.

210
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Strong words there.

211
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Challenge to anybody.

212
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,800
Strong words there.

213
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
You know, you're just begging for an ass-kicking with a statement like that, Loki.

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,460
Oh, no, I'm not.

215
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
All right.

216
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Is that it for your gaming week?

217
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
That's pretty much it, yeah.

218
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,240
All right, my gaming week, for those folks that have listened to Orange Lounge Radio

219
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,660
for any amount of time, you guys know that I'm pretty much, you know, I'm openly, admittedly

220
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:39,220
a whore for all games Final Fantasy that don't involve draw magic.

221
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,820
So Final Fantasy XII came out this week, and it's epic.

222
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,460
That's the only word I can use to describe it, it's just epic.

223
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,280
It's a lot of what I hope for and dream for.

224
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,580
Let me get my bitches out of the way first, because that's usually what people do.

225
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,220
My bitches for the game is that I think I've been really spoiled by next-gen graphics,

226
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,120
because the graphics didn't really wow me like how Final Fantasy X did when I first

227
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,240
played X, or a lot of the Final Fantasy facts in their respective generations usually get

228
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,580
very wowed by the graphics.

229
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,020
XII didn't really wow me with the graphics, but, you know, graphics are only so much of

230
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,660
a game, so that's really a minor bitch all things considered.

231
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,540
Otherwise, and the music is not up to caliber with previous Final Fantasies in the series,

232
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,540
in my opinion.

233
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,780
But otherwise, those are honestly two very small bitches in the scope of things.

234
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,740
The game is fabulous.

235
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,660
The combat system is genius.

236
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,940
The demo doesn't give you the full insight to the depth of the combat system.

237
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,800
The combat system is great, because to me it's kind of like you're sort of playing Final

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,540
Fantasy XI, except you get to make everyone your bitch and do exactly what you want, and

239
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,920
you don't have to put up with retards.

240
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
It's awesome.

241
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,180
I love it.

242
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,360
The combat system is brilliant.

243
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
I love it.

244
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,500
I know it's probably going to turn off some old-school fans of the Final Fantasy series,

245
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
but it's a nice change.

246
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,980
I think it's great.

247
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,500
The characters are awesome, the story is awesome, and I love Balthier, the pirate, he's great,

248
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,360
and the story is a little tough to get into at first, I think, but it's great.

249
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,180
There's a lot of depth to it, and it's hard for me to say a whole lot about the story,

250
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,660
because I'm only so far into the game, I've only had so much time to play it, but I had

251
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,260
an interesting experience going to pick this game up, because I went to a midnight release

252
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,200
for Final Fantasy XII at the local GameStop, because they called and said, hey, we're doing

253
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
the midnight release.

254
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,380
So I went, and it was so anticlimactic, like it was just a bunch of people standing around

255
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,700
looking bored, all kind of watching the clock for midnight to hit, and then one cosplayer

256
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,420
walked in at 11.55, and everybody was just kind of staring at him, like, isn't that cute?

257
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,660
Because he came as Cid from Final Fantasy VII, and I guess he got a prize for it.

258
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,580
I didn't know they were doing prizes for cosplayers, but whatever, so it was kind of anticlimactic,

259
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,020
and of course they asked me if I wanted to get the guidebook, and I'm like, no, I have

260
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,380
a game, I have GameFacts.

261
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,840
The guidebook is sexy.

262
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,780
I know the guidebook looks nice, but I couldn't justify paying the money for it, when GameFacts.com

263
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
is available.

264
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,540
That's all I can say.

265
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,420
Rama in our chat room says, Gambites and Licenses, crap.

266
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,500
I disagree.

267
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,780
The license board may not be the best EXP system, but the Gambites is really what makes

268
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,180
the combat system great, because that's how you tell people to be your bitch.

269
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,500
Like the Gambites is basically, for those who haven't played the game yet, the Gambit

270
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,300
system basically, you can set a pre-programmed set of logic for your players when you're

271
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
doing battle.

272
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,540
Like for instance, let's say I use Fran a lot, she's the bunny looking character, she's

273
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,460
awesome, and she's so sarcastic too.

274
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,300
Even my friend who doesn't play games, like one of my best friends, John, just watched

275
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,940
me play Final Fantasy XII for like two hours the other night, and he even agreed by the

276
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,740
time it was over that Balthier and Fran were like sexy beasts.

277
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,420
Anyway, but Fran, so like I have her logic set to, okay, first, her highest priority,

278
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,920
if anyone is under 70% hit point, she cures.

279
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,740
If anybody is under 30% hit points and she's out of magic, she'll use a potion.

280
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,260
Then she will automatically cure Silence, she'll automatically cure Poison, then her

281
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,220
priority is to attack anyone I'm attacking.

282
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,580
Then under that, the logic is that she casts Protect on my main character, Vaan, who I

283
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
use as my main character right now.

284
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:21,100
So it works, because that way she only casts Protect when we're not actually in battle,

285
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,340
so she's not wasting MP.

286
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,340
It's great.

287
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,340
So you can kind of play with this.

288
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,260
But the interesting thing about the way the gambits work, you don't have all the logic

289
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
available to you.

290
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,280
Like, for instance, you start with like only a few commands, like hit points below 70%,

291
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,860
but if you want to buy, or I mean, if you want to get hit points below 50%, you have

292
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
to buy that.

293
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,940
Or if you want to get like, you know, enemy is weak to fire, you have to buy that.

294
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,220
You know, it's kind of interesting the way that all works.

295
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,180
So I kind of think it's cool.

296
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,180
I like it.

297
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,580
So that's just my opinion.

298
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,840
So I think the game is great.

299
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,620
It's just shy of being a 10 out of 10.

300
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,040
It's like a 9.9 out of 10.

301
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
It's wonderful.

302
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
You have to get it.

303
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,940
Even if you don't like RPGs, usually, maybe the more action-oriented combat system in

304
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,200
this will get you into it.

305
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I don't know.

306
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
That's just my thoughts.

307
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,500
So, Jamie, I know when you played the demo, you said the combat system was junky, but

308
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I realized that...

309
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,260
I believe that my words were the combat system was ass.

310
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,260
You know what, though?

311
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,020
The demo didn't do it justice, because it didn't show you the depth of it.

312
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,820
It was just kind of like in the demo, it was like run up to a monster and rely on the auto

313
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,920
attack thing and maybe use the magic.

314
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
It didn't do it justice.

315
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,980
I was just like, get the stupid thing off the screen.

316
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
I want my cutscene.

317
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Believe me, plenty of cutscenes.

318
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
You know what I meant, though?

319
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
I meant the cut to battle.

320
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
Yeah.

321
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,980
The battle screen, I guess.

322
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,400
Well, it's interesting, because it means you have no random battles, and that was kind

323
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,700
of a frustrating thing in old Final Fantasy, is like, God damn it, I need to get to a save

324
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,940
point, because I need to go, and it's like you're walking towards a save point, and then

325
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
boom, boom, boom.

326
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,780
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

327
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,020
There was an item in Final Fantasy VI that removed encounters.

328
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,740
Yeah, but then you would never get any experience.

329
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,980
Yeah, but if you needed to get to town B quickly, then yeah.

330
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
That's true.

331
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,420
But in this one, at least you can see the enemies.

332
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,900
Oh, that is one other kind of minor.

333
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,100
You do go a long way between save points in some parts in this game.

334
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,400
The areas are massive.

335
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,580
It was the same with X.

336
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,980
What would you say was the worst thing about Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, when you played Final

337
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,980
Fantasy XI?

338
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
What was the worst thing about it?

339
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
Being a white mage.

340
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,340
See, but the nice thing is about Final Fantasy XII is that it's like you get XI's combat

341
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,900
system, but you don't have to deal with people's attitudes.

342
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,940
You set the gamuts, and they do it.

343
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,300
If you want someone to be your white mage bitch, great.

344
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
You got it.

345
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
And no one yells at you to cure them.

346
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
They'll just die.

347
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It's awesome.

348
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,820
So it's like 3D Chrono Trigger, without Toriyama's artwork.

349
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Maybe.

350
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,820
Maybe.

351
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
I don't know.

352
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,020
Chrono Trigger is just a whole other universe.

353
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
I don't know.

354
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
You're comparing apples to oranges.

355
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
That would be awesome.

356
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,820
You're comparing apples to oranges.

357
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,300
They're different, but they're still grapefruit.

358
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I don't know.

359
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,300
Take that as you will.

360
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,740
All you need to know is comparing apples to oranges when you're eating pizza.

361
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,260
So no other games for me to review this week, and probably for the next few weeks there

362
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,080
won't be a lot that I'm playing, although I do really want to get Elite Beat Agents.

363
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,340
And I did go to, we were at the mall today, and of course I had to look to see if they

364
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,820
had Luminous 2, because I still kind of want it.

365
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,060
Even if I am a little bit like, see I thought for some reason Luminous was out this week.

366
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,580
I got mixed up, so I have to wait for Tuesday, but even though I am a little bit er at Luminous

367
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,940
right now because the Xbox one was not all that, I still really want Luminous 2.

368
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,060
And somebody had shared the official website with me earlier in the week, and you know,

369
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,280
it looked pretty hot.

370
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,340
So anyway, let's get into some housekeeping.

371
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,760
We have a few items for housekeeping tonight.

372
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,340
First things first, it is November sweeps, for those that don't know what I'm talking

373
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
about.

374
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,780
In the TV industry they usually do this thing called November sweeps, which is where the

375
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,380
big stuff happens, like in Lost they'll kill off the character that you really liked, or

376
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,860
maybe somebody will get married, or they'll have a baby, something really big happens.

377
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,920
So we here at Orange Launch Radio thought, hey maybe we'll get involved in November

378
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,660
sweeps and we're going to have surprises throughout the month of November.

379
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,180
And tonight we have a surprise for you guys, and this is something we've been hinting

380
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,820
at for a little while.

381
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,900
But for those that just listen to us on our RSS audio feed, whether it be through iTunes

382
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,900
or XB Stream or however you're doing it, Orange Launch Radio is actually a live streaming

383
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,220
radio station 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

384
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,620
This is just kind of the flagship show here on Sunday nights, which is then broadcasted

385
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,420
over the MP3s.

386
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,860
But we do have live only shows that air throughout the week.

387
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,280
For instance, Tuesday night, Dark Soccer does her Pump Up the Volume, it's just her and

388
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,180
she plays some indie band music for you guys.

389
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,900
Wednesday nights, my roommate Extrofer and I do a show called Guys on a Show, which is

390
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,100
kind of about pop culture stuff.

391
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,380
And tonight, boys and girls, we're going to be announcing a brand new show.

392
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,380
So let's go to the tape.

393
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,380
Do you want to listen to me?

394
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,380
Because if you do, then I should warn you.

395
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,300
Because if you do, I should warn you.

396
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,020
You're going to hear all sorts of things.

397
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:17,300
It's from the past, crap from the future, the day I have a meltdown on the air, it won't

398
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,780
be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be clean.

399
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,340
But I tell you what it will be, but I tell you what it will be, the train wreck of a

400
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,340
lifetime.

401
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,780
Do you want to listen to me?

402
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:36,700
Travis Donovan Law coming to Orange Launch Radio.

403
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,180
That's right, Orange Lounge Radio welcomes Travis Donovan Live, premiering Saturday,

404
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,980
November 11th at 730 Pacific about here on Orange Lounge Radio.

405
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,340
Right now it's scheduled to be a live only show, but the option for audio RSS may be

406
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
in the future.

407
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,000
So we're very excited about that.

408
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,460
For those that don't know the history of Orange Lounge Radio, Dark Soccer and I used to be

409
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,540
on a program called Under Sedation Live that was hosted by Travis Donovan.

410
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,380
And also for those of you that are big on DDR Freak and the DDR scene, you probably

411
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,260
know Iguana Girl, she was on that program as well.

412
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,100
So Under Sedation Live has gone through some changes recently and unfortunately the station

413
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
is going to be folding.

414
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,900
The live station that runs 24-7 is going to be folding I believe at the end of this month.

415
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,580
So we thought, you know what, Travis did a lot for us, so we want to allow him to come

416
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,860
over to our station and continue the legacy he started many years ago.

417
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
So I look forward to that.

418
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,020
For those that don't know Travis, he's kind of a geek just like the rest of us.

419
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,200
So his show is going to be a little more sci-fi oriented and type stuff.

420
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,860
So sci-fi, I know he plays Xbox 360 and hopefully he'll be giving us a call a little later in

421
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,460
the program and tell us a little more about what to look forward to on his program.

422
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,260
So we're very excited about that.

423
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,820
More surprises to come in upcoming weeks.

424
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,420
For now let's get into some gaming news and we're going to start it off.

425
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,820
Loki has some dates for you guys, some things you may not have heard about, a little Under

426
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,900
the Radar stuff this week.

427
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:05,740
I have dates now, but we've got some good stuff this week of course.

428
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,980
Lots of stuff has been announced and one of those titles that you might have seen floating

429
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,660
around out there would be Halo 3.

430
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:21,460
So without further ado, and I'm going to preface this a little bit because with such a date

431
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:27,540
like this you have to kind of wonder, okay well maybe, I don't know, not quite positive

432
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:35,620
on everything, but the date that I have in my system for Halo 3, and this is, according

433
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,080
to our email, we haven't gotten an official announcement, of course Microsoft hasn't made

434
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,680
an official announcement about the date, but from what we've heard from our guy inside

435
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:52,220
Microsoft, March 14th, which makes sense because that's when the big games came out last year.

436
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,820
March is usually the end of the financial quarter for a lot of these companies including

437
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:04,660
Microsoft, so March 14th, 07, should be seeing Halo, and yeah, that's pretty cool.

438
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,460
Okay, now wait a minute, I've got to stop you there because that's a really big thing

439
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,460
you're saying there.

440
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,980
So again, let's look at the evidence and why, because most people are assuming that Christmas

441
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,100
window for 07 is going to be the launch of Halo 3, but now we've had several random things

442
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,060
pointing us to this spring 2007 date, right?

443
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,140
Because I remember a few episodes ago, you had the marketing folks that came to your

444
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,580
work and they told you spring, right?

445
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:38,840
Well, this wasn't the marketing guy, this was their head of sales at Microsoft, he said

446
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:47,260
March or April was the target date for Halo, and this makes sense because how would you

447
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,320
love to end your financial quarter than to say, look, Halo launched and we sold millions

448
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,780
and millions and millions and millions of copies and that made our numbers look really

449
00:23:54,780 --> 00:24:00,300
good because they're going to have another one that's going to be in Christmas anyways,

450
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:06,380
Halo Wars, so you don't need two Halos, that's just overkill.

451
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,400
You know what's interesting is that the same, obviously when you posted this in the show

452
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,540
roll thread, it was interesting because later the same week from a completely different

453
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,140
source, let's just say I have a friend, and I know you all hate these friend of a friend

454
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,700
things, but again, it's kind of one of those things where it starts falling into place,

455
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
right?

456
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,220
I have a friend who has a friend who works for a certain large magazine company who's

457
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,220
had a lot to do with Halo 3 recently, pushing it, who also apparently said it's going to

458
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,220
be spring of 2007.

459
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,700
Well, of course it's going to be spring of 2007, and I would think that this makes very

460
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,100
good sense, it's not going to be February because I thought originally it might be February

461
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,700
or something like that, but February is usually dead, it's kind of still that dead point from

462
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:54,100
December to March, where nothing really comes out.

463
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,800
That wasn't the only day I had, there were some other ones from EA I thought I'd mentioned

464
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,380
as well, I mean, it's not huge stuff, but EA Replay 2, they've already decided to go

465
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,460
ahead and make a second one, that'll be coming out also the same day on Valentine's Day.

466
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,340
Perfect way to say I love you is Halo 3 and EA Replay 2.

467
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,700
Coded Arbs Contagion, and that might even be pushed back, who knows, because a lot of

468
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,540
Konami stuff has been delayed lately, they've been kind of dropping the ball on some stuff.

469
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:34,380
MVP07 NCAA Baseball, also that same date, and then finally Two Worlds for Xbox 360,

470
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:41,300
which I think has been called the Oblivion Killer and whatnot, March 7th, so lots of

471
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,140
good stuff, I think there was also NBA Street that we saw there, home court, but I think

472
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,220
the date's been announced for that, so I didn't mention it.

473
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Fun stuff.

474
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,940
Oh, and have you seen the picture of the helmet yet for the Legendary Edition?

475
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,400
I think I saw it on a blog somewhere, it's interesting, I actually have that preordered

476
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,180
because I want that for my desk.

477
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,340
I hope that turns out to be true, you know, a lot of signs point to that, you know, why

478
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,580
the sudden magazine blitz right about now if Microsoft wasn't about ready to make a

479
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,660
big announcement right in time for the PlayStation 3, and I don't know, there's just a lot of

480
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,060
things that kind of make that look probable.

481
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,300
We might be wrong, it might just be a bunch of red herrings, but it would make sense.

482
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,940
It's not necessarily a case of we being wrong, there are delay issues for different reasons,

483
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,380
I mean, it's just like, you know.

484
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,180
Folks are purposely trying to mislead us astray, but at the same time, if these magazines are

485
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,740
getting these premieres of the games and all this detail about the game, that would indicate

486
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,860
to me the game is pretty close to completion.

487
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,500
I think so, and here's the thing about it though, and no one seems to pay attention

488
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,860
to the fact that a lot of times these releases are in two big, you know, chunks, you've got

489
00:26:53,860 --> 00:27:00,820
the spring releases which take place mostly in March, you know, and it basically builds

490
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:07,340
up right there in that March 15th week, you know, over there, then in November, November

491
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,100
15th, those are the big, you know, two, and it just makes perfect sense.

492
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,680
Just with the whole launch windows, you want to have this strong title for the spring that's

493
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,940
basically going to, you know, dominate the market and make people even, you know, consider

494
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,700
the 360 War over the PlayStation 3, and then for the holiday season, you've still got your

495
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,060
Halo title, Halo Wars, that you can also push out there as well, so they're covered in both,

496
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,900
you know, sections of the year.

497
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
I don't know, that makes sense to me.

498
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,180
Well, we'll see what happens.

499
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,580
We will see all the time.

500
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,140
Well anyway, getting into some other news, speaking of games that are coming out soon,

501
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,300
some of your old favorites are coming back on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console, but

502
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,380
what's interesting, and I suppose not really a surprise to anyone, is that the lineups

503
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,060
are going to be a little bit different between Japan, the U.S., and Europe.

504
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,220
There's been a lot of release charts that have been circulating the internet.

505
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,860
Now, this is supposed to be what's available by year's end, I believe, not necessarily

506
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,300
all on November 19th, December 2nd, whatever day your country's getting the Wii, but this

507
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,340
is all what's supposed to be available by year's end.

508
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:20,500
All three regions are getting a wide selection of NES games, including Wario's Woods, Tennis,

509
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,580
Pinball, Legend of Zelda, Ice Hockey, Donkey Kong, but what's interesting, Japan is getting

510
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,580
some exclusives.

511
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,300
They are the only ones that are getting Gradius, and what's very interesting, I think, is that

512
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,260
they're the only ones getting Super Mario Brothers.

513
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,580
So kind of strange there.

514
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,340
Oh, also, how could I forget this one?

515
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
Solomon's Key.

516
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
I played that game a lot.

517
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,060
I think those are launch games, if I remember correctly.

518
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,980
I thought it was until the end of the year.

519
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,860
I want to say they're launch games, because I think they're launching a little later than

520
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,860
us, and I think some of this other stuff are actually going to be coming out later for

521
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,860
us.

522
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,020
I want to say Europe is getting some games that were not either, and I want to say that

523
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,180
it's going to be relatively soon when we get those.

524
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
Well, alright.

525
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,940
Now what's interesting, speaking of the UK, they are not scheduled right now to get Donkey

526
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,540
Kong Country, but the other two regions are.

527
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,060
All the regions, though, on Super Nintendo are getting F-Zero and Sim City, but then

528
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:14,220
Japan's getting a whole lot extra Super Nintendo games, including Contra III, Super Castlevania

529
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,460
IV, Street Fighter II, and Zelda Link to the Past.

530
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,860
The only game for Nintendo 64 that's currently going to be available is Super Mario 64.

531
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,060
Then you go over to Sega Genesis, and pretty much you get the same thing across all regions.

532
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:33,660
You're getting Altered Beast, Echo the Dolphin, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, either Puyo Puyo

533
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,380
or Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, depending on your region, but it's pretty much the same

534
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
game, anyway.

535
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,620
Sonic the Hedgehog, Toejam and Earl.

536
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,020
The only game that Japan's getting as an exclusive is Shadow Dancer.

537
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,340
Wasn't that the Shinobi sequel?

538
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,780
Yeah, that was the one with the dog.

539
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,220
That game was freaking awesome.

540
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,580
But yet there's no Shinobi listed.

541
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
That's kind of weird.

542
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,260
Shadow Dancer was a better game.

543
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,520
On the TurboGrafx-16, all regions are getting Bonk's Adventure and Dungeon Explorer and

544
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:06,980
Super Star Soldier, but Japan is exclusively getting New Adventure Island and Bomberman

545
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,780
94, although the other regions are getting Bomberman 93.

546
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:19,900
Victory Run, not coming to the US, but is coming to Japan and the US.

547
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,020
I screwed up earlier.

548
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,460
Donkey Kong Country is not coming to the US.

549
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,300
It is going to Europe, but not the US.

550
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
My bad.

551
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,960
Sorry, folks.

552
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,540
We make mistakes here once in a while.

553
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,540
My bad.

554
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,180
But interesting lineups, nonetheless.

555
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,440
Of course, a lot of us go, where's this game?

556
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,700
For instance, I can't help but go, where's Guardian Legend?

557
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,480
Where's the greatest NES game ever made?

558
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,740
But maybe later.

559
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,040
I'm also going, where's Dracula X?

560
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,880
Not a lot of Castlevania games, yeah.

561
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
Only the one in Japan.

562
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,580
Well, Super Castlevania IV, while it was a good game, while they're looking at the...

563
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,740
And they could easily encode it, memory, storage being what it is now, they could easily move

564
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
a whole CD game into...

565
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:09,060
Because the thing that took up the most room on those disks was the Redbook audio.

566
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Well we'll see what happens with the titles coming up in the future.

567
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,940
It would be nice if you could do full CD games, but who knows?

568
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,980
Imagine, you know, if they did a translation of Emerald Dragon or Star Parodia, that'd

569
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
be cool.

570
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
Yeah.

571
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,940
All right, so that's all I gotta say on the Virtual Console.

572
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,220
Well, I've gotten used.

573
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,580
But this has to do with the visual end of our Nintendo friends.

574
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,020
Nintendo is basically going back and reconfirming that the Wii will be at 480p, even though

575
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:47,420
the magazine suggested it would be at a higher resolution.

576
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,700
In the magazine, it said the output would be in 720i and 720p.

577
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
But...

578
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
That was a typo.

579
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Yeah.

580
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,460
They went back and Nintendo themselves said that.

581
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:02,860
Also for the UK, just to let you guys know, they are also saying that they're going to

582
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,900
be releasing the component cable and the other peripherals that were rumored to not be released

583
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,060
at launch in the UK, so you should have no problem getting that.

584
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,000
You won't have to import that.

585
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,300
That's pretty cool.

586
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,780
I know there are some other secrets out there.

587
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,220
I still wish that Nintendo was going to give us, you know, maybe some high def later on

588
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,220
or something, but I know that's the typical fanboy wah-wah-wah, so I've given up.

589
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,340
Who says they can't?

590
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,980
Microsoft upgraded their display of output, so why not?

591
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,700
They can do stuff.

592
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,000
Because it's just not their thing.

593
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,140
That's not their thing right now.

594
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,420
Yeah, but it may not be their thing, but it doesn't mean that a third-party publisher

595
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,300
can say, I want to make my game 720, dammit!

596
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,180
So I'm going to.

597
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,180
We'll see.

598
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
I don't know.

599
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,340
So anyways, there's some other stuff released this week actually about the Virtual Console.

600
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,700
Kind of a little bit about how you'll be able to store your games and whatnot.

601
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,980
It's going to be interesting to find out actually that you'll be able to store your games to

602
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,780
the console itself, of course, the 512 megabytes built in, or the SD cards as well.

603
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,740
You will not be able to transfer your games to another console, you know, being where

604
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,980
you can take your memory card and bring it over to your friend's house and play your

605
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,460
Mario Brothers there.

606
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,820
You can, however, re-download your games.

607
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,860
Kind of typical with like Xbox Live Arcade and that type of stuff.

608
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,940
And some interesting stuff they're talking about.

609
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:44,460
How the Virtual Console stuff, you'll be able to use the standard Wii Remote actually for

610
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,940
NES games by turning it outside, which, you know, ever since I saw that Wii Remote and

611
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,980
they announced the Virtual Console, I knew they were going to be able to do that.

612
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,020
And as well as using the GameCube pads, also if you don't want to spend money on the classic

613
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,820
controller you can use that as well.

614
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,140
So that's kind of neat.

615
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,980
And yeah, that's pretty much it for now.

616
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,380
That's all about the information that they have on that.

617
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,380
Comments regarding high definition from our chat room.

618
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,060
Pooeater says, I want the games to be reasonably priced.

619
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,340
I could give a crap less about 1,296,000,000 or P or whatever.

620
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,780
No, actually there was one other thing I forgot to mention.

621
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,660
They're going to have digital manuals for each game as well.

622
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,660
So that's kind of neat.

623
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,660
Oh, that is kind of neat.

624
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,140
That's like the iTunes books you get.

625
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,620
Wasn't there something, I don't know if this was just a rumor or something, wasn't there

626
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,460
something a while ago about how Nintendo like totally wanted to copy iTunes for a gaming

627
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,460
type thing?

628
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,900
I don't know, maybe that's just some crazy thing I remember reading.

629
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
Was it Sony?

630
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't know.

631
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,620
Did somebody want to use iTunes as a model?

632
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:51,020
Yeah, they wanted to use iTunes as a model for their Gran Turismo store.

633
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,300
My bad, I got it mixed up then.

634
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,460
Well speaking of iTunes, perhaps some of the music you download from there will soon be

635
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,540
playable on the Wii.

636
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:04,060
Actually not really because iTunes uses the protected format, but there are stories going

637
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:08,700
around the internet this week that the Wii will be supporting custom soundtracks.

638
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,660
A screenshot popped up on Neo GAF forums and it's a screenshot from Excite Truck and it

639
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,340
shows in the sound options menu that there is an SD card option in the menu and so it's

640
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:27,620
being inferred that possibly you can pull MP3s from the memory card and play them as

641
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,300
custom soundtracks in the game.

642
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,480
No official word from Nintendo just yet, but the screenshot sure does make things look

643
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,980
interesting and since Nintendo has said that there are still some secrets yet to be revealed,

644
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,300
this could be that one secret that maybe the custom soundtracks is a feature in the game.

645
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
Who knows?

646
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,220
But that would be kind of neat.

647
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:50,700
I like to use custom soundtracks on 360 unless I'm playing DDR or something, oh wait no just

648
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,060
kidding I can't play DDR on 360.

649
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:56,140
Like Luminous, I can't do custom soundtracks on that because that kind of would break the

650
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:02,300
game, but most of the other arcade games I like to use custom soundtracks on.

651
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:08,820
Well speaking of additions to games at any rate, there's been another announcement of

652
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,620
a character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Fox McCloud is showing up and from what I can

653
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:20,460
tell I think it's the version from the Star Fox Adventure series.

654
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:26,540
Also in the game is going to be Pit from Kid Icarus, Meta Knight, Samus in the sexy time

655
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,300
zero suit.

656
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:39,220
There's also Solid Snake and Wario, which I'm going to have that game so fast.

657
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,420
I know it's kind of disappointing that they didn't announce something new, I mean we've

658
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,740
had Fox before.

659
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,460
Even in every single game.

660
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:49,620
Yeah but I mean okay big deal, they gave him a staff this time so.

661
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
Ooh staff.

662
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,220
It looked like it was the Star Fox Adventures.

663
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,180
Great so they gave us a crappy game Fox.

664
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,940
Thank you for reminding us that they made that game, seriously.

665
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,620
We appreciate you reporting it, but we can't help but feel a little disappointed.

666
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,020
We were hoping to, well I know you didn't plan it Jamie, but.

667
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:17,500
I was like, I didn't think that story out, I want the game anyway, but I appreciate it.

668
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,420
We were kind of hoping that we were going to hear what the new secret character, because

669
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,900
they've said that there are going to be other third party characters in it.

670
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,700
It's almost like saying, and our new secret character is going to be Luigi, I didn't see

671
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
that coming.

672
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,740
No I want Raiden to be in it, that'd be funny.

673
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,780
Our new secret character is, a defective NES cart where you have to blow on it.

674
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,300
The new fighter is pantsless rage.

675
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,020
Oh god, anyways.

676
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,740
Moving on.

677
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:53,260
So anyways some other interesting stuff about the Wii hit this week in fact in the form

678
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:58,460
of an episode of South Park where Cartman is actually waiting for the Wii to come out

679
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,820
at, it was quite funny, and was it like an E.L. or E.B., it's like an E.B. type story.

680
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
It was E.V.

681
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
E.V. whatever.

682
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:16,660
So basically impatient, you know, like most of us, he ends up freezing himself to be able

683
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,100
to be woken up later on in the future when the Wii is out, and unfortunately wakes up

684
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,500
too late.

685
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
And the hilarity ensues.

686
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,580
But he wakes up in a land full of sea otter people, which was so freaking funny, I about

687
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,580
cried.

688
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,900
I about cried the last, I don't want to spoil, but it's not that big a deal, like the last

689
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,580
minute of the episode when all the sea otter people were gearing up, I about cried, it

690
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,580
was so funny.

691
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:47,980
This is making me laugh, G.S. 68 in the chat room says, new secret character Ken Kuraghi,

692
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
he wields a crayon sword.

693
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,480
He can't, he's going to eat it.

694
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,700
Maybe Cartman's the secret character, who knows.

695
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
That's the joke.

696
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,300
It was interesting to have another game infomercial this year, but a lot of folks speculate, because

697
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,320
the episode didn't really end this week, it's a two-parter, so a lot of people are saying

698
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,820
that when Cartman actually gets to play the Wii, which will probably be next week, he's

699
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,280
going to say, ah, it sucks, or something like that will probably be the big joke.

700
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,540
But so far it's looking like another video game infomercial.

701
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,340
But yet another episode this season I think was better than the Warcraft episode, but

702
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,780
that's because Mrs. Garrison is my favorite character in the whole show, and it was pretty

703
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,180
funny.

704
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:33,340
One of my favorite characters at Nintendo is Perrin Caplan, and the Game Informer magazine

705
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,100
spoke to Perrin Caplan this week about something that I've been very curious about, the Wii

706
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:42,100
component cables, because there are stories going around out there that the component

707
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,580
cables you're only going to be able to order online, which kind of makes me sad, because

708
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,220
I was never, even today, I was never able to find GameCube component cables for a reasonable

709
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
price.

710
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,900
So I never did get to try the GameCube on the HDTV, so I thought, oh, okay, well, what

711
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,140
I'll do is I'll wait for the Wii, which is sure to have component cables, because this

712
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,860
is the next gen of gaming after all, and then I'll get to play all those old GameCube games

713
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,500
on the component cables.

714
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,280
But then the rumors came out that you're only going to be able to get them online, but Perrin

715
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,180
Caplan to the rescue, she, in response to the question that Game Informer posed, will

716
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,860
component cables be available on day one, Caplan said yes, at retail and online, Best

717
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:25,980
Buy, GameStop, Circuit City, and Nintendo.com, if you still want to go the online route.

718
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,820
Then she went on to say this very other interesting piece about comparing virtual console pricing

719
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
to lattes.

720
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,900
I didn't get that, but whatever.

721
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,940
I'm just happy to hear that the component cables will be found in stores.

722
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,820
That makes me very happy.

723
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
She's insane.

724
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Does that make you a happy panda?

725
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,940
She's a crazy, crazy person.

726
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Anyways.

727
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,380
What the hell was that?

728
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:57,540
It was no, I hit a button and it opened up my AIM and it plays a stupid song every time.

729
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,580
It's like, I love Gnarls Barkley as much as the next person, but I'm tired of hearing

730
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,180
that damn song every time I open up my AIM.

731
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,700
You must not like them very much, because I don't like them.

732
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,780
No, I like, it's Danger Mouse.

733
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,540
I like Danger Mouse.

734
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:17,820
Um, speaking of things that aren't, I guess, quite as frightening as having your AIM play

735
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:24,620
sounds when you don't expect it to, um, Akira Yamaoka is working on a new game.

736
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,620
Frightening Frightening.

737
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Cool!

738
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Silent Hill 5?

739
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
Finally?

740
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Confirmation?

741
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,620
Serior!

742
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,620
What?

743
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,420
It's called, um, Otonarioku, which means adult power.

744
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Adult power, huh?

745
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,260
So is this one of like, those games, where it's a little-

746
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,660
It's a self-help guide to improving relationships through the mastery of rules and manners.

747
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,660
Boring!

748
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:53,900
But you know it's so quirky that it's gonna sell like a freakin', I don't have, it's gonna

749
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
sell like-

750
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,700
Not in this country.

751
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,700
In Japan.

752
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:02,700
And like, five people will import it and go, I CAN'T READ JAPANESE!

753
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,020
Why would Akira Yamaoka be producing a game like this?

754
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,180
Maybe he's trying to redeem his soul.

755
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:14,340
Oh, kind of like how like, he feels like all these Silent Hill games have condemned him

756
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,700
straight to hell, so he needs to do something good for society, like something, you know,

757
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,220
like, hey, train adults how to tell which one's the salad fork.

758
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,100
I don't- what the hell do you do in adult training?

759
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:29,220
No, I think that it'll do like, it'll yell, manners, manners, manners, SIRENS GO OFF!

760
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,220
THE WORLD GETS DARK!

761
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,900
Have your grandma play this game so she doesn't go into Depends, I mean, I don't- what exactly

762
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,220
is, uh, gonna be trained in this game?

763
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,620
Okay, first of all, when you get that old, it's not something you do on purpose, it's

764
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,100
accidental, oops I crapped my pants.

765
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,420
So that's not a good comparison.

766
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Nonsense.

767
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,580
Although the thought of crapping one's pants is-

768
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
It's all about control.

769
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,380
Although the thought of crapping one's pants is rather disturbing.

770
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,580
Did you ever see that one episode of Jenny Jones with the adult- never mind, forget it.

771
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,340
No, it was, I was gonna, it was Saturday Night Live.

772
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,900
Oops, I crapped my pants.

773
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Never mind, forget it.

774
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,140
But, I don't know.

775
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:13,140
I think that they need to make this game mandatory, though, for, um, like, elementary school kids.

776
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,500
So, you know, in America, so that everyone gets good manners.

777
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,220
Alright, yeah, you should be first in line to play this.

778
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:23,220
You know what?

779
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,260
I have really good freakin' manners, okay?

780
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,580
I am so polite.

781
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:32,900
I hold the doors open for people, I smile, and nod, and I don't call them shitheads when

782
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,900
I think they're being retards.

783
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,900
You did buy me a maple latte, that was very nice.

784
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
I did!

785
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,900
See, I'm nice!

786
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
Aren't I nice?

787
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,900
I am the nicest person.

788
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,140
Of course, she was trying to redeem herself with- no, I'm just kidding.

789
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,140
No.

790
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,140
And I bought snickerdoodles.

791
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,740
Alright, back to games, back to games.

792
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
We're getting crazy off-topic.

793
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,660
Sorry, I was caught up in your guys' argument there.

794
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,900
And suddenly it was turning into the Jenny Jones show, suddenly.

795
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,700
Anyways, so, you know, of course to get ready for this big holiday launch, you know, what

796
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:10,340
is Nintendo doing to make sure that all those Wii's are going to make it to your stores?

797
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,460
Everything possible.

798
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:19,620
They are shipping it by any means possible, planes, trains, automobiles, ships, you name

799
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
it.

800
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,620
Horseback?

801
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,620
Yes.

802
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,700
Little immigrants, too, pulling the crates, you know.

803
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,820
Yeah, so any means necessary, not a huge surprise, but it's nice to, you know, be reassured

804
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:39,140
that they are doing everything in their- that they possibly could do, so.

805
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Excellent.

806
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,140
I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce somebody who's walked in, I said would be

807
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
on the show a little later.

808
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,140
Say hello to Miklotov.

809
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,140
Hello.

810
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,820
Now, Miklotov, I'm going to embarrass you on the program a little bit, because you have

811
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:57,420
certain fears on the- certain fears you've expressed to me before, so how do you feel

812
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,380
if I said that your Wii might be coming via UPS?

813
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,500
I would cry, because I hate UPS.

814
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,860
But no, you haven't told me that you hate UPS, you've told me you have a fear of UPS.

815
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:09,860
It's a little bit of both.

816
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,400
It's all from high school.

817
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
Tell us your fears, firstly.

818
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Okay, my fears?

819
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Uh-huh.

820
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,400
Okay, UPS?

821
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
Yeah.

822
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,400
Water?

823
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Yeah.

824
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Sheep?

825
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Uh-huh.

826
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
Flying bugs.

827
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:28,540
If you had ever delivered you, like, a fly-infested sheep that spat water at you, you'd cry.

828
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,100
I would probably just die on the spot.

829
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,100
That's like Silent Hill to you.

830
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,820
Okay, so why the UPS fear?

831
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,660
That has nothing to do with video games.

832
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,380
No, but I'm curious.

833
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,660
That's just like, when I was in high school, my bus stop was next to the UPS center, and

834
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,340
I was really weird in high school, and I figured that they were-

835
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,340
You're really weird now!

836
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,340
High school?

837
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,500
Yeah, whatever.

838
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:54,900
I figured they were trying to take over the world, and so I was afraid.

839
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,780
You don't get much more stupid than I have.

840
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,780
What would that be?

841
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,780
Universal Pwnage Service?

842
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,780
I don't know.

843
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,420
I just hate them, and they frighten me.

844
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,420
I thought maybe, like, a UPS man beat you up once or something.

845
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,020
No, I just, you know, standing at that bus stop, watching all the trucks go by, and the

846
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,140
best part was, it was apparently next to a UPS center, and I didn't know that, but I

847
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,140
still figured-

848
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,460
Show me on the doll where the UPS man touched you.

849
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,460
Show me on the doll.

850
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,460
Nowhere.

851
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,660
I wouldn't let him near me because I'd kill him and then run away crying.

852
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,820
Usiagi in our chat room agrees, UPS is the spawn of Satan.

853
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,820
I've never had a problem with UPS.

854
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:32,820
I hate them.

855
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,620
In fact, I've known some very attractive delivery folks from UPS.

856
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,620
No such thing.

857
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,620
No, I-

858
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,620
You know what?

859
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,620
If they're attracted-

860
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,620
At my old job, I used to have to sign for UPS all the time.

861
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,620
This is years before my current job.

862
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:45,420
I used to have to sign for UPS all the time, and, you know, sometimes that's the highlight

863
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,420
of the day.

864
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,420
It's really evil.

865
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,420
All right.

866
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,340
Sorry, we did get off the gaming subject for a little bit.

867
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,340
That's what I said.

868
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,780
Well, you know, if people wanted to listen to a podcast where they talked about games

869
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:02,180
and nothing but games, there's plenty of compact 20 to 30 minute podcasts out there you can

870
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,300
listen to.

871
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,180
Where would you listen to, you know, fears about insects and sheep and water?

872
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,180
Exactly.

873
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,140
You listen to us because we're bloated and talk a lot about crap that has nothing to

874
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:15,140
do with gaming.

875
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,620
Jamie, you're going to make me cry, and when I cry I get stabby.

876
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,780
I was actually imitating a goat, not a sheep.

877
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:22,780
You know what?

878
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,780
They're close enough.

879
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,140
Do goats scare you?

880
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,140
You know what?

881
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,140
I haven't been-

882
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
What about llamas?

883
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,140
Llamas, no.

884
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,140
Okay.

885
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,140
No, I'm really ready to get back in the game, though.

886
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,140
Llamas have to do with tempests, so there you go.

887
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,220
Where were llamas and tempests?

888
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,820
Isn't that one guy that makes tempests something to do with a llama?

889
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:40,300
Okay, I'm unplugging their mics here so we can get back-

890
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Wait, no, I have a-

891
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,580
How do you feel about Circuit City and CompUSA employees?

892
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,660
I feel that they deserve to buy things.

893
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,900
Well, guess what?

894
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,800
They don't get to buy the PlayStation 3 and the Wii from their own stores.

895
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,540
It's not just the Best Buy employees that are getting shut out.

896
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,540
No, no, no.

897
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,260
Circuit City and CompUSA have enacted policies that will prevent their workers from buying

898
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,620
the PlayStation 3 and the Wii.

899
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,920
If they get caught, they're going to be fired on the spot.

900
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,700
Best Buy employees aren't shut out.

901
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,020
Well, I guess they're not shut out.

902
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,100
Don't they have to act like regular customers or whatever?

903
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,260
Yeah, they get no preferential treats.

904
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:19,820
Well, the word is that actually Circuit City and CompUSA can't even get them.

905
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:22,980
So if you work for Circuit City, you just have to go to CompUSA, and if you work for

906
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:23,980
CompUSA, you go to Circuit City.

907
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,380
That's what you get for working for a second-rate retailer.

908
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,220
What's your problem with Circuit City and CompUSA?

909
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,180
They never have anything I want.

910
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,060
You know why I like Circuit City?

911
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,800
I don't know about your town, guys, but in this town, fucking no one shops at Circuit

912
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,800
City.

913
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,180
It's always empty.

914
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,100
No matter when I go there, there is nobody there.

915
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,900
I can't believe the chain didn't go under.

916
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,700
They went under where I'm from.

917
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,700
Really?

918
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
I'm surprised they haven't.

919
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,700
They have expanded here.

920
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,380
They took over, like the good guys all went under, and they took over the old building

921
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,780
that they were in, and yeah, I can't believe they're expanding because no one is ever in

922
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,780
Circuit City.

923
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,180
In fact, that's probably where I'd go get my PlayStation 3 is Circuit City.

924
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,180
Or Kmart.

925
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,900
I'm telling you, nobody's thinking about Kmart, and with good reason, but Kmart, I'm telling

926
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,980
you, if I were going to be camping out for a PlayStation 3, I'd go to Kmart.

927
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
You know what?

928
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:15,260
I'd camp out for a PlayStation 3.

929
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,060
I don't either, because I'm not getting one.

930
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,620
Oh, but I'm camping out anyway.

931
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,140
Well, you want to know what's funny, that when we ordered ours, we ended up actually

932
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,860
getting money back on ours, so we actually paid less than everybody else, because our

933
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,020
credit card was special.

934
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,660
But speaking of special...

935
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:37,780
Actually, I wanted to say real quick, Neologism, I totally mispronounced his name, 82, says

936
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,860
Kmart is going to get like one PlayStation 3 and two Wiis.

937
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,980
Yeah, but I'll be the only one in line, so it won't matter.

938
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,060
So what does it matter?

939
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:48,620
But now everyone's going to listen to our podcast and go, ooh, I'm going to beat Kmart.

940
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:50,380
Damn it.

941
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,380
You open your mouth.

942
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,460
If you live in the SAC area, you better back the F away.

943
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,980
I'm not telling you which Kmart I'm going to.

944
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,980
You better back the F away.

945
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,780
I'm going to the one on How.

946
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,780
Yes, I'm going to the How Kmart.

947
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:04,660
Oh, wait, no, they turned that into a Home Depot years ago.

948
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,660
Never mind.

949
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,660
Forget it.

950
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,660
No, that was actually...

951
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,660
I was like, oh, Rob's being clever.

952
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:09,660
Don't listen to me.

953
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:10,660
Yeah, don't listen to Rob anymore.

954
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,940
Oh, I'm going to the Kmart on...

955
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,720
They're still the one on 80 and Antelope, right?

956
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,260
That's the one I'm going to, yes.

957
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
That's the ticket.

958
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,260
Go there.

959
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,260
Okay.

960
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,260
No, it's not on Antelope.

961
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,260
It's Auburn.

962
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,260
Whatever.

963
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
Whatever.

964
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,260
Anyway.

965
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,260
Yeah.

966
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,260
Here's your Sacramento direction thing.

967
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,260
Okay.

968
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,820
Well, back to the PS3.

969
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,660
I hate you, Best Buy.

970
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:36,660
You bitches.

971
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,660
Okay.

972
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,660
I really don't...

973
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,660
I don't hate any...

974
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,660
Let me rephrase that.

975
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,460
I don't hate any of the Best Buy retail employees.

976
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:46,740
I hate their upper management who decided this stupid thing.

977
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:52,420
18 stores are going to be doing midnight openings for the PlayStation 3, and they're not doing

978
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,020
anything for the Wii.

979
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,020
You know why?

980
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,500
Because Nintendo loves us, and they're going to make sure we get our Wiis.

981
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,860
So there are 18 stores total.

982
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,780
It's going to be in these cities.

983
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:10,620
Park Lane, Texas, West Los Angeles, California, Chesterfield...

984
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,620
Is that...

985
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,620
Is M.O.

986
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,620
Montana?

987
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,620
Yeah.

988
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,620
No.

989
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,620
M.O. is Missouri.

990
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,620
Missouri.

991
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,620
I don't know why I thought that.

992
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:25,100
El Cajon, Superstition Springs, Arizona, Chapel Hill, Ohio, Ridgefield, Minnesota, Galleria,

993
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,860
Texas, Butterfield, Ro...

994
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,860
What's the...

995
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,860
Okay.

996
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,860
Anyway.

997
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,860
Illinois.

998
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,340
I'm a little tongue-tied today.

999
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,940
West Hollywood, California, Ann Arbor, Michigan, Gwinnett, Georgia, Hialeah, Florida, South

1000
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:48,260
Tampa, Florida, Mount Laurel, New Jersey, Manhattan, New York, Landmark, Massachusetts, and Midtown,

1001
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,260
Manhattan.

1002
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,260
Seriously, kids?

1003
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,260
Why bother, though?

1004
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,260
Why bother?

1005
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:58,660
Because some kid with a minimum wage job and no life outside of that that plays video games

1006
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,380
all day long, that can take the days off of work and ask his boss, you know, can't get

1007
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,960
Friday off work, is going to camp out for three days.

1008
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,460
So you're screwed.

1009
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,460
So why bother?

1010
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,220
I mean, now that the list is on the internet of exactly which places are going to be doing

1011
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,420
it, people are going to be driving in from far away.

1012
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,660
Somebody is going to beat you to it.

1013
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,780
So I say why bother?

1014
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:27,060
If anybody really wants the specific store number, just email us or something.

1015
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060
Just go to any big blog you look at.

1016
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,060
They all have the list.

1017
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:36,540
For the ones asking about West Los Angeles, it's store 109, whichever one that is.

1018
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,540
So yeah.

1019
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,540
All right.

1020
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
Have fun waiting in line.

1021
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,980
Now, I don't know.

1022
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,220
Are we going to go out on the 19th and do the thing with the camera like all the big

1023
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:49,500
blogs do and tape people in line looking stupid like, oh, I'm waiting for a place to drink.

1024
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
If I can make fun of them.

1025
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,780
Do we really got to do that?

1026
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,160
I mean, seriously, everybody else does that.

1027
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:00,820
It's just like reporting on the fucking groundhog and seeing his shadow or not, I mean, that's

1028
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
just retarded.

1029
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,380
Actually, I have an idea, but I'll tell you guys off the air because I don't want someone

1030
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,380
to steal it.

1031
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:06,620
I have a good idea for a parody.

1032
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:13,780
Also, to answer questions from the chat room, the Manhattan stores, the NoHo one is 609

1033
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:19,260
and the Midtown one is 1028 so that you can look online and see what stores those are.

1034
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,780
I don't know.

1035
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,220
I just whispered my parody to Loki.

1036
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,220
You like that?

1037
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,220
I don't like that.

1038
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,220
Okay, we're going to do that instead.

1039
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,220
Okay.

1040
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,220
All right.

1041
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,220
All right.

1042
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,220
So, good luck.

1043
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,220
All right.

1044
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,220
I totally missed it because I was doing my job.

1045
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:40,460
Anyways, there's some interesting things and, you know, Japan might be waiting a little

1046
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:46,220
longer to get their PlayStation 3s because it looks like Japan's going to lose another

1047
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:52,820
one fifth of their initial launch PS3s instead of getting 100,000 units at launch.

1048
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:58,340
They're going to be getting closer to 80,000 and that kind of sucks.

1049
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,020
Apparently, production problems and having them, they need to allocate those to the United

1050
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:04,020
States.

1051
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:13,600
So, yeah, well, kind of same tune that Sony seems to be playing every week so, yeah.

1052
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,740
Sucks to be them.

1053
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,060
Sucks to be UK even more though because they have to wait until March.

1054
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,820
Well, sucks to be you if you don't live in New York City because that's the only place

1055
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,780
right now where you can hit a PlayStation 3 kiosk, at least at the time we're doing

1056
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:27,780
this.

1057
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,740
I'm sure they are slowly spreading across America and we'll hit a store near you soon

1058
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,860
enough, but this week it hit YouTube.

1059
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,180
There's a clip of the PlayStation 3 kiosk at the Toys R Us in Times Square in New York

1060
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,680
City, a place I was at about one week before this happened.

1061
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,500
It seems like I missed everything good in New York City.

1062
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,140
I freaking missed the Wii's in Nintendo World by a week.

1063
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:51,780
I missed this by a week and then I missed Digital Life by a week the other way.

1064
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,780
I can't plan for shit.

1065
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,620
I hate my life.

1066
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,900
But anyway, if you want to see the clip, it's on YouTube and I'm sure linked from many gaming

1067
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,900
blogs.

1068
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,460
And if this is showing up at the Times Square, Toys R Us, I'm sure it's just a matter of

1069
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,620
time before it shows up at a Toys R Us near you.

1070
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,980
So look out for it if you want to try out the PlayStation 3.

1071
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,520
Although I don't see why anybody would really want to.

1072
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,140
Because they can make their own informed decision on whether they want to get it or not.

1073
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:19,100
My informed decision is poo.

1074
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,540
Disney is having a cow.

1075
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:27,740
They want Kingdom Hearts 3 now.

1076
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:34,980
Nomura is saying that they're already working with Squeenix about making the third version.

1077
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:43,480
In fact, if you get the new release for Kingdom Hearts 2 that's got all the extra goodies,

1078
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,460
it's going to give you a little bit of a hint into the third one.

1079
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:51,740
But to quote Nomura on this issue, we've already been approached by the Disney side saying

1080
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,060
they want us to make it.

1081
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,060
What I can say at this time is that we have various ideas, but we're not at the point

1082
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,500
where we can say that.

1083
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,340
It's physically impossible at the present.

1084
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:04,220
I feel that it's not the right time to talk about the future of Kingdom Hearts.

1085
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,020
So sorry, hold off, wait.

1086
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,500
I don't want it right now, though.

1087
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,940
Now hold on, you just poo-pooed the PlayStation 3, but the day Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out

1088
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,500
you're going to be like, OMG, PS3 fangirl, eeee!

1089
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,140
No, it won't be PS3 fangirl, it'll be Kingdom Hearts fangirl.

1090
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:26,180
I do not care what the platform is, if it's got the game I want to play, I'm going to

1091
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,800
play the game I want to play.

1092
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:33,340
It's not the system that is good, it is the game that is good, that maximizes how well

1093
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,700
it uses the system.

1094
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,700
This is true.

1095
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,700
The system is the tool.

1096
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,940
And so far no one has been able to put anything on it that's worth a damn.

1097
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,100
Well my only problem with PlayStation 3, you know, again, I stick by what I've said earlier,

1098
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,740
I think a year from now PlayStation 3 will be just fine, but right now at launch there

1099
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,740
is zero.

1100
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,740
Zip.

1101
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:49,740
Nada.

1102
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,740
Nothing I want.

1103
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,640
Because half the launch games you can get, more than half you can get on another system.

1104
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:58,020
And the ones that are exclusive make me go, meh, meh.

1105
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:02,640
But you know, I know there's stuff in the pipeline like this in Final Fantasy 13, and

1106
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,380
yeah, all this crap is going to make me want a PlayStation 3 in a year, but right now I

1107
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,220
see no need to do this crazy campout crap, there's just no need.

1108
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,260
And I've listened to other folks, and even, I think, Loki, you said that you feel the

1109
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:19,340
need to get to PlayStation 3 so that you can do the journalist thing and report on it or

1110
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,340
whatever.

1111
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,340
Fuck that.

1112
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
Fuck that.

1113
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,340
I've kind of gone that route anyways.

1114
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,780
It's too expensive and it's, I mean, what, Motorstorm's kind of the only thing I'm looking

1115
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,780
forward to on that.

1116
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:35,040
I think people understand that we're not getting paid to do this, we're just gamers like you,

1117
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,860
so you know what, if the realist is that we can't afford a PlayStation 3, I think the

1118
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,540
listeners will forgive us a little bit.

1119
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,420
Oh yeah, yeah, Jamie gets, you're special.

1120
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,220
Well no, no, no, I'm just saying, we will have a way to report on it.

1121
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,340
Alright, so you're going to be our official PlayStation 3 wench.

1122
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,340
Doesn't he have to play it?

1123
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,340
Yep.

1124
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,340
Lord help us all.

1125
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,340
God damn it.

1126
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,060
Yeah, we're sure to get an unbiased perspective on the launch games.

1127
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:00,900
So I played Sonic, it's crap.

1128
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,780
I played Gran Turismo, it's crap.

1129
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,340
We'll see, we'll see.

1130
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,180
Shadowslayer would like to point out, they haven't said which platform Kingdom Hearts

1131
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,180
3 is for yet.

1132
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,940
We're kind of making this assumption that it's PlayStation 3, but they haven't really

1133
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,020
said exactly which platform it's going to be.

1134
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,180
That's because Squeenix is sleeping in Sony's bed.

1135
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,340
JVmon says that Kingdom Hearts 3 needs a stitch level.

1136
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
I agree.

1137
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,300
Oh my god, what, no, it'd be what, Hawaii World?

1138
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,340
Well, whatever.

1139
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:39,280
Anyways, so speaking of fun things to be coming out soon, well, maybe not.

1140
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,280
So soon.

1141
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,740
But, Castlevania, the film's in the works right now, and unfortunately it's being directed

1142
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:55,960
by Paul W.S. Anderson, who has made such wonderful films before, and basically kind of describes

1143
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:03,200
the project as going to be an action horror movie in the vein of Underworld and Blade.

1144
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,820
So is he going to take a big hit?

1145
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,900
There's two winners to be influenced by.

1146
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,980
Actually Blade's kind of cool.

1147
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,300
I don't know if he's going to take a big poopy on this, but I think it's going to be generic

1148
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:17,340
vampire hunting movie one, or whatever, 50.

1149
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,180
So like Van Helsing.

1150
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,900
Yeah, actually Van Helsing is probably...

1151
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,980
That was a waste of a movie.

1152
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:29,060
I don't know, he's, okay, let me put it this way, in the spectrum of video game movies,

1153
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,220
he's not the bottom.

1154
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,220
So that's good.

1155
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:34,980
I mean, he did do Mortal Kombat, which is pretty well received.

1156
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,300
Resident Evil, a lot of fans of that, Resident Evil, eh, not so great, I mean, Mortal Kombat

1157
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,940
was cheesy, but you know, whatever, it was effective, it got the job done.

1158
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:48,400
So I trust this guy more than I do a certain other name, director, three letters, starts

1159
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,180
with U, ends in W. Now, now, his next movie though, I'm sorry, I will see that movie.

1160
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,180
That is a movie that will appeal to me.

1161
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,480
Anyway, will this movie appeal to you?

1162
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,100
It's a new Street Fighter movie.

1163
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:06,220
Yes, that is a sequel to the 1994 Street Fighter movie, which has Jean-Claude Van Damme, Raul

1164
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,980
Julia, and all that stuff.

1165
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,940
Yes, they're making another Street Fighter movie.

1166
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,940
What?

1167
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,740
Will it have Kylie Minogue in it?

1168
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,740
Probably not.

1169
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:16,100
Actually, it's not really a sequel per se.

1170
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,260
Now she has a career again.

1171
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:22,980
It's just another Street Fighter movie, but this time it will be centered around Chun-Li.

1172
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:25,140
So maybe they'll get Min-Na Wen back, I don't know.

1173
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,140
She still on ER?

1174
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
She was a cute Chun-Li.

1175
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,020
She was a cute Chun-Li, so maybe she'll come back, I don't know.

1176
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,020
Is she too old now?

1177
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,020
I don't know.

1178
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,020
It's been a few years.

1179
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,020
I don't see why she would.

1180
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,020
She's pretty hot on ER, isn't she?

1181
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:35,020
I don't watch TV.

1182
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:36,020
There you go.

1183
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,580
Miklotov says she's not on it anymore, so she's freed up to do it.

1184
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,020
All they're going to do is try to get Devin Aoki to do this, and that's it.

1185
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,460
No, they'll get the chick from Crouching Time, Zhang Jie, or whatever her name is.

1186
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,460
Zhang Jie?

1187
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
Yes, her.

1188
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:54,400
She'd be cool, actually, because she looks way too innocent.

1189
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,900
But of course, a lot of people are cringing at this news, because, you know, it's Hyde

1190
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,000
Park Entertainment and Capcom, by the way, who are coming together to do this, apparently

1191
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,240
in this big 20th anniversary of all things Street Fighter.

1192
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,380
They want to get this movie out in time for.

1193
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:09,180
They just wanted to kill it at 20, didn't they?

1194
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:13,580
Capcom needs to step in and say, okay, you fuck this one up, we kill you.

1195
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:20,820
We hire our special hitmen to beat you into pieces with a hadoken.

1196
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,420
We'll see what happens.

1197
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:28,500
Let's see, GS68 says, new Street Fighter movie, do not want.

1198
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:33,140
And Justin says, hey, we could look forward to Street Fighter the movie to the game.

1199
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:36,300
You know what was sad, though, about the movie that they did?

1200
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:37,300
What?

1201
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,300
That was Raul Julia's last role.

1202
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,300
Yeah, it was kind of sad.

1203
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,900
It's like, he's going to die with that being his last movie.

1204
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:50,060
But he did some movie for HBO as well that won a bunch of awards, and I think the HBO

1205
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,060
movie may have technically been.

1206
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:55,380
Now, it's not a theater release, but I think the HBO thing was on after the Street Fighter

1207
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,380
thing.

1208
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,700
So I think if you want to give him some more credit, you could use the HBO movies as his

1209
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,700
last movie.

1210
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,580
I do have to say, he did make a good bison.

1211
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,380
He made a great Gomez Adams.

1212
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:05,380
Oh, yeah.

1213
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,380
I'll always remember him for it.

1214
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:07,380
Tim Curry made a good Gomez, though.

1215
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,380
Eh, never saw it.

1216
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,380
All right, anyway.

1217
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:16,960
Well, speaking of things that have nothing to do with the Adams family, but has everything

1218
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,540
to do with things that our chatters seem to be going off on.

1219
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:25,380
Loving the segues tonight, everybody, loving the segues.

1220
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:34,940
Well, it looks like Microsoft and Peter Jackson have given up.

1221
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:41,900
They've made the statement that they have halted pre-production for Halo 3, well, for

1222
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:48,060
the Halo movie, I'm sorry, and so they're just, all we're going to get is Halo 3, basically.

1223
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:55,420
They still want to do it, but they have to find people who are going to want to pay for

1224
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:56,420
it.

1225
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:57,420
All right.

1226
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,980
Well, that's too bad, but I guess, you know.

1227
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:07,660
Which is stupid, because there's been a market for, you know, these types of sci-fi fantasy.

1228
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:10,700
Isn't it kind of interesting that the Chun-Li movie can get made by Halo camp, but I'll

1229
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,420
bet you that the problem is you've got Peter Jackson attached, and they probably want a

1230
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,900
budget that's like 20 times higher than what the Chun-Li movie's going to cost to make.

1231
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,900
And they want Chun-Li because it's going to be cute Asian girls in short dresses, and

1232
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,840
there's no short dresses in Halo.

1233
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:28,260
Going back to the Chun-Li movie for a minute, I want to mention from our chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com,

1234
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,240
Hit Sun says, where did the Street Fighter hype come from?

1235
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,500
In the past five years, Capcom has made one original Street Fighter character.

1236
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:40,980
True, but look at all the hype there was around the Xbox Live release of Street Fighter.

1237
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,860
I mean, it shows that people are still nostalgic over this.

1238
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:49,220
Remember we're back on Major Nelson's blog every day, somebody was posting, where's Street

1239
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,220
Fighter?

1240
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:51,220
We want Street Fighter!

1241
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:53,680
And then when it came out, it was kind of like, oh, Street Fighter for like a week,

1242
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,480
and then it was like, where's Luminous?

1243
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Where's Luminous?

1244
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,860
Where's Mortal Kombat 3?

1245
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,140
Meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.

1246
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:05,500
I do have to say, though, that Charon in chat is my hero right now for freaking bringing

1247
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,700
up the Ghost Rider movie, because I'm going to be there.

1248
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,380
Why don't we get a game based on that movie?

1249
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,320
We are, and it sucked.

1250
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,780
It was like one of the worst games I played at E3, it was awful.

1251
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,780
Really?

1252
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,940
Well, no, I'm not counting that one, I mean a good one.

1253
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:25,980
Yeah, the one at E3 was poopy, unless they went back and did some major re-edits to it,

1254
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,740
don't bother with the Ghost Rider game.

1255
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:33,460
Actually, you know, it came out, they have the preview in May, and it's coming out in...

1256
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,460
What was that game?

1257
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,980
The motorcycle game with the chain?

1258
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:36,980
Road Rash.

1259
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,620
It was Road Rash, was the game.

1260
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,300
I don't know why I like Road Rash.

1261
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,820
No, we have a story about Road Rash later on.

1262
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,820
Really exciting.

1263
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Alright, we'll get to that later then, sorry.

1264
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:54,860
Anyways, speaking about things that are coming out later, GameProExpo, is it the new E3?

1265
01:04:54,860 --> 01:05:01,000
Maybe, but they're definitely stepping in to basically take on the big show event that

1266
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,140
was E3, and it will be in the same location as well.

1267
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:14,520
Of course, they're expecting on about 30,000 attendees, no word yet though that I've seen

1268
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:21,220
whether this is going to be General Mission or Industry Only, which if it's General Mission,

1269
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,740
that's going to not be 30,000 people.

1270
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:27,620
Well, but maybe they're thinking because it's a new show that won't have the name behind

1271
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:31,860
it, people aren't going to be wanting to go to this, but it's all about what names they

1272
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,860
can attract.

1273
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:36,940
They can get big boosts for Nintendo and Microsoft the size of E3's boost.

1274
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:42,540
I think that a show like this would be lucrative to the designers because by October, their

1275
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:46,860
Christmas games are already ready and they don't have to do this big push for having

1276
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,180
to create these E3 demos and having that pressure of having the build in April.

1277
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:59,500
They can reuse the Tokyo Game Show and X06 demos or X07 by next year, so why not?

1278
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,980
It's not really any extra work that they have to do.

1279
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:07,060
They're saying that it's supposed to be centered around the Los Angeles Convention Center.

1280
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:10,900
Of course, they're going to be doing some stuff as well like tournaments and that sort

1281
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,500
of thing.

1282
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,820
That's what makes me think it's General Mission because why would you do Industry Only tournaments?

1283
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:17,820
That kind of defeats the purpose.

1284
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:25,260
It's supposed to take place October 18th, 19th, and 20th next year.

1285
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:26,260
It's just LA.

1286
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,260
I'll probably go.

1287
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,260
It sounds kind of exciting.

1288
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,540
Hopefully we're able to get in.

1289
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:38,940
Hopefully it's not by invite only like certain other conventions this next year will be,

1290
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,940
but we'll see.

1291
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:40,940
We'll see.

1292
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:41,940
All right.

1293
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,620
Well, that's it for the news here in this Part A of Orange Lounge Radio.

1294
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,340
We're going to take a quick break and we'll come right back with more of Orange Lounge

1295
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:50,340
Radio.

1296
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,100
For those of you guys listening live, we're going to do a music break here shortly.

1297
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:57,160
For those of you guys listening to us on the audio download, we will be back in a couple

1298
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:02,900
of days because we split it up into Part A and Part B, and we'll be back after this.

1299
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,300
Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcasted to the world twice

1300
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:08,300
