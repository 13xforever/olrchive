Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Who's your hosts?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dark Sakura,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sky,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and Loco.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Tonight, November 12th, 2006.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Microsoft unveils movie and television downloads,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
PlayStation 3 games get some new dates and some postponed dates,

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and can you Willy install Linux on the Wii?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello boys and girls on the internet.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We are that video game show dedicated to video games,

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
gamer lifestyle, gamer culture, and all that other stuff.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You know, it's about two and a half to three hours of just chat.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We like to think of ourselves as sitting around the table at the local diner

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
just bitching about video games while we're waiting for our food.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And the service is very slow tonight, hence why the show is about two and a half hours long.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, lamest comparison ever, sorry.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But it's kind of what the show is like a little bit.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Like, remember back in the day when we would all go play DDR

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and then we'd go to the local diner and have soup and just talk and BS and stuff, right?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, local co-host?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, sometimes.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sometimes?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sometimes.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Rawr.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Would you say that was a fair comparison, Mr. Loki?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Techmaster Loki?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry, I didn't hear most of that.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, maybe if you were listening to the show and not playing on your computer

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
while we're trying to get things started here,

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
maybe you would have heard my really bad comparison.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I was just trying to look up to see if anyone had commented on a certain story

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
that ran earlier this week and, you know.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I think you should be focusing on the show now.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It is on the show. It's show related.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I need your full attention, Mr. Loki.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Joining us tonight are some special guests,

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and hopefully I can get through the show tonight without berating.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Say hello to someone who hasn't been on the show in several years, actually,

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but one of Jamie's good buddies from Alabama, right?

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You guys used to live there together?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Actually, I left and she moved there.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, say hello, nevertheless, to Tiara.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How are you?

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm well, thank you.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And also say hello to our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Drew Nami.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If I don't get my French toast soon, I'm going to go kick someone's ass.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bad service.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, I get it. Hello.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Someone needs to pay attention to the show, Mr. Sky.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, shut up.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Anyway, here we are, and another week.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're sitting just before the brink of madness.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Video game system releases, PlayStation 3 and Wii.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Really quickly, who's getting what?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who's getting what system?

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm getting a Wii, but not a PlayStation 3 just yet.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Dark Sakura.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm getting a Wii and a PlayStation 3.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Loki.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm getting a Wii.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Uh, Tiara.

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm getting nothing because I am poor.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Drew Nami?

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm getting a Wii when I get the chance.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right, so that's, let's see, one, two, three, four Wiis and one PS3.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Not my choice.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And one, you know, one cup of coffee, I guess.

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I could send you a Game Boy.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We have lots of love for Tiara.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She can watch us all unpack them on YouTube because apparently that makes for riveting

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
game news this week is, you know, watch me play my Wii and rub it in your face that you

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
don't have one.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It is such horrible blogging news.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Seriously, like every single blog I visited this week, I guess Nintendo loves everyone

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
else more than us.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Whatever, I don't care.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm over it.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But every other website is like, hey, look, here's a video on YouTube of us taking the

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wii out of the box and showing it all in front of the camera.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then here's me playing Excite Truck.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's kind of like I'm reading the same thing on every single blog.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm like, isn't there like real news this week?

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I know it's still early in the week, though.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But as far as I'm aware, Jessica Chobert has not licked the Wii.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I may be able to beat her to that.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Actually, we might have to get Dark Sakura, maybe our own lovely gaming babe here to lick

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
some various devices.

97
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How does it sound?

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If by lick you remove the L and put a K there, then I'll do that to the PS3.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It would be hilarious if we could get like some porn star to, you know, with a Wii.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do we know a porn star?

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To like maybe put the Wii remote someplace.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Actually, I have a friend who works for a gay porn company.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We could get a gay porn star.

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Close enough, I guess.

105
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know if the whole internet will be into that.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Maybe we'll get posted on Gay Gamer.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know.

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Maybe something.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Anyway, seriously though, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
First, how was your gaming week?

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I swear this Fiji water is not spiked tonight.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You were publicly endorsing a brand of water.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, whatever.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't care.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Actually, that's the water I drink.

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Played Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit last night.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In fact, quite a bit last night.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We played all the way through Easy and then through a bunch of Medium,

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and I will let the almighty unlocker of Trogdor tell you about that later.

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then I got inspired and left the room so that I could make the preshow

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
with a bunch of, you know, stuff that was in Guitar Hero 2.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was going to put Thunder Horse from Venture Brothers.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What was the band?

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Death Lock.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I was going to put that in the show, but I decided not to.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And if you want to hear Trogdor, you have to stay and listen to the entire show.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Of course, if you're on the podcast, it won't do you any good

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because it's copyrighted.

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sorry, kids.

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And then I looked at Trauma Center and haven't played it yet,

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
and then Dan started playing Final Fantasy XII for me.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So I'm a little bit upset at him, and I played some more PSU.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm only level 3.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Slowly but surely, making your way.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Leveling is slow in PSU.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I played religiously for several days, and I'm only like level 12.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So it ain't going to get any quicker, I'm sorry to say.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I just solo through all the missions.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Seriously, play single player.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You level up so much faster.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Just skip all the cut scenes and play single player.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It doesn't level your online character.

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, sadly, no, it doesn't.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, then.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I want to level my online character.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you're just going to play by yourself.

151
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got PSU to play through the online missions.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I just wanted to start leveling my stuff.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Anything else, Ms. Dark Sakura?

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
No.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was full of stuff, actually.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Of course, I picked up two big 360 games this week.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Gears of War, which I've played for not very long, actually, so far.

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I haven't really played much through it.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I tried a little bit of the single player, got past the first mission,

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and played a little bit of the multiplayer on one console.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, I mean, not a real good indicator of what the multiplayer is, but it's okay.

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know, to be honest, I don't think the multiplayer is that great,

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
at least from what I've seen so far, unless online is just totally phenomenal.

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But it seems to be just a race for the chainsaw,

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
who can pull out the chainsaw the fastest is the winner.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So I guess that's kind of neat.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And then the game itself is not like, I mean, it's pretty cool,

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
but it's not like, oh, my God, this is so amazing.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just a pretty game, and I think it's a pretty game

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that's going to get forgotten pretty quick, but whatever.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Really?

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yeah, really.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Even despite all the praise that's being lavished upon it.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, look at the people there giving the praise for it.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They're saying, oh, my God, it's so phenomenal.

178
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, my God, it's so innovative.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's so innovative about it?

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, wow, it has a cover system.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hooray.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know, and it's got, you know, it's really intense.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you work for EA?

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't work for EA.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But you're wearing a Call of Duty shirt.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Exactly.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh, wait, that's Activision.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have two Call of Duty shirts.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Never mind.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And this was on the top of the hamper.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, anyways, so, yeah, I'll play through it.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sure it's going to be a pretty cool game.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And there is one good thing about it, though, the co-op is amazing.

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So at least they've got that going for it,

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
because there aren't that many good co-op games nowadays.

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And it's almost like Contra, I should say.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You know, that's kind of what it reminds me of, you know,

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
two people playing through the game, which also leads me to Contra,

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
which I played a little bit this week.

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know, Contra is Contra, so it's pretty cool.

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then, of course, Call of Duty 3 I bought.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That one is really cool.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Personally, I like the multiplayer in Call of Duty 3 a lot better.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've been playing it, you know, locally with a few of my friends at work,

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and it's just fun.

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's definitely improved over to the last one.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The only thing I don't like about the multiplayer in it, though,

208
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is that your little kind of HUD radar thing that they have,

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
they do not show the gunshots going off like they used to in the first one.

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So, I mean, playing like a 10-minute game,

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
it might be hard to find people.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Also, since the maps don't say how many people they're meant for,

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
which, you know, the old one did,

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
so you kind of get an idea which map is large, which one's smaller,

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and that type of thing.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This one's kind of flying blind.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But the game's pretty cool, though, because you get to drive vehicles and stuff,

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and I got a lot of my kills running over people with Jeeps,

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
so that's pretty cool, and I do like that.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And the game looks a lot better, so that'll be pretty cool.

221
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Grand Theft Auto's Vice City story has been playing a little bit more, of course.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really playing more of this, I'm starting to like the game a little bit more,

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
but also at the same time I'm frustrated with how lazy their programming is.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
For example, when you're playing certain spawn areas on the second island,

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you can actually see there's a barrier

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
blocking you from going to the first island again,

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and when you pass that barrier, you die.

228
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So they do have the technology to be able to create a barrier

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
around a certain section of the map,

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
which they should have done anyways to make the maps a lot smaller,

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but they didn't because they're too fucking lazy, so whatever.

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But the game is fun, kind of figuring out the nuances of it,

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
but still Grand Theft Auto.

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a little bit more realistic as far as some of the vehicle damage and stuff.

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then, other than that, Elder of Scrolls Oblivion,

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I've played through about half of that now,

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and hopefully I'm going to finish the other half.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I've got to grind through it so I can sell it back, that type of thing.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And yeah, cheating all the way.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right. Hooray for cheating, I guess.

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let's see, my gaming week.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's see, what have I played this week?

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I played Gears of War as well, but I'm not ready to review it yet

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
because I won't give it a review until I try out co-op,

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
because if co-op is everything everyone says it is,

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
then I really need to look at it.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So we'll wait until next week for me to talk about Gears of War.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But I am ready to talk about two other games I picked up this week,

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and one of them is Elite Beat Agents,

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
which of course is the English version of Oh and Don,

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
which is available on the Nintendo DS.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Elite Beat Agents is quite possibly the best music-based game ever

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for the casual player.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know so much about those that are totally sucked into music games.

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They might find the game to be a little bit easy on some of the earlier modes,

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and yeah, there are some challenging modes that come up later on,

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and you know, whatever.

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But for most people, for those folks that are too afraid to get on a DDR machine

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
because they're afraid of looking like an ass,

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
or those folks that are too afraid to touch a BeatMania controller

261
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
because it's like turntables, buttons, I don't do this.

262
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This could be quite possibly the best casual music game.

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I put it right up there with Guitar Hero in the ease of just pick it up and go.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And even some people don't want to play Guitar Hero

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
because they're like, that's kind of weird.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But Elite Beat Agents is easy.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No one else can see because it's on the DS,

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
and it's just you pick up the pen and go.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And the song list is surprisingly really good.

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know a lot of people were like, ugh, it's got a weird combination of songs.

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But dude, if a game can make Ashley Simpson's Lala kind of fun,

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think it deserves a lot of credit.

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I give Elite Beat Agents a lot of credit.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's funny.

275
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It cracked me up.

276
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Even one stage is kind of sad and a little bit sniffly,

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but I wouldn't cry because I'm a man.

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But no, the game's a lot of fun.

279
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Basically, for those that don't know,

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the essential element of the game is that you tap.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You tap on the bottom screen, but you follow these patterns,

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and you tap like in the beat of the music.

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
For instance, if you're playing Material Girl,

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
your tapping might go along with the words,

285
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
like doo doo doo doo doo doo,

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and you kind of drag the stylus in some parts too and follow a little ball.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So it's a lot more fun than it sounds

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
because the animations and things really kind of keep you involved.

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The only small complaint I have with the game is that, you know,

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
for the hardcore music game fan,

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
they're going to breeze through it in like a day,

292
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
at least play all the songs.

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
At least there's harder difficulties than there was in the Japanese Oh and Don

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
to kind of keep the hardcore music fan base interested in the game.

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I definitely highly, highly, highly recommend Elite Beat Agents

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
to anyone who is slightly interested in the music genre of games.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Also, the other cool thing about Elite Beat Agents,

298
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
multiplayer mode is kind of fun,

299
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and you can do it with just one cartridge.

300
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can play most of the songs just off of one cartridge.

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It takes forever to download the game,

302
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but, you know, it works out.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know, small price to pay for not having everybody to have the same game.

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And then, of course, it has this very similar type of functionality

305
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
for when both people have the cartridge.

306
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It just runs even smoothly, so it's great.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Other game I picked up this week and played is Luminous 2,

308
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
which is out on the PSP.

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And, you know, Luminous was my absolute favorite game that was released this year,

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and so I still have a lot of love for Luminous 2

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
because they didn't really change anything.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But that's also kind of my biggest problem with Luminous 2

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is that half of the skins were Luminous 1 skins.

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And I don't think a lot of people picked up on this

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
because maybe people played Luminous 1 and then forgot about it.

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But seriously, if you think, for instance,

317
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
those folks that follow music-based games,

318
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
if you think DDR repeats are bad, Luminous puts it to shame.

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Luminous repeats damn near every single skin from the first game

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
that wasn't a licensed song.

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's kind of sad.

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But on the bright side now, the good stuff about the game

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
is that Luminous 2 appears to,

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and I haven't played with this mode a whole lot yet,

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
but it appears to let you do your own music, which is kind of rad.

326
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It comes with a lot of new skins.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Some have music videos.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Some are, you know, in-house made.

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You see a lot of them on the Xbox Live version of the game.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There's mission mode involved and versus involved,

331
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and there's a demo of every extent extra.

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There's a lot of new modes that keep it fresh.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So if you don't own the original Luminous,

334
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
there's a lot for you.

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And if you like puzzle games at all,

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
you definitely need to have Luminous 2.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a must-own game if you don't have the original Luminous.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you do have the original Luminous,

339
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
then I would ask you how important are these new modes to you?

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Do you really want to be able to use your own music?

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you really want to be able to do this other stuff?

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Do you really want to play to holla back, girl?

343
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
How much of a necessity is that to you?

344
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And if the answer is, I must, then sure, go get the game.

345
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know, it's only 30 bucks.

346
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's not a bad value.

347
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But I don't know if you would want this and the Xbox Live one

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
unless you are just really crazy about your puzzle games

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
or your Luminous.

350
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And that was my gaming week.

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Besides a lot of Phantasy Star Universe,

352
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I've been playing a hell of a lot of Phantasy Star Universe single-player mode.

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know what it is.

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The story was really cliche and the voice acting is horrific,

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
especially in the first couple chapters.

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But now that I'm past that and I'm in about Chapter 8 now,

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the story has kind of gotten a little bit interesting.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like watching an anime.

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's like I'm playing an anime.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Seriously, if you're into anime,

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you've got to check out Phantasy Star Universe

362
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and give it a fair shot,

363
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
because, I mean, it copies it to a T.

364
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's crazy.

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Speaking of T, Tiara, would you like to share your gaming week with us?

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What kind of stuff you've been playing?

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
As Soy said, we played Guitar Heroes 2 last night.

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
She was around long enough to beat Easy Mode

369
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and then I played through Medium or whatever you call it,

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Normal Mode, long enough to unlock Trogdor.

371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And then we played Trogdor and then we went to sleep.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But before that, I played Tetris on my phone for a million hours

373
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
while we waited for A Nightmare Before Christmas to start.

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Because somebody bought tickets for the 1230 show

375
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and we actually got there at like 1030,

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
so it was like two hours of Tetris joy.

377
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I thought I was going to get lost.

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
She got lost everywhere else, that's all.

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But I got lost in a cool way,

380
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
because we found underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, under.

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But that's it. Excitement. The end.

383
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Now, actually, I want to interview you for a little bit,

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
because you haven't been on the show in a long time,

385
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and last time you were on the show

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
was when we were still exclusively talking about music-based games.

387
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
So now we have a whole new world

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and more people listen to the show thanks to iTunes and XB Stream

389
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and all games and all that stuff.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What kind of games do you enjoy?

391
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you a computer gamer? Are you a console gamer?

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What would you say is your favorite way of playing games?

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Actually, my outside of the home life has been so busy lately

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that I haven't really done a lot of gaming.

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I actually gave up WoW, which was amazing,

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
because I never thought I would do that.

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Seriously, I was so addicted,

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and I was like main healer in my guild and everything,

399
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and one day I was just like, you know what?

400
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think outside is nice, too.

401
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm going to go outdoors and play today.

402
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Where are you from, so our listeners know?

403
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm from Las Vegas.

404
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Las Vegas.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I know we have some listeners in Vegas, so very cool.

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
All right, so you were kind of a PC gamer

407
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
back before you found The Great Outdoors,

408
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
because it sounds like you played WoW,

409
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
and I know, didn't you play Ragnarok for a little bit,

410
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
some of that other stuff?

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, I did play Ragnarok online.

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Do you own any consoles?

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I own a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, a Game Gear, and a DS.

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So you're a classic gamer.

415
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

416
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
All right.

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The classics are awesome.

419
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You ever played The Guardian Legend?

420
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Best 8-bit game ever.

421
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Find it.

422
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Seriously, it's the best.

423
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's the most underrated title ever.

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I will not shut up about this game

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
until I get my sequel on one of the next-gen consoles.

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't care if the rights are somewhere in a black hole right now.

427
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Fucking find those rights.

428
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Give me a sequel to The Guardian Legend.

429
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not that much to ask.

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Please.

431
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Just write your congressman.

432
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm going to write Feinstein tonight and say,

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want a bill passed that will make them make A Guardian Legend 2.

434
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
P.S., I'm crazy.

435
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Junami, how was your gaming week?

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, similar to Yarrarar, I sort of gave up WoW for a bit,

437
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
even though I'm still freaking paying for it.

438
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I was playing Guitar Hero 2 for most of the week,

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
unlocked everything, everything, beat hard mode, that kind of stuff.

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I was just really enjoying it.

441
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Played a little bit of Tales of the Abyss and a little bit of Final Fantasy XII.

442
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Didn't really get anywhere on either of those.

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Other than that, I've been enjoying the great outdoors myself.

444
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What's up with you people and going outdoors?

445
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's winter.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's cold out.

447
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's like right before winter.

448
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like the most wonderful time of the year.

449
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I haven't been going outdoors.

450
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've been going bar-doors.

451
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was going to say, you live in Vegas.

452
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There's nothing to do.

453
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I've been to Vegas.

454
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's nothing to do outdoors in Vegas except make things out of dirt.

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Everything you do in Vegas is indoors and pretty and lights and all that stuff.

456
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Although, when you live in Vegas, you hate the casinos, don't you?

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yeah.

458
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's what I hear.

459
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
We've just passed the law for no smoking in restaurants and stuff,

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
so that should be nice.

461
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Wow.

462
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's going to be crazy.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
We didn't pass the law for smoking marijuana, though,

464
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
because all of those stupid stoners were too stoned to go vote.

465
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Right.

466
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well, before we get into a political show,

467
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I might be in Vegas for a Consumer Electronics Show.

468
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm currently toying with two ideas.

469
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm either going to go to Consumer Electronics Show

470
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
or I'm going to go to Disneyland.

471
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It depends how much money I have.

472
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So, one or the other.

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We'll see.

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Anyway, let's go to our chat room,

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and get some comments from our chat room because the folks over there,

477
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
we have quite a big crowd there tonight.

478
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
We're making some good comments there, except now I can't find any.

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We have a lot of people that are listening tonight that say they live in Vegas.

480
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
DJ Jenai, Gilder, both live in Vegas, saying hello.

481
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And then, of course, too, that press start says does not live in Vegas.

482
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Jeremy Todd, one is shocked that Drew Nami is giving up World of Warcraft.

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Actually, I have something to share with everybody.

484
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What's that?

485
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Foodie Monster on our chat room right now put up the best you-know-who parody

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
for our little video game caption thing.

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ah, Tak Jomsom.

488
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Tak Jomsom.

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes.

490
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, yeah, for those that didn't hear,

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I put out a call the other week because remember when Tak Jomsom decided to sue Midway

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
or, I don't know, wrote a nasty letter to Midway or whatever he did

493
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
over the fact that there was create a character and somebody made his likeness?

494
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
So I put out a challenge to our listeners to create Tak Jomsom

495
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
in as many different likenesses as you could in different games.

496
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Like I was hoping to see one in Oblivion.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, Foodie Monster put one up from what?

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What was it, City of Heroes?

499
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I believe so.

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
City of Villains.

501
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
City of Villains.

502
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Oh, well, how appropriate, City of Villains.

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, City of Villains.

504
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Awesome.

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The O.L. Army salutes you, Foodie Monster.

506
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Good job.

507
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to see more.

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You know what else we need to do?

509
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Huh?

510
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We need to give our special foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis a shout-out.

511
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It is Puppy's birthday.

512
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Ah.

513
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So happy birthday to Puppy.

514
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Happy birthday, Puppy.

515
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And in dog years he's going to fall over and die any moment now.

516
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Let's see.

517
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What else do I want to say regarding chat comments?

518
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Jeremy Todd 1 asked me in regards to my gaming week, which game is better?

519
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Luminous Live, Luminous 1, or Luminous 2?

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It depends.

521
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I would say if you don't own any of them, but you have a PSP, Luminous 2 is probably

522
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
the best one.

523
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Just because it practically has all of Luminous 1 in it.

524
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But if you already own Luminous 1, the question is are these little upgrades and the fact

525
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
that they're going to recycle half of what you already have, is that enough for you to

526
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
upgrade the game?

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Question mark.

528
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know.

529
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It depends how addicted you are to the game.

530
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I do think Luminous Live is pretty cool too, though, for those that don't have a PSP.

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't go out and buy a PSP just for Luminous like I did.

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The Xbox Live one is fine.

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's just that the Xbox needs a better D-pad.

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It needs a better D-pad.

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Please, some third party, I don't know.

536
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Maybe there's Microsoft issues why nobody's done this yet.

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
But seriously, somebody needs to put out a better D-pad.

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Get a better D-pad for the Xbox 360.

539
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Somebody.

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And then, you know, Luminous Live has Xbox Live and all that stuff, which is kind of

541
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
cool.

542
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So, I'll say that's cool.

543
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Housekeeping and things that are going on.

544
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We don't have a whole lot of announcements tonight.

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Next week, we're going to be joined by John, also known as DMN, who is a frequent caller

546
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
of the program.

547
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And he's going to be joining us for some Wii madness next week.

548
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That should be exciting.

549
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And I guess what else could we say?

550
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's Emergence Day.

551
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's November 12th, which is Emergence Day.

552
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Oh, I should also say Happy Birthday to Rice Princess, if she's listening, because it is

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
her B-Day.

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Let's get into some gaming news, since there was no housekeeping.

555
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I will say this.

556
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I got served.

557
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
If you listen to Part B of last week's show, I said, we were talking about a rumor at that

558
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
time that Microsoft was going to be offering movies and TV downloads.

559
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And I said, no way.

560
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They won't do it.

561
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If they sold HD downloads, it would totally nerf the sales of the HD DVD.

562
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
So, what did Microsoft announce on Tuesday?

563
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, that they're going to be offering movie and TV downloads in HD format.

564
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, I got told.

565
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, anyway, they announced that various shows from MTV, CBS, movies from such places

566
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
like Paramount Pictures, all this stuff would be available.

567
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
In fact, there's some screenshots circulating, and you can see some downloads include V for

568
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Vendetta, Poseidon, Cradle to the Grave, Lethal Weapon 4.

569
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I know the TV stuff they're offering, old school Star Trek, but the redone special effects,

570
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,000
that one, and Survivor and Pimp My Ride, because you really want to have that on the Microsoft

571
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
360.

572
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Basically, in a recent story that was on Joystiq, Scott Henson from Microsoft talked a little

573
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
bit about how things would work.

574
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Henson mentioned that the files that you download, they will be stored on the 360's hard drive

575
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
unit, and there's not going to be an option to stream videos from the Windows computer,

576
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
because you can kind of already do that if they're in WMV, and the other formats have

577
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
those licensing issues that go with them, hence why you can't play Divx movies on your

578
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
360.

579
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
You can if you have the media extender for some stuff.

580
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Is that because that has the licenses or whatever?

581
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Maybe.

582
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I don't think that plays everything.

583
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Your average 22 minute high definition TV show will be about 1 gigabyte, and the standard

584
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
definition version will be 300 megabytes.

585
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
720p is what all the high def stuff is going to be encoded in.

586
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
They're not going to go up to 1080.

587
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I would imagine that's because of space concerns.

588
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
720p is really not that bad.

589
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
If you have the eye to distinguish between the two, then maybe you ought to just get

590
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
an HD DVD drive into it that way.

591
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I don't know.

592
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The way the rentals work is that once you buy the thing, you'll have two weeks to start

593
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the download movie, and then you have 24 hours to finish it, and inside that 24 hour window,

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
you can watch the movie as much as you want.

595
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
The television shows, though, are basically download to keep, just like it is on iTunes.

596
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
No word yet about price.

597
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I don't know.

598
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Does this sound interesting to you guys?

599
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Is this something you guys are looking into doing with your Xbox 360?

600
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you think you'll actually download some stuff?

601
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It's kind of neat.

602
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
There's a lot of good content on there.

603
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I mean, they've got South Park, Robot Chicken, just like a Chappelle show, if you're into

604
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
that kind of stuff.

605
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Lots of Pimp My Ride.

606
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It just shows that I think people that play the Xbox 360 would be interested in it.

607
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Dr. Suckra?

608
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I have the internet.

609
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I don't need this.

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So are you endorsing underground schemes such as BitTorrent?

611
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'm making a secret of it.

612
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think that it's a good idea, in theory, for people who maybe aren't so computer savvy,

613
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
maybe.

614
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Or people who are slaves to MTV's programming content and can't live without the same mindless

615
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
stuff that they throw out at everybody on their regular station.

616
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They have to infect Xbox Live as well.

617
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So, more power to them.

618
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But I have YouTube.

619
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Alright, fair enough.

620
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Well, technically YouTube is not supposed to have a lot of that content on there anyways

621
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and they've gotten in trouble for that.

622
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
But I have DVDs as well.

623
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Being an HD TV owner, I'm kind of excited about the fact that you can get HD content.

624
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And the movies do interest me.

625
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Because I was looking at what's available on HD DVD the other night because I was considering

626
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
getting the Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.

627
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And honestly, I have to be honest.

628
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I looked side-by-side at what was available on HD DVD and what was available on Blu-ray,

629
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and I gotta say, there's way more on Blu-ray than I want, as opposed to HD DVD.

630
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
But, really what's stopping me is that the kind of movies I actually like to watch, I

631
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
know I'm going to sound like a total snob, but I like to watch indie movies and foreign

632
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
films and that kind of stuff.

633
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And none of that is available on either platform.

634
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Very, very little.

635
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Unfortunately, the Blu-ray version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Special Edition,

636
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
which is going to have cut-out scenes and stuff like that, that's only on Blu-ray.

637
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Duh!

638
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We'll rip that sucker in HD and stream it to the 360.

639
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
To be honest, I would rather do my HD movies this way.

640
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I just am concerned about space.

641
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
TV shows, though, if they're non-HD, no way.

642
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I think iPods got the better setup for that.

643
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Granted, I don't have an iPod right now, but I'm hoping I'll get some gift certificates

644
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
for Christmas or something and I might be able to get one after the holiday season or

645
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
what-have-you.

646
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,600
So, I like the idea of being able to hook it up into the iPod where there's an 80-gigabyte

647
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,200
drive and I can just get that little cable and take the TV shows anywhere.

648
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,240
The ones that are standard deaf anyway, like if I actually, heaven forbid, bought Pimp

649
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,400
My Ride, I'd obviously have to be smoking marijuana, not Nevada, but somewhere, to be

650
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,040
wanting to download that, but no, no, no, that show is, I like the show, I just wouldn't

651
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,400
pay for the show.

652
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
It's a fun show.

653
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
It's just like Mythbusters.

654
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,520
I love watching.

655
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,080
That's something that they didn't have on there.

656
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,760
They should have episodes of Mythbusters because that's an awesome show, but, you know, hey,

657
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,980
I noticed something, though.

658
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,720
I noticed that G4 shows weren't on there and that's kind of surprising, too.

659
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,540
I mean, you'd think that a cable network like that would want to, I don't know, sell their

660
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,760
shows to make any sorts of money that they can possibly make.

661
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,800
Good riddance, I say.

662
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:43,360
I think it's interesting, though, that Microsoft is not embracing yet the online, the huge

663
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,760
resource online there is of free videos and free audio streams such as podcasts and vodcasts

664
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:57,280
and that whole thing, or I'm sorry, blogcasts and vlogcasts, if you are an Xbox 360 only

665
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,760
type person that won't call them podcasts, so, God, retarded, whatever, I don't care,

666
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
whatever.

667
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
It's just a word.

668
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Well, okay, I'm curious.

669
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,560
Real quick, Drew, is this something that interests you?

670
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,640
Not really considering I don't even have a 360.

671
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
All right, then, enough said.

672
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,640
I guess I asked the wrong person.

673
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,520
I won't bother asking Tiara, then.

674
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,000
Let me think.

675
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,080
Oh, what do you think about this, though, the Trojan horse aspect of this?

676
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,840
Didn't we, I mean, a lot of people were saying this.

677
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,920
It wasn't just us, but a year ago when these next-gen systems were first being formed,

678
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,440
a lot of us said, oh, these are Trojan horses.

679
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,480
They're going to be put in your living room under the guise of a game system, but they're

680
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,920
going to be all this entertainment in a box, and look at it, it's coming to life.

681
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:44,040
I would also like to point out that the Xbox 360 demo thing that they had where you sat

682
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,760
on the floor and the thing rumbled under your butt, the big speaker thing, that they said

683
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,480
all this.

684
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,040
It was part of their thing when they had the Xbox 360 at E3 years ago.

685
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,320
Oh, so like something that they teased a long time ago.

686
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
Yes.

687
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
Ah, very interesting.

688
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Of course they want to do that.

689
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Of course.

690
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,600
Their media center PCs aren't selling that great, so they got to sell something that's

691
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
like a media center.

692
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,080
So how long before the PlayStation 3 follows?

693
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
Instantly.

694
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,880
I mean, seriously, instantly.

695
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,480
As soon as it comes out, it's there.

696
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,840
Where will Nintendo fit into all this, or do they care?

697
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
They don't care.

698
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
All right.

699
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,240
Nintendo doesn't really have to care.

700
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
They're Nintendo.

701
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,560
They don't have to care yet.

702
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:32,880
I mean, after all, they're not even jumping on the, what is it, online bandwagon yet.

703
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,720
But so anyways, with most everything that's released nowadays or announced for Microsoft,

704
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,760
Sony always has to make a counterpoint to anything.

705
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,800
And their big thing was, oh yeah, this download service sucks.

706
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,280
And you know, in that case, I do have to agree with Sony because, well, you have to, your

707
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,080
hard drive's not really going to be able to accommodate the volume you'll be downloading.

708
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,400
In fact, Microsoft's even pretty much said the same thing.

709
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,720
It was Aaron Greenberg, who was the group product marketing manager, actually said that

710
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,320
they aren't ready to bring out a larger hard drive yet so that basically you can use your

711
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,520
memory card and get your own hard drive and use it to download stuff.

712
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,120
So in other words, because we're too lazy to put out an 80 gig hard drive right now,

713
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,160
you should just buy four 20 gigs to store all this shit.

714
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:34,600
Yeah, and that's basically kind of the same thing that Sony was saying about their content.

715
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,840
Basically PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box,

716
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,880
which is bullshit anyways because you have to buy special cables if you want that nice

717
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
HD.

718
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,200
No matter what configuration you purchase, we would never segregate or shut out any of

719
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,880
our consumers from our entertainment experience because they didn't have the top of the line

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,200
system.

721
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,320
Both PlayStation 3 versions are available on November 17th, including hard drives for

722
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,520
downloading content and also installing your games onto them so that they can stream faster

723
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,920
because your Blu-ray drive is slow.

724
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,600
But the thing though that is really awesome about the PlayStation 3 though, at least you

725
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,760
can add larger hard drives and thank God for that.

726
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,920
That is at least one thing that they did right.

727
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:23,240
You could do that with the PS2 as well though, with their HD unit, I'm sorry the hard drive

728
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
thing.

729
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,040
Because we put like 150 gig on ours.

730
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:36,360
Yeah, for non-online Sony game related stuff.

731
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,720
But also a lot of games, especially in Japan, made big use of the hard drive because you

732
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,840
would load a good portion of your game.

733
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,320
Like for example, on TDX6 style, with the hard drive you could load all the songs into

734
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,640
the hard drive and then play the, what was that mode called?

735
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,080
The marathon mode.

736
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
Non-stop or whatever it is.

737
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Yeah, the non-stop.

738
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,080
Endless.

739
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,880
Yeah, you could just play endless until you lost.

740
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,240
They even had some games where I believe, wasn't it Final Fantasy XII you could load

741
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,780
onto the hard drive too?

742
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,500
The 2DX Nazis in our chat room are correcting you, it's 5th style, not 6th style.

743
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,840
It was one of those, I was close.

744
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,840
This style was better than 6th style, so yeah.

745
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,320
10 of them available, no, 9 or whatever, I lost count.

746
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
A lot.

747
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
There's a lot.

748
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,200
I gave up after 8th style, which was the last good one, thank you.

749
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
I want to make a comment on this.

750
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,440
Who is this guy that said I need to buy multiple hard drives?

751
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,800
Who was it that said that?

752
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,280
Aaron somebody.

753
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,720
Aaron somebody, fuck a whole lot of you, okay, because look, when your two biggest competitors

754
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,040
are offering something better already, you got no room to be making this statement about

755
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,760
how I should be buying additional 100 gig hard drives.

756
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Don't get me wrong, 360, I still love you, but right now, look, I can get an 80 gig hard

757
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,840
drive in the size of my hand with the iPod, take it wherever I want, and then with the

758
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,400
Sony department, you're going to be able to put whatever hard drive you want in it.

759
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,240
Laptop hard drives are not $100, especially a 20 gig hard drive for a laptop is dirt cheap.

760
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,080
And the fact that you can buy, you know, 150 gig, you know, laptop drive for probably less

761
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,960
than you're going to be spending on whatever their next hard drive that they come out for

762
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,480
the 360, which is probably going to be like 60 or something.

763
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,720
So I don't know, it's just retarded.

764
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,600
All right.

765
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Anyway, let's move on to another topic.

766
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,680
Sticking with Xbox, because I do, you know, even if I think this whole lack of a larger

767
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,880
hard drive thing is a little bit silly, Xbox does do a lot of things right, and one of

768
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,580
them is the Xbox Live Arcade.

769
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:50,720
Despite the fact that Contra is kind of broken, there are some new games coming out for Xbox

770
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,400
Live Arcade, including, before the end of the year, Assault Heroes, Heavy Weapon, Novadrome,

771
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,360
and yes, Loki, just for you, Small Arms, all coming out before the end of the year.

772
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,640
By the way, Microsoft also this week announced a partnership with Atari to bring some classic

773
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,600
Atari games to Xbox Live in 2007, as if they didn't have enough retro titles.

774
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,240
I've seen pictures of them, too.

775
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Yeah?

776
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
They look pretty good.

777
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Well, they've got, you know, kind of like the Konami titles on there.

778
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,960
They have their retro mode and their, you know, kind of remastered mode, I guess.

779
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, the games you'll be able to get Warlords, Tempest, Missile Command, Centipede and Millipede,

780
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,160
Battlezone and Asteroids slash Asteroids Deluxe.

781
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,200
And yeah, they're going to have like the evolved mode is what they're calling it in the Atari

782
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
games.

783
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,880
Supposedly, you can play games like Warlords online, which I guess is kind of cool, but

784
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,160
I think like most retro games, it will be thrilling for about 20 minutes, and then you'll

785
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,680
be, why did I spend 400 points on this?

786
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,920
Yeah, that's pretty much a lot of the games.

787
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,140
Or if you're Loki, you'll say, are the achievements easy?

788
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:57,760
Because I need to boost my score, because I'm a stats whore.

789
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,960
Hey, that is true.

790
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,000
So anyways, another thing with the 360, their last...

791
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Hey, would you say when it comes to gamer score that you're a total size queen?

792
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
No, I would not use the word queen.

793
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,000
A size king.

794
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Whatever.

795
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,680
Anyways, so for the 360, the last update that they did with 1080p blocked out some of the

796
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,000
wonderful 1080p televisions out there, and there's also been other issues with it just

797
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,480
not being very well, very good.

798
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,720
So of course they are working on a fix right now on it, and it is being addressed, and

799
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,000
hopefully it will be fixed relatively soon.

800
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,340
So I don't know.

801
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,980
Why do people release updates for their systems when they know that they're broken?

802
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,160
Or you know, release games, like for example Call of Duty 3.

803
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
Call of Duty 2, okay, perfect example.

804
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,160
The game was released, multiplayer was lagged and bugged, and yeah, it wasn't working correctly.

805
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,720
Call of Duty 3 comes out.

806
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,480
The online is lagged, bugged, and doesn't work correctly.

807
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,760
Didn't you learn from the first one?

808
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,520
Fix the game before it comes out.

809
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,600
Or did you just say, oh fuck, we need to get it out before Christmas.

810
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,080
Oh, who cares if it's not finished.

811
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,320
No one's gonna care, we'll just release a patch later on, they'll be angry, but they'll

812
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,640
buy the next one.

813
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,640
So you know, seriously, finish the game before you release it.

814
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,560
Well at least the boss monster shows up in level 30, right?

815
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Oh yeah.

816
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,240
Well at least they didn't fuck that up.

817
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,620
At least, you know.

818
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,200
That's gonna be my forever question I'm always gonna ask when you tell me a game's broken.

819
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm gonna say, does the boss monster show up in level 30?

820
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,120
Because if so, at least they didn't, you know, at least they didn't fuck up as bad as somebody

821
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,600
else I can think of.

822
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
That's just crazy.

823
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Hey, you know what, maybe they took a, you know, took a page from Rockstar and just didn't

824
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,680
play the multiplayer mode and just released the game as is.

825
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,600
Oh, do you know what the very first thing I did was when I played Gears of War?

826
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
What?

827
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
I downloaded a patch.

828
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
Yeah, me too.

829
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,240
Non-stop excitement from the moment I hit the power button.

830
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,000
Gears of War is currently sitting on the desk in my living room.

831
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,440
I don't know if it's been played yet.

832
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,080
Gears of War is like a visual orgasm.

833
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,760
It really is.

834
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,000
But I'll have more to say on it next week, because the gameplay I'm starting to question

835
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,560
a little bit, but we'll get to that next week.

836
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,640
I don't play games for how pretty they are, I play them for how well they play.

837
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,320
But, oh, you need to give this one a shot.

838
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,560
I mean it really is, like when they say it's pretty, they fucking mean it.

839
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,560
It's really pretty.

840
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
Okay.

841
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,720
Well, speaking of things that I guess some people might think are pretty, like, I don't

842
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,720
know, we actually have one person who plays this game in the room right now.

843
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,280
There's news for Second Life as Junami raises his hand.

844
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Sup?

845
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:57,840
Well, at any rate, you'll be able to sit around with your virtual friends watching TV in Second

846
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,840
Life.

847
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,080
This is the kind of thing that I go into Second Life to get away from?

848
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:10,520
Well, they're working with a company called Rivers Run Red that is going to be producing

849
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:21,600
a TV channel for VirtualLife.tv, and you can install it in your virtual home and watch

850
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,280
the sci-fi channel and other TV.

851
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
What?

852
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,160
I'm laughing because this is stupid!

853
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,280
This is so stupid!

854
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,080
I mean, what are you going to do?

855
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,320
Hey, man, want to come over to my virtual pad and hang out?

856
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,680
We'll watch Pimp My Ride.

857
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
I mean...

858
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,560
Why, do you think I was doing in the, and you can do this?

859
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,780
I'm not blaming you, but this is, I mean, I get the technological, wow, that's kind

860
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,020
of neat end of it, like, hey, I can watch TV online, but, okay, seriously, if you're

861
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,760
meeting up with other people online to just sit down and watch TV, you can do that in

862
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
real life.

863
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,280
Is that being twice as lazy?

864
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,320
I mean, seriously, because if I'm sitting down playing a game where I'm watching TV

865
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,640
in the game, is that, like, twice as, you know, twice as lazy?

866
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,320
Speaking of which, you can actually do that also in Darkness, which is coming out, they're

867
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,160
having streaming video and stuff in their TV shows, so you can actually stop in the

868
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,600
game and watch TV, which I don't know why you would, but...

869
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Funny Dale in our chat wants to know, since when was Second Life a game?

870
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
Seriously.

871
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,120
Well, just to say so, that it is launching in November.

872
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,080
What would really be insane would be if your Second Life avatar would log into his virtual

873
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,020
computer and then play Second Life as an item.

874
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,160
Do they have to pay for a virtual cable bill?

875
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Because that would just suck.

876
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,960
I mean, just because you can do something in the game doesn't mean you should.

877
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,840
Well, the virtual police come to my house and bust me because I have a black box installed

878
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,720
on my Second Life TV.

879
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,520
Now, here's the thing with Second Life, can you, like, you know, murder other avatars

880
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,060
and stuff and get away with that, or can you, like, you know, abort your own baby or something?

881
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,320
Can you do, like, pretty much anything you want in this game?

882
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,560
Because that would be kind of cool.

883
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,560
I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, and I'm really going to anger some fans

884
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,800
of this game, I'm sorry, but take it in good stride, okay?

885
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,920
I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, alright?

886
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,840
Attention, everyone, you should come over to my house tonight, because we're going to

887
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,840
be watching on my 62-inch Blasma fake screen on Second Life, we're going to be watching

888
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,400
Battlestar Galactica, see you at 7.

889
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,840
Okay, 62-inch screen.

890
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,360
You can go straight to hell, but Punchin' Pie, Punchin' Pie, okay.

891
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Fuck that.

892
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:51,440
If this is a virtual game, I'm making a TV that's the size of, like, 60 miles, you know,

893
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,120
wide, you know, 40 miles tall, and we'll just, you know, watch TV on that sucker.

894
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,800
You'll be able to see that TV anywhere in this world.

895
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,520
That's the way you got to do it, you know, if this is a fucking virtual world, then fucking

896
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,720
the sky should be a TV, I mean, seriously.

897
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,720
What's the point?

898
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm just going to make the walls of my house a giant television that plays pornography

899
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
for all the neighbors.

900
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,480
There you go.

901
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,040
Now you're thinking, that's the dumbest idea I have ever heard.

902
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
So dumb.

903
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:25,040
Well, I find it doubly dumb since I don't actually watch TV, so, you know, if I want

904
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,040
to watch TV, I have the internet.

905
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,800
Not for watching virtual TV, I download it and watch it at my convenience.

906
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
Wait a second.

907
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
Wait a second.

908
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,200
Could in this game, could I, say, have my character watch TV of another character watching

909
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,780
his TV of another character watching his TV?

910
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,840
Like reality shows in Second Life?

911
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
Yeah.

912
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,440
Second Life Survivor?

913
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,920
So we can watch somebody in Second Life on the Second Life TV watching their Second Life

914
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,080
TV is the ultimate in boring.

915
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,080
I am positive it can be done.

916
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,320
All we have to do is find out how.

917
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,000
Moving on to the topics before we get all the hate mail from the Second Life fans.

918
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,120
Look, you know, I'll give you this.

919
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:18,760
If the goal of Second Life is to, like, recreate life, then having the ability to just kind

920
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,920
of go somewhere and hang out, watch TV, is a big step, is one small step for man.

921
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,240
One giant leap for virtual man.

922
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,360
Forget it.

923
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,040
Wii component cables, hey, the Nintendo Wii's coming out and remember the component cables.

924
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,080
There's this whole back and forth where Perry and Kaplan said, yes, you're going to be able

925
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:43,360
to get the components cables in stores, but then the internet's like, but you lied to

926
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,840
us before, lady, when you said that the thing would be region free.

927
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:52,360
Well, this is what's up is that there's actually only going to be three retailers that you

928
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,240
can get it at for now.

929
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,480
Circuit City, GameStop, and Best Buy.

930
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,120
And I'm assuming when they say GameStop, they mean EB Games as well.

931
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,080
So those will be the places that you can get the component cables.

932
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:06,760
So if you're getting your Wii somewhere else, like Toys R Us, I didn't see them on the list,

933
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,080
you may have to go to one of the other retailers to get your component cables if you are a

934
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,640
480p whore.

935
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,640
Not surprised.

936
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
And why?

937
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,800
Because they're running in the shortages on everything for the Nintendo Wii.

938
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,560
Accessories, Zelda, Excite Truck, they cannot produce them fast enough.

939
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:29,960
And I'm wondering if they just spent all this time trying to produce the units and cut back

940
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,360
on the accessories and other stuff because that's where, I mean, as far as my company,

941
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:42,360
that's what we're running into, allocations on everything, accessories and games and you

942
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
name it.

943
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,200
So eliminating it down to three different stores, which I'm sure they paid a fat little

944
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,520
bonus to Nintendo for that privilege, makes perfect sense to me.

945
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,520
The chat room's still fixated on the Second Life thing and there's a good comment here

946
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,520
so I want to read it.

947
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:04,540
Footy Monster says, Second Life does open a way of people who cannot be physically together

948
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,880
to actually hang out.

949
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,040
I'll give you that.

950
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,120
And that's kind of cool and World of Warcraft is very similar and a lot of these MMOs are

951
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,760
very similar but, like, you're going to hang out and watch TV.

952
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,760
That's what you're going to do.

953
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,760
Let me put it this way.

954
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,080
That'd be like, you know, the equivalent of, okay, I'm flying, okay, to the other side

955
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:28,000
of the world to meet a pen pal or whatever and once I get there, what do I do?

956
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,120
I've spent all this money, all this time, you know, building up for this moment.

957
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,000
Hey man, you want to watch some TV?

958
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Yeah, sure, let's watch.

959
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,200
I mean, that's like a big, like, waste of time.

960
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
What did you say, Tiara?

961
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,200
What did you say?

962
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,960
I said that just described my trip here.

963
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,560
Look, if you're going to spend all that money to fly out and meet your pen pal, at least

964
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,560
do some fucking because that's...

965
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,080
Actually, actually, actually, actually, actually.

966
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,200
Because you know that expectation is there somewhere.

967
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,360
We did share a bad chance for Cisco.

968
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
It was really, yeah.

969
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,280
Well Chris and Megsy met...

970
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,920
And what do you think they do when they meet up in real life?

971
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,400
Do you think they read the Bible and, you know, pray together?

972
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,120
No, they're doing some fucking.

973
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,120
Here's the better one.

974
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:20,080
When you have friends that come over and both are on the computer, like, you know, Rob,

975
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,920
if you and Shane are over here, you'll be playing, you know, Phantasy Star Universe

976
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,280
or something like that.

977
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:29,200
Both of you playing Second Life and watching TV in Second Life together, you're in the

978
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:35,540
same room, not communicating to each other, but you're still watching the TV in the game.

979
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,700
That's awesome.

980
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,320
My mind has just been blown.

981
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,360
Anyways, back to actual, you know...

982
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,320
So I just wanted to say, if you can't afford the whole plane ticket thing because you can't

983
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,560
get out there and have sex with the person that you've been talking to online, the least

984
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:57,240
you can do instead of watching TV in Second Life is do some cyber fucking, because that's

985
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,120
as close as you can get.

986
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Damn straight.

987
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:06,920
So anyways, on to actual real uses for your TV.

988
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,480
Nintendo Virtual Console.

989
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,200
It's definitely a big thing and right now it's speculated that you're not going to be

990
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,320
able to have rumble in your Nintendo 64 games.

991
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Why?

992
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,720
Because your Nintendo 64 games are going to be using the classic controller and there

993
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,280
is no rumble for that.

994
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,240
Now that's interesting.

995
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,200
I mean, also when you think about the Nintendo 64, not all the controllers had rumbles.

996
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,560
You had to basically buy the rumble pack for it.

997
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,800
So I don't know if that's a huge thing.

998
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,760
I guess like in games like Ocarina of Time where that was important because they rumble

999
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,680
for hidden treasure and stuff.

1000
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,880
I don't know.

1001
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,700
But I remember reading somewhere that it's speculated that you're still going to have

1002
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,760
rumble in the games because apparently on the back of the classic controller you'll

1003
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,600
be able to snap the Wii remote to it and it will use the Wii remote to rumble.

1004
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:03,660
So I don't know if this is something that's coming later on or if, you know, right now

1005
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,440
of course nobody that has their Wii can check that out because, well, the online service

1006
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,360
for both the Virtual Console and anything else, the news, weather, etc. is not available

1007
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,920
so they can't try it yet.

1008
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,040
But I guess we'll find out on the 19th when all that launches and, I don't know, is that

1009
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,760
a deal breaker you think for the Nintendo 64 games and not having any rumble?

1010
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,520
I personally don't care.

1011
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,120
I don't think it's the end of the world.

1012
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,800
I seem to recall most games that make use of the rumble feature will also do the exclamation

1013
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,600
points or whatever the hell it is.

1014
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,880
So I don't think it's going to be a deal breaker.

1015
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,240
I think it just goes to show though that emulation will only go so far and if you want to play

1016
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,600
the real deal, go play the real deal.

1017
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,520
Dig out your Nintendo 64 out of the trash if you're Loki.

1018
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,120
And ask him what he did with his Nintendo 64.

1019
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,120
Ask him.

1020
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,120
I could have given it to somebody.

1021
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Exactly.

1022
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,120
I could have, but I didn't.

1023
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
I'm allowed.

1024
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,200
You know why I threw it away too, because I'm just going to buy the games on the Virtual

1025
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Console?

1026
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:16,900
Mario Kart cannot come out faster on the Wii.

1027
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,760
I still think nothing is as cool as playing it on the system it was made for, which is

1028
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:29,420
why I have 40-something video game systems taking up a whole room in my house, which

1029
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,420
is true.

1030
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,720
Well, of course, that's no secret to anybody because I'm a big nerd, but what is a secret

1031
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,600
is, well, actually, no, that's not a secret either because there are no more Wii secrets.

1032
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:46,260
If anyone thinks that Nintendo is holding something, no, Reggie says so himself.

1033
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,660
So saith Reggie, so be it.

1034
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,520
So my Wii isn't going to be able to secretly print money?

1035
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,520
No.

1036
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,360
Because I was really hoping to have this reaction on launch day.

1037
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:57,360
50-dollar bill!

1038
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
50-dollar bill!

1039
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
50-dollar bill!

1040
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
50-dollar bill!

1041
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
God!

1042
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
50-dollar bill!

1043
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
50-dollar bill!

1044
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,160
Because, you know, I heard the Wii was going to print money, so I was excited.

1045
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Only for Nintendo.

1046
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,880
We have a story later on that might be true.

1047
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,080
What, that the Wii prints money?

1048
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
You might be able to make it print money.

1049
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Awesome!

1050
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,160
And also, of course, there's the plan about the four million unit launch, which, what

1051
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,480
is, is that the biggest unit launch, do you think?

1052
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,800
The biggest launch?

1053
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah.

1054
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,480
I don't, I have no idea.

1055
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,880
That's pretty crazy.

1056
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,960
That's a big unit.

1057
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,760
That is.

1058
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,560
It's a powerful Wii.

1059
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,760
What a mighty, mighty Wii.

1060
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,560
Would you say it was a big unit?

1061
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,560
Dark Sakura?

1062
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,280
I'm not interested in the big unit.

1063
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,760
One of the biggest units you've ever seen?

1064
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,680
Let's see, speaking of big units that will cost you big money, GameStop is putting together

1065
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,440
this big bundle of Wii.

1066
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:06,240
It's a 700-dollar Wii mega bundle, and basically, this is the only way that you can get a Wii

1067
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,520
through their website early, because remember, this is the same shit they pulled with the

1068
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,720
Xbox 360, is that, you know, hey, you want to have the Xbox 360 right now?

1069
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,400
Okay, buy our 1,000-dollar bundle that has all these games with it.

1070
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
Sold out.

1071
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,400
Yeah, I know.

1072
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
I was getting to that.

1073
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,440
God damn it, stop ruining the punchline.

1074
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,560
So the Wii is 250, you get the SD card, which is 60 bucks, an additional Wiimote for 40,

1075
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:36,560
six games totaling $300, a 12-month product replacement plan, and, whoopty shit, a GameInformer

1076
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,560
gift subscription.

1077
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:42,080
So, you know, the talk online was, don't support this bullshit!

1078
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,120
This is extortion, in a way.

1079
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
Right?

1080
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,440
They know people want this system, so this is how they're doing it.

1081
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,080
So don't support it, and then the damn thing sells out in like five minutes.

1082
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:00,980
We were going to band together as gamers and teach these corporate dickheads a lesson that

1083
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:08,360
they can't make me buy Super Monkey Banana Ball Blitz whatever shit Wii game that I don't

1084
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,720
really want.

1085
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
That'll last.

1086
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:13,720
It sold out in an hour.

1087
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,000
You know, I almost bought Super Monkey Banana Blitz.

1088
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,160
Well, whatever.

1089
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,240
I'm sure there's lots of Super Monkey Ball fans out there.

1090
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,480
I'm just picking on your game for no particular reason.

1091
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,480
I'm in the mood tonight.

1092
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,960
You know the 1GB SD memory card for $59.99?

1093
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,200
You can get one for about 20 bucks at, I believe, Newegg or something like that.

1094
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,560
Definitely not $60 for a 1GB SD memory card, so that's a ripoff right there.

1095
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:48,560
In the 12 month Game Informer gift subscription, lame, trust me.

1096
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,800
That's $15 right there.

1097
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,480
Going to the chatroom and reading some comments, Raven's Dolphin says, well look at the PlayStation

1098
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,480
3 sky.

1099
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,480
Ooh, zing.

1100
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,720
Because of the whole fact that maybe I don't want a freaking Blu-ray player.

1101
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,240
But then again, that's kind of a necessary component, right, because the games are going

1102
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
to be Blu-ray.

1103
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,240
Let's see.

1104
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,040
Jeremy Todd 1 says, but not everyone likes the same games as you, Rob.

1105
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,520
Maybe those people wanted all the games packaged in, and so they bought this bundle so they

1106
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,640
would save money.

1107
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,640
You know what?

1108
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,640
I beg to differ.

1109
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,160
They don't save any money.

1110
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,400
Look at the games you're getting.

1111
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,800
Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, Red Steel, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Super Monkey Ball

1112
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,360
Banana Blitz, and Madden NFL 2007.

1113
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,000
You mean to tell me the same person that's going to buy Red Steel is going to buy Monkey

1114
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,660
Ball Banana Blitz and Madden 2007 is interested in all those games together?

1115
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:43,600
There's not one Poopy game in that list, depending on who you are?

1116
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,440
Madden is Poopy.

1117
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,600
Madden for the Wii is not exactly Poopy.

1118
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,760
Madden is not Poopy at all, if you like football games.

1119
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,820
But I'm saying that I don't think you like every single one of those genres.

1120
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,820
Maybe it's the opposite.

1121
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,920
Maybe you're a Madden fan, and that's the game you want, because throwing the football

1122
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,800
with a controller is kind of fucking cool, even for somebody who may not be into football

1123
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
games.

1124
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,800
But do I really want Monkey Ball?

1125
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,160
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is pretty awesome.

1126
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,040
They've got tons of cool mini-games, and apparently it's both for kids and people that are really

1127
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,720
hardcore into that game.

1128
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,360
I think we've overlooked, though, the main selling point.

1129
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,680
It's the Family Pack.

1130
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,680
No.

1131
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,880
Jeremy Todd 1 seems to agree with you.

1132
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,840
Well, the Wii is marketed towards the whole family, so the kids would like the child games

1133
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,560
and the older people would like the Red Steel Madden.

1134
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,560
I'll give you that.

1135
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,640
And then again, all six, and of course JV Mon says, I preordered Monkey Ball and Red

1136
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:38,640
Steel.

1137
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,640
Okay.

1138
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,640
But did you preorder Madden?

1139
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,640
Is that game interesting you too?

1140
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,960
Would you say all six of those games are something that interests you?

1141
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,520
Footy Monster says they are good games in general.

1142
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,520
No, I don't.

1143
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,840
I haven't played them yet.

1144
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,360
Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just a shitty port.

1145
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,360
That's all it is.

1146
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,240
So the game itself is good, but I mean, it's just a port.

1147
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,240
So whatever.

1148
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,800
Alright.

1149
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:08,480
Anyway, all this forced extortion of money and forcing me to buy Monkey Ball when I don't

1150
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,560
really want it, it ruffles my feathers and it makes me very angry.

1151
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,760
And as you can already tell, I'm in a bit of a mood tonight.

1152
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
I don't know why.

1153
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,000
There's no particular reason for it.

1154
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,520
I think Tiara brings some type of energy with her that makes me more, I don't know.

1155
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,960
I think it's gas from your lunch.

1156
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,040
Maybe.

1157
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,040
From that yummy pumpkin cheesecake.

1158
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,680
We went to the Cheesecake Factory today.

1159
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,680
Good stuff.

1160
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,920
Wait, you're going to put me in a good mood, and that's not the time to be in a good mood.

1161
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
Rob, they're out of cheesecake.

1162
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,920
People die.

1163
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:51,800
It's time, of course, for the FUs of the week, and I have one, and one that's the size of

1164
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
an entire city.

1165
00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:00,320
FU to most of the drivers in San Francisco for being retarded, and the whole town for

1166
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,160
being laid out so funny and getting me lost.

1167
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,720
Even the power of the double horns did not make the people move out of my way, or almost

1168
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,040
run into me, or stop in the middle of the damn, not in the middle of the lane I was

1169
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,800
in, but between two lanes.

1170
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,800
Oh, God.

1171
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Just when I think my road rage might have subsided a bit, I drive in San Francisco,

1172
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,800
and then it comes back, and then I want to kill.

1173
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,800
I imagine how I'm going to kill them in slow, painful ways, like using a cheese grater and

1174
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,800
lemon juice.

1175
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,800
I'm good.

1176
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:50,320
Okay, FU to game blog sites that posting pictures of the Wii in play, or posting, I don't know,

1177
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,480
stupid details like, it comes in a box, with cords, and stuff.

1178
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,480
That is not news.

1179
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,120
Please stop reporting it.

1180
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,120
I mean, my God.

1181
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,620
I know everyone's excited for this console launch, but I do not need to see stop motion

1182
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,560
of you pulling the damn console out of a box.

1183
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:11,400
You know what, though, I'm exempting Kotaku from this, FU, because the video of his kid

1184
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,320
playing the system was so fucking adorable, I went to go, oh, they're so cute, they're

1185
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,360
so cute.

1186
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,840
So I'm exempting Kotaku from this.

1187
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:23,120
At least that's a creative way of doing it, but it, I mean, we had news stories about

1188
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,840
how the Wii can be used as a whiteboard.

1189
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,640
I mean, come on.

1190
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,560
Just because it's shiny, you can put dry erase pens on it, big deal, but it's not news.

1191
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,560
Pooeater agrees with you.

1192
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,120
I don't give a shit about you playing the Wii.

1193
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:37,120
I care about me playing the Wii.

1194
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,120
Exactly.

1195
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,120
Alright.

1196
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:48,800
My FU of the week goes to Baskin-Robbins, because the way they scoop their ice cream,

1197
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,380
like all the ice cream comes up at the top, and none of it ever falls into the cone.

1198
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,080
So it's like, you know, by the time I eat my ice cream, because they eat my ice cream

1199
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,760
fast, there's no ice cream left in the cone, so it's like I have this empty cone with nothing

1200
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,480
to do with, and it's kind of sad.

1201
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
That was seriously the best thing I could come up with tonight.

1202
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,480
Eat the cone.

1203
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,360
I'm not that angry all these, okay, no, then I'll give them this.

1204
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,580
FU to the fact that, still with Baskin-Robbins, when you rip off the paper, sometimes like

1205
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:18,240
some of the paper gets stuck to the cone, and it's like, I have to eat paper?

1206
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,240
You need to eat the glue.

1207
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,240
Ew.

1208
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,240
Ew.

1209
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,240
FU to paper cone things.

1210
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,240
T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.

1211
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,240
Do you have a FU?

1212
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:32,240
I would just like to say FU to Marvel for taking so freaking long to finish Ultimate

1213
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,240
Wars Volume 2.

1214
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:38,160
The last issue came out last month, and the next issue that will wrap it up, which only

1215
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,360
needed probably about five pages to finish the entire series, will come out December

1216
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,360
20th.

1217
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,360
So that kind of sucks.

1218
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,360
Hi.

1219
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,360
Drew Nami.

1220
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,360
All right, first of all, shared FU for everyone.

1221
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,980
FU to MySpace, your site design sucks ass.

1222
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,000
Your members don't know web design were shit.

1223
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,400
Give them a quiz before they're allowed to make a profile, please.

1224
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,160
And FU to people who verb nouns.

1225
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,440
Verbing nouns suck.

1226
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,800
Stop verbing nouns.

1227
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:17,960
And on that note, let's move on to our next story because, oh, our next story is Join

1228
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,540
Our MySpace.

1229
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,660
We have a MySpace profile over at www.myspace.com slash orange lounge radio.

1230
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,660
Hear clips from the show.

1231
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,380
Add us to your friends list.

1232
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:37,420
Comment on our profile with cute little YouTube videos because that's what people do on MySpace.

1233
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:39,920
Let's talk about upcoming release dates.

1234
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,480
Hey, Loki, I heard Full Auto 2 on the PSPs coming out.

1235
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,200
I was really surprised to hear that because I had no idea it was in development.

1236
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,200
That was a real surprise.

1237
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,680
Yeah, that's a complete shocker to me.

1238
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,960
I'm glad someone came out and said that because if not, I would have had to have said it on

1239
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,600
every single show for a long time now.

1240
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:05,000
Well, thank God 1UP reported on it because now it's true because nothing is true until

1241
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
1UP reports on it.

1242
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,600
It's not necessarily just 1UP.

1243
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,220
Everybody reported on it because they finally put out a press release about it.

1244
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,080
But my God, how many fucking weeks do I need to tell you guys something's coming out and

1245
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,180
no one picks up on the story until, oh, look, hey, guess what?

1246
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,480
Some other website posted about this, so now it's true.

1247
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,040
Well, poopy on you.

1248
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,040
You know what?

1249
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,120
This is a show special, so the people who listen to this show, you're like a special

1250
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,120
club.

1251
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
You get to know this first.

1252
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
Fine.

1253
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:38,160
Anyways, so some other special stuff you get to know first, Full Auto 2 Battle Lines for

1254
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
the PS3.

1255
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,040
If you're waiting for that as a launch title, guess what?

1256
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,400
It's not coming out at launch.

1257
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:50,160
It'll be coming out December 13th instead, so ha, that's karma for you, Sega.

1258
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,120
Also along the same lines, Blazing Angels for the PlayStation 3, also not coming out

1259
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,760
until December 13th.

1260
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Not a big surprise.

1261
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:04,040
Rainbow Six Vegas, also another game being delayed until January 31st for the PlayStation

1262
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,720
3, so that's very interesting.

1263
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:13,680
Now for the 360, you've seen the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 pack come out back

1264
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,680
in September.

1265
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:20,400
Well, now they're starting to do a brand new thing, kind of like the old PlayStation 2

1266
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,320
demo discs that they released, their jam-packed discs.

1267
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:29,320
Well now they have this brand new thing called Xbox 360 Exhibition.

1268
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:36,160
It's going to be $5.99 retail and it'll feature six demos, including Madden NFL 07, Dead Rising,

1269
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:42,960
F.E.A.R., Fusion Frenzy 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and also six HD videos, including Halo

1270
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,280
3, Splinter Cell Double Agent, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc.

1271
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:53,280
And this is meant for someone, of course, that does not have Xbox Live, so they wouldn't

1272
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,120
have access to this, or they just didn't want to buy the Xbox official magazine.

1273
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,400
Or you just really want to pay for demos.

1274
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,400
Apparently.

1275
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,440
So it is out there, it's coming out on the 22nd, the one year anniversary.

1276
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,200
I have $6 to spend and I just don't know what to do with it.

1277
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,680
Not really interested in a combo meal from a local fast food restaurant.

1278
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:20,560
I can tell you what you would spend this money on, and it's goddamn not a 360 Exhibition,

1279
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,560
Sneak King.

1280
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:25,200
Sneak King is what you can spend your money on Sneak King and hell, you have enough money

1281
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,240
for some fries and a Coke, there you go.

1282
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,240
So...

1283
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,240
No, you're wrong.

1284
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,960
Wrong, because you have to get a combo meal to get the game, so you actually need more

1285
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:32,960
than $6.

1286
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:33,960
Whatever.

1287
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,800
You just got served, you got BK served.

1288
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,440
You're still hungry, you would spend the money on lunch anyways, it's just, you know, whatever.

1289
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,040
Now you get Sneak King.

1290
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:48,200
No, this is what I'll do, I'll get Drew, I'll say, Drew, don't you want to go out to eat

1291
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,160
and make him buy the meal, and then I'll buy the game.

1292
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,440
Money saved.

1293
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,200
Don't you want some chicken fries?

1294
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,800
Don't you want some chicken fries?

1295
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,520
Yeah, I do.

1296
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:06,480
Anyways, so, you know, getting back into the swing of things here, now, this week actually

1297
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,000
for games is probably the largest week of the entire year, and that said, there's not

1298
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,400
a lot of good stuff coming out actually, which is really sad, but for the 360 though, there

1299
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,840
are some pretty interesting things, Dead or Alive Extreme 2 is finally making its way

1300
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:28,840
out into the market, so if you're looking for a lot of TNA, well, you won't have to

1301
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,480
wait much longer.

1302
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,200
Also Rainbow Six Vegas for the 360.

1303
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:38,640
That's the way to get some chicken fries and some TNA.

1304
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:46,000
Aragon is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and then the portable systems.

1305
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,560
Pimp My Ride on PlayStation 2, actually, no, I forgot that one got delayed a week.

1306
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:57,040
But anyways, what were you going to say there, Rob?

1307
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:02,640
Something really sarcastic about Pimp My Ride the game, but I really need to shut up tonight,

1308
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,760
because we're going to get angry emails, you know, Rob talks too much on the program.

1309
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:14,280
I downloaded this podcast having no idea that Rob would talk so much, I mean, his fucking

1310
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,960
picture is on the little album art, but I never knew he would talk so much.

1311
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:18,960
More lesbians!

1312
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,960
More lesbians!

1313
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:25,520
Okay, let's see, lots of PlayStation 3 games, of course, all the launch stuff, Mobile Suit,

1314
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:36,960
Gundam, Crossfire, NHL 2K7, NBA 2K7, Ridge Racer 7, then of course a bunch of Wii titles,

1315
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:44,080
you know, Avatar Last Airbender, Red Steel, Excite Truck, Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess,

1316
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:48,480
pretty much everything that you want for the Wii is coming out Red Steel.

1317
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,200
Other than all that stuff, Bionicle Heroes is coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube 360,

1318
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,280
the DS, Game Boy Advance, Tomb Raider is finally coming out on the Nintendo systems, Capcom

1319
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,320
Classics Collection Volume 2 is on PlayStation 2 and Xbox, the Sega Genesis Collection finally

01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:14,680
coming out, Guitar Man Lives on the PSP, Final Fantasy III on the DS, Gunpei on PlayStation

1321
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:24,400
2 and the DS, and then of course, there's just so much crap coming out, it's amazing.

1322
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,440
Yeah, more than I would even want to list.

1323
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,400
All your PlayStation 3 launch titles, all your Wii launch titles, a lot of other stuff

1324
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:39,420
mixed in there, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 07, this is just too much shit.

1325
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:44,920
You know the commercial Nintendo should have aired, this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, come on

1326
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:49,840

1327
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:56,720

1328
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,720

1329
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:07,200
all coming out this week, pass.

1330
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,860
Well how about a little bit different release news?

1331
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:13,400
Did you play the demo, I mean it was poopy, I mean it was very poopy, Sonic the Hedgehog

1332
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
360?

1333
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,400
Yes.

1334
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
Yeah it was poop.

1335
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
I talked about that last week.

1336
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,400
I know you did.

1337
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,120
Were that all for our US release dates?

1338
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,120
I'm done, no.

1339
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,120
Uh huh.

1340
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Was that all for our US release dates?

1341
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:29,120
Yeah, there's too much for me to list, I mean honestly, Polarium Advanced, I mean if you

1342
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,040
really want to buy that.

1343
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:35,000
Well, we've got a few releases coming up for the UK.

1344
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:43,080
14th November, we have EverQuest 2 Echoes of Thadewire for PC, 17th a good number, Asterix

1345
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:50,720
Noble XXL 2 Mission Las Vegas on PSP and DS, dude I miss Asterix Noble X, I used to read

1346
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:56,280
these comics back in the day, Gears of War on the 17th, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

1347
01:07:56,280 --> 01:08:02,560
Premium Edition on Xbox 360, Heroes of Might and Magic 5 Hammers of Fate Luminesce 2 on

1348
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:12,520
PSP, Mind Quiz on PSP, Superman Returns the Video Game on DS, Sims 2 Pets on GBA, so have

1349
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,520
fun.

1350
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:20,200
Others just a little bit of other stuff to look forward to within the month is Rule of

1351
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:26,040
Rose, Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Guitar Hero 2 on the 24th.

1352
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:31,960
Instead of have fun, wouldn't that be, have a jolly old time, have a jolly old time, I'm

1353
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,240
just kidding.

1354
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,160
The chat room's asking who fed me sugar before the show, Jamie actually, she brought me a

1355
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,160
cookie.

1356
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
I brought cookies.

1357
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,200
It was like a coffee cookie, so it was sugar and caffeine and apparently it was laced with

1358
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,200
crack.

1359
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,200
Apparently.

1360
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,200
Yeah.

1361
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:50,720
That's right, I had Tiara's Latte Cheesecake too.

1362
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,720
It all comes together.

1363
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,920
Hey Japan, how about some release dates?

1364
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,880
You guys have the PS3 now, so you're getting some games this week, including Majang Kakuto

1365
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,200
Club which comes out November 16th, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on November 17th, and Need

1366
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,680
for Speed Carbon on November 20th.

1367
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,120
You've got to wait until December 2nd for the Wii though, sorry kids.

1368
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:13,880
You do get a lot of PlayStation 2 releases coming out this week.

1369
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:17,920
You get Rhapsodia, which is going into the Konami The Best series, it's actually getting

1370
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,200
a little bit of a price cut, and let's see, White Princess II is coming out on the 16th

1371
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,200
as well.

1372
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,100
That also appears to be going into a collection.

1373
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:33,160
This game is also going into a collection, and this might be my import title of the week.

1374
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,480
It's Kashi Mashi Girl Meets Girl.

1375
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,440
Hey, I want that one.

1376
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,640
I'll bet it does.

1377
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,680
Girl Meets Girl, and much Kashi Mashi ensues.

1378
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:51,600
Let's see, we also have on the Nintendo DS Puzzle Series Volumes 5, 6, and 7 from Hudson,

1379
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,400
Magic Taizen and Akumajo Dracula, that's just a bundle there, Gallery of Labyrinth comes

1380
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,400
out.

1381
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,100
Oh, that's the Portrait of Ruin title, that's what they're calling it over in Japan.

1382
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,520
That's not a bundle, sorry kids, that's just that game.

1383
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,840
If you're a PSP player, Metal Gear Acid 2 is going into the best this week on the 16th.

1384
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,280
You get a Sudoku game from Hudson on the 16th, and Gunpei, oh wait, that's the 20th, sorry,

1385
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,240
you've got to wait a little while longer for that one.

1386
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:20,080
And that's all I've got for you.

1387
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,080
Excellent.

1388
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:26,760
Well, with the Wii coming out here pretty soon, and of course Virtual Console also launching

1389
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,760
relatively soon, there's lots of titles coming out, and more of course being leaked by the

1390
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:42,720
ESRB, including some gun games, Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure,

1391
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,080
Pilot Wings, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, and Wild Gunman.

1392
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,880
In other words, seriously, the games I really want.

1393
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,520
I mean, that's what this pack is right here.

1394
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,520
The games I really want.

1395
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:56,520
It's the Rob pack.

1396
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,520
As opposed to the first pack, which was like games I kind of will buy if I have extra money.

1397
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,040
These are the games that are like Kid Icarus, Hogan's Alley, they used to have that game

1398
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,720
at, what was that place called, that Burger Joint, Flaky Jake's, remember that place?

1399
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,480
That's what FUD Records used to be years ago.

1400
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,400
They had a freaking, yeah, somebody who's lived here a long time knows what I'm talking

1401
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,400
about.

1402
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,000
They had a Hogan's Alley machine back in the day, and Wild Gunman is like the most simple

1403
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,200
game ever made.

1404
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,440
Have you ever played Wild Gunman?

1405
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,440
No.

1406
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,660
That's the concept of Wild Gunman.

1407
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:27,000
The person goes, draw, and you fire the zapper gun as fast as you can.

1408
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
That's all it is.

1409
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's basically, they could re-release this game as push the button fast, and that's exactly

1410
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
what it is.

1411
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,200
It was in Back to the Future, Loki, if you remember Back to the Future.

1412
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,660
Yeah, I remember that.

1413
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,840
That's the game that was there.

1414
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,360
Was it also in the Karate Kid?

1415
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,000
No, I might be on crack.

1416
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,400
No, that was skeet shooting.

1417
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,400
Never mind.

1418
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,400
I'm on crack.

1419
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,040
Well, it's kind of stupid, though, that they have Dunk Hunt coming out anyways, because

1420
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:55,200
I mean, was it that Wii Play game was pretty much Duck Hunt anyways?

1421
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:02,680
Of course, we're not getting Wii Play, because we're the United States, and the fucking UK

1422
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:03,680
gets it.

1423
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,680
Bastards.

1424
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,240
It would be nice if they would rename Hogan's Alley Hogan Knows Best's Alley, because then

1425
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:13,800
I could zap Brooke, and that would bring me endless days of excitement.

1426
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,920
Hogan's Heroes Alley.

1427
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,780
Hogan!

1428
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,680
The Hogan Family Alley.

1429
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,400
I just killed Sandy Duncan.

1430
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:27,260
And if you caught that reference, you totally are an 80s child.

1431
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:28,680
Even Matt's laughing at that one.

1432
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:29,680
Wow.

1433
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,680
I don't even know why.

1434
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,880
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1435
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,800
Don't you remember The Hogan Family?

1436
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:36,800
Never mind, forget it.

1437
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:37,800
No.

1438
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,000
I remember The Hogan Family.

1439
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Thank you.

1440
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,080
You know what else I remember?

1441
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,380
What?

1442
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,840
When this show was good?

1443
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,840
Yeah.

1444
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,840
I remember when we were in episode 2.

1445
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,840
Was it Mike?

1446
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,840
Yeah, yeah.

1447
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
Yeah?

1448
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,840
Yeah.

1449
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,840
I asked off mic.

1450
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
Oh.

1451
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,840
Yep.

1452
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,840
Yes, it's your turn to read a story, Jamie.

1453
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,680
Tell us a story!

1454
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,440
Tell us a story, Jamie.

1455
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,440
Okay.

1456
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,800
In other news, the ferret is on fire.

1457
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:06,800
Good.

1458
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Whatever.

1459
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,960
Yeah, guess what?

1460
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,720
Namco has registered new Katamari Damacy trademarks, so we can get more ball rolling

1461
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,720
in.

1462
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:24,400
We have beautiful Katamari Damacy, Katamari Damacy Trybian, and there was an application

1463
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,840
filed for Katamari Damacy-kun.

1464
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
Ball rolling.

1465
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,520
And to think I skipped the PSP version of Katamari.

1466
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:38,360
Hey, we talked about man cannons the other week.

1467
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,080
Can you roll a Katamari into a man cannon?

1468
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,080
What would happen?

1469
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,080
That would be a...

1470
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,960
A big black cock.

1471
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,960
Wow.

1472
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:52,560
That reference is about 150 episodes old, and people aren't going to get it, and they're

1473
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,240
going to go, what the fuck is wrong with Jamie?

1474
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,280
29, look it up.

1475
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,680
Oh, Drunami knows what episode number.

1476
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,680
You are sad.

1477
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,680
You're adored.

1478
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,680
You are sad.

1479
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,680
It was my first time in the studio.

1480
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:06,680
29.

1481
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,680
29, he says.

1482
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:08,680
All right.

1483
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,680
Anyway, sorry.

1484
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:14,080
Oh, my turn.

1485
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,280
Xbox Live is getting another new game very soon, and this is one I know that's near and

1486
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:22,560
dear to at least one person's heart in this room, Worms.

1487
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,560
You remember Worms?

1488
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,560
Yeah.

1489
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,440
Worms HD is coming.

1490
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:30,600
Right now, plans for announcements are being discussed with Microsoft right now.

1491
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,400
The game is in final certification stages, so maybe we'll get this by the end of the

1492
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
year.

1493
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,400
That would be rad.

1494
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,400
Hopefully.

1495
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,400
But I don't know.

1496
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,080
Rumor is that the release calendar is full for the year, so this might have to wait until

1497
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,080
next year.

1498
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,080
Oh!

1499
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,080
Here's my thought.

1500
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,080
Are we getting another UNO pack?

1501
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,080
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

1502
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,080
God, that's...

1503
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:52,400
You know, if another game gets delayed, I really can't fucking wait for the Viva Pinata

1504
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,400
UNO pack.

1505
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,400
I just...

1506
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,480
God, I'm on pins and fucking needles waiting for that.

1507
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,920
I have 100 points saved just so I can buy the Viva Pinata UNO pack.

1508
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:02,920
I hope one of these games...

1509
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:03,920
No!

1510
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,720
Of course I'm lying!

1511
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:09,440
This game could be put in when some other game gets delayed if it's ready to go.

1512
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:12,080
You know one of those other games is going to get delayed because they're going to go,

1513
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,240
gee, when we do the upscrolling level, it looks completely different on two different

1514
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
screens.

1515
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,920
Anyway, Worms is the game, of course.

1516
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,280
It's like scorched earth!

1517
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,040
It's scorched earth in wormy form.

1518
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:28,560
And you know, you fire bombs and blast them and you know, all that stuff.

1519
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Banana bombs.

1520
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
Holy hand grenades!

1521
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
Yes!

1522
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,560
Super sheep!

1523
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:38,220
I've actually been quoting lines from Monty Python all weekend, and I was quoting the

1524
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,720
holy hand grenade thing at the Metreon.

1525
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:46,680
Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that it might blow thine enemies to tiny bits,

1526
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
in thy mercy.

1527
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:53,280
Oh, at the wax museum, that's right.

1528
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,160
Something completely different, you say?

1529
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,600
How about Linux on the Wii?

1530
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
I was going to say Wii on Linux.

1531
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,280
That'd be a little weird.

1532
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:06,000
No, but anyways, yes, Wii and Linux.

1533
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,920
WEE-lee, you say, yes, that's actually what it's called, WEE-lee, and it's being done.

1534
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,080
I see what you did there.

1535
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:23,160
Yeah, okay, anyways, so it's actually being worked on, and supposedly they're going to

1536
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:27,560
start beta testing this thing as soon as the Wii comes out, because it's based on the GameCube

1537
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,480
Linux as well.

1538
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:34,320
Some things that they're aiming to be able to do with this, surfing the internet using,

1539
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,040
you know, the control, of course, as a mouse pointer, even though you can do that anyways.

1540
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:45,960
Wii media extender, to stream movies and music and stuff from your PC to the Wii and to your

1541
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:46,960
TV.

1542
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,360
They said, basically, think Apple ITV for free.

1543
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:56,560
Write document with a regular USB keyboard and print with any USB printer.

1544
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:04,160
So you could print money, huh, huh, see?

1545
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,840
Email and chat with your friends.

1546
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:18,880
50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, guys, 50 dollar bill, sorry I was late.

1547
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:25,740
Play classic games using the MAME console emulator, that'd be an irony right there.

1548
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:33,220
Develop your own programs and games, control WEE-lee from your PC using a Wi-Fi connection,

1549
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:41,600
and use WEE-lee and the Wii as a network attached storage by connecting it to an external USB

1550
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,240
hard drive.

1551
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,280
And pretty much anything else you can do on a PC.

1552
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,200
So I don't know, that's pretty cool.

1553
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:53,320
I've signed up to, hopefully, beta test this, so probably more of the come as the Wii gets

1554
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
launched.

1555
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
Oh, WEE-lee.

1556
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
WEE-lee.

1557
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:59,240
I'm waiting for the picture of the owl.

1558
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,760
And now that I've said, oh, is there, oh, there it is.

1559
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,160
Oh, no, that's the Linux penguin, that's not an owl.

1560
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,280
But it's dressed up like Mario.

1561
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,280
I know, that's cute.

1562
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,600
No, I'm waiting for the, you know, the famous owl that says, oh, really, I'm waiting for

1563
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,600
the, oh, WEE-lee one.

1564
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,600
Oh.

1565
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,600
All right.

1566
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,640
Anyway, sorry to encourage that behavior on the internet.

1567
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,880
Oh, come on, you know you like to encourage mass hysteria.

1568
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:27,300
Speaking of mass hysteria, this won't really encourage any of it, but it's kind of cool.

1569
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,200
For those five people still playing Animal Crossing DS, which I need to actually clean

1570
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,560
out my village and start doing that because this is pretty cool, with the launch of Twilight

1571
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:42,860
Princess on 19th November, Nintendo will be giving away a very special and rare gift in

1572
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:49,020
Animal Crossing according to their press release.

1573
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:55,160
If you connect via Nintendo Wi-Fi during the week of November 17th through 24th, you'll

1574
01:18:55,160 --> 01:19:01,200
receive a letter from Nintendo, which will show up in your mailbox, and you will receive

1575
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:04,320
an attached item.

1576
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,440
So it could be anything.

1577
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,320
Accompanied with the letter will be a corrupt item that will erase your save and say, go

1578
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,640
buy a Wii, stop playing the DS.

1579
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,560
No, it'll be a flower that you put in your house and then you can't put anything in that

1580
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:19,560
corner of your house.

1581
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:21,160
Oh, wait, they already did that.

1582
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:26,560
I actually went to NintendoWifi.com just to prove Jamie wrong because I like to do that,

1583
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,360
and it shows 20 random Wi-Fi players, and look at that, six people are playing Animal

1584
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,900
Crossing Wild World right now.

1585
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:40,480
We have Danny Boy is playing, and Phil is playing, and IJ, and Mike, and Christina with

1586
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:45,760
a lowercase c because she's poetic, and look at this, Rob is playing Animal Crossing right

1587
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,760
now.

1588
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:50,400
Hey, Rob, this is just for you.

1589
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:59,200
There may only be six people in the world playing Animal Crossing Wild World right this

1590
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,320
moment, but 1.5 million people are playing Final Fantasy XII.

1591
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,680
At least that's what Square Enix will have you believe because they sent out a press

1592
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:12,960
release earlier this week saying that Final Fantasy XII has 1.5 million units on shelves.

1593
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,240
Okay, well, I guess 1.5 million people aren't really playing it, but yet there's that many

1594
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,880
copies in circulation, so soon 1.5 million people will be playing it.

1595
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:26,720
Final Fantasy XII, by the way, for the records, did 2.4 million copies in Japan, so it will

1596
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,720
be interesting to see.

1597
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,880
Wouldn't it be interesting if it sold more here than it did in Japan?

1598
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,760
Well, we all know Dragon Quest is the bigger game in Japan, so I don't know.

1599
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:38,880
By the way, Final Fantasy XII, brand new record for the total number of units shipped for

1600
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,880
the franchise.

1601
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,680
Good job, Squeenix.

1602
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,020
Good job.

1603
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,360
Some other interesting stuff.

1604
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:48,760
Now next time make the graphics less pixelated, thank you.

1605
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:54,800
Some interesting stuff for fans of Guitar Hero.

1606
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:00,080
Guitar Hero 2, of course, you may remember with the demo, it actually blocked the Ant

1607
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:06,120
Commandos controllers from working with it, and apparently that's the case also if you

1608
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:12,860
have purchased your Guitar Hero controller from them before October 1st.

1609
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:18,840
If you have, then it will not work with Guitar Hero 2 unless you purchase an adapter, which

1610
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:23,560
I believe is free, but don't hold me to that.

1611
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:28,120
Once you get the adapter, I guess everything's...

1612
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:33,520
Oh, I'm sorry, the adapter is $6.99, so yeah, if you want to play with that controller,

1613
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,120
you're going to have to pay another $7.

1614
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:42,100
But the other controllers beyond that will work with Guitar Hero 2.

1615
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,720
Apparently anything that did circumvent third-party controllers has been broken already.

1616
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,380
We kind of knew that would be coming, though.

1617
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,640
I mean, that's the Ant Commandos business right there, so they had to get around it

1618
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,640
somehow, right?

1619
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,640
Yeah.

1620
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,840
Drew, you've been playing Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit, right?

1621
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,860
I see you posting about it.

1622
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:04,120
Are you interested at all in these third-party controllers or any of that?

1623
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,840
Not really, I just don't really see any interest in them.

1624
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:13,840
I've got my SG controller from the first game, and I don't really need another one.

1625
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,720
If I feel like I'm kind of over Guitar Hero, like seriously, the hype around Guitar Hero

1626
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,680
has seriously ruined Guitar Hero for me for some weird reason?

1627
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:22,680
I don't know.

1628
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:26,040
Like, you know how when you were the only person that listened to this band, and then

1629
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,960
suddenly everybody's listening to the band, and you're like, it's just not so special

1630
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,960
anymore?

1631
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,280
Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about Guitar Hero.

1632
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:38,320
I mean, call me an elitist, whatever, but am I doing myself a disservice by not checking

1633
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:39,880
out Guitar Hero 2?

1634
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:40,880
Yes.

1635
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,720
Yes, absolutely yes, yes, very yes.

1636
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,720
Oh!

1637
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:45,720
Oh!

1638
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,720
Tiara says no.

1639
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,720
Why is that?

1640
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:53,240
Because if you spent all the time that you spend playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero

1641
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:58,200
2 learning to play an actual guitar, think of all the amazing songs you could play.

1642
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:02,840
Wait, weren't you telling me a story earlier today about somebody that was in a guitar

1643
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,840
class?

1644
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,440
Tell me the story about the girl in the guitar class.

1645
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,680
Okay, this involves my boyfriend, Adam.

1646
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,480
He's taking a guitar class at the community college, and there's a girl in his class

1647
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:19,880
who was asking him, you know, do you believe in psychics, and explaining something about

1648
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,560
this one particular psychic.

1649
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:27,760
Anyways, Adam told her, the only psychic I believe in is Professor Charles Xavier.

1650
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,640
And so her response was, does he teach at this campus?

1651
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,680
That doesn't have anything to do with Guitar Hero.

1652
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:43,440
Wait, but you were telling me, okay, yeah, okay, haha, she's stupid.

1653
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:47,920
But the other part about this was, wait, what was this, she asked him if he knew Boston,

1654
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:48,920
or what was this?

1655
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:54,480
Oh yeah, apparently all she plays is Guitar Hero because she asked him if he had ever

1656
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:57,480
heard of a band called Boston.

1657
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,480
And the song that she mentioned was the song on the original Guitar Hero.

1658
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:07,800
And every time that she says that she likes a band, and he asks what songs that she likes

1659
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:11,760
from that band, it's the song that's on Guitar Heroes, and she doesn't know any

1660
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,400
of the other songs.

1661
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:18,240
Hey, you know what, I give her credit though for at least taking Tiara's advice and going

1662
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:22,800
to take a real guitar class instead of playing Guitar Hero 2.

1663
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,160
No, I'm sure it's a great game, I just, there's other games I wanted more.

1664
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:28,160
I'll get it now.

1665
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,760
I'll get the 360 version.

1666
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,880
I swear to you I will buy the 360 one, like launch day.

1667
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,880
What?

1668
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:34,880
Rob.

1669
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,880
Rob.

1670
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:36,880
What?

1671
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,880
Rob.

1672
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,880
I will shove this mic up your butt.

1673
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:39,880
Rob!

1674
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:40,880
What?

1675
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:41,880
You can come to my house and play.

1676
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,880
I just might.

1677
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,880
Okay.

1678
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:44,880
I heard on a Bobby show tonight that it supports Progressive Scan, that's kinda cool.

1679
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,880
It looks really nice on my TV.

1680
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:46,880
Rob, that's special.

1681
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,880
What?

1682
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,560
I'll get a copy for you, and I'll put it on my Playstation 2, and you can play on

1683
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,560
that.

1684
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,560
Okay, sounds good.

1685
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,560
No, I'll get the 360 version.

1686
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,560
That's what I said earlier.

1687
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:01,440
I don't see the point in getting the Playstation 2 one when we know the 360 one will be better

1688
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,080
because of its expandability.

1689
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,000
So I can wait.

1690
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,920
Can you?

1691
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,960
I sold mine, so yes.

1692
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:14,200
Alright, on that note, we're going to go to a little bit of a break because obviously

1693
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,480
I need a sedative, so I'm gonna go take some Tylenol PM during this break, and we'll

1694
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,320
be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a little bit of a break.

1695
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:33,040
Thank you, everybody, for being with us, and we'll see you in the next one.
