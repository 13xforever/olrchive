00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:26,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, November 12, 2006, Microsoft unveils movie and television downloads, PlayStation 3 games get some new dates and some postponed dates, and can you really install Linux on the Wii?

2
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello boys and girls on the internet.

3
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:44,729
[SPEAKER_06]: We are that video game show dedicated to video games, gamer lifestyle, gamer culture, and all that other stuff.

5
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,072
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's about two and a half to three hours of just chat.

6
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:55,258
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to think of ourselves as sitting around the table at the local diner, just bitching about video games while we're waiting for our food.

7
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:59,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And the service is very slow tonight, hence why the show is about two and a half hours long.

8
00:00:59,557 --> 00:01:01,118
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, ROAR

9
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Techmaster Loki.

10
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I didn't hear most of that.

11
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:30,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe if you were listening to the show and not playing on your computer while we're trying to get things started here, maybe you would have heard my really bad comparison.

12
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:37,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to look up to see if anyone had commented on a certain story that ran earlier this week.

13
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:42,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think you should be focusing on the show now.

14
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:43,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on the show.

15
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:43,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's show related.

16
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I need your full attention, Mr. Loki.

17
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

18
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: and also say hello to our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Drew Nami.

19
00:02:17,747 --> 00:02:20,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if I don't get my French toast soon, I'm going to go kick someone's ass.

20
00:02:21,151 --> 00:02:21,371
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

21
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:22,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad service.

22
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:24,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I get it.

23
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:26,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I left the comparison.

24
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:29,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone needs to pay attention to the show, Mr. Sky.

25
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:30,520
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, shut up.

26
00:02:32,382 --> 00:02:35,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, here we are and another week.

27
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We're sitting just before the brink of madness.

28
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Video game system releases.

29
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,725
[SPEAKER_06]: PlayStation 3 and Wii.

30
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Really quickly, who's getting what?

31
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:46,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's getting what system?

32
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm getting a Wii but not a PlayStation 3 just yet.

33
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,410
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura?

34
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm getting a Wii and a PlayStation 3.

35
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:52,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

36
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting a Wii.

37
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:55,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Tiara?

38
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,436
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting nothing because I am poor.

39
00:02:59,176 --> 00:02:59,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, sorry to hear it.

40
00:02:59,657 --> 00:02:59,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Junami?

41
00:02:59,817 --> 00:02:59,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Junami?

42
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:00,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I can send you a Game Boy.

43
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We have lots of love for Tiara.

44
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:29,285
[SPEAKER_06]: She can watch us all unpack them on YouTube because apparently that makes for riveting game news this week is, you know, watch me play my Wii and rub it in your face that you don't have one.

45
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:31,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It is such horrible blogging news.

46
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:37,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, like every single blog I visited this week, I guess Nintendo loves everyone else more than us.

47
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:37,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

48
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:37,992
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

49
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:38,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm over it.

50
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:46,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But every other website is like, hey, look, here's a video on YouTube of us taking the Wii out of the box and showing it all in front of the camera.

51
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,354
[SPEAKER_06]: And then here's me playing Excite Truck.

52
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:50,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

53
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:54,175
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I'm reading the same thing on every single blog.

54
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:56,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, isn't there like Real News this week?

55
00:03:57,015 --> 00:03:58,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's still early in the week, though.

56
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:02,917
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I'm aware, Jessica Chobert has not licked the Wii.

57
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:04,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be able to beat her to that.

58
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,942
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

59
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:38,473
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?

60
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I played Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit last night.

61
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:08,554
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, quite a bit last night.

62
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,757
[SPEAKER_10]: We played all the way through Easy and then through a bunch of Medium.

63
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I will let the almighty unlocker of Trogdor tell you about that later.

64
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:27,668
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I got inspired and left the room so that I could make the pre-show with a bunch of stuff that was in Guitar Hero 2.

65
00:05:27,968 --> 00:05:30,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to put Thunder Horse from...

66
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:31,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Venture Brothers.

67
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:33,178
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the band?

68
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:33,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Deathlock.

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was going to put that in the show, but I decided not to.

70
00:05:40,283 --> 00:05:43,566
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you want to hear Trogdor, you have to stay and listen to the entire show.

71
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, if you're on the podcast, it won't do you any good.

72
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:46,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's copyrighted.

73
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:48,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, kids.

74
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I looked at Trauma Center and haven't played it yet.

75
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:56,815
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Dan started playing Final Fantasy XII for me.

76
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:58,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm a little bit upset at him.

77
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:00,598
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played some more...

78
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Samora, PSU I'm only level 3 Slowly but surely, making your way That's right, leveling is slow in PSU I played religiously for several days And I'm only like level 12 So it ain't gonna get any quicker I'm sorry to say I just solo through all the missions Seriously, play single player You level up so much faster Just skip all the cutscenes and play single player

79
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:32,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't level your online character.

80
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sadly, no, it doesn't.

81
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:34,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, then.

82
00:06:35,049 --> 00:06:36,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to level my online character.

83
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,730
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're just going to play by yourself.

84
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,872
[SPEAKER_10]: I got PSU to play through the online missions.

85
00:06:40,952 --> 00:06:42,953
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to start leveling my stuff.

86
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:44,894
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

87
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else, Miss DarkSakura?

88
00:06:50,216 --> 00:06:50,336
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

89
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,637
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

90
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,299
[SPEAKER_03]: It was full of stuff, actually.

91
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:59,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I picked up two big 360 games this week.

92
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:05,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War, which I've played for not very long, actually, so far.

93
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:06,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really played much through it.

94
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:13,922
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried a little bit of the single player, got past the first mission, and played a little bit of the multiplayer on one console.

95
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:18,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, not a real good indicator of what the multiplayer is, but it's okay.

96
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:19,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

97
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:23,287
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I don't think the multiplayer is that great.

98
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:24,909
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

99
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,254
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're wearing a Call of Duty shirt

100
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:15,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, that's Activision.

101
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:16,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

102
00:08:16,523 --> 00:08:17,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two Call of Duty shirts.

103
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:18,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Never mind.

104
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was on the top of the hamper.

105
00:08:20,244 --> 00:08:23,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, so yeah, I'll play through it.

106
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:25,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be a pretty cool game.

107
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is one good thing about it, though.

108
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:28,648
[SPEAKER_03]: The co-op is amazing.

109
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:33,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least they've got that going for it, because there aren't that many good co-op games nowadays.

110
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like Contra, I should say.

111
00:08:37,132 --> 00:08:39,693
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of reminds me of two people playing through the game.

112
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:43,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Which also leads me to Contra, which I played a little bit this week.

113
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:45,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Contra's Contra, so it's pretty cool.

114
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, Call of Duty 3 I bought.

115
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,780
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is really cool.

116
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I like the multiplayer in Call of Duty 3 a lot better.

117
00:08:55,644 --> 00:09:01,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing it locally with a few of my friends at work, and it's just fun.

118
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:03,711
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely improved over the last one.

119
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,414
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I don't like about the multiplayer in it, though, is that the...

120
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:15,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Your little HUD radar thing that they have, they do not show the gunshots going off like they used to in the first one.

121
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:20,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So, playing a 10 minute game, it might be hard to find people.

122
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:30,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, since the maps don't say how many people they're meant for, which the old one did, so you kind of get an idea of which map is large, which one's smaller, and that type of thing.

123
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,195
[SPEAKER_03]: This one's kind of flying blind.

124
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:40,519
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's pretty cool, though, because you get to drive vehicles and stuff, and I got a lot of my kills running over people with Jeeps, so that's pretty cool.

125
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like that.

126
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,901
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game looks a lot better, so that'll be pretty cool.

127
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto's Vice City Story has been playing a little bit more, of course.

128
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:57,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, playing more of this, I'm starting to like the game a little bit more, but also at the same time, I'm frustrated with how lazy their programming is.

129
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:58,805
[SPEAKER_03]: For example...

130
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:00,413
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

131
00:10:24,577 --> 00:10:51,885
[SPEAKER_03]: but they didn't because they're too fucking lazy so whatever but the game is fun um just kind of figuring out the nuances of it but still Grand Theft Auto and um I don't know it's a little bit more realistic as far as you know some of the vehicle damage and stuff and then um other than that really uh Elder Scrolls Oblivion I've played through about half of that now and hopefully gonna finish the other half I gotta grind through it so I can sell it back you know that type of thing and um

132
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:54,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Gears of War Elite Beat Agents

133
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Elite Beat Agents is the best music-based game ever for the casual player.

134
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,492
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

135
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:06,903
[SPEAKER_06]: and even some people don't want to play Guitar Hero because they're like, that's kind of weird.

136
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,804
[SPEAKER_06]: But Elite Beat Agents is easy.

137
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:11,385
[SPEAKER_06]: No one else can see because it's on the DS and it's just, you pick up the pen and go.

138
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:14,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And the song list is surprisingly really good.

139
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people were like, oh, it's got a weird combination of songs.

140
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,893
[SPEAKER_06]: But dude, if a game can make Ashley Simpson's La La kind of fun, I think it deserves a lot of credit.

141
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:25,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give Elite Beat Agents a lot of credit.

142
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,415
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny, it cracked me up.

143
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:33,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Even one stage is kind of sad and a little bit sniffly, but you know, I wouldn't cry because I'm a man.

144
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:33,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

145
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:36,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, the game's a lot of fun.

146
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:41,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, for those that don't know, the essential element of the game is that you tap.

147
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:46,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You tap on the bottom screen, but you follow these patterns, and you tap, like, in the beat of the music.

148
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:55,603
[SPEAKER_06]: For instance, if you're playing Material Girl, your tapping might go along with the words, like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, and you kind of drag the stylus in some parts, too, and follow a little ball.

149
00:12:55,663 --> 00:13:00,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a lot more fun than it sounds, because the animations and things really kind of keep you involved.

150
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:03,207
[SPEAKER_06]: The only small complaint I have with the game is that, you know...

151
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:04,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

152
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:21,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It just runs even smoothly, so it's great

153
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:54,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Other game I picked up this week and played is Luminous 2, which is out on the PSP.

154
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,117
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Luminous was my absolute favorite game that was released this year.

155
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:04,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I still have a lot of love for Luminous 2 because they didn't really change anything.

156
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:10,899
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's also kind of my biggest problem with Luminous 2 is that half of the skins were Luminous 1 skins.

157
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:15,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think a lot of people picked up on this because maybe people played Luminous 1 and then forgot about it.

158
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:24,283
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously, if you think... For instance, those folks that follow music-based games, if you think DDR repeats are bad, Luminous puts it to shame.

159
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:25,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Luminous repeats...

160
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

161
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,333
[SPEAKER_06]: There's mission mode involved, and versus involved, and there's a demo of every extent extra.

162
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,075
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of new modes that keep it fresh.

163
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:00,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't own the original Luminous, there's a lot for you.

164
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you like puzzle games at all, you definitely need to have Luminous 2.

165
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:08,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a must-own game if you don't have the original Luminous.

166
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,005
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do have the original Luminous, then I would ask you...

167
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,767
[SPEAKER_06]: How important are these new modes to you?

168
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:17,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to be able to use your own music?

169
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to be able to do this other stuff?

170
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you really want to play the Hollaback Girl?

171
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,573
[SPEAKER_06]: How much of a necessity is that to you?

172
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:28,676
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the answer is, I must, then sure, go get the game.

173
00:15:29,576 --> 00:15:30,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only $30.

174
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:31,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a bad value.

175
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:40,443
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if you would want this and the Xbox Live one unless you are just really crazy about your puzzle games or you're luminous.

176
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:42,033
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

177
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:15,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of tea, Tiara, would you like to share your gaming week with us?

178
00:16:15,147 --> 00:16:16,148
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of stuff you've been playing?

179
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,772
[SPEAKER_07]: As Soy said, we played Guitar Heroes 2 last night.

180
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:33,640
[SPEAKER_07]: She was around long enough to beat easy mode, and then I played through medium, or whatever you call it, normal mode, long enough to unlock Trogdor.

181
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we played Trogdor, and then we went to sleep.

182
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:39,104
[SPEAKER_07]: But before that...

183
00:16:39,617 --> 00:17:08,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I played Tetris on my phone for a million hours while we waited for A Nightmare Before Christmas to start because somebody bought tickets for the 12.30 show and we actually got there at like 10.30 so it was like two hours of Tetris joy I thought I was going to get lost she got lost everywhere else, that's all but I got lost in a cool way because we found underneath the Golden Gate Bridge yeah, under but that's it, excitement, the end

184
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, actually, I want to interview you for a little bit because you haven't been on the show in a long time.

185
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:17,114
[SPEAKER_06]: And last time you were on the show was when we were still exclusively talking about music-based games.

186
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:22,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have a whole new world and more people listen to the show thanks to iTunes and XBStream and all games and all that stuff.

187
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:25,498
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of games do you enjoy?

188
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a computer gamer?

189
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a console gamer?

190
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,681
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you say is your favorite way of playing games?

191
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:38,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, my outside of the home life has been so busy lately that I haven't really done a lot of gaming.

192
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:39,345
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually gave up WoW.

193
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,837
[SPEAKER_07]: which was amazing because I never thought I would do that.

194
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:53,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, I was so addicted and I was like main healer in my guild and everything and one day I was just like, you know what, I think outside is nice too.

195
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go outdoors and play today.

196
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:58,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you from so our listeners know?

197
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from Las Vegas.

198
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:00,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Las Vegas.

199
00:18:00,268 --> 00:18:02,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we have some listeners in Vegas so very cool.

200
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:03,139
[SPEAKER_06]: GuardianLegend

201
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Best 8-bit game ever.

202
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:28,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Find it.

203
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:28,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

204
00:18:28,645 --> 00:18:29,245
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best.

205
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the most underrated title ever.

206
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:36,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not shut up about this game until I get my sequel on one of the next-gen consoles.

207
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:40,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if, like, the rights are somewhere in a black hole right now.

208
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking find those rights.

209
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a sequel to The Guardian Legend.

210
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,251
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that much to ask.

211
00:18:45,411 --> 00:18:45,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

212
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:48,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Just write your congressman.

213
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:51,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to write Feinstein tonight and say...

214
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a bill passed that will make them make a Guardian Legend 2.

215
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,580
[SPEAKER_06]: P.S.

216
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm crazy.

217
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:59,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Junami, how was your gaming week?

218
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:05,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, similar to Yarrarar, I sort of gave up WoW for a bit even though I'm still freaking paying for it.

219
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:17,127
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing Guitar Hero 2 for most of the week, unlocked everything, everything, beat hard mode, that kind of stuff.

220
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:18,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been going outdoors.

221
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:19,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going bar doors.

222
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, you live in Vegas.

223
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to Vegas.

224
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:51,669
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing to do outdoors in Vegas except make things out of dirt.

225
00:19:52,069 --> 00:19:56,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything you do in Vegas is indoors and pretty and lights and all that stuff.

226
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:58,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, when you live in Vegas, you hate the casinos, don't you?

227
00:19:59,612 --> 00:19:59,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

228
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:00,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I hear.

229
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:06,154
[SPEAKER_07]: We've just passed the law for no smoking in restaurants and stuff, so that should be nice.

230
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:06,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

231
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:08,375
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be crazy.

232
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,482
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't pass the law for smoking marijuana, though, because all of those stupid stoners were too stoned to go vote!

233
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:38,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's go to our chat room, which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com and get some comments from our chat room, because the folks over there, we have quite a big crowd there tonight.

234
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making some good comments there, except now I can't find any.

235
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:44,333
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of people that are listening tonight that say they live in Vegas.

236
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:49,216
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Janai, Gilder, both live in Vegas, saying hello.

237
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:52,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, to that press start, says, does not live in Vegas.

238
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeremy Todd 1 is shocked that Adrenami is giving up World of Warcraft.

239
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

240
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:28,640
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah, for those that didn't hear, I put out a call the other week because remember when Tack Johnson decided to sue Midway or, I don't know, wrote a nasty letter to Midway or whatever he did over the fact that there was create a character and somebody made his likeness?

241
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put out a challenge to our listeners to create Tack Johnson in as many different likenesses as you could in different games.

242
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I was hoping to see one in Oblivion.

243
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, FootyMonster put one up from what?

244
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:41,265
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it, City of Heroes?

245
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:42,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe so.

246
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:43,831
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Villains.

247
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, how appropriate.

248
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:45,653
[SPEAKER_06]: City of Villains.

249
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:47,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

250
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,597
[SPEAKER_06]: The OL Army salutes you, footy monster.

251
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:52,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

252
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:52,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see more.

253
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,059
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else we need to do?

254
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:54,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

255
00:21:54,779 --> 00:22:01,684
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to give our special foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis a shout-out.

256
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:03,806
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Puppy's birthday.

257
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:04,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

258
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So, happy birthday to Puppy.

259
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:07,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday, Puppy.

260
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:11,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And in dog years, he's, like, going to fall over and die any moment now.

261
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:12,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

262
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:15,254
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do I want to say regarding chat comments?

263
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:20,500
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTodd1 asked me in regards to my gaming week, which game is better, Luminous Live, Luminous 1, or Luminous 2?

264
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:24,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.

265
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if you don't own any of them...

266
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,228
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have a PSP, Luminous 2 is probably the best one.

267
00:22:32,848 --> 00:22:35,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because it practically has all of Luminous 1 in it.

268
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:44,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you already own Luminous 1, the question is, are these little upgrades and the fact that they're going to recycle half of what you already have, is that enough for you to upgrade the game?

269
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

270
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:46,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends how addicted you are to the game.

271
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think Luminous Live is pretty cool too, though, for those that don't have a PSP.

272
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:53,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't go out and buy a PSP just for Luminous like I did.

273
00:22:55,253 --> 00:22:58,636
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox Live one is fine, it's just that the Xbox needs a better D-pad.

274
00:22:58,696 --> 00:23:00,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs a better D-pad.

275
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:10,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, some third party, I don't know, maybe there's Microsoft issues why nobody's done this yet, but seriously, somebody needs to put out a better D-pad for the Xbox 360.

276
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:13,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody.

277
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:19,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, Luminous Live has Xbox Live and all that stuff, which is kind of cool, so I'll say that's cool.

278
00:23:20,578 --> 00:23:21,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Housekeeping!

279
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:53,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say this, I got served.

280
00:23:53,648 --> 00:24:04,655
[SPEAKER_06]: If you listen to part B of last week's show, I said, we were talking about a rumor at that time that Microsoft was going to be offering movies and TV downloads, and I said, no way, they won't do it.

281
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:10,879
[SPEAKER_06]: If they sold HD downloads, it would totally nerf the sales of the HD DVD.

282
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did Microsoft announce on Tuesday?

283
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:17,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that they're going to be offering a movie and TV downloads in HD formats.

284
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got told.

285
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:30,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, they announced that various shows from MTV, CBS, movies from such places like Paramount Pictures, all this stuff would be available.

286
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:38,733
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, there's some screenshots circulating, and you can see some downloads include V for Vendetta, Poseidon, Cradle to the Grave, Lethal Weapon 4.

287
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:44,795
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the TV stuff they're offering, old school Star Trek, but the redone special effects, that one.

288
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:51,995
[SPEAKER_06]: and Survivor and Pimp My Ride because you really wanted to have that on the Microsoft 360.

289
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:03,728
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically in a recent story that was on Joystick, Scott Henson from Microsoft talked a little bit about how things would work.

290
00:25:04,468 --> 00:25:16,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Henson mentioned that the files that you download, they will be stored on the 360's hard drive unit and there's not going to be an option to stream videos from the Windows computer because you can kind of already do that if they're in WMV.

291
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:17,800
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

292
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:39,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Your average 22-minute high-definition TV show will be about 1 gigabyte, and the standard definition version will be 300 megabytes.

293
00:25:39,944 --> 00:25:42,287
[SPEAKER_06]: 720p is what all the high-def stuff is going to be encoded in.

294
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:43,108
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to go up to 1080.

295
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I would imagine that's because of space concerns.

296
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:48,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And 720p is really not that bad.

297
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:53,659
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have the eye to distinguish between the two, then maybe you ought to just get an HD-DVD drive and do it that way.

298
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

299
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:56,827
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

300
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:17,798
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura?

301
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:18,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the internet.

302
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need this.

303
00:26:46,544 --> 00:26:50,326
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you endorsing underground schemes such as BitTorrent?

304
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I make no secret of it.

305
00:26:53,228 --> 00:27:03,794
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think that it's a good idea in theory for people who maybe aren't so computer savvy, maybe.

306
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:11,979
[SPEAKER_10]: Or people who, you know, are slaves to MTV's programming content and can't live without, you know,

307
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:16,633
[SPEAKER_10]: The same mindless stuff that they throw out at everybody on their regular station.

308
00:27:16,673 --> 00:27:18,454
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to infect Xbox Live as well.

309
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So more power to them.

310
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,297
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have YouTube.

311
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:24,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fair enough.

312
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:30,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Well technically YouTube's not supposed to have a lot of that content on there anyways and they've gotten in trouble for that.

313
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:33,603
[SPEAKER_10]: But I have DVDs as well.

314
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:35,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

315
00:27:55,313 --> 00:27:56,094
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

316
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:23,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

317
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:41,746
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

318
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:11,018
[SPEAKER_03]: to be wanting to download that, but, no, no, no, that show is, it's, I like the show, I just wouldn't pay for the show.

319
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:29,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun show, it's just like Mythbusters, I'd love watching, that's something that they didn't have on there, they should have episodes of Mythbusters, because that's an awesome show, but, you know, hey, I noticed something though, I noticed that G4 shows weren't on there, and that's kind of surprising too, I mean, you'd think that

320
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:35,210
[SPEAKER_03]: A cable network like that would want to, I don't know, sell their shows to make any sorts of money that they can possibly make?

321
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Good riddance, I say.

322
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:50,756
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's interesting, though, that Microsoft is not embracing yet the online, the huge resource online there is of free videos and free audio streams, such as podcasts and vodcasts and that whole thing.

323
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:59,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, I'm sorry, blogcasts and vlogcasts, if you are an Xbox 360-only type person that won't call them podcasts.

324
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:01,525
[SPEAKER_03]: God, retarded.

325
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:03,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, I don't care, whatever.

326
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,350
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a word.

327
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:07,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, I'm curious, real quick.

328
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:08,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew, is this something that interests you?

329
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:12,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, considering I don't even have a 360.

330
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, then, enough said.

331
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:16,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I asked the wrong person.

332
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:18,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't bother asking Tiara, then.

333
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:19,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me think.

334
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what do you think about this, though, the Trojan horse aspect of this?

335
00:30:23,994 --> 00:30:25,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we – I mean, a lot of people were saying this.

336
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:31,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just us, but a year ago when these next-gen systems were first being formed, a lot of us said, oh, these are Trojan horses.

337
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:36,327
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be put in your living room under the guise of a game system, but they're going to be all this entertainment in a box.

338
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at it.

339
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:37,928
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming to life.

340
00:30:39,189 --> 00:30:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also like to point out that at the Xbox 360 demo thing that they had where you sat on the floor and the thing rumbled on your butt, the big speaker thing, that they said all this.

341
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:58,654
[SPEAKER_10]: It was part of their thing when they had the Xbox 360 at E3 years ago.

342
00:30:58,754 --> 00:31:01,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so like something that they teased a long time ago.

343
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:01,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

344
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, very interesting.

345
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:03,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course they want to do that.

346
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:04,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's

347
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:09,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Their media center PCs aren't selling that great, so they gotta sell something that's like a media center.

348
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:11,236
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long before the PlayStation 3 follows?

349
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:12,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Instantly.

350
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, instantly.

351
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:18,101
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it comes out, it's there.

352
00:31:18,381 --> 00:31:20,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Where will Nintendo fit into all this, or do they care?

353
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:21,344
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care.

354
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:24,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo doesn't really have to care.

355
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:25,887
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Nintendo.

356
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:27,048
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have to care yet.

357
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:32,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, after all, they're not even jumping on the online bandwagon yet.

358
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:43,006
[SPEAKER_03]: But, so anyways, with most everything that's released nowadays or announced for Microsoft, Sony always has to make a counterpoint to anything.

359
00:31:43,606 --> 00:31:47,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And their big thing was, oh yeah, this download service sucks.

360
00:31:49,447 --> 00:31:53,048
[SPEAKER_10]: In that case, I do have to agree with Sony, because, well...

361
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:58,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Your hard drive is not really going to be able to accommodate the volume you'll be downloading.

362
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:03,338
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, Microsoft's even pretty much said the same thing.

363
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:18,008
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Aaron Greenberg, who was the group product marketing manager, actually said that they aren't ready to bring out a larger hard drive yet so that basically you can use your memory card and get your own hard drive and use it to...

364
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:28,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, because we're too lazy to put out an 80 gig hard drive right now, you should just buy four 20 gigs to store all this shit.

365
00:32:29,503 --> 00:32:33,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's basically kind of the same thing that Sony was saying about their content.

366
00:32:34,146 --> 00:32:39,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box, which is...

367
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:40,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

368
00:33:00,302 --> 00:33:03,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could do that with the PS2 as well though.

369
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:03,744
[SPEAKER_03]: With their HD unit.

370
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the hard drive thing that

371
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:27,727
[SPEAKER_10]: We put like 150 gig on ours.

372
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:36,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for non-online Sony game related stuff.

373
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:43,713
[SPEAKER_10]: But also a lot of games, especially in Japan, made big use of the hard drive because you would load a good portion of a game.

374
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:52,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, on, what was it, 6th style, 2DX 6th style, you could, with the hard drive, you could load all the songs into the hard drive and then play the...

375
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:56,354
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that mode called?

376
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:58,595
[SPEAKER_10]: The marathon mode?

377
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-stop or whatever it is.

378
00:33:59,976 --> 00:34:00,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Endless.

379
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:05,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you could just play endless until you lost.

380
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,923
[SPEAKER_10]: They even had some games where, I believe, wasn't it Final Fantasy XII?

381
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,124
[SPEAKER_10]: You could load onto the hard drive too?

382
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:13,807
[SPEAKER_06]: The 2DX Nazis in our chat room are correcting you.

383
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:15,208
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 5th style, not 6th style.

384
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:16,569
[SPEAKER_10]: It was one of those.

385
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I was close.

386
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,052
[SPEAKER_06]: When you consider there's like, what, like,

387
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:31,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I gave up after 8th style, which was the last good one, thank you.

388
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I want to make a comment on this.

389
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:35,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this guy that said I need to buy multiple hard drives?

390
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:36,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was it that said that?

391
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Aaron somebody.

392
00:34:39,235 --> 00:34:41,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron somebody, fuck a whole lot of you, okay?

393
00:34:41,357 --> 00:34:51,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, look, when your two biggest competitors are offering something better already, you got no room to be making this statement about how I should be buying additional 100 gig hard drives.

394
00:34:52,046 --> 00:35:03,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, 360, I still love ya, but right now, look, I can get an 80 gig hard drive in the size of my hand with the iPod, take it wherever I want, and then with the Sony department, you're gonna be able to put whatever hard drive you want in it.

395
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:03,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It's

396
00:35:03,996 --> 00:35:09,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Laptop hard drives are not $100, especially a 20 gig hard drive for a laptop is dirt cheap.

397
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:23,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that you can buy a 150 gig laptop drive for probably less than you're going to be spending on whatever their next hard drive that they come out for the 360, which is probably going to be like 60 or something.

398
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it's just retarded.

399
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:28,655
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

400
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:45,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on to another topic, sticking with Xbox, because I do, you know, even if I think this whole lack of a larger hard drive thing is a little bit silly, Xbox does do a lot of things right, and one of them is the Xbox Live Arcade, despite the fact that Contra is kind of broken.

401
00:35:48,553 --> 00:36:01,901
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some new games coming out for Xbox Live Arcade, including, before the end of the year, Assault Heroes, Heavy Weapon, Novadrome, and yes, Loki, just for you, Small Arms, all coming out before the end of the year.

402
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:12,587
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Microsoft also this week announced a partnership with Atari to bring some classic Atari games to Xbox Live in 2007, as if they didn't have enough retro titles.

403
00:36:12,647 --> 00:36:13,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen pictures of them, too.

404
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:14,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

405
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:14,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

406
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:15,588
[SPEAKER_03]: They look pretty good.

407
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've got, you know, kind of like the Konami titles on there.

408
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:23,710
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their retro mode and their, you know, kind of remastered mode, I guess.

409
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:31,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the games you'll be able to get, Warlords, Tempest, Missile Command, Centipede and Millipede, Battlezone, and Asteroids slash Asteroids Deluxe.

410
00:36:31,992 --> 00:36:36,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, they're going to have, like, the evolved mode is what they're calling it in the Atari games.

411
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:41,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Supposedly, you can play games like Warlords online, which I guess is kind of cool, but I think like most retro games...

412
00:36:42,611 --> 00:36:46,833
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be thrilling for about 20 minutes, and then you'll be, why did I spend 400 points on this?

413
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:50,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much a lot of the games.

414
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're Loki, you'll say, are the achievements easy?

415
00:36:53,976 --> 00:36:56,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I need to boost my score, because I'm a stats whore.

416
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that is true.

417
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:06,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, another thing with the 360, their last... Hey, would you say when it comes to gamer score that you're a total size queen?

418
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:11,223
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I would not use the word queen.

419
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:12,674
[SPEAKER_03]: A size king.

420
00:37:13,675 --> 00:37:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

421
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

422
00:37:16,636 --> 00:37:29,900
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for the 360, the last update they did with 1080p blocked out some of the wonderful 1080p televisions out there, and there's also been other issues with it just not being very good.

423
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:38,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, they are working on a fix right now on it, and it is being addressed, and hopefully it will be fixed relatively soon.

424
00:37:38,943 --> 00:37:39,163
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

425
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:41,460
[SPEAKER_03]: CallDuty3 comes out.

426
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,622
[SPEAKER_03]: The online is lagged, bugged, and doesn't work correctly.

427
00:37:43,682 --> 00:37:44,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you learn from the first one?! !

428
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:07,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Fix the game before it comes out.

429
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did you just say, oh, fuck, we need to get it out before Christmas.

430
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:12,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, who cares if it's not finished?

431
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:13,115
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's going to care.

432
00:38:13,175 --> 00:38:14,576
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just release a patch later on.

433
00:38:14,616 --> 00:38:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be angry, but they'll buy the next one.

434
00:38:16,577 --> 00:38:20,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, seriously, finish the game before you release it.

435
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least the boss monster shows up in level 30, right?

436
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:23,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

437
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:26,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least they didn't fuck that up.

438
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:28,922
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, you know.

439
00:38:29,465 --> 00:38:33,186
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be my forever question I'm always going to ask when you tell me a game's broken.

440
00:38:33,226 --> 00:38:35,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say, does the boss monster show up in level 30?

441
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:39,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if so, at least they didn't fuck up as bad as somebody else I can think of.

442
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:42,288
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just crazy.

443
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:43,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you know what?

444
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:49,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they took a page from Rockstar and just didn't play the multiplayer mode and just released the game as is.

445
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do you know what the very first thing I did was when I played Gears of War?

446
00:38:53,971 --> 00:38:54,171
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

447
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded a patch.

448
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:56,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me too.

449
00:38:57,816 --> 00:39:00,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-stop excitement from the moment I hit the power button.

450
00:39:01,117 --> 00:39:03,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War is currently sitting on the desk in my living room.

451
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it's been played yet.

452
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Gears of War is like a visual orgasm.

453
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,719
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

454
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,060
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll have more to say on it next week.

455
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the gameplay, I'm starting to question a little bit.

456
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll get to that next week.

457
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't play games for how pretty they are.

458
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I play them for how well they play.

459
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: But, oh, you need to give this one a shot.

460
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:24,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it really is.

461
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:26,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when they say it's pretty, they fucking mean it.

462
00:39:26,503 --> 00:39:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really pretty.

463
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:28,324
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

464
00:39:31,845 --> 00:39:39,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, speaking of things that I guess some people might think are pretty, I don't know, we actually have one person who plays this game in the room right now.

465
00:39:40,526 --> 00:39:41,886
[SPEAKER_10]: There's news for Second Life.

466
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:45,587
[SPEAKER_10]: As Junami raises his hand.

467
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:47,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Sup?

468
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:56,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, you will be able to sit around with your virtual friends watching TV in

469
00:39:58,655 --> 00:40:02,317
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the kind of thing that I go into Second Life to get away from.

470
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:27,979
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm laughing because this is stupid!

471
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,901
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so stupid!

472
00:40:30,441 --> 00:40:32,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what are you gonna do?

473
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:38,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, man, wanna come over to my virtual pad and hang out?

474
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,450
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll watch Pimp My Ride?

475
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:42,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

476
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:46,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you think I was doing in the, and you can do this.

477
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:53,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not blaming you, but this is, I mean, I get the like technological, wow, that's kind of neat end of it.

478
00:40:53,740 --> 00:41:04,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey, I can watch TV online, but okay, seriously, like if you're meeting up with other people online to just sit down and watch TV, you can do that in real life.

479
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:06,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that being twice as lazy?

480
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:12,306
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously, because if I'm sitting down playing a game where I'm watching TV in the game, is that like twice as, you know,

481
00:41:12,964 --> 00:41:13,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Twice as lazy.

482
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:19,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, you can actually do that also in Darkness, which is coming out.

483
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:25,271
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having a streaming video and stuff in their TV shows, so you can actually stop in the game and watch TV, which I don't know why you would.

484
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:30,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Funnydale in our chat room wants to know, since when was Second Life a game?

485
00:41:30,874 --> 00:41:31,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

486
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:32,855
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an experience.

487
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:33,516
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a way of life.

488
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:35,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to say so, that it is launching in November.

489
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:41,080
[SPEAKER_01]: What would really be insane would be if your Second Life avatar would...

490
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Login to his virtual computer and then play Second Life.

491
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:47,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have to pay for a virtual cable bill?

492
00:41:47,962 --> 00:41:49,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that would just suck.

493
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:53,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Just find the second box.

494
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:21,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now.

495
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:23,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really going to anger some fans of this game.

496
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,668
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but take it in good stride, okay?

497
00:42:25,008 --> 00:42:27,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, alright?

498
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Attention, everyone.

499
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:36,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You should come over to my house tonight because we're going to be watching on my 62-inch plasma fake screen on Second Life.

500
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be watching Battlestar Galactica.

501
00:42:38,075 --> 00:42:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: See you at 7.

502
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:38,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

503
00:42:39,936 --> 00:42:40,737
[SPEAKER_03]: PUNCH AND PIE

504
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:07,662
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

505
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Not for watching virtual TV.

506
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,665
[SPEAKER_10]: I download it and watch it at my convenience.

507
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:32,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a second.

508
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:41,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Could in this game, could I say have my character watch TV of another character watching his TV of another character watching his TV?

509
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:43,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Like reality shows in Second Life?

510
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:44,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

511
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Second Life Survivor?

512
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:52,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can watch somebody in Second Life on the Second Life TV watching their Second Life TV.

513
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:54,042
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ultimate in boring.

514
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:56,324
[SPEAKER_01]: I am positive it can be done.

515
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,412
[SPEAKER_01]: All we have to do is find out how.

516
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to topics before we get all the hate mail from the Second Life fans.

517
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:10,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you know, I'll give you... I just got the finger from Doonami.

518
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I'll give you this.

519
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:22,581
[SPEAKER_06]: If the goal of Second Life is to, like, recreate life, then having the ability to just kind of go somewhere and hang out, watch TV, is a big step.

520
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:24,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one small step for man.

521
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: One giant leap for virtual man... Forget it.

522
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:46,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Wii Component Cables, hey, the Nintendo Wii's coming out, and remember the Component Cables, uh, there's this whole back and forth where Perrin Kaplan said, yes, you're gonna be able to get the Component Cables in stores, but then the internet's like, but you lied to us before, lady, when you said that the thing would be region-free.

523
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:53,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is what's up is that there's actually only going to be three retailers that you can get it at for now.

524
00:44:54,179 --> 00:44:56,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Circuit City, GameStop, and Best Buy.

525
00:44:56,421 --> 00:44:59,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm assuming when they say GameStop, they mean EB Games as well.

526
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:02,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So those will be the places that you can get the component cables.

527
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:12,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're getting your Wii somewhere else, like Toys R Us, I didn't see them on the list, you may have to go to one of the other retailers to get your component cables if you are a 480p whore.

528
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:13,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Not surprised.

529
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:14,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

530
00:45:14,076 --> 00:45:18,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're running in the shortages on everything for the Nintendo Wii.

531
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:25,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Accessories, Zelda, Excite Truck, they cannot produce them fast enough.

532
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:31,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if they just spent all this time trying to produce the units and cut back on the accessories and other stuff.

533
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,261
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as my company, that's what we're running into.

534
00:45:36,281 --> 00:45:38,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Allocations on everything.

535
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:42,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Accessories and games and you name it.

536
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:43,282
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just

537
00:45:44,187 --> 00:45:55,233
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, limiting it down to three different stores, which I'm sure they paid a fat little bonus to Nintendo for that privilege, makes perfect sense to me.

538
00:45:56,514 --> 00:46:00,136
[SPEAKER_06]: The chatroom's still fixated on the Second Life thing, and there's a good comment here, so I want to read it.

539
00:46:00,156 --> 00:46:05,639
[SPEAKER_06]: FootyMonster says, Second Life does open a way of people who cannot be physically together to actually hang out.

540
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you that, and that's kind of cool, and like World of Warcraft is very similar, and a lot of these MMOs are very similar, but...

541
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:16,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you're gonna hang out and watch TV, that's what you're gonna do?

542
00:46:16,602 --> 00:46:28,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way, that'd be like, you know, the equivalent of, okay, I'm flying, okay, to the other side of the world to meet a pen pal or whatever, and once I get there, what do I do?

543
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:32,135
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent all this money, all this time, you know, building up for this moment.

544
00:46:32,735 --> 00:46:33,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, you wanna watch some TV?

545
00:46:33,976 --> 00:46:34,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure, let's watch.

546
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:37,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's like a big, like, waste of time.

547
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,040
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you say, Tiara?

548
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,621
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you say?

549
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:42,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I said that just described my trip here.

550
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, if you're going to spend all that money to fly out and meet your pen pal, at least do some fucking, because that's... Actually, actually, actually, actually, actually... Because you know that expectation is there somewhere.

551
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,282
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really... Well, Chris and Megsie met...

552
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do you think they do when they meet up in real life?

553
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:11,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they read the Bible and pray together?

554
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:14,019
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're doing some fucking... Here's the better one.

555
00:47:14,279 --> 00:47:23,361
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have friends that come over and both are on the computer, like Rob, if you and Shane are over here, you'll be playing Phantasy Star Universe or something like that.

556
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:28,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of you playing Second Life and watching TV in Second Life together.

557
00:47:28,843 --> 00:47:34,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the same room, not communicating to each other, but you're still watching the TV in the game.

558
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:35,961
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

559
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:38,302
[SPEAKER_03]: My mind has just been blown.

560
00:47:40,122 --> 00:47:42,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, back to actual, you know.

561
00:47:42,923 --> 00:47:58,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say, if you can't afford the whole plane ticket thing because you can't get out there and have sex with the person that you've been talking to online, the least you can do instead of watching TV in Second Life is do some cyber fucking because that's as close as you can get.

562
00:47:58,927 --> 00:47:59,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn straight.

563
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,703
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, on to actual real uses for your TV.

564
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:07,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo Virtual Console.

565
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:10,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a big thing.

566
00:48:10,426 --> 00:48:16,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's speculated that you're not going to be able to have Rumble in your Nintendo 64 games.

567
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:17,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

568
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:24,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your Nintendo 64 games are going to be using the classic controller, and there is no Rumble for that.

569
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:25,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Now...

570
00:48:26,331 --> 00:48:27,151
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.

571
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:31,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, also when you think about the Nintendo 64, not all the controllers had rumbles.

572
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:33,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to, you know, basically buy the rumble pack for it.

573
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:35,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if that's a huge thing.

574
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:42,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, like, in games like Ocarina of Time where that was, you know, important because they rumble for, like, you know, hidden treasure and stuff.

575
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:44,058
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

576
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:54,682
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I remember reading somewhere that it's speculated that you're still going to have rumble in the games because apparently on the back of the classic controller you'll be able to snap the...

577
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:59,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Remote to it, and it will use the Wii Remote to rumble.

578
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:16,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if this is something that's coming later on, or if, you know, right now, of course, nobody that has their Wii can check that out, because, well, the online service for both the Virtual Console and, you know, anything else, the news, weather, etc., is not available, so they can't try it yet.

579
00:49:16,822 --> 00:49:21,825
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess we'll find out on the 19th when all that launches, and I don't know.

580
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a deal-breaker, you think?

581
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally don't care.

582
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:30,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Hucked in a Dumpster

583
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

584
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:01,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have, but I didn't.

585
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:03,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm allowed.

586
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,761
[SPEAKER_03]: You know why I threw it away, too?

587
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:07,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm just going to buy the games on the virtual console.

588
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:13,266
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think nothing is as cool as playing on the original system.

589
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:16,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Mario Kart cannot come out faster on the Wii.

590
00:50:17,088 --> 00:50:20,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think nothing is as cool as playing it on the system it was made for.

591
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:27,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is why I have 40-something video game systems taking up a whole room in my house.

592
00:50:29,335 --> 00:50:29,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is true.

593
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:34,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, of course, that's no secret to anybody because I'm a big nerd.

594
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:40,642
[SPEAKER_10]: But what is a secret is, well, actually, that's not a secret either because there are no more Wii secrets.

595
00:50:41,203 --> 00:50:45,665
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone thinks that Nintendo is holding something, no, Reggie says so himself.

596
00:50:46,226 --> 00:50:47,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So saith Reggie, so be it.

597
00:50:49,628 --> 00:50:52,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So my Wii isn't going to be able to secretly print money?

598
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:53,130
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

599
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was really hoping to have this reaction on launch day.

600
00:50:56,676 --> 00:50:57,076
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill?

601
00:50:57,377 --> 00:50:58,837
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill?

602
00:50:58,857 --> 00:50:59,137
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill!

603
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,780
[SPEAKER_08]: God!

604
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,561
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill!

605
00:51:04,801 --> 00:51:08,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I heard the Wii was going to print money, so I was excited.

606
00:51:08,843 --> 00:51:09,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, only for Nintendo.

607
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:12,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have a story later on that might be true.

608
00:51:13,285 --> 00:51:14,326
[SPEAKER_03]: What, that the Wii prints money?

609
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:16,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be able to make it print money.

610
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:17,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome!

611
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:22,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, of course, there's the plan about the 4 million unit launch, which...

612
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:26,387
[SPEAKER_10]: What is... Is that the biggest unit launch, do you think?

613
00:51:27,468 --> 00:51:28,348
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest launch?

614
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:28,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

615
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:30,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't... I have no idea.

616
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:33,232
[SPEAKER_10]: That's pretty crazy.

617
00:51:34,753 --> 00:51:35,554
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big unit.

618
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:36,895
[SPEAKER_10]: That is.

619
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:38,616
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a powerful Wii.

620
00:51:39,477 --> 00:51:41,098
[SPEAKER_10]: What a mighty, mighty Wii.

621
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:44,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say it was a big unit, DarkSakura?

622
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:45,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not interested in the big unit.

623
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:47,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say it's one of the biggest units you've ever seen?

624
00:51:50,465 --> 00:51:51,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see, um...

625
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:59,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of big units that will cost you big money, GameStop is putting together this big bundle of Wii.

626
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:03,159
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a $700 Wii Mega Bundle.

627
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:07,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, this is the only way that you can get a Wii through their website early.

628
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:13,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Because remember, this is the same shit they pulled with the Xbox 360, is that, you know, hey, you want to have the Xbox 360 right now?

629
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:17,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, buy our $1,000 bundle that has all these games with it.

630
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sold out.

631
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:20,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know, I was getting to that.

632
00:52:21,218 --> 00:52:22,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Goddammit, stop ruining the punchline.

633
00:52:23,399 --> 00:52:37,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the Wii is $2.50, you get the SD card, which is $60, an additional Wiimote for $40, six games, totaling $300, a 12-month product replacement plan, and, whoopty-shit, a Game Informer gift subscription.

634
00:52:37,948 --> 00:52:41,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the talk online was, don't support this bullshit!

635
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: This is extortion, in a way.

636
00:52:45,473 --> 00:52:45,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

637
00:52:45,813 --> 00:52:49,135
[SPEAKER_06]: They know people want this system, so this is how they're doing it.

638
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:53,779
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't support it and then the damn thing sells out in like five minutes.

639
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:09,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We were going to band together as gamers and teach these corporate dickheads a lesson that they can't make me buy Super Monkey Banana Ball Blitz whatever shit Wii game that I don't really want.

640
00:53:11,673 --> 00:53:12,974
[SPEAKER_06]: But alas, it sold out in an hour.

641
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:16,677
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I almost bought Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz.

642
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:18,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, whatever.

643
00:53:18,191 --> 00:53:20,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's lots of Super Monkey Ball fans out there.

644
00:53:20,252 --> 00:53:22,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just picking on your game for no particular reason.

645
00:53:22,553 --> 00:53:23,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in a mood tonight.

646
00:53:23,514 --> 00:53:26,415
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the 1GB Wii SD memory card for $59.99?

647
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:32,579
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get one for about $20 at, I believe, New Egg or something like that.

648
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:37,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not $60 for a 1GB SD memory card.

649
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's a rip-off right there.

650
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 12-month Game Informer gift subscription...

651
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:47,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

652
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:47,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me.

653
00:53:48,384 --> 00:53:49,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That's $15 right there.

654
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to the chat room and reading some comments.

655
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:56,091
[SPEAKER_06]: RavensDolphin says, Well, look at the PlayStation 3, Sky.

656
00:53:56,592 --> 00:53:57,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, zing.

657
00:53:58,053 --> 00:54:00,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the whole fact that maybe I don't want a freaking Blu-ray player.

658
00:54:01,637 --> 00:54:03,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, that's kind of a necessary component, right?

659
00:54:03,598 --> 00:54:06,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the games are going to be Blu-ray, so... Let's see...

660
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,841
[SPEAKER_06]: JeremyTodd1 says, but not everyone likes the same games as you, Rob.

661
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:16,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe those people wanted all the games packaged in, and so they bought this bundle so they would save money.

662
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:17,182
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

663
00:54:17,202 --> 00:54:18,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I beg to differ.

664
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:19,482
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't save any money.

665
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the games you're getting.

666
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:27,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, Red Steel, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, and Madden NFL 2007.

667
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:35,066
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean to tell me the same person that's going to buy Red Steel is going to buy Monkey Ball Banana Blitz and Madden 2007?

668
00:54:35,286 --> 00:54:37,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Is interested in all those games together?

669
00:54:37,526 --> 00:55:06,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Madden is poopy Madden for the Wii is not exactly poopy Madden's not poopy Madden's not poopy at all if you like football games but I'm saying that I don't think you like every single one of those genres maybe it's the opposite maybe you're a Madden fan and that's the game you want because throwing the football with a controller is kind of fucking cool even for somebody who may not be into football games but do I really want Monkey Ball?

670
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:09,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is pretty awesome.

671
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:15,250
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got tons of cool mini-games, and apparently it's both for kids and people that are really hardcore into that game.

672
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,011
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've overlooked, though, the main selling point.

673
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,292
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the family pack.

674
00:55:21,233 --> 00:55:22,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, no.

675
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,754
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, JeremyTodd1 seems to agree with you.

676
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the Wii is marketed towards the whole family, so the kids would like the child games, and the older people would like the Red Steel Madden.

677
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:33,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give you that.

678
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:37,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, all six, and of course, JV Mon says, I pre-ordered Monkey Ball and Red Steel.

679
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:40,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but did you pre-order Madden?

680
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:41,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that game interesting to you too?

681
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you say all six of those games are something that interests you?

682
00:55:44,932 --> 00:55:47,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Footy Monster says they are good games in general.

683
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,114
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't.

684
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:49,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played them yet.

685
00:55:49,934 --> 00:55:52,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just a shitty port.

686
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:52,915
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it is.

687
00:55:53,555 --> 00:55:56,797
[SPEAKER_03]: The game itself is good, but, I mean, it's just a port.

688
00:55:57,197 --> 00:55:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever.

689
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:00,498
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

690
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:09,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, all this forced extortion of money and forcing me to buy Monkey Ball when I don't really want it.

691
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:12,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It ruffles my feathers and it makes me very angry.

692
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can already tell, I'm in a bit of a mood tonight.

693
00:56:14,783 --> 00:56:15,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

694
00:56:15,323 --> 00:56:16,764
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no particular reason for it.

695
00:56:17,264 --> 00:56:22,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Tiara brings some type of energy with her that makes me more, I don't know.

696
00:56:22,606 --> 00:56:23,967
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's gas from your lunch.

697
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

698
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:24,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

699
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:27,312
[SPEAKER_06]: from that yummy pumpkin cheesecake.

700
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:28,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to the Cheesecake Factory today.

701
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:29,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

702
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait, wait, you're going to put me in a good mood and that's not the time.

703
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:32,854
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the time to be in a good mood.

704
00:56:32,874 --> 00:56:33,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob, they're out of cheesecake.

705
00:56:35,915 --> 00:56:36,716
[SPEAKER_06]: People die.

706
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,461
[SPEAKER_10]: It's time, of course, for the FUs of the week.

707
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,142
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have one.

708
00:56:50,602 --> 00:56:52,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And one that's the size of an entire city.

709
00:56:54,458 --> 00:57:02,123
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to most of the drivers in San Francisco for being retarded and the whole town for being laid out so funny and getting me lost.

710
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:16,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Even the power of the double horns did not make the people move out of my way or almost run into me or stop in the middle of the damn, not in the middle of the lane I was in, but between two lanes.

711
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:18,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God!

712
00:57:18,622 --> 00:57:23,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Just when I think my road rage might have subsided a bit, I drive in San Francisco.

713
00:57:24,726 --> 00:57:27,147
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, it comes back.

714
00:57:28,208 --> 00:57:29,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I want to kill.

715
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:32,330
[SPEAKER_10]: I imagine how I'm going to kill them.

716
00:57:32,831 --> 00:57:36,833
[SPEAKER_10]: In slow, painful ways, like using a cheese grater and lemon juice.

717
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:38,734
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

718
00:57:38,874 --> 00:57:41,016
Oh, God.

719
00:57:41,136 --> 00:57:41,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

720
00:57:42,717 --> 00:57:52,924
[SPEAKER_03]: After you do game blog sites that think posting pictures of the Wii in play or posting, I don't know, stupid details like, It comes in a box!

721
00:57:53,124 --> 00:57:53,804
[SPEAKER_03]: With cords!

722
00:57:54,145 --> 00:57:54,885
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff!

723
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:56,386
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not news.

724
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:57,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Please stop reporting it.

725
00:57:58,187 --> 00:57:58,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my god.

726
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:02,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everyone's excited for this console launch, but I do not need to see...

727
00:58:02,734 --> 00:58:06,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, stop motion of you pulling the damn console out of a box.

728
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:07,015
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

729
00:58:07,175 --> 00:58:15,317
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm exempting Kotaku from this FU because the video of his kid playing the system was so fucking adorable, I wanted to go, Oh, they're so cute!

730
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:16,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so cute.

731
00:58:17,317 --> 00:58:18,718
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm exempting Kotaku from this.

732
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:25,139
[SPEAKER_03]: At least that's a creative way of doing it, but it... I mean, we had news stories about how the Wii can be used as a whiteboard.

733
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:25,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.

734
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:29,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it's shiny, you can put, you know, dry erase pens on it.

735
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:29,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal, but...

736
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:32,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not news.

737
00:58:32,591 --> 00:58:33,572
[SPEAKER_06]: PooEater agrees with you.

738
00:58:33,632 --> 00:58:35,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit about you playing the Wii.

739
00:58:35,153 --> 00:58:36,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I care about me playing the Wii.

740
00:58:36,694 --> 00:58:37,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly!

741
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:40,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

742
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:52,987
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to Baskin Robbins because the way they scoop their ice cream, like, all the ice cream comes up at the top and none of it ever falls into the cone.

743
00:58:53,347 --> 00:58:57,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you know, by the time I eat my ice cream, because they eat my ice cream fast, um,

744
00:58:57,489 --> 00:59:02,110
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no ice cream left in the cone, so it's like I have this empty cone with nothing to do with, and it's kind of sad.

745
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,230
[SPEAKER_06]: That was seriously the best thing I could come up with tonight.

746
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:05,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that angry.

747
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat the cone.

748
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:07,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that angry.

749
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, no, then I'll give him this.

750
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:16,192
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the fact that still with Baskin Robbins, when you rip off the paper, sometimes, like, some of the paper gets stuck to the cone.

751
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, I have to eat paper?

752
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:18,993
[SPEAKER_06]: You need the glue.

753
00:59:19,673 --> 00:59:19,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

754
00:59:20,673 --> 00:59:20,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew.

755
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:23,493
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to paper cone things.

756
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:25,434
[SPEAKER_06]: T-R-R-R-R-R.

757
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:26,714
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a F you.

758
00:59:27,543 --> 00:59:33,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just like to say FU to Marvel for taking so freaking long to finish Ultimates Volume 2.

759
00:59:33,685 --> 00:59:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: The last issue came out last month, and the next issue that will wrap it up, which only needed probably about five pages to finish the entire series, will come out December 20th.

760
00:59:43,688 --> 00:59:44,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of sucks.

761
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Drew Nami.

762
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,891
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, first of all, shared FU for everyone.

763
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:54,452
[SPEAKER_01]: FU to MySpace, your site design sucks ass.

764
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:57,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Your members don't know web design works shit.

765
00:59:57,918 --> 01:00:00,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a quiz before they're allowed to make a profile, please.

766
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:01,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

767
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,820
[SPEAKER_01]: And F you to people who verb nouns.

768
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Verbing nouns suck.

769
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop verbing nouns.

770
01:00:09,681 --> 01:00:19,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, let's move on to our next story because... Oh, our next story is join our MySpace.

771
01:00:19,503 --> 01:00:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a MySpace profile over at www.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

772
01:00:24,565 --> 01:00:25,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Hear clips from the show.

773
01:00:26,738 --> 01:00:27,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Add us to your friends list.

774
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Comment on our profile with cute little YouTube videos.

775
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:33,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what people do on MySpace.

776
01:00:37,284 --> 01:00:39,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about upcoming release dates.

777
01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:43,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Loki, I heard Full Auto 2 on the PSP is coming out.

778
01:00:43,408 --> 01:00:49,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really surprised to hear that because I had no idea it was in development.

779
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:49,971
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a real surprise.

780
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:51,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a complete shocker to me.

781
01:00:51,712 --> 01:00:52,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you know...

782
01:00:53,013 --> 01:01:15,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone came out and said that because if not I would have had to have said it on every single show for a long time now Well thank god 1UP reported on it because now it's true Because nothing is true until 1UP reports on it It's not necessarily just 1UP, everybody reported on it because they finally put out a press release about it But my god, how many fucking weeks do I need to tell you guys something's coming out

783
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: and no one picks up on the story until, oh, look, hey, guess what?

784
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:23,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other website posted about this, so now it's true.

785
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:25,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, poopy on you.

786
01:01:25,027 --> 01:01:25,347
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

787
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:26,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It just makes this show special.

788
01:01:26,888 --> 01:01:29,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So the people that listen to this show, you're like a special club.

789
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,590
[SPEAKER_06]: You get to know this first.

790
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:31,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

791
01:01:31,571 --> 01:01:34,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so some other special stuff you get to know first.

792
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:38,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Full Isle 2 Battle Lines for the PS3.

793
01:01:39,758 --> 01:01:41,920
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're waiting for that as a launch title, guess what?

794
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not coming out at launch.

795
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:45,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be coming out December 13th instead.

796
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:46,444
[SPEAKER_03]: So, ha!

797
01:01:46,784 --> 01:01:49,626
[SPEAKER_03]: That's karma for you, Sega.

798
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:55,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, along the same lines, Blazing Angels for the PlayStation 3, also not coming out until December 13th.

799
01:01:56,692 --> 01:01:57,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big surprise.

800
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:04,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Rainbow Six Vegas, also another game being delayed until January 31st for the PlayStation 3.

801
01:02:04,879 --> 01:02:06,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's very interesting.

802
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:09,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 Pack PlayStation 2 Demo Disks

803
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Jampactus.

804
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now they have this brand new thing called Xbox 360 Exhibition.

805
01:02:29,272 --> 01:02:30,652
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be $5.99 retail.

806
01:02:30,832 --> 01:02:47,558
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll feature six demos, including Madden NFL 07, Dead Rising, Fear, Fusion Frenzy 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and also six HD videos, including Halo 3, Splinter Cell Double Agent, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc.

807
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:48,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

808
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:58,781
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is meant for someone, of course, that does not have Xbox Live, so they wouldn't have access to this, or they just didn't want to buy the Xbox official magazine.

809
01:02:59,081 --> 01:03:00,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you just really want to pay for demos.

810
01:03:01,302 --> 01:03:01,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently.

811
01:03:02,343 --> 01:03:03,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is out there.

812
01:03:03,724 --> 01:03:06,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out on the 22nd, the one-year anniversary.

813
01:03:06,565 --> 01:03:09,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I have $6 to spend, and I just don't know what to do with it.

814
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:13,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really interested in a combo meal from a local fast food restaurant.

815
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:17,772
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you what you would spend this money on, and it's goddamn not...

816
01:03:19,113 --> 01:03:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: 360 Exhibition, Sneak King.

817
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:26,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Sneak King is which you can spend your money on Sneak King and hell, you have enough money for some fries and a Coke.

818
01:03:26,276 --> 01:03:27,516
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

819
01:03:27,856 --> 01:03:28,717
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you're wrong.

820
01:03:28,797 --> 01:03:30,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong because you have to get a combo meal to get the game.

821
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:32,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So you actually need more than six dollars.

822
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:33,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

823
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,439
[SPEAKER_06]: You just got served.

824
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:35,600
[SPEAKER_06]: You got BK served.

825
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:38,401
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still hungry.

826
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,062
[SPEAKER_03]: You would spend the money on lunch anyways.

827
01:03:40,142 --> 01:03:41,342
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, whatever.

828
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you get Sneak King.

829
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:44,887
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is what I'll do.

830
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:46,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get Drew.

831
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:50,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say, Drew, don't you want to go out to eat and make him buy the meal and then I'll buy the game?

832
01:03:51,049 --> 01:03:51,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Money saved.

833
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:54,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you want some chicken fries?

834
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you want some chicken fries?

835
01:03:57,891 --> 01:04:02,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so getting back into the swing of things here.

836
01:04:04,776 --> 01:04:09,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this week actually for games is probably the largest week of the entire year.

837
01:04:09,658 --> 01:04:13,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And that said, there's not a lot of good stuff coming out actually, which is really sad.

838
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:18,942
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the 360 though, there are some pretty interesting things.

839
01:04:19,462 --> 01:04:24,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead or Alive Extreme 2 is finally making its way out into the market.

840
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:29,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking for a lot of T&A, well, you won't have to wait much longer.

841
01:04:30,321 --> 01:04:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Rainbow Six Vegas for the 360.

842
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:34,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll have to get some chicken fries and some TNA.

843
01:04:38,765 --> 01:04:44,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Eragon is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and then the portable systems.

844
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Pimp My Ride on PlayStation 2.

845
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:49,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I forgot that one.

846
01:04:49,509 --> 01:04:50,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I got delayed a week.

847
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:55,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, what were you going to say there, Rob?

848
01:04:56,793 --> 01:05:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Something really sarcastic about Pimp My Ride the game, but I really need to shut up tonight because we're going to get angry emails.

849
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:05,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob talks too much.

850
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:07,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob talks too much on the program.

851
01:05:08,879 --> 01:05:13,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I downloaded this podcast having no idea that Rob would talk so much.

852
01:05:13,261 --> 01:05:17,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, his fucking picture is on the little album art, but I never knew he would talk so much.

853
01:05:17,843 --> 01:05:18,764
[SPEAKER_06]: More lesbians.

854
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:19,764
[SPEAKER_06]: More lesbians.

855
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:20,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

856
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:24,850

862
01:05:46,564 --> 01:05:47,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

865
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:26,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, more than I would even want to list.

866
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:33,030
[SPEAKER_03]: All your PlayStation 3 launch titles, all your Wii launch titles, a lot of other stuff mixed in there.

867
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:35,171
[SPEAKER_03]: WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 07.

868
01:06:36,812 --> 01:06:38,053
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just too much shit.

869
01:06:39,394 --> 01:06:41,375
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the commercial Nintendo should have aired?

870
01:06:42,896 --> 01:06:46,238
[SPEAKER_06]: This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday, come on down and get your Nintendo Wii!

871
01:06:47,563 --> 01:06:48,984

[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic the Hedgehog on the 360 is also coming out this week.

877
01:07:03,751 --> 01:07:04,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass.

878
01:07:07,132 --> 01:07:09,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about a little bit different release news?

879
01:07:09,794 --> 01:07:10,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you play the demo?

880
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:11,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was poopy.

881
01:07:11,955 --> 01:07:12,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was very poopy.

882
01:07:12,735 --> 01:07:13,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonic the Hedgehog 360?

883
01:07:13,435 --> 01:07:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

884
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:15,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was poop.

885
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:16,417
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about that last week.

886
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you did.

887
01:07:19,836 --> 01:07:20,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Were that all for our U.S.

888
01:07:20,677 --> 01:07:21,137
[SPEAKER_02]: release dates?

889
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:22,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

890
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that all for our U.S.

891
01:07:23,397 --> 01:07:23,918
[SPEAKER_02]: release dates?

892
01:07:24,018 --> 01:07:25,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's too much for me to list.

893
01:07:25,578 --> 01:07:30,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, Polarium Advanced, I mean, if you really want to buy that.

894
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we've got a few releases coming up for the U.K.

895
01:07:36,061 --> 01:07:41,403
[SPEAKER_10]: 14th November, we have EverQuest 2, Echoes of Thadeware for PC.

896
01:07:41,783 --> 01:07:45,824
[SPEAKER_10]: 17th, a good number, Asterix Noble XXXL2, Mission Las Vegas.

897
01:07:46,881 --> 01:07:47,882
[SPEAKER_10]: on PSP and DS.

898
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:49,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I miss Asterix and Obelix?

899
01:07:49,744 --> 01:07:51,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to read those comics back in the day.

900
01:07:53,046 --> 01:08:09,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War on the 17th, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter Premium Edition on Xbox 360, Heroes of Might and Magic 5, Hammers of Fate, Lumen S2 on PSP, Mind Quiz on PSP, Superman Returns the Video Game on DS, Sims 2 Pets on GBA.

[SPEAKER_10]: So, have fun!

902
01:08:14,749 --> 01:08:24,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a little bit of other stuff to look forward to within the month is Rule of Rose, Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, Guitar Hero 2 on the 24th.

903
01:08:26,052 --> 01:08:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of have fun, wouldn't that be have a jolly old time?

904
01:08:29,093 --> 01:08:29,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a jolly old time.

905
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:32,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

906
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,699
[SPEAKER_06]: The Chyram's asking who fed me sugar before the show.

907
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, actually, she brought me a cookie.

908
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:40,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought cookies.

909
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:44,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a coffee cookie, so it was sugar and caffeine, and apparently it was laced with crack.

910
01:08:45,169 --> 01:08:45,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently.

911
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

912
01:08:47,332 --> 01:08:49,695
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I had Tiara's Latte Cheesecake, too.

913
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:51,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It all comes together.

914
01:08:51,864 --> 01:08:53,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Japan, how about some release dates?

915
01:08:53,886 --> 01:09:06,417
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have the PS3 now, so you're getting some games this week, including Mahjong Cocktail Club, which comes out November 16th, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on November 17th, and Need for Speed Carbon on November 20th.

916
01:09:07,596 --> 01:09:09,457
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta wait till December 2nd for the Wii, though.

917
01:09:09,497 --> 01:09:10,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, kids.

918
01:09:10,057 --> 01:09:13,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You do get a lot of PlayStation 2 releases coming out this week.

919
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,379
[SPEAKER_06]: You get Rhapsodia, which is going into the Konami The Best series.

920
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually getting a little bit of a price cut.

921
01:09:20,599 --> 01:09:24,560
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, White Princess II is coming out on the 16th as well.

922
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,021
[SPEAKER_06]: That also appears to be going into a collection.

923
01:09:27,961 --> 01:09:32,122
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is also going into a collection, and this might be my import title of the week.

924
01:09:33,062 --> 01:09:35,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl.

925
01:09:36,246 --> 01:09:37,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I want that one.

926
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:38,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll bet it does.

927
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Girl meets girl and much kashimashi ensues.

928
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:45,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

929
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:50,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have on the Nintendo DS Puzzle Series Volumes 5, 6, and 7 from Hudson.

930
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:54,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Magic Taizen and Akumajo Dracula.

931
01:09:55,055 --> 01:09:56,295
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a bundle there.

932
01:09:56,616 --> 01:09:58,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Gallery of Labyrinth comes out.

933
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:00,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's the Portrait of Ruin title.

934
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:01,598
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they're calling it over in Japan.

935
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:03,032
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a bundle, sorry kids.

936
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,012
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just that game.

937
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:08,954
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a PSP player, Metal Gear Acid 2 is going into the best this week on the 16th.

938
01:10:09,315 --> 01:10:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a Sudoku game from Hudson on the 16th.

939
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:13,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And Gunpei, oh wait, that's the 20th.

940
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, you gotta wait a little while longer for that one.

941
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:19,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's all I got for you.

942
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:20,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

943
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:27,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, with the Wii coming out here pretty soon, and of course the Virtual Console also launching relatively soon...

944
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:46,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, and Wild Gunman.

945
01:10:47,165 --> 01:10:49,448
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, seriously, the games I really want.

946
01:10:50,976 --> 01:10:53,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild Gunman is like the most simple game ever made.

947
01:10:53,276 --> 01:10:54,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever played Wild Gunman?

948
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the concept of wild gumming.

949
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:26,016
[SPEAKER_06]: The person goes, draw, and you fire the zapper gun as fast as you can.

950
01:11:26,576 --> 01:11:27,316
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

951
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:31,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically, they could re-release this game as push the button fast.

952
01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what it is.

953
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Back to the Future, Loki.

954
01:11:37,621 --> 01:11:39,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I remember that.

955
01:11:39,501 --> 01:11:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the game that was there.

956
01:11:41,742 --> 01:11:43,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it also in The Karate Kid?

957
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:44,944
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I might be on crack.

958
01:11:44,984 --> 01:11:45,944
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was skeet shooting.

959
01:11:46,084 --> 01:11:46,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind.

960
01:11:47,785 --> 01:11:48,205
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on crack.

961
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of stupid, though, that they have Duck Hunt coming out anyways, because, I mean, was it that Wii Play game was pretty much Duck Hunt anyways?

962
01:11:56,149 --> 01:11:56,389
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

963
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:02,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we're not getting Wii Play, because we're the United States, and fucking UK gets it.

964
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:03,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Bastards.

965
01:12:04,396 --> 01:12:13,525
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice if they would rename Hogan's Alley Hogan Knows Best's Alley, because then I could zap Brook, and that would bring me endless days of excitement.

966
01:12:13,565 --> 01:12:14,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Hogan's Heroes Alley.

967
01:12:16,567 --> 01:12:17,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Hogan!

968
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:19,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hogan Family Alley.

969
01:12:19,788 --> 01:12:21,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I just killed Sandy Duncan.

970
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:25,711
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you caught that reference, you totally are an 80s child.

971
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:28,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Matt's laughing at that one.

972
01:12:28,572 --> 01:12:28,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

973
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:29,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know why.

974
01:12:30,573 --> 01:12:32,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know what you're talking about.

975
01:12:33,775 --> 01:12:35,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you remember the Hogan Family?

976
01:12:35,635 --> 01:12:36,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind, forget it.

977
01:12:37,076 --> 01:12:39,397
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the Hogan Family.

978
01:12:39,757 --> 01:12:40,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

979
01:12:40,938 --> 01:12:42,338
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what else I remember?

980
01:12:42,939 --> 01:12:43,199
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

981
01:12:44,299 --> 01:12:45,340
[SPEAKER_06]: When this show was good?

982
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:45,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

983
01:12:49,383 --> 01:12:51,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, guess what?

984
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:58,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Namco has registered new Katamari Damacy trademarks, so we can get more ball rolling in.

985
01:13:17,463 --> 01:13:27,108
[SPEAKER_10]: We have beautiful Katamari Damacy, Katamari Damacy Tribian, and there was an application filed for Katamari Damacy-kun.

986
01:13:28,629 --> 01:13:31,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Ball rolling, and to think I skipped the PSP version of Katamari.

987
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, we talked about man cannons the other week.

988
01:13:38,275 --> 01:13:39,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you roll a Katamari into a man cannon?

989
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:40,556
[SPEAKER_06]: What would happen?

990
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:44,038
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a... A big black hawk.

991
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:55,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that reference is about 150 episodes old, and people aren't going to get it, and they're going to go, what the fuck is wrong with Jamie?

992
01:13:58,364 --> 01:14:02,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Drunami knows what episode number, you are sad, you are sad.

993
01:14:02,887 --> 01:14:04,288
[SPEAKER_06]: 29, 29 he says, alright, anyway, sorry.

994
01:14:04,348 --> 01:14:04,849
Oh, my turn.

995
01:14:04,929 --> 01:14:04,989
Um...

996
01:14:14,062 --> 01:14:20,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox Live is getting another new game very soon, and this is one I know that's near and dear to at least one person's heart in this room.

997
01:14:21,007 --> 01:14:21,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Worms!

998
01:14:22,488 --> 01:14:23,289
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember Worms?

999
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:23,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah!

1000
01:14:24,049 --> 01:14:26,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Worms HD is coming.

1001
01:14:27,372 --> 01:14:30,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, plans for announcements are being discussed with Microsoft right now.

1002
01:14:30,594 --> 01:14:34,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The game is in final certification stages, so maybe we'll get this by the end of the year.

1003
01:14:34,777 --> 01:14:35,458
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be rad.

1004
01:14:35,718 --> 01:14:36,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully.

1005
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:37,159
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

1006
01:14:37,259 --> 01:14:42,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumor is that the release calendar is full for the year, so this might have to wait until next year, but...

1007
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:44,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here's my thought.

1008
01:14:44,545 --> 01:14:46,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we getting another UNO pack?

1009
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:53,098
[SPEAKER_06]: God, that's, you know, if another game gets delayed, I really can't fucking wait for the Viva Pinata UNO pack.

1010
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:56,564
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, God, I'm on pins and fucking needles waiting for that.

1011
01:14:57,766 --> 01:15:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I have 100 points saved just so I can buy the Viva Pinata Uno pack.

1012
01:15:01,988 --> 01:15:03,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope one of these games... No!

1013
01:15:03,108 --> 01:15:03,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I'm lying!

1014
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:08,870
[SPEAKER_06]: This game could be put in when some other game gets delayed if it's ready to go.

1015
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:16,333
[SPEAKER_06]: You know one of those other games is going to get delayed because they're going to go, oh, gee, when we do the upscrolling level, it looks completely different on two different screens.

1016
01:15:17,273 --> 01:15:18,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Worms is the game, of course.

1017
01:15:18,853 --> 01:15:20,614
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Scorched Earth.

1018
01:15:21,194 --> 01:15:23,195
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Scorched Earth in wormy form.

1019
01:15:23,915 --> 01:15:26,316
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you fire bombs and

1020
01:15:31,688 --> 01:15:39,770
[SPEAKER_10]: I've actually been quoting lines from Monty Python all weekend, and I was quoting the holy hand grenade thing at the Metreon.

1021
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:47,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that it might blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.

1022
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:48,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, at the wax museum, that's right.

1023
01:15:52,634 --> 01:15:54,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, something completely different, you say?

1024
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,678
[SPEAKER_03]: How about Linux on the Wii?

1025
01:15:57,799 --> 01:15:59,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say Wii on Linux.

1026
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:00,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a little weird.

1027
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:05,563
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but anyways, yes, Wii and Linux.

1028
01:16:05,923 --> 01:16:06,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Wheelie, you say?

1029
01:16:07,264 --> 01:16:09,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's actually what it's called, Wheelie.

1030
01:16:09,925 --> 01:16:12,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's being done.

1031
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:12,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you did there.

1032
01:16:16,109 --> 01:16:16,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

1033
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:21,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so it's actually being worked on, and...

1034
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:28,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly, they're going to start beta testing this thing as soon as the Wii comes out because it's based on the GameCube Linux as well.

1035
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:37,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things that they're aiming to be able to do with this, surfing the internet using the control, of course, as a mouse pointer, even though you can do that anyways.

1036
01:16:38,004 --> 01:16:46,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Wii Media Extender to stream movies and music and stuff from your PC to the Wii and to your TV.

1037
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:47,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1038
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: They said basically think Apple ITV for free.

1039
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:55,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Write document with a regular USB keyboard and print with any USB printer.

1040
01:16:56,513 --> 01:16:57,613
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could print money.

1041
01:16:57,973 --> 01:16:58,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1042
01:16:58,394 --> 01:16:58,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

1043
01:16:58,814 --> 01:16:59,034
[SPEAKER_03]: See?

1044
01:17:01,434 --> 01:17:03,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's see.

1045
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:05,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Email and chat with your friends.

1046
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:07,516
[SPEAKER_03]: $50 bill?

1047
01:17:07,536 --> 01:17:07,716
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill?

1048
01:17:07,736 --> 01:17:07,876
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill!

1049
01:17:07,896 --> 01:17:08,116
[SPEAKER_08]: God!

1050
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:08,416
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 bill!

1051
01:17:08,956 --> 01:17:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was late.

1052
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1053
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:22,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Play classic games using the MAME console emulator.

1054
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be irony right there.

1055
01:17:25,393 --> 01:17:27,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Develop your own programs and games.

1056
01:17:27,374 --> 01:17:44,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Control Wheelie from your PC using a Wi-Fi connection and use Wheelie and the Wii as a network attached storage by connecting it to an external USB hard drive and pretty much anything else you can do on a PC.

1057
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:45,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

1058
01:17:46,354 --> 01:17:47,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, that's pretty cool.

1059
01:17:47,394 --> 01:17:53,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I've signed up to hopefully beta test this, so probably more of the come as the Wii gets launched.

1060
01:17:53,776 --> 01:17:54,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wheelie.

1061
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:55,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Wheelie.

1062
01:17:56,436 --> 01:17:58,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting for the picture of the owl.

1063
01:17:59,197 --> 01:18:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that I've said, oh, is there already, oh, there it is.

1064
01:18:02,337 --> 01:18:03,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, that's a Linux penguin.

1065
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:04,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not an owl.

1066
01:18:04,098 --> 01:18:05,278
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's dressed up like Mario.

1067
01:18:05,318 --> 01:18:05,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that's cute.

1068
01:18:06,018 --> 01:18:09,219
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm waiting for the, you know, the famous owl that says, oh, really?

1069
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:11,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm waiting for the oh, wheelie one.

1070
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:11,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1071
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:12,779
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1072
01:18:13,219 --> 01:18:16,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry to encourage that behavior on the internet.

1073
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:17,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, come on.

1074
01:18:18,734 --> 01:18:20,874
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you like to encourage mass hysteria.

1075
01:18:21,495 --> 01:18:25,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of mass hysteria, this won't really encourage any of it, but it's kind of cool.

1076
01:18:27,257 --> 01:18:34,719
[SPEAKER_10]: For those five people still playing Animal Crossing DS, which I need to actually clean out my village and start doing that because this is pretty cool.

1077
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:44,603
[SPEAKER_10]: With the launch of Twilight Princess on 19th November, Nintendo will be giving away a very special and rare gift in Animal Crossing, according to their...

1078
01:18:49,017 --> 01:19:02,387
[SPEAKER_10]: If you connect via Nintendo Wi-Fi during the week of November 17th through 24th, you'll receive a letter from Nintendo, which will show up in your mailbox, and you will receive an attached item.

1079
01:19:04,249 --> 01:19:06,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So, it could be anything.

1080
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:14,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Accompanied with the letter will be a corrupt item that will erase your save and say, Go buy a Wii, stop playing the DS!

1081
01:19:15,194 --> 01:19:19,398
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it'll be a flower that you put in your house and then you can't put anything in that corner of your house.

1082
01:19:19,878 --> 01:19:20,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, they already did that.

1083
01:19:21,519 --> 01:19:26,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually went to NintendoWiFi.com just to prove Jamie wrong because I like to do that.

1084
01:19:26,503 --> 01:19:28,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And it shows 20 random Wi-Fi players.

1085
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at that.

1086
01:19:29,726 --> 01:19:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Six people are playing Animal Crossing Wild World right now.

1087
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:34,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We have...

1088
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:42,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Danny Boy is playing and Phil is playing and IJ and Mike and Christina with a lowercase c because she's poetic.

1089
01:19:42,898 --> 01:19:43,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And look at this.

1090
01:19:43,658 --> 01:19:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob is playing Animal Crossing right now.

1091
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:54,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, Rob, this is just for you.

1092
01:19:55,024 --> 01:20:03,588
[SPEAKER_06]: There may only be six people in the world playing Animal Crossing Wild World right this moment, but 1.5 million people are playing Final Fantasy XII.

1093
01:20:04,284 --> 01:20:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's what Square Enix will have you believe, because they sent out a press release earlier this week saying that Final Fantasy XII has 1.5 million units on shelves.

1094
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:20,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, I guess 1.5 million people aren't really playing it, but yet there's that many copies in circulation, so soon 1.5 million people will be playing it.

1095
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:27,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XII, by the way, for the record, did 2.4 million copies in Japan, so it'll be interesting to see.

1096
01:20:27,798 --> 01:20:30,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be interesting if it sold more here than it did in Japan?

1097
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we all know Dragon Quest is the bigger game in Japan, so I don't know.

1098
01:20:34,745 --> 01:20:39,548
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Final Fantasy XII, brand new record for the total number of units shipped for the franchise.

1099
01:20:39,988 --> 01:20:40,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, Squeenix!

1100
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:42,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1101
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:46,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other interesting stuff... Now, next time, make the graphics less pixelated.

1102
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:46,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1103
01:20:48,674 --> 01:20:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Some interesting stuff for fans of Guitar Hero.

1104
01:20:54,538 --> 01:21:03,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Hero 2, of course, you may remember with the demo, it actually blocked the Ant Commando's controllers from working with it.

1105
01:21:03,638 --> 01:21:24,792
[SPEAKER_03]: and apparently that's the case also if you have purchased your Guitar Hero controller from them before October 1st if you have then it will not work with Guitar Hero 2 unless you purchase an adapter which I believe is free but don't hold me to that and

1106
01:21:25,459 --> 01:21:30,420
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you get the adapter, I guess everything's... Oh, I'm sorry, the adapter's $6.99.

1107
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:34,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you want to play with that controller, you're going to have to pay another $7.

1108
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:40,182
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other controllers beyond that will work with Guitar Hero 2.

1109
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:46,363
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently anything that did circumvent third-party controllers has been broken already.

1110
01:21:47,663 --> 01:21:48,943
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of knew that would be coming, though.

1111
01:21:49,483 --> 01:21:53,284
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, that's the Ancommando's business right there, so they had to get around it somehow, right?

1112
01:21:53,504 --> 01:21:53,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1113
01:21:53,944 --> 01:21:54,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1114
01:21:55,805 --> 01:21:57,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Drew, you've been playing Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit, right?

1115
01:21:57,867 --> 01:21:58,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you posting about it.

1116
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you interested at all in these third-party controllers or any of that?

1117
01:22:03,996 --> 01:22:04,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

1118
01:22:04,477 --> 01:22:06,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't really see any interest in them.

1119
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:11,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my SG controller from the first game, and I don't really need another one.

1120
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:21,494
[SPEAKER_06]: If I feel like I'm kind of over Guitar Hero, like seriously, the hype around Guitar Hero has seriously ruined Guitar Hero for me for some weird reason.

1121
01:22:21,794 --> 01:22:30,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, like you know how like when you were the only person that listened to this band and then suddenly everybody's listening to the band and you're like, it's just not so special anymore.

1122
01:22:30,316 --> 01:22:32,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about Guitar Hero.

1123
01:22:32,516 --> 01:22:38,938
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, call me an elitist, whatever, but am I doing myself a disservice by not checking out Guitar Hero 2?

1124
01:22:39,978 --> 01:22:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1125
01:22:40,778 --> 01:22:42,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely yes.

1126
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:43,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very yes.

1127
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Tiara says no.

1128
01:22:46,191 --> 01:22:46,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?

1129
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:58,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you spend all the time that you spend playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero 2, learning to play an actual guitar, think of all the amazing songs you could play.

1130
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:03,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, weren't you telling me a story earlier today about somebody that was in a guitar class?

1131
01:23:03,102 --> 01:23:04,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me the story about the girl in the guitar class.

1132
01:23:05,704 --> 01:23:09,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this involves my boyfriend, Adam.

1133
01:23:09,466 --> 01:23:12,308
[SPEAKER_07]: He's taking a guitar class at the community college.

1134
01:23:13,015 --> 01:23:21,220
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's a girl in his class who was asking him, you know, do you believe in psychics and explaining something about this one particular psychic.

1135
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:26,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Adam told her, the only psychic I believe in is Professor Charles Xavier.

1136
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:31,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And so her response was, does he teach at this campus?

1137
01:23:35,848 --> 01:23:37,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't have anything to do with Guitar Hero.

1138
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:40,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, but you were telling me, okay, yeah.

1139
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:42,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, haha, she's stupid.

1140
01:23:43,062 --> 01:23:48,244
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other part about this was, wait, what was this, she asked him if he knew Boston or what was this?

1141
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:56,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, apparently all she plays is Guitar Hero because she asked him if he had ever heard of a band called Boston.

1142
01:23:57,362 --> 01:24:12,651
[SPEAKER_07]: and the song that she mentioned was the song on the original Guitar Hero and every time that she says that she likes a band and he asks what songs that she likes from that band, it's the song that's on Guitar Heroes and she doesn't know any of the other songs.

1143
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:14,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you know what?

1144
01:24:15,073 --> 01:24:22,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I give her credit though for at least taking Tiara's advice and going to take a real guitar class instead of playing Guitar Hero 2.

1145
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:24,874
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm sure it's a great game.

1146
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:27,116
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, there's other games I wanted more.

1147
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:28,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get it next week.

1148
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:29,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get the 361.

1149
01:24:29,877 --> 01:24:32,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to you I will buy the 361, like launch day.

1150
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:33,360
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1151
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,281
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1152
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:37,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I will shove this mic up your butt.

1153
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:37,423
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1154
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:38,804
[SPEAKER_10]: You can come to my house and play.

1155
01:24:39,384 --> 01:24:39,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I just might.

1156
01:24:40,365 --> 01:24:40,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1157
01:24:41,305 --> 01:24:43,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard on a Bobby show tonight that it supports progressive scan.

1158
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

1159
01:24:44,888 --> 01:24:45,908
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks really nice on my TV.

1160
01:24:46,108 --> 01:24:46,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Not special.

1161
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:46,829
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1162
01:24:48,504 --> 01:24:53,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get a copy for you and I'll put it on my PlayStation 2 and you can play on that.

1163
01:24:53,847 --> 01:24:54,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sounds good.

1164
01:24:54,927 --> 01:24:56,328
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll get the 360 version.

1165
01:24:56,388 --> 01:24:57,088
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I said earlier.

1166
01:24:57,589 --> 01:25:02,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see the point in getting the PlayStation 2 one when we know the 360 one will be better because of its expandability.

1167
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:05,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I can wait.

1168
01:25:05,913 --> 01:25:06,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you?

1169
01:25:07,994 --> 01:25:09,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I sold mine, so yes.

1170
01:25:10,783 --> 01:25:22,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, on that note, we're going to go to a little bit of a break because obviously I need a sedative, so I'm going to go take some Tylenol PM during this break and we'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a little bit of a break.

1171
01:25:23,266 --> 01:25:28,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.

1172
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:33,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
