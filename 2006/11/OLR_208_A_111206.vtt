Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Who's your hosts?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Dark Sakura,

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Sky,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
and Loco.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Tonight, November 12th, 2006.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Microsoft unveils movie and television downloads,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
PlayStation 3 games get some new dates and some postponed dates,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
and can you Willy install Linux on the Wii?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Hello boys and girls on the internet.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
We are that video game show dedicated to video games,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
gamer lifestyle, gamer culture, and all that other stuff.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
You know, it's about two and a half to three hours of just chat.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
We like to think of ourselves as sitting around the table at the local diner

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
just bitching about video games while we're waiting for our food.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
And the service is very slow tonight, hence why the show is about two and a half hours long.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, lamest comparison ever, sorry.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
But it's kind of what the show is like a little bit.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Like, remember back in the day when we would all go play DDR

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
and then we'd go to the local diner and have soup and just talk and BS and stuff, right?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers, local co-host?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Yes, sometimes.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Sometimes?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Sometimes.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Rawr.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Would you say that was a fair comparison, Mr. Loki?

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Techmaster Loki?

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm sorry, I didn't hear most of that.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, maybe if you were listening to the show and not playing on your computer

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
while we're trying to get things started here,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
maybe you would have heard my really bad comparison.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
I was just trying to look up to see if anyone had commented on a certain story

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
that ran earlier this week and, you know.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Well, I think you should be focusing on the show now.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
It is on the show. It's show related.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I need your full attention, Mr. Loki.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Joining us tonight are some special guests,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
and hopefully I can get through the show tonight without berating.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
Say hello to someone who hasn't been on the show in several years, actually,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
but one of Jamie's good buddies from Alabama, right?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
You guys used to live there together?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Actually, I left and she moved there.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Okay.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, say hello, nevertheless, to Tiara.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hello.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
How are you?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm well, thank you.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
All right.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
And also say hello to our old Orange Lounge Radio favorite, Drew Nami.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
If I don't get my French toast soon, I'm going to go kick someone's ass.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
What?

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Bad service.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Oh, I get it. Hello.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Someone needs to pay attention to the show, Mr. Sky.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
All right, shut up.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Anyway, here we are, and another week.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We're sitting just before the brink of madness.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
Video game system releases, PlayStation 3 and Wii.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Really quickly, who's getting what?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Who's getting what system?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm getting a Wii, but not a PlayStation 3 just yet.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Dark Sakura.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm getting a Wii and a PlayStation 3.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Loki.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm getting a Wii.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Uh, Tiara.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
I'm getting nothing because I am poor.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Aw, sorry to hear it.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Drew Nami?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm getting a Wii when I get the chance.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
All right, so that's, let's see, one, two, three, four Wiis and one PS3.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Not my choice.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
And one, you know, one cup of coffee, I guess.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I could send you a Game Boy.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
We have lots of love for Tiara.

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
She can watch us all unpack them on YouTube because apparently that makes for riveting

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
game news this week is, you know, watch me play my Wii and rub it in your face that you

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
don't have one.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
It is such horrible blogging news.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
Seriously, like every single blog I visited this week, I guess Nintendo loves everyone

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
else more than us.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Whatever, I don't care.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I'm over it.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
But every other website is like, hey, look, here's a video on YouTube of us taking the

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
Wii out of the box and showing it all in front of the camera.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And then here's me playing Excite Truck.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I don't know.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
It's kind of like I'm reading the same thing on every single blog.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
I'm like, isn't there like real news this week?

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
I know it's still early in the week, though.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
But as far as I'm aware, Jessica Chobert has not licked the Wii.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
I may be able to beat her to that.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
Actually, we might have to get Dark Sakura, maybe our own lovely gaming babe here to lick

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
some various devices.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
How does it sound?

04:14.000 --> 04:20.000
If by lick you remove the L and put a K there, then I'll do that to the PS3.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
It would be hilarious if we could get like some porn star to, you know, with a Wii.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Do we know a porn star?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
To like maybe put the Wii remote someplace.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Actually, I have a friend who works for a gay porn company.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
We could get a gay porn star.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Close enough, I guess.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
I don't know if the whole internet will be into that.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Maybe we'll get posted on Gay Gamer.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
I don't know.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Maybe something.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I don't know.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
All right.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Anyway, seriously though, let's talk about some gaming news tonight.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
I'm sorry.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
First, how was your gaming week?

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
I swear this Fiji water is not spiked tonight.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You were publicly endorsing a brand of water.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Well, whatever.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
I don't care.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Actually, that's the water I drink.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Played Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit last night.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
In fact, quite a bit last night.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
We played all the way through Easy and then through a bunch of Medium,

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
and I will let the almighty unlocker of Trogdor tell you about that later.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
And then I got inspired and left the room so that I could make the preshow

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
with a bunch of, you know, stuff that was in Guitar Hero 2.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
I was going to put Thunder Horse from Venture Brothers.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
What was the band?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Death Lock.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
And I was going to put that in the show, but I decided not to.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
And if you want to hear Trogdor, you have to stay and listen to the entire show.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Of course, if you're on the podcast, it won't do you any good

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
because it's copyrighted.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Sorry, kids.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
And then I looked at Trauma Center and haven't played it yet,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
and then Dan started playing Final Fantasy XII for me.

05:57.000 --> 06:07.000
So I'm a little bit upset at him, and I played some more PSU.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
I'm only level 3.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Slowly but surely, making your way.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Leveling is slow in PSU.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
I played religiously for several days, and I'm only like level 12.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
So it ain't going to get any quicker, I'm sorry to say.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
I just solo through all the missions.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Seriously, play single player.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
You level up so much faster.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Just skip all the cut scenes and play single player.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
It doesn't level your online character.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, sadly, no, it doesn't.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Okay, then.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
I want to level my online character.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
If you're just going to play by yourself.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
I got PSU to play through the online missions.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I just wanted to start leveling my stuff.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
All right.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
Anything else, Ms. Dark Sakura?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
No.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
It was full of stuff, actually.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Of course, I picked up two big 360 games this week.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
Gears of War, which I've played for not very long, actually, so far.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I haven't really played much through it.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I tried a little bit of the single player, got past the first mission,

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
and played a little bit of the multiplayer on one console.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
So, I mean, not a real good indicator of what the multiplayer is, but it's okay.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I don't know, to be honest, I don't think the multiplayer is that great,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
at least from what I've seen so far, unless online is just totally phenomenal.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
But it seems to be just a race for the chainsaw,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
who can pull out the chainsaw the fastest is the winner.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So I guess that's kind of neat.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
And then the game itself is not like, I mean, it's pretty cool,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
but it's not like, oh, my God, this is so amazing.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
It's just a pretty game, and I think it's a pretty game

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
that's going to get forgotten pretty quick, but whatever.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Really?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, really.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Even despite all the praise that's being lavished upon it.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Well, look at the people there giving the praise for it.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
They're saying, oh, my God, it's so phenomenal.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Oh, my God, it's so innovative.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
What's so innovative about it?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Okay, wow, it has a cover system.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Hooray.

08:05.000 --> 08:09.000
You know, and it's got, you know, it's really intense.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
Do you work for EA?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't work for EA.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
But you're wearing a Call of Duty shirt.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Exactly.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, wait, that's Activision.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
I have two Call of Duty shirts.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Never mind.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
And this was on the top of the hamper.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
So, anyways, so, yeah, I'll play through it.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm sure it's going to be a pretty cool game.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
And there is one good thing about it, though, the co-op is amazing.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
So at least they've got that going for it,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
because there aren't that many good co-op games nowadays.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And it's almost like Contra, I should say.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
You know, that's kind of what it reminds me of, you know,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
two people playing through the game, which also leads me to Contra,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
which I played a little bit this week.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You know, Contra is Contra, so it's pretty cool.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
Then, of course, Call of Duty 3 I bought.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
That one is really cool.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Personally, I like the multiplayer in Call of Duty 3 a lot better.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.000
I've been playing it, you know, locally with a few of my friends at work,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
and it's just fun.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
It's definitely improved over to the last one.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
The only thing I don't like about the multiplayer in it, though,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
is that your little kind of HUD radar thing that they have,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
they do not show the gunshots going off like they used to in the first one.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
So, I mean, playing like a 10-minute game,

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
it might be hard to find people.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
Also, since the maps don't say how many people they're meant for,

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
which, you know, the old one did,

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
so you kind of get an idea which map is large, which one's smaller,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
and that type of thing.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
This one's kind of flying blind.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
But the game's pretty cool, though, because you get to drive vehicles and stuff,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
and I got a lot of my kills running over people with Jeeps,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
so that's pretty cool, and I do like that.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
And the game looks a lot better, so that'll be pretty cool.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
Grand Theft Auto's Vice City story has been playing a little bit more, of course.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
Really playing more of this, I'm starting to like the game a little bit more,

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
but also at the same time I'm frustrated with how lazy their programming is.

09:58.000 --> 10:03.000
For example, when you're playing certain spawn areas on the second island,

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
you can actually see there's a barrier

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
blocking you from going to the first island again,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
and when you pass that barrier, you die.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.000
So they do have the technology to be able to create a barrier

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
around a certain section of the map,

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
which they should have done anyways to make the maps a lot smaller,

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
but they didn't because they're too fucking lazy, so whatever.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
But the game is fun, kind of figuring out the nuances of it,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
but still Grand Theft Auto.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.000
It's a little bit more realistic as far as some of the vehicle damage and stuff.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
And then, other than that, Elder of Scrolls Oblivion,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I've played through about half of that now,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
and hopefully I'm going to finish the other half.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
I've got to grind through it so I can sell it back, that type of thing.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
And yeah, cheating all the way.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
All right. Hooray for cheating, I guess.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
Let's see, my gaming week.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Let's see, what have I played this week?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I played Gears of War as well, but I'm not ready to review it yet

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
because I won't give it a review until I try out co-op,

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
because if co-op is everything everyone says it is,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
then I really need to look at it.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
So we'll wait until next week for me to talk about Gears of War.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
But I am ready to talk about two other games I picked up this week,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
and one of them is Elite Beat Agents,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
which of course is the English version of Oh and Don,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
which is available on the Nintendo DS.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
Elite Beat Agents is quite possibly the best music-based game ever

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
for the casual player.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
I don't know so much about those that are totally sucked into music games.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
They might find the game to be a little bit easy on some of the earlier modes,

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
and yeah, there are some challenging modes that come up later on,

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
and you know, whatever.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But for most people, for those folks that are too afraid to get on a DDR machine

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
because they're afraid of looking like an ass,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
or those folks that are too afraid to touch a BeatMania controller

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
because it's like turntables, buttons, I don't do this.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
This could be quite possibly the best casual music game.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
I put it right up there with Guitar Hero in the ease of just pick it up and go.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And even some people don't want to play Guitar Hero

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
because they're like, that's kind of weird.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
But Elite Beat Agents is easy.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
No one else can see because it's on the DS,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and it's just you pick up the pen and go.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
And the song list is surprisingly really good.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
I know a lot of people were like, ugh, it's got a weird combination of songs.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
But dude, if a game can make Ashley Simpson's Lala kind of fun,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I think it deserves a lot of credit.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So I give Elite Beat Agents a lot of credit.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
It's funny.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
It cracked me up.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Even one stage is kind of sad and a little bit sniffly,

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
but I wouldn't cry because I'm a man.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
But no, the game's a lot of fun.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Basically, for those that don't know,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
the essential element of the game is that you tap.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
You tap on the bottom screen, but you follow these patterns,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
and you tap like in the beat of the music.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
For instance, if you're playing Material Girl,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
your tapping might go along with the words,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
like doo doo doo doo doo doo,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and you kind of drag the stylus in some parts too and follow a little ball.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
So it's a lot more fun than it sounds

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
because the animations and things really kind of keep you involved.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
The only small complaint I have with the game is that, you know,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
for the hardcore music game fan,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
they're going to breeze through it in like a day,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
at least play all the songs.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
At least there's harder difficulties than there was in the Japanese Oh and Don

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
to kind of keep the hardcore music fan base interested in the game.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
But I definitely highly, highly, highly recommend Elite Beat Agents

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
to anyone who is slightly interested in the music genre of games.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
Also, the other cool thing about Elite Beat Agents,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
multiplayer mode is kind of fun,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
and you can do it with just one cartridge.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
You can play most of the songs just off of one cartridge.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
It takes forever to download the game,

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
but, you know, it works out.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
You know, small price to pay for not having everybody to have the same game.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
And then, of course, it has this very similar type of functionality

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
for when both people have the cartridge.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
It just runs even smoothly, so it's great.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Other game I picked up this week and played is Luminous 2,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
which is out on the PSP.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
And, you know, Luminous was my absolute favorite game that was released this year,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
and so I still have a lot of love for Luminous 2

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
because they didn't really change anything.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
But that's also kind of my biggest problem with Luminous 2

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
is that half of the skins were Luminous 1 skins.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
And I don't think a lot of people picked up on this

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
because maybe people played Luminous 1 and then forgot about it.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
But seriously, if you think, for instance,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
those folks that follow music-based games,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
if you think DDR repeats are bad, Luminous puts it to shame.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Luminous repeats damn near every single skin from the first game

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
that wasn't a licensed song.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
It's kind of sad.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
But on the bright side now, the good stuff about the game

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
is that Luminous 2 appears to,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
and I haven't played with this mode a whole lot yet,

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
but it appears to let you do your own music, which is kind of rad.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
It comes with a lot of new skins.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Some have music videos.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Some are, you know, in-house made.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
You see a lot of them on the Xbox Live version of the game.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
There's mission mode involved and versus involved,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
and there's a demo of every extent extra.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
There's a lot of new modes that keep it fresh.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
So if you don't own the original Luminous,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
there's a lot for you.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And if you like puzzle games at all,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
you definitely need to have Luminous 2.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
It's a must-own game if you don't have the original Luminous.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
If you do have the original Luminous,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
then I would ask you how important are these new modes to you?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Do you really want to be able to use your own music?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Do you really want to be able to do this other stuff?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Do you really want to play to holla back, girl?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
How much of a necessity is that to you?

15:24.000 --> 15:29.000
And if the answer is, I must, then sure, go get the game.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
You know, it's only 30 bucks.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
It's not a bad value.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
But I don't know if you would want this and the Xbox Live one

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
unless you are just really crazy about your puzzle games

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
or your Luminous.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And that was my gaming week.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Besides a lot of Phantasy Star Universe,

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I've been playing a hell of a lot of Phantasy Star Universe single-player mode.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I don't know what it is.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
The story was really cliche and the voice acting is horrific,

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
especially in the first couple chapters.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
But now that I'm past that and I'm in about Chapter 8 now,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
the story has kind of gotten a little bit interesting.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
It's like watching an anime.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
It's like I'm playing an anime.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Seriously, if you're into anime,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
you've got to check out Phantasy Star Universe

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
and give it a fair shot,

16:05.000 --> 16:10.000
because, I mean, it copies it to a T.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
It's crazy.

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Speaking of T, Tiara, would you like to share your gaming week with us?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
What kind of stuff you've been playing?

16:18.000 --> 16:24.000
As Soy said, we played Guitar Heroes 2 last night.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
She was around long enough to beat Easy Mode

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
and then I played through Medium or whatever you call it,

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
Normal Mode, long enough to unlock Trogdor.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
And then we played Trogdor and then we went to sleep.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
But before that, I played Tetris on my phone for a million hours

16:43.000 --> 16:48.000
while we waited for A Nightmare Before Christmas to start.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Because somebody bought tickets for the 1230 show

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
and we actually got there at like 1030,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
so it was like two hours of Tetris joy.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I thought I was going to get lost.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
She got lost everywhere else, that's all.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
But I got lost in a cool way,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
because we found underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah, under.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
But that's it. Excitement. The end.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Now, actually, I want to interview you for a little bit,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
because you haven't been on the show in a long time,

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
and last time you were on the show

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
was when we were still exclusively talking about music-based games.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
So now we have a whole new world

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
and more people listen to the show thanks to iTunes and XB Stream

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
and all games and all that stuff.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
What kind of games do you enjoy?

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Are you a computer gamer? Are you a console gamer?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
What would you say is your favorite way of playing games?

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
Actually, my outside of the home life has been so busy lately

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
that I haven't really done a lot of gaming.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
I actually gave up WoW, which was amazing,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
because I never thought I would do that.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Seriously, I was so addicted,

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
and I was like main healer in my guild and everything,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
and one day I was just like, you know what?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I think outside is nice, too.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I'm going to go outdoors and play today.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Where are you from, so our listeners know?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
I'm from Las Vegas.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Las Vegas.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
I know we have some listeners in Vegas, so very cool.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
All right, so you were kind of a PC gamer

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
back before you found The Great Outdoors,

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
because it sounds like you played WoW,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
and I know, didn't you play Ragnarok for a little bit,

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
some of that other stuff?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, I did play Ragnarok online.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Do you own any consoles?

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
I own a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, a Game Gear, and a DS.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
So you're a classic gamer.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
All right.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
The classics are awesome.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You ever played The Guardian Legend?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Best 8-bit game ever.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Find it.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Seriously, it's the best.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It's the most underrated title ever.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I will not shut up about this game

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
until I get my sequel on one of the next-gen consoles.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
I don't care if the rights are somewhere in a black hole right now.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Fucking find those rights.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Give me a sequel to The Guardian Legend.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
It's not that much to ask.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Please.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Just write your congressman.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm going to write Feinstein tonight and say,

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
I want a bill passed that will make them make A Guardian Legend 2.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
P.S., I'm crazy.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Junami, how was your gaming week?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, similar to Yarrarar, I sort of gave up WoW for a bit,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
even though I'm still freaking paying for it.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
I was playing Guitar Hero 2 for most of the week,

19:11.000 --> 19:17.000
unlocked everything, everything, beat hard mode, that kind of stuff.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I was just really enjoying it.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Played a little bit of Tales of the Abyss and a little bit of Final Fantasy XII.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Didn't really get anywhere on either of those.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Other than that, I've been enjoying the great outdoors myself.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
What's up with you people and going outdoors?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
It's winter.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
It's cold out.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
It's like right before winter.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
It's like the most wonderful time of the year.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
I haven't been going outdoors.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I've been going bar-doors.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I was going to say, you live in Vegas.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
There's nothing to do.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I've been to Vegas.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
There's nothing to do outdoors in Vegas except make things out of dirt.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Everything you do in Vegas is indoors and pretty and lights and all that stuff.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Although, when you live in Vegas, you hate the casinos, don't you?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Yeah.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
That's what I hear.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
We've just passed the law for no smoking in restaurants and stuff,

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
so that should be nice.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Wow.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
That's going to be crazy.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
We didn't pass the law for smoking marijuana, though,

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
because all of those stupid stoners were too stoned to go vote.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
Right.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Well, before we get into a political show,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
I might be in Vegas for a Consumer Electronics Show.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
I'm currently toying with two ideas.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
I'm either going to go to Consumer Electronics Show

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
or I'm going to go to Disneyland.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
It depends how much money I have.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
So, one or the other.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
We'll see.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Anyway, let's go to our chat room,

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
which is available at chat.orangeloungeradio.com

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
and get some comments from our chat room because the folks over there,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
we have quite a big crowd there tonight.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
We're making some good comments there, except now I can't find any.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
We have a lot of people that are listening tonight that say they live in Vegas.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
DJ Jenai, Gilder, both live in Vegas, saying hello.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
And then, of course, too, that press start says does not live in Vegas.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
Jeremy Todd, one is shocked that Drew Nami is giving up World of Warcraft.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Actually, I have something to share with everybody.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
What's that?

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
Foodie Monster on our chat room right now put up the best you-know-who parody

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
for our little video game caption thing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Ah, Tak Jomsom.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Tak Jomsom.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Yes.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
No, yeah, for those that didn't hear,

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
I put out a call the other week because remember when Tak Jomsom decided to sue Midway

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
or, I don't know, wrote a nasty letter to Midway or whatever he did

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
over the fact that there was create a character and somebody made his likeness?

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
So I put out a challenge to our listeners to create Tak Jomsom

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
in as many different likenesses as you could in different games.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Like I was hoping to see one in Oblivion.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
Well, Foodie Monster put one up from what?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
What was it, City of Heroes?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
I believe so.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
City of Villains.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
City of Villains.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.000
Oh, well, how appropriate, City of Villains.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, City of Villains.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Awesome.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
The O.L. Army salutes you, Foodie Monster.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Good job.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
I want to see more.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
You know what else we need to do?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
Huh?

21:55.000 --> 22:02.000
We need to give our special foreign correspondent from the People's Republic of Davis a shout-out.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It is Puppy's birthday.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Ah.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.000
So happy birthday to Puppy.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Happy birthday, Puppy.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
And in dog years he's going to fall over and die any moment now.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Let's see.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
What else do I want to say regarding chat comments?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Jeremy Todd 1 asked me in regards to my gaming week, which game is better?

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
Luminous Live, Luminous 1, or Luminous 2?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
It depends.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
I would say if you don't own any of them, but you have a PSP, Luminous 2 is probably

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
the best one.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Just because it practically has all of Luminous 1 in it.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
But if you already own Luminous 1, the question is are these little upgrades and the fact

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
that they're going to recycle half of what you already have, is that enough for you to

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
upgrade the game?

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Question mark.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
I don't know.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
It depends how addicted you are to the game.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
I do think Luminous Live is pretty cool too, though, for those that don't have a PSP.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Don't go out and buy a PSP just for Luminous like I did.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
The Xbox Live one is fine.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
It's just that the Xbox needs a better D-pad.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It needs a better D-pad.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Please, some third party, I don't know.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
Maybe there's Microsoft issues why nobody's done this yet.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
But seriously, somebody needs to put out a better D-pad.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
Get a better D-pad for the Xbox 360.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Somebody.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
And then, you know, Luminous Live has Xbox Live and all that stuff, which is kind of

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
cool.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
So, I'll say that's cool.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
Housekeeping and things that are going on.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We don't have a whole lot of announcements tonight.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
Next week, we're going to be joined by John, also known as DMN, who is a frequent caller

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
of the program.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And he's going to be joining us for some Wii madness next week.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
That should be exciting.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
And I guess what else could we say?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
It's Emergence Day.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
It's November 12th, which is Emergence Day.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Oh, I should also say Happy Birthday to Rice Princess, if she's listening, because it is

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
her B-Day.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
Let's get into some gaming news, since there was no housekeeping.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I will say this.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I got served.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
If you listen to Part B of last week's show, I said, we were talking about a rumor at that

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
time that Microsoft was going to be offering movies and TV downloads.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And I said, no way.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
They won't do it.

24:05.000 --> 24:11.000
If they sold HD downloads, it would totally nerf the sales of the HD DVD.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
So, what did Microsoft announce on Tuesday?

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
Oh, that they're going to be offering movie and TV downloads in HD format.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah, I got told.

24:21.000 --> 24:28.000
Well, anyway, they announced that various shows from MTV, CBS, movies from such places

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
like Paramount Pictures, all this stuff would be available.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.000
In fact, there's some screenshots circulating, and you can see some downloads include V for

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Vendetta, Poseidon, Cradle to the Grave, Lethal Weapon 4.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
I know the TV stuff they're offering, old school Star Trek, but the redone special effects,

24:46.000 --> 24:52.000
that one, and Survivor and Pimp My Ride, because you really want to have that on the Microsoft

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
360.

24:54.000 --> 25:02.000
Basically, in a recent story that was on Joystiq, Scott Henson from Microsoft talked a little

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
bit about how things would work.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
Henson mentioned that the files that you download, they will be stored on the 360's hard drive

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
unit, and there's not going to be an option to stream videos from the Windows computer,

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
because you can kind of already do that if they're in WMV, and the other formats have

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
those licensing issues that go with them, hence why you can't play Divx movies on your

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
360.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
You can if you have the media extender for some stuff.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Is that because that has the licenses or whatever?

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Maybe.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
I don't think that plays everything.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.000
Your average 22 minute high definition TV show will be about 1 gigabyte, and the standard

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
definition version will be 300 megabytes.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
720p is what all the high def stuff is going to be encoded in.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
They're not going to go up to 1080.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I would imagine that's because of space concerns.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
720p is really not that bad.

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
If you have the eye to distinguish between the two, then maybe you ought to just get

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
an HD DVD drive into it that way.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I don't know.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
The way the rentals work is that once you buy the thing, you'll have two weeks to start

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
the download movie, and then you have 24 hours to finish it, and inside that 24 hour window,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
you can watch the movie as much as you want.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
The television shows, though, are basically download to keep, just like it is on iTunes.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
No word yet about price.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
I don't know.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Does this sound interesting to you guys?

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Is this something you guys are looking into doing with your Xbox 360?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Do you think you'll actually download some stuff?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
It's kind of neat.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
There's a lot of good content on there.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
I mean, they've got South Park, Robot Chicken, just like a Chappelle show, if you're into

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
that kind of stuff.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Lots of Pimp My Ride.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
It just shows that I think people that play the Xbox 360 would be interested in it.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Dr. Suckra?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
I have the internet.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
I don't need this.

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
So are you endorsing underground schemes such as BitTorrent?

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I'm making a secret of it.

26:54.000 --> 27:03.000
I think that it's a good idea, in theory, for people who maybe aren't so computer savvy,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
maybe.

27:04.000 --> 27:13.000
Or people who are slaves to MTV's programming content and can't live without the same mindless

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
stuff that they throw out at everybody on their regular station.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
They have to infect Xbox Live as well.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
So, more power to them.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
But I have YouTube.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Alright, fair enough.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
Well, technically YouTube is not supposed to have a lot of that content on there anyways

27:28.000 --> 27:31.000
and they've gotten in trouble for that.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
But I have DVDs as well.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
Being an HD TV owner, I'm kind of excited about the fact that you can get HD content.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
And the movies do interest me.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.000
Because I was looking at what's available on HD DVD the other night because I was considering

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
getting the Xbox 360 HD DVD drive.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
And honestly, I have to be honest.

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
I looked side-by-side at what was available on HD DVD and what was available on Blu-ray,

27:54.000 --> 27:58.000
and I gotta say, there's way more on Blu-ray than I want, as opposed to HD DVD.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.000
But, really what's stopping me is that the kind of movies I actually like to watch, I

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
know I'm going to sound like a total snob, but I like to watch indie movies and foreign

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
films and that kind of stuff.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And none of that is available on either platform.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Very, very little.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
Unfortunately, the Blu-ray version of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Special Edition,

28:15.000 --> 28:21.000
which is going to have cut-out scenes and stuff like that, that's only on Blu-ray.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.000
Duh!

28:22.000 --> 28:27.000
We'll rip that sucker in HD and stream it to the 360.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
To be honest, I would rather do my HD movies this way.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I just am concerned about space.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
TV shows, though, if they're non-HD, no way.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
I think iPods got the better setup for that.

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
Granted, I don't have an iPod right now, but I'm hoping I'll get some gift certificates

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
for Christmas or something and I might be able to get one after the holiday season or

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
what-have-you.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.600
So, I like the idea of being able to hook it up into the iPod where there's an 80-gigabyte

28:50.600 --> 28:55.200
drive and I can just get that little cable and take the TV shows anywhere.

28:55.200 --> 28:59.240
The ones that are standard deaf anyway, like if I actually, heaven forbid, bought Pimp

28:59.240 --> 29:04.400
My Ride, I'd obviously have to be smoking marijuana, not Nevada, but somewhere, to be

29:04.400 --> 29:10.040
wanting to download that, but no, no, no, that show is, I like the show, I just wouldn't

29:10.040 --> 29:14.400
pay for the show.

29:14.400 --> 29:15.400
It's a fun show.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.400
It's just like Mythbusters.

29:16.400 --> 29:17.520
I love watching.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.080
That's something that they didn't have on there.

29:19.080 --> 29:23.760
They should have episodes of Mythbusters because that's an awesome show, but, you know, hey,

29:23.760 --> 29:24.980
I noticed something, though.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.720
I noticed that G4 shows weren't on there and that's kind of surprising, too.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.540
I mean, you'd think that a cable network like that would want to, I don't know, sell their

29:32.540 --> 29:35.760
shows to make any sorts of money that they can possibly make.

29:35.760 --> 29:37.800
Good riddance, I say.

29:37.800 --> 29:43.360
I think it's interesting, though, that Microsoft is not embracing yet the online, the huge

29:43.360 --> 29:49.760
resource online there is of free videos and free audio streams such as podcasts and vodcasts

29:49.760 --> 29:57.280
and that whole thing, or I'm sorry, blogcasts and vlogcasts, if you are an Xbox 360 only

29:57.280 --> 30:03.760
type person that won't call them podcasts, so, God, retarded, whatever, I don't care,

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
whatever.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
It's just a word.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Well, okay, I'm curious.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.560
Real quick, Drew, is this something that interests you?

30:10.560 --> 30:14.640
Not really considering I don't even have a 360.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.640
All right, then, enough said.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.640
I guess I asked the wrong person.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.520
I won't bother asking Tiara, then.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.000
Let me think.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.080
Oh, what do you think about this, though, the Trojan horse aspect of this?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.840
Didn't we, I mean, a lot of people were saying this.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.920
It wasn't just us, but a year ago when these next-gen systems were first being formed,

30:28.920 --> 30:31.440
a lot of us said, oh, these are Trojan horses.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.480
They're going to be put in your living room under the guise of a game system, but they're

30:34.480 --> 30:38.920
going to be all this entertainment in a box, and look at it, it's coming to life.

30:38.920 --> 30:44.040
I would also like to point out that the Xbox 360 demo thing that they had where you sat

30:44.040 --> 30:48.760
on the floor and the thing rumbled under your butt, the big speaker thing, that they said

30:48.760 --> 30:51.480
all this.

30:51.480 --> 30:58.040
It was part of their thing when they had the Xbox 360 at E3 years ago.

30:58.040 --> 31:01.320
Oh, so like something that they teased a long time ago.

31:01.320 --> 31:02.320
Yes.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.320
Ah, very interesting.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.320
Of course they want to do that.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.320
Of course.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.600
Their media center PCs aren't selling that great, so they got to sell something that's

31:08.600 --> 31:09.600
like a media center.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.080
So how long before the PlayStation 3 follows?

31:12.080 --> 31:13.080
Instantly.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.880
I mean, seriously, instantly.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.480
As soon as it comes out, it's there.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.840
Where will Nintendo fit into all this, or do they care?

31:20.840 --> 31:21.840
They don't care.

31:21.840 --> 31:22.840
All right.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.240
Nintendo doesn't really have to care.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.240
They're Nintendo.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.560
They don't have to care yet.

31:27.560 --> 31:32.880
I mean, after all, they're not even jumping on the, what is it, online bandwagon yet.

31:32.880 --> 31:40.720
But so anyways, with most everything that's released nowadays or announced for Microsoft,

31:40.720 --> 31:43.760
Sony always has to make a counterpoint to anything.

31:43.760 --> 31:48.800
And their big thing was, oh yeah, this download service sucks.

31:48.800 --> 31:55.280
And you know, in that case, I do have to agree with Sony because, well, you have to, your

31:55.280 --> 31:59.080
hard drive's not really going to be able to accommodate the volume you'll be downloading.

31:59.080 --> 32:03.400
In fact, Microsoft's even pretty much said the same thing.

32:03.400 --> 32:09.720
It was Aaron Greenberg, who was the group product marketing manager, actually said that

32:09.720 --> 32:14.320
they aren't ready to bring out a larger hard drive yet so that basically you can use your

32:14.320 --> 32:20.520
memory card and get your own hard drive and use it to download stuff.

32:20.520 --> 32:25.120
So in other words, because we're too lazy to put out an 80 gig hard drive right now,

32:25.120 --> 32:29.160
you should just buy four 20 gigs to store all this shit.

32:29.160 --> 32:34.600
Yeah, and that's basically kind of the same thing that Sony was saying about their content.

32:34.600 --> 32:38.840
Basically PlayStation 3's content is designed for everyone to enjoy right out of the box,

32:38.840 --> 32:42.880
which is bullshit anyways because you have to buy special cables if you want that nice

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
HD.

32:43.880 --> 32:48.200
No matter what configuration you purchase, we would never segregate or shut out any of

32:48.200 --> 32:51.880
our consumers from our entertainment experience because they didn't have the top of the line

32:51.880 --> 32:53.200
system.

32:53.200 --> 32:57.320
Both PlayStation 3 versions are available on November 17th, including hard drives for

32:57.320 --> 33:03.520
downloading content and also installing your games onto them so that they can stream faster

33:03.520 --> 33:05.920
because your Blu-ray drive is slow.

33:05.920 --> 33:09.600
But the thing though that is really awesome about the PlayStation 3 though, at least you

33:09.600 --> 33:13.760
can add larger hard drives and thank God for that.

33:13.760 --> 33:16.920
That is at least one thing that they did right.

33:16.920 --> 33:23.240
You could do that with the PS2 as well though, with their HD unit, I'm sorry the hard drive

33:23.240 --> 33:24.240
thing.

33:24.240 --> 33:28.040
Because we put like 150 gig on ours.

33:28.040 --> 33:36.360
Yeah, for non-online Sony game related stuff.

33:36.360 --> 33:41.720
But also a lot of games, especially in Japan, made big use of the hard drive because you

33:41.720 --> 33:43.840
would load a good portion of your game.

33:43.840 --> 33:50.320
Like for example, on TDX6 style, with the hard drive you could load all the songs into

33:50.320 --> 33:56.640
the hard drive and then play the, what was that mode called?

33:56.640 --> 33:59.080
The marathon mode.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.080
Non-stop or whatever it is.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.080
Yeah, the non-stop.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.080
Endless.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.880
Yeah, you could just play endless until you lost.

34:05.880 --> 34:09.240
They even had some games where I believe, wasn't it Final Fantasy XII you could load

34:09.240 --> 34:10.780
onto the hard drive too?

34:10.780 --> 34:15.500
The 2DX Nazis in our chat room are correcting you, it's 5th style, not 6th style.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.840
It was one of those, I was close.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.840
This style was better than 6th style, so yeah.

34:21.840 --> 34:26.320
10 of them available, no, 9 or whatever, I lost count.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.320
A lot.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.320
There's a lot.

34:28.320 --> 34:32.200
I gave up after 8th style, which was the last good one, thank you.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.200
I want to make a comment on this.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.440
Who is this guy that said I need to buy multiple hard drives?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.800
Who was it that said that?

34:37.800 --> 34:39.280
Aaron somebody.

34:39.280 --> 34:44.720
Aaron somebody, fuck a whole lot of you, okay, because look, when your two biggest competitors

34:44.720 --> 34:49.040
are offering something better already, you got no room to be making this statement about

34:49.040 --> 34:51.760
how I should be buying additional 100 gig hard drives.

34:51.760 --> 34:57.240
Don't get me wrong, 360, I still love you, but right now, look, I can get an 80 gig hard

34:57.240 --> 35:00.840
drive in the size of my hand with the iPod, take it wherever I want, and then with the

35:00.840 --> 35:04.400
Sony department, you're going to be able to put whatever hard drive you want in it.

35:04.400 --> 35:09.240
Laptop hard drives are not $100, especially a 20 gig hard drive for a laptop is dirt cheap.

35:09.240 --> 35:17.080
And the fact that you can buy, you know, 150 gig, you know, laptop drive for probably less

35:17.080 --> 35:20.960
than you're going to be spending on whatever their next hard drive that they come out for

35:20.960 --> 35:24.480
the 360, which is probably going to be like 60 or something.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.720
So I don't know, it's just retarded.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.600
All right.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.800
Anyway, let's move on to another topic.

35:32.800 --> 35:36.680
Sticking with Xbox, because I do, you know, even if I think this whole lack of a larger

35:36.680 --> 35:40.880
hard drive thing is a little bit silly, Xbox does do a lot of things right, and one of

35:40.880 --> 35:43.580
them is the Xbox Live Arcade.

35:43.580 --> 35:50.720
Despite the fact that Contra is kind of broken, there are some new games coming out for Xbox

35:50.720 --> 35:58.400
Live Arcade, including, before the end of the year, Assault Heroes, Heavy Weapon, Novadrome,

35:58.400 --> 36:02.360
and yes, Loki, just for you, Small Arms, all coming out before the end of the year.

36:02.360 --> 36:07.640
By the way, Microsoft also this week announced a partnership with Atari to bring some classic

36:07.640 --> 36:12.600
Atari games to Xbox Live in 2007, as if they didn't have enough retro titles.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.240
I've seen pictures of them, too.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.240
Yeah?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.240
They look pretty good.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.040
Well, they've got, you know, kind of like the Konami titles on there.

36:19.040 --> 36:23.960
They have their retro mode and their, you know, kind of remastered mode, I guess.

36:23.960 --> 36:29.000
Well, the games you'll be able to get Warlords, Tempest, Missile Command, Centipede and Millipede,

36:29.000 --> 36:32.160
Battlezone and Asteroids slash Asteroids Deluxe.

36:32.160 --> 36:36.200
And yeah, they're going to have like the evolved mode is what they're calling it in the Atari

36:36.200 --> 36:37.200
games.

36:37.200 --> 36:39.880
Supposedly, you can play games like Warlords online, which I guess is kind of cool, but

36:39.880 --> 36:45.160
I think like most retro games, it will be thrilling for about 20 minutes, and then you'll

36:45.160 --> 36:47.680
be, why did I spend 400 points on this?

36:47.680 --> 36:50.920
Yeah, that's pretty much a lot of the games.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.140
Or if you're Loki, you'll say, are the achievements easy?

36:54.140 --> 36:57.760
Because I need to boost my score, because I'm a stats whore.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.960
Hey, that is true.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.000
So anyways, another thing with the 360, their last...

37:04.000 --> 37:07.920
Hey, would you say when it comes to gamer score that you're a total size queen?

37:07.920 --> 37:11.920
No, I would not use the word queen.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.000
A size king.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Whatever.

37:15.000 --> 37:22.680
Anyways, so for the 360, the last update that they did with 1080p blocked out some of the

37:22.680 --> 37:28.000
wonderful 1080p televisions out there, and there's also been other issues with it just

37:28.000 --> 37:30.480
not being very well, very good.

37:30.480 --> 37:35.720
So of course they are working on a fix right now on it, and it is being addressed, and

37:35.720 --> 37:39.000
hopefully it will be fixed relatively soon.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.340
So I don't know.

37:41.340 --> 37:45.980
Why do people release updates for their systems when they know that they're broken?

37:45.980 --> 37:50.160
Or you know, release games, like for example Call of Duty 3.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.080
Call of Duty 2, okay, perfect example.

37:52.080 --> 37:58.160
The game was released, multiplayer was lagged and bugged, and yeah, it wasn't working correctly.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.720
Call of Duty 3 comes out.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.480
The online is lagged, bugged, and doesn't work correctly.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.760
Didn't you learn from the first one?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.520
Fix the game before it comes out.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.600
Or did you just say, oh fuck, we need to get it out before Christmas.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.080
Oh, who cares if it's not finished.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.320
No one's gonna care, we'll just release a patch later on, they'll be angry, but they'll

38:15.320 --> 38:16.640
buy the next one.

38:16.640 --> 38:20.640
So you know, seriously, finish the game before you release it.

38:20.640 --> 38:23.560
Well at least the boss monster shows up in level 30, right?

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
Oh yeah.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.240
Well at least they didn't fuck that up.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.620
At least, you know.

38:29.620 --> 38:33.200
That's gonna be my forever question I'm always gonna ask when you tell me a game's broken.

38:33.200 --> 38:36.200
I'm gonna say, does the boss monster show up in level 30?

38:36.200 --> 38:39.120
Because if so, at least they didn't, you know, at least they didn't fuck up as bad as somebody

38:39.120 --> 38:41.600
else I can think of.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.600
That's just crazy.

38:42.600 --> 38:46.600
Hey, you know what, maybe they took a, you know, took a page from Rockstar and just didn't

38:46.600 --> 38:49.680
play the multiplayer mode and just released the game as is.

38:49.680 --> 38:53.600
Oh, do you know what the very first thing I did was when I played Gears of War?

38:53.600 --> 38:54.600
What?

38:54.600 --> 38:55.600
I downloaded a patch.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.800
Yeah, me too.

38:57.800 --> 39:01.240
Non-stop excitement from the moment I hit the power button.

39:01.240 --> 39:05.000
Gears of War is currently sitting on the desk in my living room.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.440
I don't know if it's been played yet.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.080
Gears of War is like a visual orgasm.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.760
It really is.

39:12.760 --> 39:16.000
But I'll have more to say on it next week, because the gameplay I'm starting to question

39:16.000 --> 39:17.560
a little bit, but we'll get to that next week.

39:17.560 --> 39:20.640
I don't play games for how pretty they are, I play them for how well they play.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.320
But, oh, you need to give this one a shot.

39:23.320 --> 39:26.560
I mean it really is, like when they say it's pretty, they fucking mean it.

39:26.560 --> 39:28.560
It's really pretty.

39:28.560 --> 39:29.960
Okay.

39:29.960 --> 39:36.720
Well, speaking of things that I guess some people might think are pretty, like, I don't

39:36.720 --> 39:40.720
know, we actually have one person who plays this game in the room right now.

39:40.720 --> 39:46.280
There's news for Second Life as Junami raises his hand.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.280
Sup?

39:47.280 --> 39:57.840
Well, at any rate, you'll be able to sit around with your virtual friends watching TV in Second

39:57.840 --> 39:58.840
Life.

39:58.840 --> 40:03.080
This is the kind of thing that I go into Second Life to get away from?

40:03.080 --> 40:10.520
Well, they're working with a company called Rivers Run Red that is going to be producing

40:10.520 --> 40:21.600
a TV channel for VirtualLife.tv, and you can install it in your virtual home and watch

40:21.600 --> 40:25.280
the sci-fi channel and other TV.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.280
What?

40:26.280 --> 40:28.160
I'm laughing because this is stupid!

40:28.160 --> 40:30.280
This is so stupid!

40:30.280 --> 40:33.080
I mean, what are you going to do?

40:33.080 --> 40:38.320
Hey, man, want to come over to my virtual pad and hang out?

40:38.320 --> 40:41.680
We'll watch Pimp My Ride.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.680
I mean...

40:42.680 --> 40:46.560
Why, do you think I was doing in the, and you can do this?

40:46.560 --> 40:52.780
I'm not blaming you, but this is, I mean, I get the technological, wow, that's kind

40:52.780 --> 40:58.020
of neat end of it, like, hey, I can watch TV online, but, okay, seriously, if you're

40:58.020 --> 41:03.760
meeting up with other people online to just sit down and watch TV, you can do that in

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
real life.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.280
Is that being twice as lazy?

41:06.280 --> 41:10.320
I mean, seriously, because if I'm sitting down playing a game where I'm watching TV

41:10.320 --> 41:14.640
in the game, is that, like, twice as, you know, twice as lazy?

41:14.640 --> 41:19.320
Speaking of which, you can actually do that also in Darkness, which is coming out, they're

41:19.320 --> 41:23.160
having streaming video and stuff in their TV shows, so you can actually stop in the

41:23.160 --> 41:27.600
game and watch TV, which I don't know why you would, but...

41:27.600 --> 41:30.600
Funny Dale in our chat wants to know, since when was Second Life a game?

41:30.600 --> 41:31.600
Seriously.

41:31.600 --> 41:37.120
Well, just to say so, that it is launching in November.

41:37.120 --> 41:43.080
What would really be insane would be if your Second Life avatar would log into his virtual

41:43.080 --> 41:46.020
computer and then play Second Life as an item.

41:46.020 --> 41:48.160
Do they have to pay for a virtual cable bill?

41:48.160 --> 41:50.160
Because that would just suck.

41:50.160 --> 41:54.960
I mean, just because you can do something in the game doesn't mean you should.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.840
Well, the virtual police come to my house and bust me because I have a black box installed

41:59.840 --> 42:01.720
on my Second Life TV.

42:01.720 --> 42:06.520
Now, here's the thing with Second Life, can you, like, you know, murder other avatars

42:06.520 --> 42:11.060
and stuff and get away with that, or can you, like, you know, abort your own baby or something?

42:11.060 --> 42:13.320
Can you do, like, pretty much anything you want in this game?

42:13.320 --> 42:18.560
Because that would be kind of cool.

42:18.560 --> 42:22.560
I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, and I'm really going to anger some fans

42:22.560 --> 42:24.800
of this game, I'm sorry, but take it in good stride, okay?

42:24.800 --> 42:27.920
I can see the posts on the Second Life forums now, alright?

42:27.920 --> 42:31.840
Attention, everyone, you should come over to my house tonight, because we're going to

42:31.840 --> 42:36.840
be watching on my 62-inch Blasma fake screen on Second Life, we're going to be watching

42:36.840 --> 42:39.400
Battlestar Galactica, see you at 7.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.840
Okay, 62-inch screen.

42:41.840 --> 42:45.360
You can go straight to hell, but Punchin' Pie, Punchin' Pie, okay.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.360
Fuck that.

42:46.360 --> 42:51.440
If this is a virtual game, I'm making a TV that's the size of, like, 60 miles, you know,

42:51.440 --> 42:57.120
wide, you know, 40 miles tall, and we'll just, you know, watch TV on that sucker.

42:57.120 --> 42:59.800
You'll be able to see that TV anywhere in this world.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.520
That's the way you got to do it, you know, if this is a fucking virtual world, then fucking

43:03.520 --> 43:06.720
the sky should be a TV, I mean, seriously.

43:06.720 --> 43:07.720
What's the point?

43:07.720 --> 43:10.480
I'm just going to make the walls of my house a giant television that plays pornography

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
for all the neighbors.

43:11.480 --> 43:12.480
There you go.

43:12.480 --> 43:19.040
Now you're thinking, that's the dumbest idea I have ever heard.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.040
So dumb.

43:20.040 --> 43:25.040
Well, I find it doubly dumb since I don't actually watch TV, so, you know, if I want

43:25.040 --> 43:28.040
to watch TV, I have the internet.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.800
Not for watching virtual TV, I download it and watch it at my convenience.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.800
Wait a second.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
Wait a second.

43:33.800 --> 43:39.200
Could in this game, could I, say, have my character watch TV of another character watching

43:39.200 --> 43:41.780
his TV of another character watching his TV?

43:41.780 --> 43:43.840
Like reality shows in Second Life?

43:43.840 --> 43:44.840
Yeah.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.440
Second Life Survivor?

43:46.440 --> 43:51.920
So we can watch somebody in Second Life on the Second Life TV watching their Second Life

43:51.920 --> 43:54.080
TV is the ultimate in boring.

43:54.080 --> 43:59.080
I am positive it can be done.

43:59.080 --> 44:03.320
All we have to do is find out how.

44:03.320 --> 44:07.000
Moving on to the topics before we get all the hate mail from the Second Life fans.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.120
Look, you know, I'll give you this.

44:12.120 --> 44:18.760
If the goal of Second Life is to, like, recreate life, then having the ability to just kind

44:18.760 --> 44:24.920
of go somewhere and hang out, watch TV, is a big step, is one small step for man.

44:24.920 --> 44:28.240
One giant leap for virtual man.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.360
Forget it.

44:30.360 --> 44:36.040
Wii component cables, hey, the Nintendo Wii's coming out and remember the component cables.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.080
There's this whole back and forth where Perry and Kaplan said, yes, you're going to be able

44:39.080 --> 44:43.360
to get the components cables in stores, but then the internet's like, but you lied to

44:43.360 --> 44:46.840
us before, lady, when you said that the thing would be region free.

44:46.840 --> 44:52.360
Well, this is what's up is that there's actually only going to be three retailers that you

44:52.360 --> 44:54.240
can get it at for now.

44:54.240 --> 44:56.480
Circuit City, GameStop, and Best Buy.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.120
And I'm assuming when they say GameStop, they mean EB Games as well.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.080
So those will be the places that you can get the component cables.

45:02.080 --> 45:06.760
So if you're getting your Wii somewhere else, like Toys R Us, I didn't see them on the list,

45:06.760 --> 45:11.080
you may have to go to one of the other retailers to get your component cables if you are a

45:11.080 --> 45:12.640
480p whore.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.640
Not surprised.

45:13.640 --> 45:14.640
And why?

45:14.640 --> 45:19.800
Because they're running in the shortages on everything for the Nintendo Wii.

45:19.800 --> 45:25.560
Accessories, Zelda, Excite Truck, they cannot produce them fast enough.

45:25.560 --> 45:29.960
And I'm wondering if they just spent all this time trying to produce the units and cut back

45:29.960 --> 45:35.360
on the accessories and other stuff because that's where, I mean, as far as my company,

45:35.360 --> 45:42.360
that's what we're running into, allocations on everything, accessories and games and you

45:42.360 --> 45:43.360
name it.

45:43.360 --> 45:49.200
So eliminating it down to three different stores, which I'm sure they paid a fat little

45:49.200 --> 45:56.520
bonus to Nintendo for that privilege, makes perfect sense to me.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.520
The chat room's still fixated on the Second Life thing and there's a good comment here

45:59.520 --> 46:00.520
so I want to read it.

46:00.520 --> 46:04.540
Footy Monster says, Second Life does open a way of people who cannot be physically together

46:04.540 --> 46:05.880
to actually hang out.

46:05.880 --> 46:07.040
I'll give you that.

46:07.040 --> 46:11.120
And that's kind of cool and World of Warcraft is very similar and a lot of these MMOs are

46:11.120 --> 46:15.760
very similar but, like, you're going to hang out and watch TV.

46:15.760 --> 46:16.760
That's what you're going to do.

46:16.760 --> 46:17.760
Let me put it this way.

46:17.760 --> 46:23.080
That'd be like, you know, the equivalent of, okay, I'm flying, okay, to the other side

46:23.080 --> 46:28.000
of the world to meet a pen pal or whatever and once I get there, what do I do?

46:28.000 --> 46:32.120
I've spent all this money, all this time, you know, building up for this moment.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.000
Hey man, you want to watch some TV?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Yeah, sure, let's watch.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.200
I mean, that's like a big, like, waste of time.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.200
What did you say, Tiara?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.200
What did you say?

46:40.200 --> 46:42.960
I said that just described my trip here.

46:42.960 --> 46:49.560
Look, if you're going to spend all that money to fly out and meet your pen pal, at least

46:49.560 --> 46:51.560
do some fucking because that's...

46:51.560 --> 46:55.080
Actually, actually, actually, actually, actually.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.200
Because you know that expectation is there somewhere.

46:58.200 --> 47:00.360
We did share a bad chance for Cisco.

47:00.360 --> 47:02.360
It was really, yeah.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.280
Well Chris and Megsy met...

47:05.280 --> 47:07.920
And what do you think they do when they meet up in real life?

47:07.920 --> 47:11.400
Do you think they read the Bible and, you know, pray together?

47:11.400 --> 47:13.120
No, they're doing some fucking.

47:13.120 --> 47:14.120
Here's the better one.

47:14.120 --> 47:20.080
When you have friends that come over and both are on the computer, like, you know, Rob,

47:20.080 --> 47:22.920
if you and Shane are over here, you'll be playing, you know, Phantasy Star Universe

47:22.920 --> 47:24.280
or something like that.

47:24.280 --> 47:29.200
Both of you playing Second Life and watching TV in Second Life together, you're in the

47:29.200 --> 47:35.540
same room, not communicating to each other, but you're still watching the TV in the game.

47:35.540 --> 47:36.700
That's awesome.

47:36.700 --> 47:39.320
My mind has just been blown.

47:39.320 --> 47:42.360
Anyways, back to actual, you know...

47:42.360 --> 47:47.320
So I just wanted to say, if you can't afford the whole plane ticket thing because you can't

47:47.320 --> 47:51.560
get out there and have sex with the person that you've been talking to online, the least

47:51.560 --> 47:57.240
you can do instead of watching TV in Second Life is do some cyber fucking, because that's

47:57.240 --> 47:59.120
as close as you can get.

47:59.120 --> 48:00.120
Damn straight.

48:00.120 --> 48:06.920
So anyways, on to actual real uses for your TV.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.480
Nintendo Virtual Console.

48:08.480 --> 48:14.200
It's definitely a big thing and right now it's speculated that you're not going to be

48:14.200 --> 48:17.320
able to have rumble in your Nintendo 64 games.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
Why?

48:18.320 --> 48:23.720
Because your Nintendo 64 games are going to be using the classic controller and there

48:23.720 --> 48:25.280
is no rumble for that.

48:25.280 --> 48:27.240
Now that's interesting.

48:27.240 --> 48:31.200
I mean, also when you think about the Nintendo 64, not all the controllers had rumbles.

48:31.200 --> 48:34.560
You had to basically buy the rumble pack for it.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.800
So I don't know if that's a huge thing.

48:35.800 --> 48:40.760
I guess like in games like Ocarina of Time where that was important because they rumble

48:40.760 --> 48:43.680
for hidden treasure and stuff.

48:43.680 --> 48:44.880
I don't know.

48:44.880 --> 48:49.700
But I remember reading somewhere that it's speculated that you're still going to have

48:49.700 --> 48:53.760
rumble in the games because apparently on the back of the classic controller you'll

48:53.760 --> 48:59.600
be able to snap the Wii remote to it and it will use the Wii remote to rumble.

48:59.600 --> 49:03.660
So I don't know if this is something that's coming later on or if, you know, right now

49:03.660 --> 49:09.440
of course nobody that has their Wii can check that out because, well, the online service

49:09.440 --> 49:15.360
for both the Virtual Console and anything else, the news, weather, etc. is not available

49:15.360 --> 49:16.920
so they can't try it yet.

49:16.920 --> 49:23.040
But I guess we'll find out on the 19th when all that launches and, I don't know, is that

49:23.040 --> 49:27.760
a deal breaker you think for the Nintendo 64 games and not having any rumble?

49:27.760 --> 49:30.520
I personally don't care.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.120
I don't think it's the end of the world.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.800
I seem to recall most games that make use of the rumble feature will also do the exclamation

49:35.800 --> 49:37.600
points or whatever the hell it is.

49:37.600 --> 49:40.880
So I don't think it's going to be a deal breaker.

49:40.880 --> 49:45.240
I think it just goes to show though that emulation will only go so far and if you want to play

49:45.240 --> 49:47.600
the real deal, go play the real deal.

49:47.600 --> 49:51.520
Dig out your Nintendo 64 out of the trash if you're Loki.

49:51.520 --> 49:55.120
And ask him what he did with his Nintendo 64.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.120
Ask him.

49:56.120 --> 49:59.120
I could have given it to somebody.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.120
Exactly.

50:00.120 --> 50:03.120
I could have, but I didn't.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.120
I'm allowed.

50:04.120 --> 50:07.200
You know why I threw it away too, because I'm just going to buy the games on the Virtual

50:07.200 --> 50:10.200
Console?

50:10.200 --> 50:16.900
Mario Kart cannot come out faster on the Wii.

50:16.900 --> 50:21.760
I still think nothing is as cool as playing it on the system it was made for, which is

50:21.760 --> 50:29.420
why I have 40-something video game systems taking up a whole room in my house, which

50:29.420 --> 50:30.420
is true.

50:30.420 --> 50:35.720
Well, of course, that's no secret to anybody because I'm a big nerd, but what is a secret

50:35.720 --> 50:40.600
is, well, actually, no, that's not a secret either because there are no more Wii secrets.

50:40.600 --> 50:46.260
If anyone thinks that Nintendo is holding something, no, Reggie says so himself.

50:46.260 --> 50:49.660
So saith Reggie, so be it.

50:49.660 --> 50:52.520
So my Wii isn't going to be able to secretly print money?

50:52.520 --> 50:53.520
No.

50:53.520 --> 50:56.360
Because I was really hoping to have this reaction on launch day.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.360
50-dollar bill!

50:57.360 --> 50:58.360
50-dollar bill!

50:58.360 --> 50:59.360
50-dollar bill!

50:59.360 --> 51:00.360
50-dollar bill!

51:00.360 --> 51:01.360
God!

51:01.360 --> 51:02.360
50-dollar bill!

51:02.360 --> 51:03.360
50-dollar bill!

51:03.360 --> 51:09.160
Because, you know, I heard the Wii was going to print money, so I was excited.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.160
Only for Nintendo.

51:10.160 --> 51:12.880
We have a story later on that might be true.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.080
What, that the Wii prints money?

51:15.080 --> 51:17.080
You might be able to make it print money.

51:17.080 --> 51:18.080
Awesome!

51:18.080 --> 51:24.160
And also, of course, there's the plan about the four million unit launch, which, what

51:24.160 --> 51:27.480
is, is that the biggest unit launch, do you think?

51:27.480 --> 51:28.800
The biggest launch?

51:28.800 --> 51:29.800
Yeah.

51:29.800 --> 51:31.480
I don't, I have no idea.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.880
That's pretty crazy.

51:33.880 --> 51:35.960
That's a big unit.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.760
That is.

51:37.760 --> 51:39.560
It's a powerful Wii.

51:39.560 --> 51:41.760
What a mighty, mighty Wii.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.560
Would you say it was a big unit?

51:43.560 --> 51:44.560
Dark Sakura?

51:44.560 --> 51:46.280
I'm not interested in the big unit.

51:46.280 --> 51:50.760
One of the biggest units you've ever seen?

51:50.760 --> 51:57.680
Let's see, speaking of big units that will cost you big money, GameStop is putting together

51:57.680 --> 52:00.440
this big bundle of Wii.

52:00.440 --> 52:06.240
It's a 700-dollar Wii mega bundle, and basically, this is the only way that you can get a Wii

52:06.240 --> 52:09.520
through their website early, because remember, this is the same shit they pulled with the

52:09.520 --> 52:13.720
Xbox 360, is that, you know, hey, you want to have the Xbox 360 right now?

52:13.720 --> 52:18.400
Okay, buy our 1,000-dollar bundle that has all these games with it.

52:18.400 --> 52:19.400
Sold out.

52:19.400 --> 52:20.400
Yeah, I know.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.400
I was getting to that.

52:21.400 --> 52:23.440
God damn it, stop ruining the punchline.

52:23.440 --> 52:29.560
So the Wii is 250, you get the SD card, which is 60 bucks, an additional Wiimote for 40,

52:29.560 --> 52:36.560
six games totaling $300, a 12-month product replacement plan, and, whoopty shit, a GameInformer

52:36.560 --> 52:37.560
gift subscription.

52:37.560 --> 52:42.080
So, you know, the talk online was, don't support this bullshit!

52:42.080 --> 52:45.120
This is extortion, in a way.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.120
Right?

52:46.120 --> 52:50.440
They know people want this system, so this is how they're doing it.

52:50.440 --> 52:55.080
So don't support it, and then the damn thing sells out in like five minutes.

52:55.080 --> 53:00.980
We were going to band together as gamers and teach these corporate dickheads a lesson that

53:00.980 --> 53:08.360
they can't make me buy Super Monkey Banana Ball Blitz whatever shit Wii game that I don't

53:08.360 --> 53:11.720
really want.

53:11.720 --> 53:12.720
That'll last.

53:12.720 --> 53:13.720
It sold out in an hour.

53:13.720 --> 53:17.000
You know, I almost bought Super Monkey Banana Blitz.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.160
Well, whatever.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.240
I'm sure there's lots of Super Monkey Ball fans out there.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.480
I'm just picking on your game for no particular reason.

53:22.480 --> 53:23.480
I'm in the mood tonight.

53:23.480 --> 53:27.960
You know the 1GB SD memory card for $59.99?

53:27.960 --> 53:33.200
You can get one for about 20 bucks at, I believe, Newegg or something like that.

53:33.200 --> 53:40.560
Definitely not $60 for a 1GB SD memory card, so that's a ripoff right there.

53:40.560 --> 53:48.560
In the 12 month Game Informer gift subscription, lame, trust me.

53:48.560 --> 53:51.800
That's $15 right there.

53:51.800 --> 53:55.480
Going to the chatroom and reading some comments, Raven's Dolphin says, well look at the PlayStation

53:55.480 --> 53:56.480
3 sky.

53:56.480 --> 53:57.480
Ooh, zing.

53:57.480 --> 54:01.720
Because of the whole fact that maybe I don't want a freaking Blu-ray player.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.240
But then again, that's kind of a necessary component, right, because the games are going

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
to be Blu-ray.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.240
Let's see.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.040
Jeremy Todd 1 says, but not everyone likes the same games as you, Rob.

54:12.040 --> 54:15.520
Maybe those people wanted all the games packaged in, and so they bought this bundle so they

54:15.520 --> 54:16.640
would save money.

54:16.640 --> 54:17.640
You know what?

54:17.640 --> 54:18.640
I beg to differ.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.160
They don't save any money.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.400
Look at the games you're getting.

54:21.400 --> 54:25.800
Twilight Princess, Trauma Center, Red Steel, Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Super Monkey Ball

54:25.800 --> 54:28.360
Banana Blitz, and Madden NFL 2007.

54:28.360 --> 54:32.000
You mean to tell me the same person that's going to buy Red Steel is going to buy Monkey

54:32.000 --> 54:37.660
Ball Banana Blitz and Madden 2007 is interested in all those games together?

54:37.660 --> 54:43.600
There's not one Poopy game in that list, depending on who you are?

54:43.600 --> 54:45.440
Madden is Poopy.

54:45.440 --> 54:48.600
Madden for the Wii is not exactly Poopy.

54:48.600 --> 54:52.760
Madden is not Poopy at all, if you like football games.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.820
But I'm saying that I don't think you like every single one of those genres.

54:56.820 --> 54:57.820
Maybe it's the opposite.

54:57.820 --> 55:00.920
Maybe you're a Madden fan, and that's the game you want, because throwing the football

55:00.920 --> 55:04.800
with a controller is kind of fucking cool, even for somebody who may not be into football

55:04.800 --> 55:05.800
games.

55:05.800 --> 55:06.800
But do I really want Monkey Ball?

55:06.800 --> 55:09.160
Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz is pretty awesome.

55:09.160 --> 55:14.040
They've got tons of cool mini-games, and apparently it's both for kids and people that are really

55:14.040 --> 55:15.720
hardcore into that game.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.360
I think we've overlooked, though, the main selling point.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.680
It's the Family Pack.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.680
No.

55:22.680 --> 55:25.880
Jeremy Todd 1 seems to agree with you.

55:25.880 --> 55:29.840
Well, the Wii is marketed towards the whole family, so the kids would like the child games

55:29.840 --> 55:32.560
and the older people would like the Red Steel Madden.

55:32.560 --> 55:33.560
I'll give you that.

55:33.560 --> 55:37.640
And then again, all six, and of course JV Mon says, I preordered Monkey Ball and Red

55:37.640 --> 55:38.640
Steel.

55:38.640 --> 55:39.640
Okay.

55:39.640 --> 55:40.640
But did you preorder Madden?

55:40.640 --> 55:41.640
Is that game interesting you too?

55:41.640 --> 55:44.960
Would you say all six of those games are something that interests you?

55:44.960 --> 55:47.520
Footy Monster says they are good games in general.

55:47.520 --> 55:48.520
No, I don't.

55:48.520 --> 55:49.840
I haven't played them yet.

55:49.840 --> 55:52.360
Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just a shitty port.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
That's all it is.

55:53.360 --> 55:57.240
So the game itself is good, but I mean, it's just a port.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.240
So whatever.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.800
Alright.

56:00.800 --> 56:08.480
Anyway, all this forced extortion of money and forcing me to buy Monkey Ball when I don't

56:08.480 --> 56:12.560
really want it, it ruffles my feathers and it makes me very angry.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.760
And as you can already tell, I'm in a bit of a mood tonight.

56:14.760 --> 56:15.760
I don't know why.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.000
There's no particular reason for it.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.520
I think Tiara brings some type of energy with her that makes me more, I don't know.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.960
I think it's gas from your lunch.

56:24.960 --> 56:26.040
Maybe.

56:26.040 --> 56:27.040
From that yummy pumpkin cheesecake.

56:27.040 --> 56:28.680
We went to the Cheesecake Factory today.

56:28.680 --> 56:29.680
Good stuff.

56:29.680 --> 56:32.920
Wait, you're going to put me in a good mood, and that's not the time to be in a good mood.

56:32.920 --> 56:33.920
Rob, they're out of cheesecake.

56:33.920 --> 56:34.920
People die.

56:34.920 --> 56:51.800
It's time, of course, for the FUs of the week, and I have one, and one that's the size of

56:51.800 --> 56:53.800
an entire city.

56:53.800 --> 57:00.320
FU to most of the drivers in San Francisco for being retarded, and the whole town for

57:00.320 --> 57:04.160
being laid out so funny and getting me lost.

57:04.160 --> 57:08.720
Even the power of the double horns did not make the people move out of my way, or almost

57:08.720 --> 57:14.040
run into me, or stop in the middle of the damn, not in the middle of the lane I was

57:14.040 --> 57:16.800
in, but between two lanes.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.800
Oh, God.

57:18.800 --> 57:24.800
Just when I think my road rage might have subsided a bit, I drive in San Francisco,

57:24.800 --> 57:30.800
and then it comes back, and then I want to kill.

57:30.800 --> 57:36.800
I imagine how I'm going to kill them in slow, painful ways, like using a cheese grater and

57:36.800 --> 57:37.800
lemon juice.

57:37.800 --> 57:38.800
I'm good.

57:38.800 --> 57:50.320
Okay, FU to game blog sites that posting pictures of the Wii in play, or posting, I don't know,

57:50.320 --> 57:55.480
stupid details like, it comes in a box, with cords, and stuff.

57:55.480 --> 57:56.480
That is not news.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.120
Please stop reporting it.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.120
I mean, my God.

57:59.120 --> 58:03.620
I know everyone's excited for this console launch, but I do not need to see stop motion

58:03.620 --> 58:06.560
of you pulling the damn console out of a box.

58:06.560 --> 58:11.400
You know what, though, I'm exempting Kotaku from this, FU, because the video of his kid

58:11.400 --> 58:16.320
playing the system was so fucking adorable, I went to go, oh, they're so cute, they're

58:16.320 --> 58:17.360
so cute.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.840
So I'm exempting Kotaku from this.

58:18.840 --> 58:23.120
At least that's a creative way of doing it, but it, I mean, we had news stories about

58:23.120 --> 58:24.840
how the Wii can be used as a whiteboard.

58:24.840 --> 58:26.640
I mean, come on.

58:26.640 --> 58:32.560
Just because it's shiny, you can put dry erase pens on it, big deal, but it's not news.

58:32.560 --> 58:33.560
Pooeater agrees with you.

58:33.560 --> 58:35.120
I don't give a shit about you playing the Wii.

58:35.120 --> 58:37.120
I care about me playing the Wii.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.120
Exactly.

58:38.120 --> 58:39.120
Alright.

58:39.120 --> 58:48.800
My FU of the week goes to Baskin-Robbins, because the way they scoop their ice cream,

58:48.800 --> 58:53.380
like all the ice cream comes up at the top, and none of it ever falls into the cone.

58:53.380 --> 58:56.080
So it's like, you know, by the time I eat my ice cream, because they eat my ice cream

58:56.080 --> 59:00.760
fast, there's no ice cream left in the cone, so it's like I have this empty cone with nothing

59:00.760 --> 59:02.480
to do with, and it's kind of sad.

59:02.480 --> 59:05.280
That was seriously the best thing I could come up with tonight.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.480
Eat the cone.

59:06.480 --> 59:10.360
I'm not that angry all these, okay, no, then I'll give them this.

59:10.360 --> 59:14.580
FU to the fact that, still with Baskin-Robbins, when you rip off the paper, sometimes like

59:14.580 --> 59:18.240
some of the paper gets stuck to the cone, and it's like, I have to eat paper?

59:18.240 --> 59:20.240
You need to eat the glue.

59:20.240 --> 59:21.240
Ew.

59:21.240 --> 59:22.240
Ew.

59:22.240 --> 59:23.240
FU to paper cone things.

59:23.240 --> 59:24.240
T-R-R-R-R-R-R-R.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.240
Do you have a FU?

59:25.240 --> 59:32.240
I would just like to say FU to Marvel for taking so freaking long to finish Ultimate

59:32.240 --> 59:33.240
Wars Volume 2.

59:33.240 --> 59:38.160
The last issue came out last month, and the next issue that will wrap it up, which only

59:38.160 --> 59:42.360
needed probably about five pages to finish the entire series, will come out December

59:42.360 --> 59:43.360
20th.

59:43.360 --> 59:45.360
So that kind of sucks.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.360
Hi.

59:46.360 --> 59:47.360
Drew Nami.

59:47.360 --> 59:51.360
All right, first of all, shared FU for everyone.

59:51.360 --> 59:54.980
FU to MySpace, your site design sucks ass.

59:54.980 --> 59:58.000
Your members don't know web design were shit.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.400
Give them a quiz before they're allowed to make a profile, please.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.160
And FU to people who verb nouns.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.440
Verbing nouns suck.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.800
Stop verbing nouns.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:17.960
And on that note, let's move on to our next story because, oh, our next story is Join

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.540
Our MySpace.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.660
We have a MySpace profile over at www.myspace.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:25.660
Hear clips from the show.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.380
Add us to your friends list.

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:37.420
Comment on our profile with cute little YouTube videos because that's what people do on MySpace.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.920
Let's talk about upcoming release dates.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:44.480
Hey, Loki, I heard Full Auto 2 on the PSPs coming out.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.200
I was really surprised to hear that because I had no idea it was in development.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200
That was a real surprise.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.680
Yeah, that's a complete shocker to me.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.960
I'm glad someone came out and said that because if not, I would have had to have said it on

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.600
every single show for a long time now.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.000
Well, thank God 1UP reported on it because now it's true because nothing is true until

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
1UP reports on it.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.600
It's not necessarily just 1UP.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.220
Everybody reported on it because they finally put out a press release about it.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:16.080
But my God, how many fucking weeks do I need to tell you guys something's coming out and

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.180
no one picks up on the story until, oh, look, hey, guess what?

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:23.480
Some other website posted about this, so now it's true.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.040
Well, poopy on you.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040
You know what?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.120
This is a show special, so the people who listen to this show, you're like a special

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
club.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
You get to know this first.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120
Fine.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:38.160
Anyways, so some other special stuff you get to know first, Full Auto 2 Battle Lines for

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160
the PS3.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.040
If you're waiting for that as a launch title, guess what?

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.400
It's not coming out at launch.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:50.160
It'll be coming out December 13th instead, so ha, that's karma for you, Sega.

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.120
Also along the same lines, Blazing Angels for the PlayStation 3, also not coming out

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.760
until December 13th.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760
Not a big surprise.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:04.040
Rainbow Six Vegas, also another game being delayed until January 31st for the PlayStation

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.720
3, so that's very interesting.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:13.680
Now for the 360, you've seen the Xbox Live Arcade Unplugged Volume 1 pack come out back

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680
in September.

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:20.400
Well, now they're starting to do a brand new thing, kind of like the old PlayStation 2

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.320
demo discs that they released, their jam-packed discs.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.320
Well now they have this brand new thing called Xbox 360 Exhibition.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:36.160
It's going to be $5.99 retail and it'll feature six demos, including Madden NFL 07, Dead Rising,

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:42.960
F.E.A.R., Fusion Frenzy 2, Lego Star Wars 2, and also six HD videos, including Halo

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:48.280
3, Splinter Cell Double Agent, Gears of War, Rainbow Six Vegas, etc.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:53.280
And this is meant for someone, of course, that does not have Xbox Live, so they wouldn't

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.120
have access to this, or they just didn't want to buy the Xbox official magazine.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.400
Or you just really want to pay for demos.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400
Apparently.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.440
So it is out there, it's coming out on the 22nd, the one year anniversary.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:10.200
I have $6 to spend and I just don't know what to do with it.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.680
Not really interested in a combo meal from a local fast food restaurant.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:20.560
I can tell you what you would spend this money on, and it's goddamn not a 360 Exhibition,

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.560
Sneak King.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.200
Sneak King is what you can spend your money on Sneak King and hell, you have enough money

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.240
for some fries and a Coke, there you go.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240
So...

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.240
No, you're wrong.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.960
Wrong, because you have to get a combo meal to get the game, so you actually need more

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:32.960
than $6.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:33.960
Whatever.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:37.800
You just got served, you got BK served.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.440
You're still hungry, you would spend the money on lunch anyways, it's just, you know, whatever.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.040
Now you get Sneak King.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:48.200
No, this is what I'll do, I'll get Drew, I'll say, Drew, don't you want to go out to eat

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.160
and make him buy the meal, and then I'll buy the game.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.440
Money saved.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.200
Don't you want some chicken fries?

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.800
Don't you want some chicken fries?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.520
Yeah, I do.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:06.480
Anyways, so, you know, getting back into the swing of things here, now, this week actually

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.000
for games is probably the largest week of the entire year, and that said, there's not

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.400
a lot of good stuff coming out actually, which is really sad, but for the 360 though, there

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.840
are some pretty interesting things, Dead or Alive Extreme 2 is finally making its way

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:28.840
out into the market, so if you're looking for a lot of TNA, well, you won't have to

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.480
wait much longer.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.200
Also Rainbow Six Vegas for the 360.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:38.640
That's the way to get some chicken fries and some TNA.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:46.000
Aragon is coming out on PlayStation 2, Xbox, the 360, and then the portable systems.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.560
Pimp My Ride on PlayStation 2, actually, no, I forgot that one got delayed a week.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.040
But anyways, what were you going to say there, Rob?

01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:02.640
Something really sarcastic about Pimp My Ride the game, but I really need to shut up tonight,

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.760
because we're going to get angry emails, you know, Rob talks too much on the program.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:14.280
I downloaded this podcast having no idea that Rob would talk so much, I mean, his fucking

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:17.960
picture is on the little album art, but I never knew he would talk so much.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960
More lesbians!

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960
More lesbians!

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:25.520
Okay, let's see, lots of PlayStation 3 games, of course, all the launch stuff, Mobile Suit,

all coming out this week, pass.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.860
Well how about a little bit different release news?

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.400
Did you play the demo, I mean it was poopy, I mean it was very poopy, Sonic the Hedgehog

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
360?

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400
Yes.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400
Yeah it was poop.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
I talked about that last week.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
I know you did.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:21.120
Were that all for our US release dates?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.120
I'm done, no.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120
Uh huh.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120
Was that all for our US release dates?

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:29.120
Yeah, there's too much for me to list, I mean honestly, Polarium Advanced, I mean if you

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.040
really want to buy that.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:35.000
Well, we've got a few releases coming up for the UK.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:43.080
14th November, we have EverQuest 2 Echoes of Thadewire for PC, 17th a good number, Asterix

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:50.720

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.520
fun.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:20.200
Others just a little bit of other stuff to look forward to within the month is Rule of

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:26.040
Rose, Neo Geo Battle Colosseum, Guitar Hero 2 on the 24th.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:31.960
Instead of have fun, wouldn't that be, have a jolly old time, have a jolly old time, I'm

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.240
just kidding.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.160
The chat room's asking who fed me sugar before the show, Jamie actually, she brought me a

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160
cookie.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160
I brought cookies.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:44.200
It was like a coffee cookie, so it was sugar and caffeine and apparently it was laced with

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.200
crack.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.200
Apparently.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.200
Yeah.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.720
That's right, I had Tiara's Latte Cheesecake too.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:51.720
It all comes together.

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.920
Hey Japan, how about some release dates?

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.880
You guys have the PS3 now, so you're getting some games this week, including Majang Kakuto

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.200
Club which comes out November 16th, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 07 on November 17th, and Need

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.680
for Speed Carbon on November 20th.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.120
You've got to wait until December 2nd for the Wii though, sorry kids.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.880
You do get a lot of PlayStation 2 releases coming out this week.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.920
You get Rhapsodia, which is going into the Konami The Best series, it's actually getting

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.200
a little bit of a price cut, and let's see, White Princess II is coming out on the 16th

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200
as well.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.100
That also appears to be going into a collection.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:33.160
This game is also going into a collection, and this might be my import title of the week.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.480
It's Kashi Mashi Girl Meets Girl.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:37.440
Hey, I want that one.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.640
I'll bet it does.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.680
Girl Meets Girl, and much Kashi Mashi ensues.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:51.600
Let's see, we also have on the Nintendo DS Puzzle Series Volumes 5, 6, and 7 from Hudson,

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.400
Magic Taizen and Akumajo Dracula, that's just a bundle there, Gallery of Labyrinth comes

01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.400
out.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.100
Oh, that's the Portrait of Ruin title, that's what they're calling it over in Japan.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.520
That's not a bundle, sorry kids, that's just that game.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.840
If you're a PSP player, Metal Gear Acid 2 is going into the best this week on the 16th.

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:14.280
You get a Sudoku game from Hudson on the 16th, and Gunpei, oh wait, that's the 20th, sorry,

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.240
you've got to wait a little while longer for that one.

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.080
And that's all I've got for you.

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.080
Excellent.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:26.760
Well, with the Wii coming out here pretty soon, and of course Virtual Console also launching

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:32.760
relatively soon, there's lots of titles coming out, and more of course being leaked by the

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:42.720
ESRB, including some gun games, Duck Hunt, Hogan's Alley, Kid Icarus, Kirby's Adventure,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.080
Pilot Wings, Pro Wrestling, Punch Out, and Wild Gunman.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.880
In other words, seriously, the games I really want.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.520
I mean, that's what this pack is right here.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:55.520
The games I really want.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:56.520
It's the Rob pack.

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.520
As opposed to the first pack, which was like games I kind of will buy if I have extra money.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:04.040
These are the games that are like Kid Icarus, Hogan's Alley, they used to have that game

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.720
at, what was that place called, that Burger Joint, Flaky Jake's, remember that place?

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.480
That's what FUD Records used to be years ago.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.400
They had a freaking, yeah, somebody who's lived here a long time knows what I'm talking

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.400
about.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:17.000
They had a Hogan's Alley machine back in the day, and Wild Gunman is like the most simple

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.200
game ever made.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.440
Have you ever played Wild Gunman?

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.440
No.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.660
That's the concept of Wild Gunman.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:27.000
The person goes, draw, and you fire the zapper gun as fast as you can.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
That's all it is.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's basically, they could re-release this game as push the button fast, and that's exactly

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
what it is.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.200
It was in Back to the Future, Loki, if you remember Back to the Future.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.660
Yeah, I remember that.

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.840
That's the game that was there.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.360
Was it also in the Karate Kid?

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.000
No, I might be on crack.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.400
No, that was skeet shooting.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400
Never mind.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400
I'm on crack.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.040
Well, it's kind of stupid, though, that they have Dunk Hunt coming out anyways, because

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.200
I mean, was it that Wii Play game was pretty much Duck Hunt anyways?

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:02.680
Of course, we're not getting Wii Play, because we're the United States, and the fucking UK

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.680
gets it.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680
Bastards.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:09.240
It would be nice if they would rename Hogan's Alley Hogan Knows Best's Alley, because then

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.800
I could zap Brooke, and that would bring me endless days of excitement.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.920
Hogan's Heroes Alley.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.780
Hogan!

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.680
The Hogan Family Alley.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.400
I just killed Sandy Duncan.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.260
And if you caught that reference, you totally are an 80s child.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.680
Even Matt's laughing at that one.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.680
Wow.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680
I don't even know why.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.880
I don't even know what you're talking about.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.800
Don't you remember The Hogan Family?

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800
Never mind, forget it.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.800
No.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.000
I remember The Hogan Family.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Thank you.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.080
You know what else I remember?

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.380
What?

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:45.840
When this show was good?

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:46.840
Yeah.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.840
I remember when we were in episode 2.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840
Was it Mike?

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840
Yeah?

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:52.840
Yeah.

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840
I asked off mic.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.840
Oh.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.840
Yep.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.840
Yes, it's your turn to read a story, Jamie.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.680
Tell us a story!

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.440
Tell us a story, Jamie.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.440
Okay.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.800
In other news, the ferret is on fire.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.800
Good.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.800
Whatever.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.960
Yeah, guess what?

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.720
Namco has registered new Katamari Damacy trademarks, so we can get more ball rolling

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.720
in.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:24.400
We have beautiful Katamari Damacy, Katamari Damacy Trybian, and there was an application

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:28.840
filed for Katamari Damacy-kun.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:29.840
Ball rolling.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.520
And to think I skipped the PSP version of Katamari.

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:38.360
Hey, we talked about man cannons the other week.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.080
Can you roll a Katamari into a man cannon?

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.080
What would happen?

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080
That would be a...

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.960
A big black cock.

01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:45.960
Wow.

01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:52.560
That reference is about 150 episodes old, and people aren't going to get it, and they're

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.240
going to go, what the fuck is wrong with Jamie?

01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:58.280
29, look it up.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.680
Oh, Drunami knows what episode number.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680
You are sad.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680
You're adored.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680
You are sad.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.680
It was my first time in the studio.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680
29.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680
29, he says.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.680
All right.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.680
Anyway, sorry.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.080
Oh, my turn.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.280
Xbox Live is getting another new game very soon, and this is one I know that's near and

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:22.560
dear to at least one person's heart in this room, Worms.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560
You remember Worms?

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560
Yeah.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.440
Worms HD is coming.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.600
Right now, plans for announcements are being discussed with Microsoft right now.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.400
The game is in final certification stages, so maybe we'll get this by the end of the

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
year.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.400
That would be rad.

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.400
Hopefully.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.400
But I don't know.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.080
Rumor is that the release calendar is full for the year, so this might have to wait until

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.080
next year.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.080
Oh!

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.080
Here's my thought.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.080
Are we getting another UNO pack?

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080
God, that's...

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.400
You know, if another game gets delayed, I really can't fucking wait for the Viva Pinata

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400
UNO pack.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400
I just...

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:57.480
God, I'm on pins and fucking needles waiting for that.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.920
I have 100 points saved just so I can buy the Viva Pinata UNO pack.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.920
I hope one of these games...

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:03.920
No!

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.720
Of course I'm lying!

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.440
This game could be put in when some other game gets delayed if it's ready to go.

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:12.080
You know one of those other games is going to get delayed because they're going to go,

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.240
gee, when we do the upscrolling level, it looks completely different on two different

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240
screens.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.920
Anyway, Worms is the game, of course.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:21.280
It's like scorched earth!

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.040
It's scorched earth in wormy form.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:28.560
And you know, you fire bombs and blast them and you know, all that stuff.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560
Banana bombs.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560
Holy hand grenades!

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
Yes!

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560
Super sheep!

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:38.220
I've actually been quoting lines from Monty Python all weekend, and I was quoting the

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:40.720
holy hand grenade thing at the Metreon.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:46.680
Oh lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that it might blow thine enemies to tiny bits,

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680
in thy mercy.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.280
Oh, at the wax museum, that's right.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.160
Something completely different, you say?

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.600
How about Linux on the Wii?

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.280
I was going to say Wii on Linux.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.280
That'd be a little weird.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:06.000
No, but anyways, yes, Wii and Linux.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.920
WEE-lee, you say, yes, that's actually what it's called, WEE-lee, and it's being done.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.080
I see what you did there.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:23.160
Yeah, okay, anyways, so it's actually being worked on, and supposedly they're going to

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.560
start beta testing this thing as soon as the Wii comes out, because it's based on the GameCube

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.480
Linux as well.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.320
Some things that they're aiming to be able to do with this, surfing the internet using,

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.040
you know, the control, of course, as a mouse pointer, even though you can do that anyways.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:45.960
Wii media extender, to stream movies and music and stuff from your PC to the Wii and to your

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960
TV.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.360
They said, basically, think Apple ITV for free.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:56.560
Write document with a regular USB keyboard and print with any USB printer.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:04.160
So you could print money, huh, huh, see?

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.840
Email and chat with your friends.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:18.880
50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, 50 dollar bill, guys, 50 dollar bill, sorry I was late.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:25.740
Play classic games using the MAME console emulator, that'd be an irony right there.

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:33.220
Develop your own programs and games, control WEE-lee from your PC using a Wi-Fi connection,

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:41.600
and use WEE-lee and the Wii as a network attached storage by connecting it to an external USB

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.240
hard drive.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.280
And pretty much anything else you can do on a PC.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.200
So I don't know, that's pretty cool.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.320
I've signed up to, hopefully, beta test this, so probably more of the come as the Wii gets

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
launched.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320
Oh, WEE-lee.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.320
WEE-lee.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.240
I'm waiting for the picture of the owl.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.760
And now that I've said, oh, is there, oh, there it is.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.160
Oh, no, that's the Linux penguin, that's not an owl.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.280
But it's dressed up like Mario.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.280
I know, that's cute.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.600
No, I'm waiting for the, you know, the famous owl that says, oh, really, I'm waiting for

01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600
the, oh, WEE-lee one.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600
Oh.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:13.600
All right.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.640
Anyway, sorry to encourage that behavior on the internet.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.880
Oh, come on, you know you like to encourage mass hysteria.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:27.300
Speaking of mass hysteria, this won't really encourage any of it, but it's kind of cool.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:32.200
For those five people still playing Animal Crossing DS, which I need to actually clean

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:36.560
out my village and start doing that because this is pretty cool, with the launch of Twilight

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.860
Princess on 19th November, Nintendo will be giving away a very special and rare gift in

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:49.020
Animal Crossing according to their press release.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:55.160
If you connect via Nintendo Wi-Fi during the week of November 17th through 24th, you'll

01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.200
receive a letter from Nintendo, which will show up in your mailbox, and you will receive

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.320
an attached item.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:07.440
So it could be anything.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.320
Accompanied with the letter will be a corrupt item that will erase your save and say, go

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.640
buy a Wii, stop playing the DS.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.560
No, it'll be a flower that you put in your house and then you can't put anything in that

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560
corner of your house.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.160
Oh, wait, they already did that.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:26.560
I actually went to NintendoWifi.com just to prove Jamie wrong because I like to do that,

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:31.360
and it shows 20 random Wi-Fi players, and look at that, six people are playing Animal

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.900
Crossing Wild World right now.

01:19:33.900 --> 01:19:40.480
We have Danny Boy is playing, and Phil is playing, and IJ, and Mike, and Christina with

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:45.760
a lowercase c because she's poetic, and look at this, Rob is playing Animal Crossing right

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760
now.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.400
Hey, Rob, this is just for you.

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:59.200
There may only be six people in the world playing Animal Crossing Wild World right this

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:04.320
moment, but 1.5 million people are playing Final Fantasy XII.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.680
At least that's what Square Enix will have you believe because they sent out a press

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.960
release earlier this week saying that Final Fantasy XII has 1.5 million units on shelves.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:17.240
Okay, well, I guess 1.5 million people aren't really playing it, but yet there's that many

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:20.880
copies in circulation, so soon 1.5 million people will be playing it.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.720
Final Fantasy XII, by the way, for the records, did 2.4 million copies in Japan, so it will

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.720
be interesting to see.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:30.880
Wouldn't it be interesting if it sold more here than it did in Japan?

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:34.760
Well, we all know Dragon Quest is the bigger game in Japan, so I don't know.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.880
By the way, Final Fantasy XII, brand new record for the total number of units shipped for

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.880
the franchise.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:41.680
Good job, Squeenix.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.020
Good job.

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.360
Some other interesting stuff.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.760
Now next time make the graphics less pixelated, thank you.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:54.800
Some interesting stuff for fans of Guitar Hero.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.080
Guitar Hero 2, of course, you may remember with the demo, it actually blocked the Ant

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.120
Commandos controllers from working with it, and apparently that's the case also if you

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:12.860
have purchased your Guitar Hero controller from them before October 1st.

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.840
If you have, then it will not work with Guitar Hero 2 unless you purchase an adapter, which

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.560
I believe is free, but don't hold me to that.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.120
Once you get the adapter, I guess everything's...

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:33.520
Oh, I'm sorry, the adapter is $6.99, so yeah, if you want to play with that controller,

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.120
you're going to have to pay another $7.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:42.100
But the other controllers beyond that will work with Guitar Hero 2.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:47.720
Apparently anything that did circumvent third-party controllers has been broken already.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.380
We kind of knew that would be coming, though.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.640
I mean, that's the Ant Commandos business right there, so they had to get around it

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640
somehow, right?

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640
Yeah.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:57.840
Drew, you've been playing Guitar Hero 2 quite a bit, right?

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.860
I see you posting about it.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.120
Are you interested at all in these third-party controllers or any of that?

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:06.840
Not really, I just don't really see any interest in them.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:13.840
I've got my SG controller from the first game, and I don't really need another one.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.720
If I feel like I'm kind of over Guitar Hero, like seriously, the hype around Guitar Hero

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.680
has seriously ruined Guitar Hero for me for some weird reason?

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680
I don't know.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:26.040
Like, you know how when you were the only person that listened to this band, and then

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.960
suddenly everybody's listening to the band, and you're like, it's just not so special

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960
anymore?

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.280
Yeah, that's kind of how I feel about Guitar Hero.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:38.320
I mean, call me an elitist, whatever, but am I doing myself a disservice by not checking

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.880
out Guitar Hero 2?

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880
Yes.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:43.720
Yes, absolutely yes, yes, very yes.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.720
Oh!

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:45.720
Oh!

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:46.720
Tiara says no.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.720
Why is that?

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:53.240
Because if you spent all the time that you spend playing Guitar Hero and Guitar Hero

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.200
2 learning to play an actual guitar, think of all the amazing songs you could play.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.840
Wait, weren't you telling me a story earlier today about somebody that was in a guitar

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.840
class?

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.440
Tell me the story about the girl in the guitar class.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:09.680
Okay, this involves my boyfriend, Adam.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.480
He's taking a guitar class at the community college, and there's a girl in his class

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:19.880
who was asking him, you know, do you believe in psychics, and explaining something about

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.560
this one particular psychic.

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:27.760
Anyways, Adam told her, the only psychic I believe in is Professor Charles Xavier.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:31.640
And so her response was, does he teach at this campus?

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:37.680
That doesn't have anything to do with Guitar Hero.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:43.440
Wait, but you were telling me, okay, yeah, okay, haha, she's stupid.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:47.920
But the other part about this was, wait, what was this, she asked him if he knew Boston,

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.920
or what was this?

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:54.480
Oh yeah, apparently all she plays is Guitar Hero because she asked him if he had ever

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.480
heard of a band called Boston.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.480
And the song that she mentioned was the song on the original Guitar Hero.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:07.800
And every time that she says that she likes a band, and he asks what songs that she likes

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.760
from that band, it's the song that's on Guitar Heroes, and she doesn't know any

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.400
of the other songs.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.240
Hey, you know what, I give her credit though for at least taking Tiara's advice and going

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.800
to take a real guitar class instead of playing Guitar Hero 2.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:27.160
No, I'm sure it's a great game, I just, there's other games I wanted more.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160
I'll get it now.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.760
I'll get the 360 version.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.880
I swear to you I will buy the 360 one, like launch day.

01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:33.880
What?

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:34.880
Rob.

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.880
Rob.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:36.880
What?

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.880
Rob.

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880
I will shove this mic up your butt.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:39.880
Rob!

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.880
What?

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:41.880
You can come to my house and play.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880
I just might.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880
Okay.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:44.880
I heard on a Bobby show tonight that it supports Progressive Scan, that's kinda cool.

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:45.880
It looks really nice on my TV.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:46.880
Rob, that's special.

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:47.880
What?

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:53.560
I'll get a copy for you, and I'll put it on my Playstation 2, and you can play on

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.560
that.

01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:55.560
Okay, sounds good.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:56.560
No, I'll get the 360 version.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:57.560
That's what I said earlier.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:01.440
I don't see the point in getting the Playstation 2 one when we know the 360 one will be better

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:04.080
because of its expandability.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.000
So I can wait.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.920
Can you?

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.960
I sold mine, so yes.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.200
Alright, on that note, we're going to go to a little bit of a break because obviously

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.480
I need a sedative, so I'm gonna go take some Tylenol PM during this break, and we'll

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.320
be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a little bit of a break.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:33.040
Thank you, everybody, for being with us, and we'll see you in the next one.
