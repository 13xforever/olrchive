Tonight, December 24th, 2006, some new channels make their debut on the Wii, a California lawmaker targets spyware in games, and is Katamari about to roll over Xbox Live Arcade?
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
We are that podcast dedicated to video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle.
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Yo.
How you doing, Miss Thing?
Hackin'.
Yeah, a little sick today?
A little of that and trying to play with my IP on my computer so I can fool the BBC.
I see.
Did Santa bring you the flu, the plague?
The plague has returned, but not nearly as bad.
I'm prepared for it this time around.
That's good to hear.
Say hello as well to the always prepared Techmaster, Loki!
Hello.
How you doing, Loki?
I was doing okay.
You were doing okay?
What happened?
I'll mention it later.
It's just...
It's more of the same crap, you know, where people are reporting exclusive stories that I have reported weeks ago type thing.
Now, I told you, go post this in the forum in your little thread there.
I did.
I did do that stuff.
No, no, no.
I'm saying post the person who's saying that they have the exclusive story.
Post that there and, you know, the listeners can see for themselves there.
Orange Lounge Radio is one of the best kept secrets on the internet.
Anyway.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Ah, that's... You know, as much crap as I give mobile phone games on this program, I actually really enjoyed the Luminous one.
It wasn't bad for mobile.
I'm not going to reinstall Super Pac-Man.
It's just not worth it.
It's too damn hard to play.
It's not the same.
Well, it's not really... It's a good emulation of it, but it's just difficult with a... You need one of the bigger phones to do it, and I have a very small phone.
You know what cell phone game I have on my phone?
What?
Burger Time.
You're crazy.
I'm thinking about downloading Tetris.
I don't know if it'll work.
The one I have on mine, I know we have different carriers.
Is it the Jamdat Tetris?
I think so.
It's very blue.
It's not bad.
I'd like to mention, just real quick.
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I don't care, but Dan's been wanting an indie for a while, and that's pretty cool.
When are you going to get PinBot?
I want one.
Actually, we want JackBot.
I don't, you know, your fancy schmancy bootlegs or whatever.
It's not a bootleg.
JackBot is the modern pinball version.
Whatever, whatever.
It's got the same tracks as PinBot and has the bonus segment from Bride of PinBot.
All right, whatever.
So it's really cool.
However, we do have friends who have a pinbot, so I can just go over there and play it anytime I want.
But does it do the thing where it goes, I am pinbot?
Yes.
Okay, good.
It is a fully functional pinbot, and that game is fucking hard.
On the NES, it was pretty hard, too.
Because on the NES, it had little aliens that would try to eat your ball.
But the actual pinball machine is just difficult.
I see.
But I have a special place in my heart for pinbot.
All right.
Anything else you played this week?
Besides playing with fire?
I did play with fire because I lit candles on the winter solstice.
They need to make fire the game.
Well, there's putting out fire the game, the brave firefighters.
Okay, alright.
That's a year-end award I'd like to see.
Best use of fire in a game.
I did... Well, there's also Burning Rangers back in the day.
I played another game, though.
What's that?
I did play that Marine Harpoon Sega game because I was at Walmart and I was bored.
So I played...
I played the harpoon game.
And how was that?
Sucks.
Alright.
It's been the first time you play it and that's like, this screen has burned in.
Fix.
Loki, how was your gaming week?
How was my gaming week?
Okay.
I played a lot of crappy games, unfortunately.
I played Cars on the Wii and it sucked ass.
I bought it for Nelly.
You know, she said she could try it and then she agreed it did suck ass.
Um.
Then I kind of went back on what I said about Ubisoft And I went and bought another Ubisoft game And this only further, you know, proves that their games suck Because I went and bought Monster 4x4 World Circuit Despite the reviews, you know, I said Oh, they're just probably complaining because the graphics look like GameCube graphics And it's not like we've been able to trust any major gaming press review recently anyway Exactly, so, you know
I thought, hey, you know, what the hell, it sounds like it could be like Excite Truck, it's four players, that could be fun.
No, it's not.
What the hell is this piece of shit that you gave me?
Because this is obviously not a real game.
I've done that with a game before.
But what game?
It was the WWF, at the time, Thunder game on PlayStation.
It was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster and had them trade it out.
Seriously, I would urge anyone not to even consider this as an alternative to Excite Truck.
This is not even close.
Well, most people don't like Excite Truck either, so they're just like, you know what?
No racing on the Wii for me.
Are you going to pick up Need for Speed Carbon?
Give it one more shot.
No, I'm not picking up Need for Speed Carbon.
If you're just being carbon, I know what kind of a game it is, and so I know it would be pretty decent.
It's just not the same type of a game as Excite Truck, but Monster Farmer 4 World Circuit, it's slow, doing the tricks is hard.
But it comes with the LEET steering wheel peripheral.
Oh yeah, the LEET steering wheel peripheral, that's a piece of shit.
I brought it into the studio today, okay?
I brought it to have Christopher try it out so he can give a review on the next show, but it is awful.
It is a really bad game, and I...
I'm sorry, but they just... So they had six or seven launch games.
Yeah, but they all sucked, Ubisoft.
You're just trying to capitalize on the lack of titles, you know, being out there and hoping people will get to buy this stuff.
And you know what?
I'm sure a lot of people bought this stuff, and I don't know, maybe their kids liked it and stuff, but it's just, it's an awful game.
And once you play, you know, like Excite Truck or something like that, or Need for Speed Carbon, you're just like, wow, what the hell is this shit?
So, I urge you, do not buy this game, because you'll only be disappointed.
Do you think Ubisoft might be able to redeem themselves with some of the later games that are coming out in 2007?
With, you know, 360, they have some pretty big titles planned, right?
Well, 360, they've got Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, which looks okay, but it looks exactly the same as Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 1.
So, you know, Warfighter 2, great.
I mean, seriously, I...
I challenge you to look at the screenshots and be able to tell the two games apart.
You can't.
They look exactly the same.
So, I don't know.
I mean, but then again, people like stuff that's the same.
So, it should be fine.
And Rainbow Six Vegas, I heard, was pretty good.
It's just not my type of game.
But, I've seen some of the stuff that they're coming out for the Wii, for, you know, say in, um,
It's not anything new, let me put it that way.
It's just ports of old shit that they're tacking the controls on, and they really need to come out and create some new games, and I'm not talking about Red Steel 2.
I'm talking about a brand new game.
Does Reggie need to come lay the smack down?
I think so.
I think they're just looking at numbers, you know, and Red Steel sold really well.
It's just, it wasn't that good of a game.
You know, people were looking for another GoldenEye, and it was not GoldenEye.
Alright, was that it?
MyGamingWeek Nothing really new to report for you guys.
I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff.
I've been playing Every Extend Extra, a little bit of Luminous 2 as well.
Still playing Burnout on Xbox and I'm getting very frustrated at how bad I suck at Burnout because the achievements, for one of them you have to get all, basically the majority of the achievements are you get all perfect ratings in every difficulty level.
Well, I'm one star shy in the very first basic difficulty level.
There's one
Freaking Race, I cannot get a gold medal in, and therefore I'm not able to get a perfect.
And it's frustrating the hell out of me how badly I suck at Burnout, so I cry a lot.
But it does give me an opportunity to use custom soundtracks and listen to, you know.
What's kind of funny is usually I'll put in the soundtrack to Wangan and Midnight Maximum Tune, and I'll play Burnout to that.
And it's kind of fun.
So, yay for custom soundtracks.
And you know, I've been watching Extifer play a lot of Excite Truck.
By the way, I'd like to point out, he just finally got, just like as of a few moments ago, got the very last trophy, the Super Duper Rings trophy, and says that nothing else happens, you just get all the trophies, that's it.
But he's been using the SD card that Jamie got him for Christmas to do all the custom soundtracks there.
He needs to get all the challenge modes finished, and then...
I think that unlocks one other thing that's minor.
He's done every single possible thing you can do in race mode.
I mean, I don't know anybody besides Nelly that's probably as obsessed with this game as X4 is.
Most people wrote off Excite Truck as kind of cheap compared to X4 360 Racers.
Really?
I have it in Dan House.
Interesting.
It's so interesting because this game kind of got a lot of critical heat against it, but it's really caught on with a lot of folks that I've...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It's kind of got the same formula, almost.
I mean, the way that you score points and stuff for doing drifts and, you know... I mean, Sidetrack does have its weaknesses.
Lack of online support being the biggest, you know.
Well, that's just... I know, it's lame.
That really is lame.
Lack of four-player racing.
Stupid.
I mean, come on.
I mean, I really don't understand Nintendo in just saying, Oh, you know, all these other consoles have been online for the last two generations, um...
No, we're just not gonna, we just don't feel it right now.
No, you're stupid.
You're stupid, stupid, stupid.
and I can't help but wonder how Mario Kart's going to do.
Because you know that's inevitable that we'll get a Mario Kart on the Wii eventually.
Well, hopefully it won't suck.
Probably not until 2008.
I hope it won't suck as bad as Double Dash because Double Dash blew ass.
But the DS one was pretty rad.
And that's the most recent one, really.
That's because it's like Mario Kart 64.
That's why it rocked.
But the thing is though is it better have online play because if it doesn't, that's a huge mistake.
And
ExciteTrek 2
Sort of.
Kind of.
I guess I could see that a little bit.
And sort of the feel of the game.
Yeah, I could see that a little bit.
If they had the multiplayer be, or sort of like how, what was that game?
Oh God, I can't remember.
It's 2099, one of the racing games.
You know what Excite... It had the dial-in thing to where you could... You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?
You mean Rush 2049?
Yes, thank you.
You know what Excite Trek reminds me of?
A woman.
How?
and DarkSakura.com.
Anything else on Excite Trek?
Oh, it was still my gaming week.
Eh, who cares?
DS, Final Fantasy 3, which I'm loving more and more, even though it's kind of hard.
And I finally got the four-star difficulty in Elite Beat Agents.
God, I love that game.
I really do.
Expect to see that in my top ten for the year.
I'll tell you that much.
All right.
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick before we get into the news.
Next week's show is also going to be pre-taped.
We're pre-taped tonight.
We're not live, as we mentioned previously, but those of you guys on our audio RSS, also known as podcasting, have a chance to download the program.
and so hello folks.
Next week is going to be the same deal.
However, next week is going to be a special show.
Since we're anticipating there's not going to be a lot of news due to the holiday season, what we're going to do is we're going to do sort of a year-end special and we're inviting a lot of our friends as in other podcasters, other shows on OLR, guests that we've had previously on the program and people in the industry.
We're inviting a whole
DarkSakura.com
Also, we want to mention Dig.com just recently added podcasting to their listing, and we want to thank you guys who've dug us.
Not bad, considering we haven't really mentioned it on the show or on the front page of the site.
We did give it a shout-out on the forums, and I know All Games has really been helping out with that effort as well.
We've gotten, I don't know, 60-something digs on the podcast.
That's pretty cool.
So if you feel like going and supporting that a little more, that would be awesome, because it all helps to spread the word, which, as you know,
Independent Radio has to rely on to get the news out there because we don't have no magazine that gives us free two, three page spreads in to promote our product.
So you have to go on there and vote.
And isn't it interesting that even that being said that the Corpcast, you know, because they're so out there and so pushed, they end up getting dug the most too.
Well, they do have employees that can go and dig.
I suppose that's true too.
Oh, well.
Anywho, let's get into some gaming news starting with Loki.
Definitely.
And of course this week we had two updates to it.
The forecast channel and the internet channel being added.
The forecast channel is, well, weather.
And it was pretty simplistic, but fun to play around with.
I spun the globe a lot because I was bored.
I think we all spun the globe.
That's what you do with globes.
I mean, when I was in school and I'd find a globe, I'd spin it.
That's pretty much it.
We would try to find the funniest city name.
I would take stickers and paste them all over the globe.
So those have been the launch.
The, of course, internet channel is free until June 2007, or June 30th, 2007, which it'll be pay afterwards, five bucks afterwards.
Right now, I guess they're considering it a beta.
Why is it not done?
Damn you, Opera.
I mean, come on, finish the fucking thing.
whatever so they're working the kinks out they'll be updated I'm assuming for free everyone's assuming oh we're all going to have to pay for it in July or whatever I don't think so I think they're just going to update it and so look forward to that and then of course I think in January we're going to be getting the news channel which hopefully we'll have a way to sign up for different RSS feeds and stuff because I don't really give a shit about the world news but
Whatever.
Yeah, they're really trying to turn the Wii into the front page of Yahoo.
Well, what do you think, though, I mean, about the browser channel?
I think it's pretty good.
I'm glad it does support Flash, because you'll see a lot more from OLRWii.com.
I got some good plans for that.
Hurry, hurry.
And what's good, though, is it's definitely a lot easier to browse than, say, the PSP browser.
That's for sure.
I'm wondering how long it'll be before we actually...
And it's actually kind of weird.
It's a little bit easier to browse than the PS3 browser, too, because apparently their text entry sucks, too.
But I'm wondering how long it'll be before we see a 360 browser.
Because, you know, they've got to jump on the bandwagon.
I don't know.
It's pretty cool.
I know that the WiiCade stuff doesn't work too well.
Everyone was hoping that site would be good, but they have to downgrade all their games for Flash 7.
It was okay.
I checked some of it out.
It was okay.
Yeah, they're pretty fun, some of the games.
Um...
Thanks for watching!
Well, it's not tiny box, but when you're looking at a big widescreen TV, it doesn't take up a big portion of it.
So I kind of wish there was a way to make that stuff bigger because YouTube's a pretty awesome site to be looking at on the Wii.
I mean, you can get everybody in the living room.
And what I did is I created my own personal page finally on YouTube, and I've started bookmarking videos I really like, like the banana muffin, muffin, muffin, banana.
Our listeners are going to have no idea what I'm talking about.
But you can bookmark these videos and play them for people.
That's cool.
Alright, so, yeah, I like the Wii browser as well.
I'm looking forward to whatever you are able to come up with for olrwii.com, because olrpsp.com, that site's still getting, even though we haven't really done a lot of maintenance on it, it's still getting talked about.
It's still getting talked about, and, you know, it looks great on the PSP.
You did a really good job with that, so hats off to you.
Looking forward to seeing what you can do with the Wii.
Alright.
Really?
I can't help it.
Yes, we're looking forward to seeing what Matt can do with his Wii.
Let me talk also about some other Wii news.
A lot of folks are talking about Virtual Console, and I thought it was quite humorous that people thought Nintendo was going to throw them a free game at Christmas.
Well, I don't know.
I heard a rumor Sony's doing something similar, but I guess folks thought Nintendo was going to throw them Super Mario Bros., one of their biggest games, as a free game.
Which, you know, considering how many times we've had to buy Super Mario Bros.
and various, like the Game Boy one they had, and the
Super Nintendo 1 they had and all that crap.
You'd think they could give us it for free, but no.
It's coming out for 500 Wii Points on Christmas Day.
But also coming out, ToeJam & Earl, R-Type for the TurboGrafx-16, and Super Castlevania, which should be pretty awesome.
Street Fighter 2 also.
Street Fighter 2 as well, even though I don't really plan on checking that one out.
R-Type.
Yeah, you like R-Type?
Urban Champion.
On January 1st, you get Urban Champion and I think it was Baseball.
By the way, Urban Champion kind of sucks.
I know a lot of people think it might be cool because they haven't really heard of it, but keep in mind, this game was made before Double Dragon, before a lot of that other stuff.
Urban Champion kind of sucks.
It's not going to be worth the 500 points, I'm sorry to say.
We need bad dudes.
New Year's Day is kind of weak, but Christmas Day is very strong in releases.
Are you a bad enough dude to save the president?
Bad dudes would be awesome.
That's what they really need.
No, it sucked on the NES.
It totally sucked compared to the arcade.
It was a horrible game, but it was fun.
Did they make bad dudes on Genesis?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
I don't think so.
I thought they made it on another system besides just the Nintendo.
Oh, well.
So you have those releases to look forward to on Christmas.
Well, speaking of releases, as... Well, there are...
Some next week in the UK.
And by some, I mean three.
Of course, on the 25th, we have Wii Sports.
Duh.
On the 29th, we've got... What the hell retailer is going to be open on the 25th in the UK to sell Wii Sports?
Alright, whatever, whatever.
I'm like, yeah.
And then also, two PSP releases, Free Running and Lego Star Wars 2, the original trilogy.
On the 29th.
It makes sense, though, that it's a slow week in the UK because of the holiday and everything.
It's going to be pretty slow over here, too, right, Loki?
Yeah, it's extremely slow.
I want to say there's actually nothing coming out.
I'm pretty confident in that.
And if anything, it was just a crappy-ass DS game.
And I really mean crappy, like board game collection-type crappy.
Anyway, so, but we do have some exclusive release dates for you, and I'd like to touch on something I was talking about earlier in the show about how websites are carrying exclusive stories that certain games are coming out and that they have the first news on it.
There's actually a news piece that's being run by GoNintendo.com, which is actually originally covered on CodenameRevolution.com, talking about High School Musical being in development for the Wii.
In case you forgot, we did mention that back in episode 206,
Way back in the month of October, and gave you a release date of that as well.
And in case you haven't heard of that, I believe it's coming out in May.
But who cares?
It's High School Musical The Game.
I mean, I put this right up there with, like, happy feet.
Exactly.
It's a crappy game.
Can't you guys just kiss and make up?
It's really not worth fighting over.
No, it's worth fighting over.
Everything's worth fighting.
No, but seriously, so that's coming out, and, you know, great.
We did have a few other things, and some of these were mentioned during the week.
I had them posted in our show role, but during the week, more news came out, and we had some dates being released.
Of course, Prince of Persia Rival Swords for the Wii being announced by Ubisoft, and that's coming out March 14th.
What they didn't mention, though, is that Driver Parallel Lines will also be coming out on the Wii and the PSP.
That is also the same day on March 14th.
And a week prior, they're going to be releasing their game for the new Ninja Turtles movie.
And that's coming out on PlayStation 2, GameCube, 360, the Wii, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance.
And that's coming out on the 7th.
Also from Ubisoft, we've got a sequel to their really crappy Game Boy Advance game, Dogs.
Dogs 2, which is coming out on the 7th of March as well.
They have a music game coming out at the end of February called Guitar Hits for the PSP.
Dragon Ball Z, Shin Budokai, Another
for PSP, the follow-up of their Shin Budokai game, and that's coming out March 14th.
And then Dragon Ball Z Haru Kanaru, that's a very long name, Haru Kanaru Densetsu for the DS, and that's a mouthful right there.
That's coming out on the 21st of March.
And then
You're gonna love this.
Elder Scrolls Oblivion for the PlayStation 3.
Delayed yet again to the end of February.
Coming out now, February 27th.
What the hell?
Gee, where have I heard this Oblivion getting delayed for the new console thing before?
Where have I heard this before?
2006, maybe?
Yeah, seriously.
So, it's being delayed yet again.
I don't know why they don't have it done yet, but whatever.
So.
That's it.
Well, thanks for the exclusive look at some of the U.S.
news.
Nobody else has mentioned that whole Oblivion getting delayed thing, huh?
No, no.
But I'm sure a few months from now they'll mention, oh, by the way, it's been delayed.
We have the exclusive news on it because everyone seems to ignore us.
That's fine.
We're not a real legitimate site because we don't have game in our title.
Nope.
Coming out in Japan, also kind of slim pickings in Japan this week, but you do get the Japanese version of Prey on the 360 this week on December 28th.
Also on the PlayStation 3, you're going to get Formula 1 Championship Edition coming out there.
Coming to the Nintendo Wii, you get, not a lot, you get a new memory card there.
Coming to the PlayStation 2, you get Formula 1 2006, Unimishi, and Himihibi Princess Days.
Does that sound like a title you're interested in playing?
DarkSakura?
That actually sounds kind of cute.
Sounds kind of cute.
Coming for the Nintendo DS, we have just a bunch of accessories, some pens, some covers, and an Animal Crossing mascot strap, and a carrying bag for Animal Crossing.
Hmm.
Sounds like it might be kind of fun.
You do get Dragon Quest monsters, though, on the DS, which is, you know, Dragon Quest games are always pretty big deals over there in Japan, even though this is, you know, it's a spin-off game still.
Gonna be pretty big.
And that's really all I have.
Not a whole lot.
It's a slow week over there, too.
And as I was going to say, the High School Musical game, I said May, because I was just completely pulling it out of the top of my head.
But I looked back in the show role for episode 206, and apparently it was July 11th.
May was Pirates of the Caribbean 3.
Let it go, Jesus.
Hey, I've got to get my information correct, okay?
Just in case.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Anyways.
Now that we're moving on from our angst, aren't we?
I think so, yeah.
The best news about this is that I won't have to buy some fucking cable to do it like you had to do on the GameCube.
Remember, the first cable you could connect to your Advance or whatever, but then it didn't work with the Advance SP.
Nope, it didn't.
It was so annoying.
So annoying.
Damn you, Nintendo.
I'm still mad at you over that.
That's why I still held onto my GBA.
Because I have to tell you what I want to see come out again is the Pac-Man Plus or Pac-Man Versus.
Oh, Pac-Man Versus.
Yeah, that would actually be a really fun download title for the Wii, wouldn't it?
I actually, we still randomly play that game because it's just fantastic.
I mean, it was such a fun idea.
Well, also, I think about, you know, they should really give Four Swords another chance because I think a lot of people didn't get into Four Swords on the GameCube because of the fact you had to have, all these people had to have an advance and all these people had to have the cables.
And it wasn't usually hard to find people with an advance.
It was hard to find people with the cables to play the game with.
Same thing with Crystal Chronicles.
I think we actually have two or three sets of cables at my house just because of that.
Yeah, but you're a nerd.
Well, I mean, it was just that we ended up, you know, Dan worked at GameStop at the time.
We found him cheap.
We'd just hold on to him.
But it was really, I think, in that respect, though, it's, hey, we make it require this.
We can sell more stuff.
So, I don't know.
I'm really, really hoping that we get not just, you know, like the one or two ones that were out before, but get a whole series of games that interact between the Wii and the DS.
I could really go for that.
Any ideas how they could do that, Loki?
How they could get more games to interact with both systems?
Well, probably just... They'll probably start adding it on kind of like they did with the Game Boy Advance stuff, you know, where, like, remember Metroid Prime, where you could download the original Metroid to it and stuff like that.
They'll probably start with gimmicky stuff like that.
Hopefully, maybe the new Animal Crossing will allow you to download some games.
Dream on!
Actually, I have an idea.
They should be able to turn your Wii into a demo station.
Yeah, that's been a long time rumor.
I remember nobody's ever seen if that's really going to happen.
But yeah, the rumor was you'd be able to download DS demos through your Wii.
Just like you're supposed to be able to do PSP demos through the PS3.
But if an Animal Crossing were to come out on Wii, that means that we'd probably get the island back.
That should be fun.
I think everybody's waiting for Animal Crossing on the Wii.
I don't know.
I'm a little skeptical this time because I was so excited about Animal Crossing on the DS.
I was so excited about it and then played it for like two weeks and then I was done.
I think you should have a Mii game.
You know, you make your Mii on your Wii and download your Mii to the DS with a little thing like sub-games.
I guess anything is possible.
Anything's possible.
I don't know.
But one thing that they're probably not going to have in Animal Crossing is the Wiimote throwing game, because they've been getting a lot of heat over the whole Wiimote strap thing.
In fact, of course, as I predicted last week, immediately the next day, Class Action Lawsuit filed for the stupid Wii strap things, and of course... He's so humble, isn't he?
Hey, I mean, I'm not taking credit for that, because anybody could have guessed that, that's just...
That's just stupid.
I mean, of course it was coming because people were looking to profit from all this stuff.
So, some company, Greenwelling LLP, filed a national class action lawsuit on behalf of the owners of Nintendo Wii.
Thank you, them, because, you know, all these Wii owners are in dire need of some money.
No, you know what?
You don't represent me.
I am a Nintendo Wii owner since launch day, and you don't represent me.
Let that be known on this program.
Anyway, so you need to say I represent Wii owners except Rob Pomorin's Lounge Radio.
And me.
And me.
You should just say you represent stupid people.
They said that basically the class action lawsuit rose as a result of the defective nature of the Wii remotes.
Basically saying that the wrist straps were not strong enough to withstand the use of the player and that Nintendo did not include enough
instruction on how to use the Wii Remote properly.
What?
Oh, my God.
I want to shove a Wii Remote up their butt.
That's a retard.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
That's insulting to retarded people.
That's just an idiot.
I'm sorry.
I can't deal with that.
And that it's basically, you know, what they're saying, though, and they're looking to do is the class action lawsuit is going to basically correct
They want to correct the defect in the Wii Remote and provide a refund to the purchase or replace the defective Wii Remotes.
I think they're trying to also claim damages for stuff that people have done.
I can't help but think, though, that they've sent out emails.
There's a stupid indicator in the front of all the games.
It's built into the games, for God's sake.
Built into the consoles.
On every single game, this is the Wii strap thing.
They've offered this free replacement program.
If you want to replace your Wii straps, they'll do it for free.
They've...
Told you in the instruction manuals do not swing wildly, and you don't need to swing wildly, and the commercials don't show them swinging wildly.
Granted, they show them diving across the couch, but that's not swinging wildly.
That's just acting like an idiot.
Well, I think the best comparison I heard about that, though, was that, like, you know, in a commercial for a new car, they show them driving in the wilderness doing all these stunts, and they always have that little thing, you know, professional driver on closed course, do not attempt, that whole thing, right?
And you know that you don't do that with a regular car.
You just know that.
Common sense tells you that, right?
Common sense tells you if you dive across the couch, you're likely to break the couch or a lamp or your Wiimote, but that's the risk you take.
It had warnings, right?
They've made the warnings abundant.
Three words, idiot.
Well, it just comes down to Nintendo, of course, said this is, you know, without merit that they've done everything.
Basically, reinstating what we just said about, you know, the Wii and that they've given way more than enough, you know, precautions and stuff.
And people are stupid.
It's just like, you know...
You don't see lawsuits out there for people throwing baseball bats and hitting somebody with them and them suing the baseball bat company because they're stupid and let go of the bat.
They know they're not supposed to do that.
Well, just like you know you're not supposed to swing the remote like a 90-mile-an-hour fastball, and just because your hands became slippery... Well, you know, if I had a knife and my hands were slippery and I accidentally stabbed someone with the knife, it's my old damn fault, not the knife company, because they made their knives sharp.
It's just...
It's really dumb, and I hope to God that they have somebody out there that sees this case and throws it out of court.
Didn't they say this might go to jury trial, or that's what they want?
Is they want a jury trial out of this?
Well, I think the lawsuit was... No, wait, that was the one for the Xbox 360, where they were seeking $5 million for... They haven't really said a number that they're looking to get yet, but from what we've seen so far, the Wii straps breaking has been...
Relatively rare.
I mean, it's happened, but people post it on the internet, and so it seems like a bigger problem than it actually is.
And a lot of these we found out as of last week that are faked.
So, I mean, I just see this as just them trying to profit off of it.
Let's take the fakers to court.
Nintendo ought to sue all the fakers.
That would be funny.
Well, that does make sense.
Technically, it's perjury.
There you go.
It's basically... I say if Nintendo loses money on this, they take those fakers to court.
That would be funny.
Defamation.
Defamation suit.
I think that would be funny.
All right.
Now, real quick, I want to say, though, speaking of lawsuits, did you hear about that?
I know this is going to sound completely random, but did you hear about that trillion-dollar lawsuit that the RIAA filed against that Russian MP3 company that was selling all of MP3.com or whatever that site is?
Do you hear about that?
It's like one of the biggest lawsuits ever.
Trillions of dollars, like $1.6 trillion lawsuit or something like that.
There was another study I read.
I don't even remember exactly what it was, but it was something that they were saying that these claims, the damages that are being caused by the downloads are a lot, I mean, which is obvious, are a lot less than what these companies are seeking for.
And that, you know, really the people downloading these MP3s are not really causing that much damage to them.
All this news about lawsuits, I don't know about you guys, but news about stupid lawsuits makes me very angry.
Does it make you angry?
Everything makes me angry.
You know what happens when we get angry?
People die.
The FUs of the week time.
DarkSakura, what's pissing you off this week?
FU to mucus and the extreme amounts of it that live in my lungs.
and MakeMeSickEveryMorning.
I hate bronchitis.
I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.
I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate you!
Remember Kefka?
Oh, forget it.
Yes.
Yes, I remember.
But, um, I'd also like to just offer an F you to, uh, Tower Video for not having any Doctor Who DVDs before they, uh, went out of business.
Loki?
Loki?
I'm pissed off at the lack of Wii games that are out there that are good Wii games because, you know, I'm really, I'm kind of searching for some more stuff to play and I bought a lot of stuff and I have to say about, you know, 60% of it's been crap.
And it's just, it's not because, you know...
I picked a crappy game.
Haven't you played damn near every launch title now except like Happy Feet and Avatar?
Well, I haven't played like any of the, you know, Happy Feet, Avatar, Spongebob, you know, that stuff that's ports off of old games like Ant Bully and stuff.
But I've played, you know, quite a bit of everything and a lot of it's really crappy and I'm starting to get a little afraid that, you know, maybe this launch for the Wii wasn't as good as everyone's saying it was because...
Thank you for watching!
It was a lot better than this stuff.
But, I mean, to be fair, the games that were good on Wii were really good.
Like, you know, Zelda.
I thought Excite Truck was pretty damn good, especially for a launch title.
Trauma Center, fucking amazing.
Especially if you haven't played the DS one.
Here's the thing it's coming down to is because Excite Truck is really good.
It's like, yeah, that's awesome.
I want to find another game like this.
Oh, wait.
Thank you for watching!
There is a drought in games, and it's like three games coming out in the next two months.
I'm sorry, they need more than this.
Don't you expect that there's going to be a drought in January, February for every system?
What do the other systems have coming?
The other systems?
360's got Lost Planet, which is a pretty large title.
Well, Battlestation's Midway, which is shit.
And Fusion Frenzy.
And then PlayStation 3 doesn't have shit coming out for it, but PlayStation 3 didn't have shit coming out for it at launch either.
Um...
And then PlayStation 2.
I mean, January, granted, is a slow month.
But February does have a lot of stuff coming out for other systems.
A lot of big titles.
And the Wii is just kind of being skipped.
All right.
My FUs of the week, I don't really have a lot, so FU to cookies for being so tempting and straying me from my diet this holiday season.
Because I've gotten so many yummy cookies, like, you know, Loki and Nelly made me some for Christmas that were very good.
No offense, I mean, the cookies were great, it's just too tempting.
And then some of my students at work made me cookies, and oh gosh, it's too much, too much to handle.
Let's get back into some news.
It's funny that you brought this up, but it was talked about this week, the whole delays for Wii games.
There was some news going on that Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime could possibly be delayed all the way to Christmas.
But then, of course, Reggie Fils-Aimé discussed with Newsweek not that long ago, he made a promise, Nintendo would not have the launch problems they have with usual consoles.
Quote, Metroid Prime 3 which is a from the ground up creation of Metroid for the Wii system will come out in early 2007.
This gives us fantastic momentum coming off the launch and will certainly be an example of how there will be no new game drought for this system.
Another from the ground up Wii game that we are strategically timing to launch to make sure we are continuing driving momentum through 2007 is Super Mario Galaxy.
You know, and they really are doing a good job keeping games coming out.
Nintendo is, you know, because they've got WarioWare for January, We Play for February, Mario Party 8 for March, I mean, and that's already, you know, the first quarter of the year, and they've got a game coming out every month.
Can't say the same for other companies, though, because... So it's the third parties that have to pick it up.
But is it still kind of new, maybe?
Maybe.
And third parties have their development cycles, you know.
March, you're going to see a ton of games come out.
And remember how Nintendo wasn't letting a lot of them online at first?
That's stupid.
That could be part of it, too.
Nintendo needs to fucking get a clue.
Online's where it is now.
And you know what?
People were really excited about the online for the DS.
And I thought, okay, because they saw that.
Let's take that as an example.
Get this fucking console online.
This Mii Channel, exchanging Miis and exchanging messages shit, it's old.
It's old already.
We need some more online games.
It needs some actual good support for the online.
Metroid at some point, Super Mario World on Super Nintendo.
Those types of games will be strategically planned for when there's a drought of big Wii games.
Great.
You know what you need to do with those virtual console games?
You need to put them online like they do with Xbox Live Arcade games.
Put them so that you can play multiplayer online.
Maybe not exactly is how they're doing it because the Xbox Live Arcade games have had a little bit of problems with some of the online components of them, but
Multiplayer Online with Mario Kart.
I mean, that's going to be awesome.
Of course, they probably wouldn't want to compete with their new Mario Kart whenever the fuck that's coming out.
You could really add a lot of oomph to some of these old crap titles like Baseball, Tennis, Mario Brothers.
Well, I shouldn't say it's crap.
I mean, they all contributed to history.
Leaderboards, at least.
Yeah, you could really add a lot of oomph to these games and really justify the $5 price with these little enhancements.
I think.
It's not asking that much.
I mean,
Well, you know, I'm sure there's a huge technical aspect when it comes to lag and all that stuff, but, you know, whatever.
Well... Excuse me for a moment while my voice fills me.
Well...
There are a few rumors floating about, and one that I know a lot of people would really, really like to see.
There are talks actually from EGM in the January issue stating that Katamari Damacy would be coming out on the Wii and Xbox Live Arcade.
I'm sort of not sure how it would work on the Wii, if you'd do it like Monkey Ball.
Probably like Monkey Ball.
Yeah.
But Xbox Live, though, it would definitely...
It's a good idea, I think, for Xbox Live.
I'm worried about the size limitation on Xbox Live, though, with 50 megs.
Well, I guess the graphics ain't all that.
I don't know, okay.
I loaded my copy onto my HD loader, and it wasn't that big.
I'd have to check it again.
Well, I'm hearing the rumors that they're going to up the live limit because the new memory card's coming out, the 256 megs.
I think the 50 meg limit's stupid anyways, and to be honest, I...
So you can't download a live arcade game to your memory card.
Boo fucking hoo.
Who cares?
Get a goddamn hard drive.
Or don't use that part of it.
Just use your fucking memory card for saves, and that is it.
We don't even do that.
We just use a hard drive.
Yeah, the only thing I use memory cards for, downloading content from kiosks, and I don't even do that anymore.
Didn't We Heart Katamari have a two-player mode?
It did, didn't it?
It did.
Yeah, so could you imagine having that on the Xbox?
Add cooperative and versus.
Well, the... The original one did too.
The originals did too.
That's right.
It was kind of a...
I like co-op mode better for Katamari.
It wasn't, you know, it wasn't like, you know, it's no Halo, Gears of War style multiplayer that, you know, keeps people coming back, but it's a nice addition, you know, makes it a little something special.
That would be kind of fun on Xbox Live.
I would love to see, you know... I'd much rather play Katamari and Mashi co-op than Gears of War, I'm sorry.
I'd love to see the Wii version have your Miis as, like, the little, you know, characters running around in the levels and stuff.
That'd be funny.
Oh, getting to roll over your friends?
Yeah.
That'd be fun.
That would be really cool.
Or they should do like a... Or the massive people in your Mii parade.
Or they should do like a convert an existing Mii into a little prince cousin.
A little prince face.
Maybe.
That'd be fun.
I think that would be good.
They have a lot of things that they can do with that.
And hopefully they'll actually use all that.
And of course, Loki will be all about the achievements.
Fuck that shit.
Yes, it will be all about the achievements.
No, but anyways.
Speaking of the 360, the 360 owners got a pretty cool surprise recently as Microsoft has upped their warranty from 90 days to one whole year.
So if your console happens to be broken, or if it was broken, you're going to be getting a refund for your broken console.
So that is pretty awesome.
And definitely, at least they're supporting their hardware with the issues that they may have for it.
Yeah.
Go Microsoft!
Well, this song, of course, is in Luminous 2 on the PSP, and it was just released for download on iTunes this week, so you can check that out by the Genki Rockets.
Heavenly Star
I really like this song, ever since the video was posted back in the day.
Thanks for watching!
and the Black Eyed Peas, Pump It song and Missy Elliott, Lose Control.
That's a great one to play Luminous to.
I'm sorry.
They had some pretty fun choices.
For the benefit of our listeners, I'm staring blankly at Rob.
Whatever.
Then go to the next story.
I don't listen to any of that.
Go to the next story.
Well, you know how we were saying that Metal Gear, not just we, I mean a bunch of people were saying Metal Gear Solid 4 was going to be multi-platform?
It was a rumor last week.
It was a rumor.
It was a rumor.
Well, an inside source at Konami is not really that reliable.
They've come out saying that it's going to be definitely exclusive for PS3.
At this time is the key word, or words I should say.
So they left themselves an out.
It's at this time.
It's just like they said, you know, what was it...
Back when, well, when I pointed out when they brought, you know, their version of the story that Splinter Cell was coming out on the PS3 as well.
And, you know, they said, oh, we had no plans of this coming out on the PlayStation 3 at this time.
And then next week they announced, oh, it's coming out on the PlayStation 3.
Oh, no, it wasn't that.
It was, um...
Virtual Fighter V, that's what it was.
They were doing an interview for that, and that was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, and then this week, you know, 360, so... I'm going to say something uncharacteristic for me.
I don't really think any other system can do the game justice but PS3.
Interesting.
What makes you say that?
Playing Resistance Fall of Man.
You don't think they could do it on 360?
What is it?
They could do it, but it would not do it justice.
It...
With everything that I've seen that they want to do with Metal Gear Solid 4, they're going to need the extra processing power.
They're really going to need it.
I've played a bunch of stuff on Xbox 360 and it all comes out really pretty, but I honestly, just doing comparisons for several of the games, I think the PS3 is going to be the better platform for the game anyway.
I guarantee you this will be out on the 360.
Not day and date, but it will be out on the 360.
I'm going to have it on PS3.
It doesn't matter.
Interesting.
I never really got into Metal Gear past the old NES ones.
I mean, I don't know.
I somehow missed that boat.
And I know I'm weird for missing it.
Rob, do you believe that love can bloom on a battlefield?
Shut up.
They basically, it's all about money.
That's what it is.
The PlayStation 3 has 200,000 units out there.
Or say, okay, by the end of...
What if the PS3 suddenly takes off between this and Final Fantasy XIII?
and it will be made on the 360.
Just because they're, you know, exclusive right now, you know, they do, Sony does pay them for exclusive rights to some of these games and so it, after a certain amount of time.
But, but, but, the Xbox 360 does not have six axis.
Yeah, and the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble.
Such flimsy controllers.
Anyways, so, you know, great.
Um,
And speaking of the PlayStation 3, somebody's actually in talks with Amazon for their movie download service.
And, you know, because PlayStation 3, they're starting to kind of get into the more, you know, downloads and everything.
And I got to admit, they do have some pretty good stuff on their network service right now as far as, you know, like the equivalence to live arcade games.
You know, especially they're getting that Gran Turismo HD demo, which is not bad for free.
I got to admit, that's pretty cool.
And...
Now they're talking about going the same way as the 360 and offering movie downloads, which this isn't a big surprise because it's Sony and they want it to be this media center type thing.
So of course they're talking with Amazon because they have their digital download service as well and probably going to hook up with them on that.
But I see this probably happening, especially with the PSP.
I think they have their download service as well.
So what does this mean for UMDs?
This doesn't mean anything for UMDs.
It means that people are going to be downloading videos to the PlayStation 3.
UMDs are going to be like UMDs, meaning they're going to be out there, but they're not going to sell.
Is this to compete with 360's new little marketplace movie thingy?
Definitely.
Which I still don't like because they don't have enough HD movies.
They have like five.
I count five or six HD movies.
That's it.
It's literally going to be to compete with that, and it's also going to be to compete with iTunes.
That's exactly what it's for.
All right.
Well, something else to be competitive in the movie world.
Ken Kutaragi has spoken with Impress, that's a magazine over in Japan, about an AV-centric PlayStation 3.
This would have the cell processor powering and would, quote, be a standard AV component-sized box with a more powerful power supply unit, anti-shake insulator, and twice the main memory.
And then it also goes on to talk about dual HDMI output for this high-end system.
Now, this is kind of similar to the PSX, which was a version of the PlayStation 2, but it was just very expensive.
I guess you can kind of compare it to, you know, like the Panasonic Q was like an AV machine, but it also played GameCube games.
So it's not necessarily that he's talking about, you know, replacing the PlayStation 3 already.
But to me, it does seem a little early to be talking about this.
To me.
And it's also... It's like, make your PlayStation 3s.
Well, the dual HDMI out, that was originally what they were talking about for the original PlayStation 3.
Then, apparently, that was a little crazy.
And also the same with... Well, actually, I remember the dual HDMI out for the PlayStation 3 was for multiple monitors.
Remember, they said that if you had two HDTVs, who would have this?
Sitting next to each other, you could extend your desktop to be on both of them for...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and buy a PlayStation 3 and still do it cheaper than this.
It's just stupid.
And the other thing, too, they're saying normal component size.
Well, that PlayStation 3 is not small by any means.
It is already normal component size, if not larger.
I mean, so what's the size of this power brick thing going to be?
I mean, is it going to be the size of, like,
A TV or something?
I mean, seriously, what are they talking about for this stuff?
I think this is still a ways out, whatever it is.
I think they need to shut him up, is what they need to do.
Because he's just spouting off retardedness as time goes on.
He really, he doesn't have a grip on reality.
Alright, well we issued a challenge to our listeners last week.
If you think the Sony spokespeople have no clue what they're doing in the marketing department, create your own Sony ad.
And we invited folks to leave us a voicemail on our Skype line.
Hi, I'm Sony's new spokesperson, Paradox Vincent.
Now look,
The PS3's been getting a lot of rap, but I think that it's really just all miscommunication, you know?
You gamer people just don't understand the way the business works, so I'm here to clear some things up.
The biggest complaint we've heard is the price.
Too cheap, I know, but there's nothing we can do about that now.
Secondly, some people say it freezes.
We're putting freezing technology in, so that people can really get a feel
for the true next generation look and feel on your 1080i television.
To really feel like you're driving that car, like you're shooting that alien, or how you're in that giant robot.
We want you to feel like you're a ninja or whatever, stabbing the giant enemy crab.
We get it, you know?
We understand that some people might not have HDTV.
In fact, a great number of people don't have HDTV.
Especially not 1080i HDTV.
We don't care.
Leave us alone.
I'm not hearing you.
La la, la la la la la.
La la, you're stupid.
All in all, it's the perfect gaming console.
I know.
The Wii's a pedophile.
And the Xbox 360 takes pictures of you while you're sleeping.
Would you pay $600 for a pedophile?
Or a pervert?
Or a terrorist?
I wouldn't.
Make the right move.
Make the Sony move.
Good job, Paradox Vincent.
We're going to send you some random things from our OLR prize pool.
I know we have a DDR Extreme 2 bundle.
Yes, that's Extreme 2.
That's last year's game.
But hey, those DDR pads are not easy to come by, so you get a bundle there and some other stuff as well.
I think there's a DS game we have to give away, too.
Don't we have a copy of Tau or something that's got to get given away at some point?
I don't know.
We'll have to see what's in the box.
You'll see.
You'll find out what you get when you get it.
All right.
What a great contest.
You get to win something.
Yeah.
A thing, a random... Think of it as Santa Claus coming to your house.
Something's better than nothing.
Something random from Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll be in touch.
You win stuff here.
More contests to come.
We'll probably do something next week, so stay tuned to Orange Lounge Radio.
Well, I have some news, and this makes me happy.
Remember Loco Roco?
Why, yes, I do.
It's getting a sequel.
That's kind of a given.
You mean one of the only PSP games people talked about a lot this year?
Getting a sequel?
No way!
Well, it was announced by Phil Harrison to MTV News.
Now, this makes me think, though, that quite possibly, I don't know, given that LocoRoco sort of flopped in Japan, I'm wondering if they're going to have a more limited release there than they will here.
I can just hear, I can see the interview now.
Yeah, we're doing a sequel to LocoRoco.
I don't like any of those Mexican games.
Jamey sees a penis in everything.
I do not.
I bet you wish you were in Second Life this week.
I know we didn't get around to that story, but there was some chick that was being interviewed in Second Life, and all these penises flew by on the screen like people threw dicks at her.
And I was thinking, hmm, Jamie should see this.
I actually tried downloading Second Life, because, again, it was my fandom that inspired me.
Someone freaking made a TARDIS on Second Life.
You nerd.
Well, it's not fully extra-dimensional like the actual one, but they had it all laid out, and they had the current one, and then they had the Tom Baker-era one in the different rooms and stuff.
I thought that was cool.
And then I played Second Life for five minutes, and then I was like, this game sucks.
Anyways.
Yeah, Second Life, I don't get it.
Anyways.
New Kingdom Hearts.
Speaking of Jamie fandom.
Yay!
I'm sure this is news to everybody.
They're making another Kingdom Hearts game.
That's a shocker.
Shocker.
Why?
Why would they do something like this?
It's not like the last game sold millions or anything.
So yeah, they're making a new Kingdom Hearts game, Kingdom Hearts 3.
And of course, this was sort of announced on the trailer that they had for Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix during their Jump Festa show in Tokyo.
and basically saying that a new project was in the works.
So, Kingdom Hearts 3, something brand new to the series.
Well, something Kingdom Hearts-ish is coming.
Yay.
Yay.
They better have Space Paranoids in it.
And I'm here to announce something else that Square is going to be doing.
I know this is going to be a shock to everyone.
After Final Fantasy XIII, there will be a Final Fantasy XIV.
Oh my god!
It's coming.
It's coming.
I speculate there will be five versions of it.
I am actually thinking, let me think, there will be another Final Fantasy game re-released on some handheld in the near future.
There will be some type of re-release of some game from Square Enix's catalog.
And there's going to be another Final Fantasy VII side story.
After Super Mario Galaxy, there will be another Mario game.
Amazing.
And there will be another Zelda game.
Well, we actually already know about the Zelda game.
But there will be a Metroid 4 in some capacity.
There will be another Metroid game as well.
And then they will also re-release a remade version of the old Metroid.
And despite what the rumors say, if you think they're not going to make a Halo 4 or some type of Halo story, you're kidding yourself.
All right, anyway, speaking of games that are going to be kind of expensive, as all those games are going to be, there was an interesting story run by Forbes this week that breaks down the price of a $60 video game.
Of course, a lot of people are bitching and moaning because games are $60 now.
I don't know if you've heard, but games are kind of expensive in this day and age.
And this is where your money goes.
$27 goes towards the making of the game.
15 goes towards art and graphics.
$12 goes towards gameplay mechanics.
Now, $12 goes to the retail markup, meaning that the store you actually buy it from gets $12, because it usually costs them about $48.
And there's a console owner fee of $7.
and the retail and publishing parties involved only really get about $1 for every game sold.
They might be able to push it to $3 a game if they sell advertising in the manual or do some of that in-game advertising stuff or what have you.
Interesting.
That's where your money goes if you ever wondered.
That's economics for you.
Well, if you ever wonder where your emails go when you send them to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, they go to the bowels of hell known as Jamie's house, where she opens them up and reads them and finds some of her favorites to read for you all on air.
So do you have some mail for us this week, DarkSakura?
Yes.
Damn you people, only five this week.
What's up with that?
I expect better of our listeners.
I heard there was a holiday or something going on.
So?
It doesn't take long to type.
I type 90 words a minute.
I can have a letter typed up in, you know, three minutes.
Anyway.
Nah, but we got some pretty good emails.
The first one comes from, I guess it's pronounced Igor.
This is Igor, regular listener from...
Florianopolis Brazil that's cool I've been listening to you for quite some time and I consider it a very good podcast top 5 on my iTunes every week by the way I believe that you should be experiencing some problems in iTunes and a stupid thing popped up sorry I had my DVD pop up and then I closed my case while it was reading so it covered email
Anyway, um, okay, um, this is not the first time this happened, at least twice in the last month because I downloaded Part A and it is only eight minutes long.
Does anyone also have this issue?
Keep doing a great job.
Hope to see you guys down here in South America.
Sincerely, Igor.
Um, I don't use iTunes.
I do.
I always check to make sure the podcast works okay on iTunes.
I've never been able to duplicate the issue, but you're not the first person I've heard to complain about it.
Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can do on our end.
I'm not sure what iTunes is doing to cause it or if it's a server thing.
I think iTunes, if the download moves too slow, and considering how much we get hammered when a new show goes out, because we're distributed on the Xbox,
God, now I can't remember.
Xbox Live?
No, no, not Xbox Live.
The XP Stream, thank you.
We're on that, and that hits us every 15 minutes, so a lot of people hit our show right when it comes out, and I think it might be causing the server to move a little bit slowly.
There are other subscription services you can use.
Yeah, there are other subscriptions you can use to get on the feed, or you can go to the feed directly and just go to where it says Download Our Podcast on the main site.
You can actually pull the MP3s directly from our page.
And there's also, you know, you can use Yahoo Podcasts, although they've fallen behind on the listing, so I don't know how much I support that one right now.
And Dig, but they mirror the show on their site or something kind of funny.
So if you're not going to use iTunes, I would suggest maybe like PodNova or the, what is that thing called, Juice?
Or something like that that would pull down the MP3s as well.
Or go directly to the feed and save it from there.
When I get them, I go to the feed.
So I can tell you it's reliable.
Well, we have another one coming from Gorilla, which is cool because I'm a fan.
Well, no, I see Gorilla and I instantly think Gorillas.
Hey kids, long time listener and fan of the show.
Just wanted to comment on some things said on past shows in regards to eBaying Wii or PS3.
It's sort of a long one.
So forgive me if I paraphrase a little bit.
I personally have no problem with someone selling their bought and owned device.
If I own a PS3 for two minutes or two years, I own it and have a right to put it up on eBay.
If someone thinks this is wrong, then they should have been in line in front of me and got one, and they could have done whatever they want with it.
It's not my business.
In my own defense, I did get a PS3, and I did wait in line for a Wii, so yeah.
I don't believe people should be getting anything the easy way.
I think everyone should work hard for what they have.
Or the game companies should make enough of it.
Yeah, there's that too.
I fully blame Sony and, you know, greed for the state of that.
This is going to be an email I'm going to post on our forums because it is long, but I'm going to read the last paragraph because it sort of mirrors a little bit how I feel about it.
I'm sure you will edit this if you read it on the show, but the bottom line is this is my opinion.
If you own something, no matter how long, especially if you put the time and effort to wait in line with a bunch of people who would never want to stand out,
You never want to stand next to otherwise.
It is your right to self-smash, burn, throw out a window, or keep for years before selling it back to GameStop anyway.
If people don't like it, then tell them when they see an auction for $3,000 on an already overpriced $600 device, don't bid.
I do agree with that.
Hold on.
I thought you were staunchly against reselling these consoles on eBay.
No, no, no.
I'm going to say this very specifically.
I am against buying them out for the specific purpose of selling them.
For those people who bought 10 PS3s at 10 different stores in Japan just for the purpose of selling them online, I have a problem with that.
I don't have a problem with someone, you know, and I did think about it, you know, I will admit when, you know, I can change my opinion about things after putting lots of thought into it.
Say that this is your college tuition, I don't have a problem with that, you know.
I mean, if you take it home, and so you, I actually don't have a problem if you take it home, play this, if you know this is shit, and put it on eBay, I don't have a problem with that, at all.
I don't have a, now, the one problem I have, though, with using it to make a profit for, say, your bills, or for your mortgage, is that it's gambling.
It really, I'm not a gambling person.
You know, I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But it is your right to do so.
I agree with that.
I don't think it's right for, again, those people who were basically getting the edge on the market by buying 100 PS3s and selling them on eBay.
That's, yeah, that's much.
That's abuse.
That's sick.
What, but I think that, yeah, all those people, though, who are paying the money for them on eBay, gouge them.
Make them pay.
You know, because they didn't stand in line and put any damn effort into it.
You know, those people deserve to get ripped off.
And if it's disposable income, then you know what?
They need to take those people away from their disposable income and make them go work hard for something.
I have a problem with that.
I think that people should actually have to work hard for what they have instead of just having it handed to them on a platter.
Although I don't mind when anybody hands me anything on a platter, but I also work hard for everything else I have.
It's a different story if you just get everything you want.
If you work hard, you should be able to get something.
But anyway.
Thanks and love the show for keeping up all the good work and reviews.
I did buy an Xbox 360 and am keeping it.
Oh, you're cool.
It's from Gorilla.
Post your game and tag on the forums.
Join the OL Army.
Email from Chicago.
Chicago.
Once in a while, you should have a retro game segment and feature past systems such as the 3DO game system.
which I loved and still own.
Okay, you're entitled to that.
I was way ahead of its time.
Yeah, you're allowed to love it if you really want to love that system.
Before PS1 came out and killed it.
You know, actually, you must have ESPN.
I mean, ESP.
Because look for something like that to be coming out next year.
All right.
There's more.
Right.
More emails from Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
I'm going to have learned giants by the time I'm done with this segment.
That's all right.
Hey, guys and girl.
Yes, Jamie, I wouldn't forget your angsty self.
Well, thank you.
It's them and yeah, it's been going good down here in Texas, I suppose.
The stars at night shine big and bright.
Ow!
I can't clap with the microphone in my hand.
Sorry, can't help it.
Pee-wee.
Just recently I had an idea for a game.
Now don't you start spouting off, I smell a Konami lawsuit.
Konami will sue!
Hey!
But I was thinking of making a Stepmania-type game for the arcade.
I have ideas and such, but right now, nothing has been done, and I'm trying to get the word out.
Seeing as how I love your show, and I know everybody else should, maybe I can find some help with this.
I'm not going to read out the email yet.
Enough of my shameless self-promoting or whatever.
Hold on.
If it's going to change subjects, I want to talk about the Step Mania thing for just a minute.
Isn't that just in the groove?
I mean, I imagine this person must have some type of separate idea that differentiates it from in the groove.
But, you know, it wasn't in the groove, just Step Mania.
And, Loki, you actually had a Step Mania cabinet that you helped build for a local arcade.
Tell us briefly, in a minute or so, what was your experience with that?
It was a pain in the ass.
Why?
What happened?
Just the computers.
Normal computers don't like
Um, normal, um, arcade cabinet environments.
In other words, they get too damn hot.
And, um, you know, at the time I didn't have the right tools to basically put a image on that type of a screen because the arcade screens run at, um, what they call CGA, which is a very low resolution, um, screen.
But it looks nice in the arcade because, you know, it's really old screen.
But, um,
It's a pain in the ass, let me put it that way.
But now within the groups, you know, arcade stuff, since they just run a PC anyways, you can actually buy a lot of the stuff from like third-party manufacturers and be able to create your own Stepmania cabinet really easy now.
And in fact, they actually built Stepmania builds meant for arcade cabinets.
So if you build a cool enough computer, and it's also hard too because you have to get the computer to turn on
with the actual cabinet stuff.
But if you can rig that all up, then yeah, it's pretty easy to do once you've got the setup.
Right.
To continue with the email.
Let me get to my main point.
I recently picked up a Nintendo DS and was hoping to pick up a copy of Final Fantasy 3 for it at the closest GameStop.
Now, well, I have a good reason to get all angsty about the franchise now seeing as how they didn't even have a copy in.
Before this, they sold me a defective 2DX game.
Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
That sounds like me.
So yeah, that's all I really have to say.
Still waiting to get a 360 or are we, me being the poor bastard I am.
You know what, I suggest, I don't really think it's the GameStop because they have the stock that they have at the time.
Use your phone, give them a call.
You know, I live close to three GameStops.
If I have been told by a GameStop rep previously, I'm too busy to look, come down here.
and that's when I decided I wasn't going to support that particular store anymore.
I realized that was that store and not the chain as a whole but that's when I realized I wasn't ever going to go down there ever.
Then again, usually I'll have to just say, hey, this is Dan's wife.
Well, you know.
But no, I actually... I don't get on the phone and go, I have a podcast on the internet so you damn well better help me or I'm going to talk shit about you.
No, I just call like anyone else does, you know?
Well, I mean, usually what I do is I call and then, you know, if it's one of the managers I've met before then I'll say, hey, yeah, it's me.
Hmm.
but um honestly though really if you I found a few people who are willing to look to say hey I'm you know I'm going to be coming by if you have this I'm going to be giving you money if you have this but you know I've been in a GameStop when it's busy and when they say they don't have time to look it means they don't have time to look they are that is the
And that is a fault of GameStop Corporate.
They do not want to give the hours they need to man the stores.
I'm not going back to that store.
It's not the manager's fault.
I teach customer service for a living.
I get offended when people do that kind of shit.
Well, I was in customer service for a while, too, and I know what I expect of myself.
Well, you know what?
If they're too busy at that one time, then obviously they're too busy to ring me up at the register.
Can I put you on hold?
And they could have one employee that's not necessarily working the register because not everyone has to be working the register at the time.
They have one employee to check on that.
Can I put you on hold?
They are supposed to put you on hold.
And they are supposed to have you on hold as long as you're on hold.
I walked right over to the next... You know what?
Instead, I walked right over to the next store.
Best Buy picked up my game, left.
In and out.
Very easy.
And that's where I bought all my games for a little while.
Well, you know, and it's not really, I think, so much the fault of the store managers.
Because having talked to a number of them, they're all like, we need more hours, we need more hours, we need more hours.
And it's corporate that's not giving it to them.
So blame them.
I don't know whose fault it is, but it sucks.
Last one comes from Neki.
I guess that's how it's pronounced.
Downloaded for the first time off iTunes and it's great.
Nice community feel to it.
I'm from the UK so can't do any of the live forums, etc.
Like to hear a few more stories about the UK.
We do our best.
I look when I can.
WePlay is already out in the UK.
In the last podcast you said it wasn't out but maybe that's only in the US.
We probably were talking about the US, because we're not getting it until February.
And I know we had a big story on the delay of Wii Play last week.
Whereas you guys, I think, you are just now getting Wii Sports, whereas we added it as a pack-in with our system.
So it's kind of interesting.
Anyway, looking forward to the next podcast.
Until next time, Neki.
I'm really, actually, I do try to look for UK-specific stuff.
More like Europe in general.
I...
I mean, honestly, I myself have a lot of love for the UK, and I want to make sure that our folks are covered.
Well, keep in mind, a big part of it is, too, is that a lot of stuff, you know, and I don't mean to offend or whatever, but a lot of stuff comes up in Japan and the US first, and then the UK just kind of gets it later.
Not to say that there aren't specific things to the UK, you know, obviously, and Jamie tries to stay on top of those, but it's just kind of the nature of the business is most of the business is done in Tokyo and in the Bay Area, you know?
So...
We try to keep tabs on release dates and things of that nature because we heart our international listeners.
But keep in mind, usually when games are under development and things, it is kind of over on this side.
But then again, they do get some games that we don't get, like mostly football.
Once in a while, once in a while.
Some of the games of that nature.
I try to keep my eyes open for specific ones.
So think of it this way.
Hey, at least if we're getting the games first, we can tell you which ones suck, and then that way you don't even have to blink an eye when they come out over there.
Exactly.
For what little it's worth, because we can't force the companies to change their schedules or whatever.
By the way, I think we had a slightly increased listenership this week, because iTunes had us, they have video games as their featured category in podcasts this week, and we're one of them that's in the little box, so that's kind of cool.
So, thank you iTunes!
Is that it for voicemails?
That would be it.
Alrighty.
You mean emails?
Oh yeah, emails, sorry.
Give them my voice!
1-877-GAME-OLR if you want to leave us a voicemail.
I want voicemail from some of our overseas listeners now.
That's true.
This listener could call our voicemail any time.
Now, don't use the 800, but you can go through Skype.
Oh, yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah, that's right.
International folks don't want to use it, unless you're Canadian.
Unless you're Canadian.
You can use the 800.
But download Skype.
You can actually just send us a message through the Skype line.
It's voice over IP.
It costs your internet connection.
That's it.
That's it.
So go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com and click on Interact With Us for more information.
It's all free.
All free?
Yes, please.
Excellent.
Well, getting back into some news here.
One thing that we talk about, especially in games and stuff, is all these ads.
And a big thing when we were doing the Battlefield 2142 stuff was that their advertisements had a little kind of a spyware feel to it.
Because they were picking up your IP and where you're located and
that kind of thing so they could target ads towards you.
Not a huge deal to some people, but a big deal to others.
Well, apparently it's a big deal to some California lawmakers.
California Assemblywoman Lori Saldana is going to be working on introducing a bill into state legislation that would halt companies like EA from including Spyware technology in games.
And, you know, they found, you know, certain...
methods used by these companies as particularly vile, as she puts it.
And definitely something that I'd like to see passed because, you know, I'm not sure.
I don't think it's on our show role.
We were talking about like advertising games and how it's not very effective.
And so, you know, gathering information from these companies and the EA is really bad on this, you know, especially with where you have to sign up and have your credit card information and stuff like that.
It's not good.
What I'm interested in is, you know, she seems to get it.
Yeah.
What, who is she?
How did she figure out about, I mean, is she a gamer?
No, it's just, I don't know, she just seems to get it.
Hmm.
Do we have, because, you know, one thing we felt like we don't, we haven't had much of in the political world is some type of pro-gaming champion, you know what I mean?
I don't mean like a professional gamer, but I mean like somebody who supports the video games and the gaming community.
We've certainly had a lot of anti-
I think she's kind of interested in, it's mainly privacy experts.
I see, so she's more of like an EFF type champion.
Yeah, and I think this just kind of relates a little bit to stuff like that.
And basically she's saying that it doesn't advertise it on the outside of the packaging and it contains the stuff.
It's like, you bought it and then, oh, by the way, we forgot to mention that, you know, that installing this will actually send us some private data.
And you need to do this in order to play the game.
I would just like to see someone who gets gaming in Congress, that's all.
Jamie, run for Congress.
Okay, pay my way.
Vote for Jamie, kay thanks.
Yeah, vote for Jamie, or die.
Alright, anyway, well that should be interesting to see what happens with that.
I think that's kind of cool.
I think it's something that should... I think the company should know they're going to be looked at if they're going to use these type of tactics.
So I support it.
I'm curious to see what the specifics of the bill will be.
Since this is our holiday episode, this last official story we have for you guys has to do with Bethesda and their big, big, big game, Oblivion.
They are giving away for Christmas a brand new expansion pack for Oblivion.
Well, it's not new, but it's...
It's a Christmas theme pack or whatever.
No, it's not a theme pack either.
It's one of the older expansions.
They dropped the price to free.
Oh, I thought it was a new one.
Oh, all right.
Well, whatever.
Maroon's Razor, which I guess used to cost money, it's now being offered for free.
Well, that sucks to everyone who bought it before.
Never mind.
These guys are grinches for doing that to those people.
Unfortunately, I have not played any of the Oblivion expansions.
I apologize for my mistake.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Tis the season.
And so I guess Nintendo is the Grinch after all, not putting out anything free.
Well, they did have the internet channel, so maybe not.
They did give you that, and the forecast channel, and coming up the news channel too.
But the internet channel, you know, is free.
So I guess we all got a little something for Christmas.
Now here's something I gotta mention though, and I'm not sure if you noticed.
Wii Connect 24, what the fuck does it actually do?
Because it sure as hell doesn't update my system.
It sure as hell doesn't download this new stuff automatically.
What the fuck?
I mean...
Well, at least you get that message.
That's, I don't know.
At least you have the message, right?
Nintendo sent you a little email that said the forecast channel is now available, right?
Yeah, great.
Good for them.
But it's not, you know, this WeConnect24.
It's always connected to the internet.
No, it's always connected, but it's not doing anything.
All right.
Well, we have another segment here before we close out the show and that would be DarkSakura who likes to surf the internet up and down and left and right and all that be a select start kind of stuff.
She finds a website that she must share with all of you guys and it's called DarkSakura's Website of the Week.
And we have happy music.
So this week's website better be happy.
I didn't do crap to find it, you told me about it.
Oh goody, you used my pick.
I made a suggestion, and it got picked.
I'm so excited.
Weekitty.com, W-I-I-K-I-T-T-Y dot com.
This site is crack.
It has a gallery of cats and wees, and it's so cute.
You can see the kitty.
So it's like stuff on my cat, but with Wii controllers?
Yeah.
That's awesome.
This is fantastic.
I need to do one with Shermie.
And on top of that, they actually say Happy Caturday, which makes me think of 4chan.
So, yeah, this is cute.
I'm going to submit Shermie on WeKitty.
I'm going to go look at WeKitty on my Wii and bookmark it as a favorite.
I actually have Shermie snuggling up to an Xbox 360 controller.
There you go.
Well, you should make 360kitty.com.
No, I'm not going to pay for the domain.
They're cheap.
I'm poor.
Loki, you can do it.
I can do it.
You know, you should put, like, PS3Kitty.com and have PS3 crushing the cat because it's so good.
I got it.
CatBox360.
And have, like, do, like, litter boxes up like an Xbox.
That would be rad.
I did notice that WeKitty did use the opportunity to give a big fat plug for the people who made it their own personal little game review site.
So, you know, we could use...
360 Kitty or whatever is a big plug.
I don't know.
I want to jump on the bandwagon.
How about Xbox Puppy?
Where's the love for the puppies?
Puppies are stinky.
And they require too much attention.
I would admit that I'm a cat person over a dog person, but I do think puppies do deserve a little bit of love.
How about DSGirbles.com?
Lovehamster.com.
There you go.
With a P.
Pro Evolution Sucker 6 Hey
Pro Evolution Soccer 6 is now a demo on Xbox Live Marketplace.
It's the rival of FIFA 07.
It's only available for Xbox Gold, but it will be available to Silver on the 29th, and it's a 1.31 gigabyte game.
Tell us what's on it, because we don't know.
I'm not a football girl, but
Isn't this the same one we saw an early build of at the Panami BBQ?
It looked pretty hot.
For soccer.
Not that I'm necessarily... Okay, I have to say, I do love football.
A little bit.
But not... You're a rugby girl.
No, no.
When I say football, I mean soccer.
Because American football is shit.
Pure and simple.
Sorry, it is.
It's crap.
It's a crap sport, and it's just crap.
More people would probably watch football if they had cheerleaders like American football.
Yet it seems to be the most popular sport in this nation.
Yeah, and the rest of the world says, screw you, that's stupid.
We like real football.
And it gives me an excuse to watch men in shorts.
I like basketball.
Yeah, but you know what?
The rest of the world may be all about this metric system, but hey, we're too good for that.
It's all about fucking base 12 systems.
Hell yeah.
You mean the Imperial system?
Yeah.
Well, doesn't it sound better, or doesn't it sound much nicer to hear that it's only, you know, it's 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside?
Doesn't it sound so bad as, you know, negative two!
Anyway, forget it, never mind.
Well, there's another one as well.
Nintendo... For the record, I agree, the metric system is better.
to get that on record.
Nintendo has stated that the reports that came out of France saying that Wii Sports 2 is already in development is quote, a rumor and speculation.
But pretty good speculation of that, honestly.
Well, NGC France reported that there was one that might include swimming, basketball, a few other sports.
The quote, though, coming from Nintendo, was really pleased with the reaction to Wii Sports.
From people completely new to gaming, to the hardcore fans, everywhere has taken to it straight away.
That's a quote from one of the Nintendo UK spokespeople.
And they're actually speculating it might be the most popular game.
Interesting.
No love for Wii Soccer.
Dude, that would be cool.
Would you kick your controller around there?
I know.
How would you do that?
You put your controller in the ball moat.
Well, it detects directions.
That's a great idea.
Then people can kick the ball around the house because the Wiis aren't breaking enough things around the house as it is.
Kick a ball through the window.
Real smart, Jamie.
A winner is you.
Was I serious?
No.
Partially.
No.
I mean, it was kind of, like, it was stupid in the gameplay value, but, like, getting to chop people's arms and legs off and then they still have to fight with no arms or legs was really funny.
Playfighter, man.
Get your arms off.
All right, Loki, you have any last-minute stories for us?
Of course I do.
So, the story came out.
Apparently, there's a way modifying your own DVD firmware in your own CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive on your PC.
You're able to rip Wii discs.
So, now...
Pirates have won yet another battle.
It's only a matter of time before we see pirated games being run on the Wii.
Until Nintendo says, oh, you want that news channel?
That's what they'll use Wii Connect 24 with the updates.
They'll just silently push out the updates that'll patch that kind of shit.
Well, they haven't done it yet.
We'll see.
And who says I have to connect it to the internet while I'm playing these games?
And to be honest, if they can burn them the exact same way as the discs are burnt now, they'll never know.
We'll see, we'll see.
Anyways, that being said, let's see here.
Also, it's kind of funny.
You know how if you register three games with Nintendo that you get a free three-month trial to Nintendo Power?
Well, apparently the folks at GoNintendo.com found out that the Wii Internet channel counts as a game, and now they get a free subscription.
Hooray.
That's kind of funny.
Does it really?
I didn't.
I mean, I have my subscription all the time.
I actually have all my Nintendo products registered in Nintendo.
It's a lot now because of those stinking virtual console games.
I have the virtual console tied to my Nintendo account and you get credit for all those games you download.
I really wish here in the US they did some type of reward systems like they did in the other countries.
If you're using the Wii browser and find that you really want tabbed browsing in the Wii, well, fear not.
The website has actually figured out a way to do that.
If you want to browse tabbed
websites, you can check out team-dsx.net slash ds slash basic.php.
And apparently this was used for the Opera Browser on the DS, but can also be used for the Wii Opera Browser to add tab to the browsing functionality.
I don't want tab browsing so much as I want support for my USB keyboard.
That would be nice.
Anyways.
and of course since there was the free Gran Turismo HD demo being put out there actually ended up leaking a little bit early on the PlayStation 3 network and crashed it because it was more than it could handle which is kind of fun.
That's funny.
We mentioned that Bethesda is putting out the free Oblivion expansion or I should say dropping the price on it but more
Test Drive Unlimited Test Drive Unlimited
McLaren, F1 GT, Dodge Viper, SRT 10, Coop, and many more.
So that's kind of cool.
They've also got a free Forza Motorsports Showdown trailer, which is available on both Canada and US Xbox Live.
And then also three different Command & Conquer Tiberian Wars trailers
Thanks for watching!
I'm kind of surprised it wasn't that bad.
And keep in mind, I'm not as attached to Transformers.
I haven't seen it yet.
You haven't seen the Transformers?
Oh, my God.
I've been busy.
Right after the show is over, I'm going to download that sucker in HD so she can see it.
Oh, I have it in HD already.
Go to Apple.com.
It's not Apple.
No, they have it on Apple's site, don't they?
No, it's not on Apple.
What?
It's on Yahoo.
You lie.
I don't lie.
Anyways, so, speaking of the trailer, apparently there was some interesting stuff shown during the trailer between the 37 second and 39 second mark on there.
There's a frame that shows Sector 7 Org at the top and Takara 83 at the bottom.
And apparently, that if you go to Sector7.org and enter in Takara83, it starts an ARG.
So a brand new alternate reality game tied in with the Transformers thing, a new viral campaign.
And then when you solve it, you get forwarded to All I Want for Xmas is a PSP.com.
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah, that'd be funny.
No, but it's a brand new start, so definitely worth checking out, I guess.
Alrighty.
Oh, and I'd like to also mention, you know, just the kind of,
Start the show the way I ended it, or end the show the way I started it.
1UP is reporting Earth Defense Force 2017 is coming to the U.S., and I do believe I mentioned that on an earlier podcast.
So humble, the great and humble Loki.
All right, that's it.
It's only a one-part show tonight, because the holiday and the pre-tape and everything.
So this is the part of the show where we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
And I'll start tonight.
My final thought is...
January 22nd and Heroes returning to TV.
I can't wait.
It's too long.
At least I have some Kiefer Sutherland to hold me over.
Let me know when my man is on that show so I can come watch it.
He's supposed to be on the first episode.
So when is that?
January 22nd, so you better watch the first 11 before that.
What night is that?
Monday.
I have school.
Damn you.
And on the eighth day, the Lord gave us TiVo.
I need new lungs and reject false icons Loki?
My final thought is I'm not buying any more Ubisoft games
I want to get somebody from that company on the show so bad.
I want a one-on-one with Loki.
All right.
