4
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:26,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio here on this special New Year's Eve special leading on into the year 2007.

5
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:32,260
[SPEAKER_15]: We're bringing on some special guests from all across the independent gaming voice community.

6
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:41,143
[SPEAKER_15]: We have some bloggers and other podcasters and folks who do other live shows and even dipping in and having some guests from the sci-fi and geek world coming in as well.

7
00:00:41,403 --> 00:00:44,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's where our next guest comes from, yes, DarkSakura?

8
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely comes from geek world.

9
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:47,805
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Travis from Travis Donovan Live.

10
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:55,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Thunderstorm Warning, Tornado Watch

11
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:23,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh fun!

12
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And no power.

13
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:26,702
[SPEAKER_15]: No video games for you then today.

14
00:01:27,723 --> 00:01:29,264
[SPEAKER_15]: No, and I just got my Wii today.

15
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:32,706
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, how did you finally get a Wii?

16
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:44,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Went to EB Games of all places, and just randomly, after stopping at GameStop, and asked GameStop first, and they said no, they had PS3's in, but not Wiis.

17
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:47,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Went to EB Games and said, hey, do you got a Wii?

18
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:50,499
[SPEAKER_10]: And the guy just looked at me and went, yeah.

19
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, hook me up, my brother.

20
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:53,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Random stroke of luck.

21
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,096
[SPEAKER_15]: What games did you get for your Wii?

22
00:01:56,217 --> 00:02:00,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I got Rayman, the rabid one that everybody hates.

23
00:02:01,698 --> 00:02:04,618
[SPEAKER_15]: We've heard some pretty good things about that from some of the other guests we've had on the program.

24
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,839
[SPEAKER_10]: I figure if everyone else hates it, then I'm going to love it.

25
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:09,459
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

26
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then we definitely want to know your opinion on some of the best and worst in 2006, because if your opinion is the opposite, then that should be kind of interesting.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,381
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have ten boxes left.

28
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:20,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Please pick a box, one through ten.

29
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,876
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we'll go with lucky number seven.

30
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:26,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Lucky number seven, here we go.

31
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:27,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's open the box.

32
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:35,979
[SPEAKER_15]: And the category we want to know your opinion on is best game to play online.

33
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:39,040
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the best game to play online in 2006?

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's going to be difficult, seeing how I didn't play a lot online and it would have been 360 only.

35
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,662
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm going to take a book.

36
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:57,217
[SPEAKER_10]: or a page from my family here and I'm going to go with what they play online all the time and it has to unfortunately be the soul-stealing Final Fantasy.

37
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, Final Fantasy 11 then on 360, right?

38
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

39
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, on PC.

40
00:03:04,863 --> 00:03:06,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, they're still playing PC.

41
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:11,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're going to have to say the 360 version because the PC one came out a couple years ago but the 360 one was this year.

42
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, well then let me change my damn answer.

43
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,652
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, all right, all right.

44
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:16,032
[SPEAKER_10]: What then?

45
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:19,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Best game this year to play online?

46
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what the hell, Gears of War.

47
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Gears of War!

48
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Very popular choice.

49
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Any particular reason why you chose Gears of War?

50
00:03:30,434 --> 00:03:34,096
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it for the 360 and I played it online like twice and it was fun.

51
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:36,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you played the co-op mode?

52
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:42,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear a lot of people, I think the reason why a lot of folks really enjoy Gears of War is because of the co-op.

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And not a lot of games encourage co-op.

54
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:48,441
[SPEAKER_10]: I would play with you, Travis, at some point.

55
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's just kinky and wrong.

56
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,420
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, then, fine.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,581
[SPEAKER_15]: The choice stands as it is, and I'm not going to play online with you.

58
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,382
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, then how about this news topic?

59
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,423
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be very curious to know your opinion on this.

60
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:19,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Earlier this year, there was a TV station that used to represent gamers a long time ago that changed their slogan earlier this year, and that was G4 Television, and their new slogan as of earlier this year was, We Get Guys.

61
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:22,408
[SPEAKER_15]: You ever watch a G4 TV, Travis?

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:34,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, I have accidentally stumbled upon it because on my channel listing it's awfully close to BBC America and stuff like that.

63
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,234
[SPEAKER_10]: So I accidentally tuned into it.

64
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:36,654
[SPEAKER_15]: I see.

65
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:40,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you ever watch G4 Tech TV back in the day, right when they first merged?

66
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:46,562
[SPEAKER_10]: In its heyday, well actually before it merged, Tech TV was the bomb.

67
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,745
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the shiznit, as they say in the ghetto.

68
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,147
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the best thing ever.

69
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,295
[SPEAKER_10]: for geeks and gamers out there.

70
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Then when G4 took over, it was fine.

71
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: It was okay.

72
00:04:57,878 --> 00:05:04,463
[SPEAKER_10]: There was some bumps in the road, but unfortunately now it is what I like to call a partial birth abortion of a network.

73
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:05,864
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

74
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:06,464
[SPEAKER_15]: What went wrong?

75
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:14,070
[SPEAKER_10]: They have no idea or concept of how to program a network around gaming and technology.

76
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:20,835
[SPEAKER_10]: They're too ratings conscious, and unfortunately they have a talent pool

77
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:27,845
[SPEAKER_10]: which makes a West Virginia gene pool look like genius status.

78
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:34,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think that there's a need out there for a video game network or do you think online kind of fills that void?

79
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:37,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the internet of course fills it.

80
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:39,415
[SPEAKER_10]: It fills it extremely well.

81
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:47,342
[SPEAKER_10]: There are tons of sources whether you've got your GameSpot, your IGN, your 1UP, your Joystick, whatever.

82
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,232
[SPEAKER_10]: and print-wise, magazine-wise, you also have a plethora of magazines you can buy.

83
00:05:55,633 --> 00:06:18,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Television-wise, it would be good to have somebody or a network that wasn't jockeyed one way or the other by advertising dollars to sort of twist their slant on gaming in the industry because I'll tell you right now, you can tell on G4 that the almighty dollar really does affect some of what they say on that network

84
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a big fan of that network.

85
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:30,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what they've done to my holy grail, which is Star Trek, is ridiculous and stupid with that whole 2.0 shit.

86
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:32,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Pardon my English.

87
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're showing cops.

88
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:38,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

89
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:42,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I was flipping the other day and I saw cops on there.

90
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,701
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, wow, it's very interesting.

91
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:49,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you think then people continue to, in the gaming world, care about G4?

92
00:06:50,570 --> 00:07:01,939
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, I've noticed that once in a while game blogs and game sites run these stories on G4 television, and I can't help but personally wonder, and I know we've talked about it on our own program previously, why do people continue to care?

93
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:08,244
[SPEAKER_15]: If G4 is not giving the gamer world what we need, why is the gamer world continuing to give them free press?

94
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:13,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so long as you have any type of mass media outlet,

95
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,152
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody is going to try to take advantage of as many of those outlets as possible and G4 is one of those.

96
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:32,677
[SPEAKER_10]: You have the talking heads on that network which are there to shield their products and that's why people still care unfortunately about G4.

97
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:42,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I do find G4, I give G4 credit to be one of the very few Americanized networks

98
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:58,548
[SPEAKER_10]: that actually employ a she-male, Morgan Webb, and a spasmodic schizo with severe bipolar disorder, Adam Sessler, and the rest of their lineup.

99
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:06,733
[SPEAKER_10]: And I love how they steal British interactive television game shows and claim them as their own, i.e.

100
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:11,876
[SPEAKER_10]: that late night video game or that game call-in show that they do.

101
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:22,649
[SPEAKER_10]: which is a steal from a British show that they do over there.

102
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:33,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So long as they're on the air, game companies will use them as an outlet to show their products because the attention span of the American public is that of a fruit fly.

103
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:34,464
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

104
00:08:35,005 --> 00:08:36,626
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll get their media anywhere they can.

105
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:41,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we here at Orange Lounge have given them too much air time as it is, so we need to move right along to the next topic.

106
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,670
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you for your input.

107
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,992
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think was the best video game of 2006?

108
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,953
[SPEAKER_15]: We're tallying it up tonight.

109
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:55,879
[SPEAKER_10]: The best game of 06, again, I'm going to fall back on, is Gears of War, just because it took the first-person shooter.

110
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,102
[SPEAKER_10]: It really didn't ratchet up a notch as far as the style of gameplay.

111
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:03,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still the same run, duck, cover, shoot, but...

112
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:11,317
[SPEAKER_10]: The graphics quality, I think it's the first true game of 06 to take advantage of the next-gen console.

113
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:17,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the other next-gen console, the PS3.

114
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:27,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't throw the Wii into the category of next-gen because graphics-wise it's the same, but the 360 and the PS3, you're finally seeing the developers get a hold of this, and I'm looking forward to 07.

115
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:33,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Wii tries to classify itself more as a new-gen than next-gen, so...

116
00:09:36,313 --> 00:09:43,615
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wii is definitely revolutionary and it is going to be fun to play and it's going to be innovative and it's going to be fun to see how publishers take advantage of that as well.

117
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,596
[SPEAKER_14]: What was your worst game of 2006?

118
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God.

119
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,737
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have enough time on the show.

120
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:58,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go from a standpoint of a letdown as far as genre is concerned.

121
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,801
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have to be Star Trek Legacy.

122
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,760
[SPEAKER_10]: Ooh, wow, why Star Trek Legacy?

123
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:19,989
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not so much, the story, the single player story missions are incredible, and they're fun, and the graphics are great, and it's great that you have the voice of all the captains, and that part's wonderful.

124
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:29,135
[SPEAKER_10]: What's killing this game from being as hot as Bridge Commander was on the PC, and as I went into it on my show, is...

125
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,250
[SPEAKER_10]: The multiplayer on this game literally sucks.

126
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it sucks big floppy donkey dongs.

127
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Half the time you can't even get into a game.

128
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:44,013
[SPEAKER_10]: You get kicked out.

129
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:45,474
[SPEAKER_10]: The connections are horrid.

130
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:49,015
[SPEAKER_10]: The lag times are not bad when you finally get a game.

131
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:51,155
[SPEAKER_10]: But the problem is getting a game.

132
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,197
[SPEAKER_15]: You think it's possible maybe the developers will push a patch out that hopefully will fix some of it?

133
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,963
[SPEAKER_10]: They were quick to push a patch out for the multiplayer on the PC.

134
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,926
[SPEAKER_10]: They literally had that out the same day it was released on PC.

135
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:13,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Legacy was a port from 360 to PC, so that was because they were having problems with GameSpy.

136
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,073
[SPEAKER_10]: GameSpy is well known for having compatibility issues with games anyways.

137
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,896
[SPEAKER_10]: If there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now.

138
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,551
[SPEAKER_10]: and I don't think.

139
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:30,313
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Bethesda Soft is just taking CBS Viacom's money and saying, here, we gave you three games.

140
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the money.

141
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:34,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck and thanks for all the fish kind of thing.

142
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:35,515
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

143
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:43,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I know Star Trek is something near and dear to your heart because you do the sci-fi program here on Orange Launch Radio on Saturday night, yes?

144
00:11:44,544 --> 00:11:46,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Not so much sci-fi anymore, but yes.

145
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:51,287
[SPEAKER_15]: What exactly can the fans expect to hear when they tune into Travis Donovan Live on Saturdays?

146
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:57,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's great, being the station manager and such as you are, keeping up to speed with the shows, Rob.

147
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I do throw a little sci-fi and geek into it, of course.

148
00:12:04,212 --> 00:12:12,935
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm now getting to the point where I'm so pissed off with the morons in television and the morons on the Internet that

149
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,796
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the angry, pissed off, motherfucking, hetero, white, middle-aged man.

150
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:44,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm not so much middle-aged, but for your listeners, I would be considered middle-aged.

151
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,892
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sort of what Travis Donovan Live is all about now.

152
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,573
[SPEAKER_10]: The tagline is putting reality back in its place.

153
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:57,794
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you looking forward to most in the geek world in 2007?

154
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:02,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Not necessarily games, but anything.

155
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:09,360
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm interested to see how well Vista plays out when Windows Vista releases.

156
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:12,565
[SPEAKER_10]: How well of an operating system that's going to be?

157
00:13:12,665 --> 00:13:18,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it just going to be fancy new graphics and user interface, or is it actually going to be something substantial?

158
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Because nowadays it's so easy to steal information and corrupt data via the Internet.

159
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:30,659
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just wondering how much more secure Vista is going to be.

160
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's already been hacked from what I understand, so that's not a good sign.

161
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:38,045
[SPEAKER_10]: The rest of technology, I mean, that's up in the air right now.

162
00:13:38,837 --> 00:13:41,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Things are moving at such a pace.

163
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,981
[SPEAKER_10]: It's always fun to see what the Japanese bring out.

164
00:13:44,001 --> 00:13:47,623
[SPEAKER_10]: They bring out robots to help the invalid.

165
00:13:48,024 --> 00:13:53,788
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hoping soon they'll bring out a robot that'll help wipe my butt because, again, I'm a lazy American and I don't like to do that.

166
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:59,212
[SPEAKER_15]: On that note, I think we should probably say goodbye.

167
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:01,593
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much for being on the program tonight.

168
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:02,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good.

169
00:14:02,974 --> 00:14:05,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's end the call on the brown note.

170
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:06,637
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

171
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,680
[SPEAKER_15]: or as we've called it on the show previously, the Brown Eye of Judgment.

172
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,662
[SPEAKER_15]: We shall have to go back to the archives for that one.

173
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,725
[SPEAKER_15]: TravisDonovanLive.com for more information on the program.

174
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:20,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Saturday nights here on Orange Lounge Radio and podcast on your own site too, yes?

175
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God, you remembered the URL.

176
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

177
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:28,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's my podcast via my site.

178
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm also on iTunes.

179
00:14:29,514 --> 00:14:29,795
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

180
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:31,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Search him out, Travis Donovan.

181
00:14:31,856 --> 00:14:33,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much for being here and best of luck to you in 07.

182
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:35,708
[SPEAKER_10]: No problem.

183
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully, you know, it'll be great.

184
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:52,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, for those that don't know, you know, if you go way, way back in the broadcast history of myself and DarkSakura, we actually started on a show with Travis.

185
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:57,460
[SPEAKER_15]: He did a long time ago called Understation Alive, and he's still pretty funny after all these many, many, many years.

186
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,062
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the fill-in person slash most frequent guest.

187
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:02,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and I was the...

188
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,979
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember making the calls to pay phones in Disneyland.

189
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:25,128
[SPEAKER_15]: How did the payphone calls go?

190
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone answered one.

191
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,310
[SPEAKER_15]: We did get one.

192
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,074
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I remember, we had somebody answer it once, and we actually had a conversation with them.

193
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,057
[SPEAKER_15]: But then we called back, and the call mysteriously dropped.

194
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:38,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were theorizing that the Disneyland police had tapped our conversation and dropped the calls.

195
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:41,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know Disneyland's got some scary security.

196
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,049
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point of it, though, is that they are presenting...

197
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why all the stuff that happens around the park is called behind the scenes for a reason.

198
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The employees are cast members.

199
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything there is sent to present something, and a phone call, they don't want to get in the way of that.

200
00:15:58,495 --> 00:15:59,196
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

201
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:03,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, speaking of craziness, our next guests are crazy, but in a good way.

202
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:04,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, DarkSakura?

203
00:16:04,778 --> 00:16:04,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

204
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:08,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Franz Sheeran and Ron Wickman from Destructoid.com.

205
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:23,315
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we are joined here now on our Orange Lounge Radio year-end special with one, two, three people joining us from the website destructoid.com.

206
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello, everybody, to Franz.

207
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:26,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Franz, you there?

208
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,416
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Franz from Destructoid.

209
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:29,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how you doing, Franz?

210
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:30,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Man of many words.

211
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:35,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And the voice you hear there is Ron, Graybush Workman.

212
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:36,518
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

213
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:37,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Graybush in the house.

214
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having us.

215
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:39,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a problem.

216
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,200
[SPEAKER_15]: And also joining us, say hello to Shir.

217
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:43,729
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, guys?

218
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:46,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't have anything to say.

219
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:46,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm boring.

220
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,530
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

221
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,871
[SPEAKER_15]: We often don't either, but we somehow fill three hours every week.

222
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:52,711
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so fucking laid back.

223
00:16:53,892 --> 00:17:01,013
[SPEAKER_15]: So, now you guys all, you know, you blog for the Destructoid.com website, but do you guys participate in their podcast as well, Podtoid?

224
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Occasionally.

225
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:03,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sometimes.

226
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:04,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Usually, Ron.

227
00:17:04,894 --> 00:17:07,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm usually, I'm turning into the comic relief for the show.

228
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They beg, but I'm like, you know, I have things to do, leave me alone.

229
00:17:12,043 --> 00:17:14,764
[SPEAKER_15]: How many bloggers do they have over at Destructoid?

230
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:19,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Because when I'm looking at the list of people, it looks like I'm looking at a picture of The Last Supper or something.

231
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,466
[SPEAKER_15]: There's so many people.

232
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:21,926
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we looking at?

233
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:25,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably mid to high 30s.

234
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, in January, we're maybe looking at over 40, hopefully.

235
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

236
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:30,309
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple more people.

237
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:40,912
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got well over a dozen people that post daily and consistently and stuff like that, and that's kind of our thing, what we're shooting for, is to update information, have

238
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Gregory, we made a joke last night.

239
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:47,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, we rarely own a website that posts at 3.30 in the morning every day.

240
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:50,750
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got people that are up all night messing around with stuff.

241
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,852
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys really are an army of robots when you say that.

242
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,374
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems that way.

243
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We're turning into the detoyed army, I guess.

244
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:05,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, we want to pick the army's brain here a little bit on some of the gaming topics in a little game we call Year in Review 2006.

245
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we have nine boxes left, because people have been plucking all the other boxes.

246
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:13,813
[SPEAKER_15]: And Franz, we'll start with you.

247
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Which box do you want to open up?

248
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:17,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Box 1 through 9, any one of them.

249
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,875
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a PS3 in it, I'm returning it, though.

250
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:21,295
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

251
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:22,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll go with 9.

252
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:25,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Box 9, let's take a look.

253
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:34,183
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to know, Franz, what did you think was the most creative game in 2006?

254
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.

255
00:18:36,244 --> 00:18:37,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Most creative game in 2006.

256
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:39,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

257
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:40,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Pinata.

258
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:41,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Pinata.

259
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:43,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, no, Ron's actually got a point.

260
00:18:43,728 --> 00:18:45,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the two games we played.

261
00:18:45,229 --> 00:18:46,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Viva Pinata.

262
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get a game where you re-rate the engine to make it look more kiddy, and it's mating animals that dance around for the whole game, that's pretty damn creative.

263
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:57,096
[SPEAKER_15]: You said there was two going around in your mind?

264
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,157
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the other one out of curiosity?

265
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:01,592
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that was just the only game around Morkman's Blotting this year.

266
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I see.

267
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Viva Pinata really for kids, though?

268
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:11,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know when I played it, I was like, if I was seven, my controller would be through the window right now.

269
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:12,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be tough for kids to understand it.

270
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,396
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Pokemon in the sense that anybody can enjoy it.

271
00:19:15,596 --> 00:19:17,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I played Pokemon, and that was a great game.

272
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:23,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, and this is stuff in Viva Pinata that my Greybush ass couldn't figure out how to do, that's for sure.

273
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I was getting frustrated with these vinyadas.

274
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking stuff up on the internet and people were feeling bad for me.

275
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:30,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, here, I'll send you a vinyada.

276
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, no, I want these damn mice to have sex.

277
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ron's in fucking Mensa.

278
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:38,425
[SPEAKER_15]: My vinyadas kept beating each other.

279
00:19:38,545 --> 00:19:40,646
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like Lord of the Wise.

280
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:41,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Horrible.

281
00:19:42,086 --> 00:19:43,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Those kept getting sick.

282
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:45,632
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Viva Piñata, most creative game.

283
00:19:45,912 --> 00:19:58,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Franz, the news topic we want to know your opinion on, and, you know, I don't know if you have any friends over in the UK, but it seems like one of the recurring themes in 2006 is that our buddies in the UK keep getting the shaft.

284
00:19:59,921 --> 00:20:01,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's been the story of their lives.

285
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,003
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely true.

286
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:10,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Why does Britain keep getting fucked over when it comes to release dates or, you know, system launches, prices of games?

287
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:11,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do they keep getting picked on?

288
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:15,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, yeah, I think it's a shame.

289
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, if Microsoft would jump on that and divvy up their sales a lot more, I think that would give them a lot more price.

290
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:22,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, didn't the Wii just come out?

291
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Wii couldn't even give them enough, though.

292
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,623
[SPEAKER_05]: They could barely do pre-sales over there.

293
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:29,364
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it came out like two weeks ago.

294
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, and they're waiting until March, I guess, to do the PlayStation over there?

295
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:35,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're not even going to get a taste of it.

296
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hell, half the United States isn't getting a taste of it now.

297
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:40,969
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, it's important to note, too, that they ban games that's kind of

298
00:20:41,497 --> 00:20:41,817
[SPEAKER_05]: PS2 PS2 PS2

299
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:11,126
[SPEAKER_15]: It was decent.

300
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:15,309
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I think the problem with Ruler Rose, it was a full-priced title, wasn't it?

301
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:16,710
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like a $49.99 they wanted for it?

302
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

303
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:21,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so, yeah, that was the biggest problem is because PS2, you know.

304
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:29,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's just Atlus because they're retarded and still think they can get $49.99 for a PlayStation 2 game at the end of its life cycle, so.

305
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:35,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, I guess if Square can get $59 for a collector's edition of Final Fantasy XII, which has nothing special.

306
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:36,884
[SPEAKER_15]: by the way, nothing special.

307
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:39,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy XII, I love this in Final Fantasy.

308
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,467
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a sexy game, I'll give you that.

309
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:48,790
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and it's actually GameStop that thinks they can get $59.99 for the special edition of Final Fantasy XII.

310
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:51,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they got it from me, but that's because I'm a corporate whore.

311
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:55,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Shira, it's your turn, why don't you pick a box?

312
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:56,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we have one through eight left.

313
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:59,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll pick number three.

314
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:01,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Box number three, let's open it up.

315
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:06,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Box number three.

316
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:07,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is a good one.

317
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:11,081
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you believe was the most disappointing game of 2006?

318
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:11,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

319
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:15,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to get a lot of flack for this.

320
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:19,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

321
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:20,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, snap.

322
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Zelda Twilight Princess?

323
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, because Zelda is the type of game where everyone's like, this game is better than unicorns fucking pixies.

324
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:30,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not.

325
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:32,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so great, and that would be great.

326
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:33,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about you guys.

327
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:34,112
[SPEAKER_15]: That's funny.

328
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:37,153
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly how I described it on the last episode of Orange Lounge.

329
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:37,753
[SPEAKER_15]: It's amazing.

330
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:43,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like... Everyone's like, this is going to be the greatest game ever, and then I played it and I was like, eh, this isn't the greatest game ever.

331
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:44,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

332
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:48,155
[SPEAKER_06]: My only little comment for that is it came out two years late.

333
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:49,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

334
00:22:49,932 --> 00:22:51,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the thing that makes it a disappointment.

335
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the problem for you?

336
00:22:53,453 --> 00:22:56,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that this is essentially a GameCube game with Wii controls?

337
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, that's not the problem.

338
00:22:58,113 --> 00:23:02,094
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that I don't really like Zelda that much.

339
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I like games in that genre.

340
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:06,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Ocarina of Time was okay.

341
00:23:06,315 --> 00:23:07,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Majora's Mask like Wind Waker.

342
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:10,095
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one is just like boring.

343
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no real character depth and I was just like, yeah, fuck this.

344
00:23:13,856 --> 00:23:16,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody else want to chime in on what they think the most disappointing game of 2006 was?

345
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:16,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh...

346
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:24,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Rare didn't come out, did they?

347
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't they just release Viva Pinata?

348
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:28,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Pinata?

349
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:29,325
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

350
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:30,967
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a Rare game.

351
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

352
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:34,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Nomadrome.

353
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Nomadrome for Xbox Live Arcade.

354
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:39,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Why Nomadrome?

355
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it was garbage.

356
00:23:42,376 --> 00:23:43,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It killed me.

357
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:43,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played it?

358
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't enjoy it, yeah.

359
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just, you look at it, it's like $10 for this thing?

360
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:58,080
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a really bad, like... I only played a few minutes, it was that bad that I was just laughing, but $10 for a game that's a real bad twisted metal?

361
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:58,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Red Steel 2.

362
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:02,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Steel was atrocious.

363
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:04,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you believe they greenlighted a sequel to Red Steel?

364
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:09,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because I think a lot of people were really looking forward to it, and really like...

365
00:24:09,804 --> 00:24:12,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking for all the new concepts and they're like, man, this is going to be the greatest game ever.

366
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:16,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ubisoft, when they released it, everyone was like, well, this isn't that good.

367
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:18,227
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of things you could do better.

368
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:25,130
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ubisoft's going to take that into account, make a better game with the similar core gameplay, and it's just going to be fucking awesome.

369
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:26,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I hope happens.

370
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:27,835
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

371
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:35,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Shir, the news topic I want to know your opinion on has to do with the price ranges for video game systems in 2006.

372
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:41,022
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard at one point that, even though I think most of us knew this was BS, but the Revolution was going to be $99.

373
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:44,043
[SPEAKER_15]: This is when it was still called the Revolution, not the Wii.

374
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:48,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And then suddenly it was $250, more reasonable, probably what we expected.

375
00:24:48,545 --> 00:24:53,868
[SPEAKER_15]: But then all the way up to $600 for the PlayStation 3 or $500 for the low end, depending on how you look at it.

376
00:24:54,168 --> 00:24:59,834
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've had systems cost anywhere at one point or another in theory or whatever it be, $99 to $600.

377
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:07,761
[SPEAKER_15]: How important do you think price is of these systems in the console wars that are going on here in 2006 and on into 07?

378
00:25:08,582 --> 00:25:11,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I got this topic because I'm broke as hell.

379
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,226
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just the perfect topic for me.

380
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:16,469
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a big factor for me when I'm buying systems.

381
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,052
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I don't have a 360 because I'm broke.

382
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:26,617
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like $400, and you can't play without live, really, and then it requires a yearly fee that I really don't have.

383
00:25:27,237 --> 00:25:29,398
[SPEAKER_06]: No, $400 live comes with it.

384
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:30,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut the hell up, Ron.

385
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You always miss that.

386
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,161
[SPEAKER_06]: You always see these press releases, and they're like, and then you've got to buy live.

387
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:36,782
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it comes with it for $400.

388
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:38,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, the gold package or whatever.

389
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:40,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who gives a shit?

390
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:42,625
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to play games online, you can play with silver.

391
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,866
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no difference aside from multiplayer games.

392
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,190
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have four people on your Xbox playing.

393
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, shut up.

394
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Gold's a better color.

395
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:52,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

396
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:54,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, yeah.

397
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:56,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, Wii's $250.

398
00:25:56,692 --> 00:26:01,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was going to be cheaper, so did everyone else, but I really didn't care, because I could scrape up $250.

399
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't scrape up $400, because I suck.

400
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:09,096
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, the PS3 is just way out there, and even if you wanted to go on eBay, it's like a grand.

401
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh,

402
00:26:11,223 --> 00:26:16,146
[SPEAKER_06]: For six dollars, go buy a cheap remote, spray paint it white, and spray paint your GameCube white.

403
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:16,726
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a Wii.

404
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:18,447
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't.

405
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:19,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither one of them can play DVDs.

406
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:20,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't argue with you, Ron.

407
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:22,789
[SPEAKER_04]: They both have subpar graphics.

408
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can't play Elebits on the GameCube.

409
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:26,651
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes a point.

410
00:26:27,972 --> 00:26:29,293
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to drop that?

411
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:32,875
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to push it out on the... I guess there wouldn't be any way to do it with controls.

412
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:33,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn right.

413
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just lost.

414
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we've got to keep it moving here.

415
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:38,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for your input.

416
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:41,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on over to Graybush.

417
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:42,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, great.

418
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Please be a question about how to get rid of crabs.

419
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:47,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Please be how to get rid of crabs.

420
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,258
[SPEAKER_15]: One through seven, take your pick.

421
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:50,919
[SPEAKER_15]: I will take number four.

422
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Number four.

423
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's open up case number four.

424
00:26:57,521 --> 00:27:00,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Best downloadable content for a game.

425
00:27:01,582 --> 00:27:02,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, content...

426
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god, you're going to rag on me on this one, but I hate to say this, but the damn UNO player packs.

427
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:12,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

428
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you a big Camp Nou cards fan?

429
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:21,440
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing I had the most fun with this year is all... Are you coming out of the closet, Ron?

430
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:21,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, man.

431
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Ricky Martin all over again with this.

432
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:27,805
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just... I can't... Best downloadable add-on to a game.

433
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:31,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Call of Duty map packs obviously were cool for me.

434
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I thought you said Uno.

435
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:33,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we were going with Uno here.

436
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:35,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just trying to think.

437
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, like, arguing back and forth here.

438
00:27:38,432 --> 00:27:43,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say Call of Duty map packs I probably had the most fun with, but the Uno stuff, like... I...

439
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,091
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

440
00:27:58,598 --> 00:28:08,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to be a tie between the stupid add-on packs that actually got me to play Uno and stay up all night with people bullshitting on there and the Call of Duty 2 maps.

441
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it have anything to do with the webcams on Uno?

442
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:15,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, that's one news story that didn't quite make our cut for being included tonight.

443
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:22,784
[SPEAKER_06]: When they first came out, it was really funny because there'd be three or four of us in a room and we'd be like, oh, look, yeah, there's somebody's ass.

444
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:24,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, look, somebody's boobs.

445
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:29,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, I guess the novelty wore off real quick, but it was a really funny thing.

446
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:38,960
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was cool because we would, like, I could sit on my back porch and smoke cigarettes and play Uno, because the controller vibrates when it's your turn, and Uno's so hard you just hit the A button.

447
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,241
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to look at the screen.

448
00:28:40,582 --> 00:28:50,571
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, every many nights I'd be sitting outside smoking a cigarette, couldn't even see, but I'd be chatting on my headset, hit the A. When the controller vibrated, I'd hit the button and it'd throw a card out there, because it doesn't matter, it's Uno.

449
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:57,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Playing UNO on live is weird for me now because I feel like I'm always playing against LonelyGirl15 with the webcam.

450
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:05,013
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's one of those things where I never expected to have fun ever, ever playing UNO.

451
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I never even expected to play UNO.

452
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:10,495
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we get in there, it's just a bunch of us friends and we bullshit and we have a good time.

453
00:29:10,535 --> 00:29:13,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not as much about UNO gameplay.

454
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:17,817
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember when we added the new decks to it, it changed the game, and we started playing with strategy.

455
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:20,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like we're actually playing fucking UNO.

456
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:25,529
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those type of things where somebody's done something right if we're actually playing Uno.

457
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:27,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, are you guys big on the shit-talking on Uno?

458
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, you know, drop four, motherfucker, and things like that?

459
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but it's always joking.

460
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:34,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Reverse bitch.

461
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:41,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of fun games, the news story we wanted to ask you about would be Guitar Hero.

462
00:29:41,315 --> 00:29:47,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we obviously had Guitar Hero 2 come out this year, which is the sequel to a monster hit last year.

463
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:55,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they announced, and this is still a bit of a rumor status, but that there's going to be a quartet of new Guitar Hero games coming out through the next year.

464
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:58,464
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the one on the 360 and so on and so on.

465
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Is too much Guitar Hero too much of a good thing?

466
00:30:03,388 --> 00:30:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never played it because it's a video game and it involves me dancing around with a plastic toy guitar.

467
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:15,815
[SPEAKER_06]: There is nothing that's ever going to be cool about a grown man dancing around with a plastic toy guitar.

468
00:30:16,095 --> 00:30:18,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I get you.

469
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:22,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Sitting on the back porch playing Uno smoking cigarettes is fucking rad, huh?

470
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:25,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Dancing around with a plastic guitar?

471
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,901
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be a rock star.

472
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:47,479
[SPEAKER_06]: is like the lamer version of DDR for me I know people love it and get into it but it's just like, you play it with a plastic toy it would be like me playing Call of Duty with a squirt gun, hiding behind couches Ron Workman's a communist Ron, out of curiosity Ron, have you ever heard of a Japanese game called Parapara Paradise?

473
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,482
[SPEAKER_15]: No Alright, just don't, don't ever look it up because you'll hate it Is it a rhythm game?

474
00:30:55,262 --> 00:31:03,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's based on this old Japanese style of dancing that was done by girls wearing these big tall boots, and they wave their hands around to Eurobeat music.

475
00:31:03,665 --> 00:31:06,585
[SPEAKER_15]: It's something to behold, I'll give you that.

476
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine is one of those things, like, I would never let someone see me in public playing DDR unless I was completely just wasted, drunk off my ass.

477
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:17,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when I see people playing DDR, I'm just like, you look ridiculous.

478
00:31:17,829 --> 00:31:21,910
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of those guys that's just like, look at that guy playing DDR, he looks like an idiot, and it's...

479
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:25,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always been like that, and Guitar Hero is kind of the same thing.

480
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not condemning it, but I can't see myself playing with a blast.

481
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:32,845
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the privacy of your own home when no one's looking?

482
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:34,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I would.

483
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:41,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like the Wii in a way, where if you play it at home, people are going to see it, and people like Ron won't want to play it, but the others will be interested, and they'll pick it up.

484
00:31:42,072 --> 00:31:46,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see the 360 sales doing well with it, but six months from now, I don't see it doing well.

485
00:31:46,455 --> 00:31:48,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they come out with the wireless guitar?

486
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:48,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

487
00:31:51,164 --> 00:31:54,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And that actually looks pretty tough, so maybe I'll get one when I do that.

488
00:31:54,506 --> 00:31:56,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, alright.

489
00:31:56,468 --> 00:32:00,571
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go around now and I'm going to ask everybody what they believe the best game of 2006 was.

490
00:32:00,771 --> 00:32:03,633
[SPEAKER_15]: And the worst game we hear at Orange Lounge Radio, we're tallying it up.

491
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll start with the best game.

492
00:32:05,134 --> 00:32:07,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Franz, what did you think the best game was of 2006?

493
00:32:08,896 --> 00:32:11,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Cliche, but Twilight Princess.

494
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:15,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Why Twilight Princess over everything else?

495
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Waiting for Shearer's answer now.

496
00:32:16,761 --> 00:32:19,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'll admit that it's not quite as good as I hoped.

497
00:32:19,542 --> 00:32:31,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the wolf part downplays it a little bit, but if you forget about that it's a Zelda game, and if you just pretend it was a completely new game, and you compare it to any other game from 2006, the gameplay is solid.

498
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,731
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not a lot to complain about.

499
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a high nine, so I don't think it will ever top it, not even Gears.

500
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:40,435
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a game that's topping a lot of people's list.

501
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:42,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Shearer, what did you think the best game of 2006 was?

502
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:46,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII, hands down.

503
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:47,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII.

504
00:32:47,394 --> 00:32:49,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That game just ripped me apart.

505
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:52,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it, I played it for like 20 hours in the first like three days.

506
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:53,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I just played it non-stop.

507
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that game.

508
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

509
00:32:55,681 --> 00:32:57,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you always been a Final Fantasy series whore?

510
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:00,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Or was XII kind of your enabler?

511
00:33:01,366 --> 00:33:03,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I played Final Fantasy VII, loved it.

512
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Played Final Fantasy VIII, fuck you guys, loved it.

513
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Played Final Fantasy IX, hated it.

514
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:10,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Hated FFX and hated everything else after FFX.

515
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So FFXII was kind of like... Which would be FFXI.

516
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:15,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, FF11 and then like the spin-off games.

517
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, true.

518
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,520
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just ever so crap.

519
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,781
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I deleted those from my brain.

520
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,382
[SPEAKER_15]: FF10-2 doesn't exist to me.

521
00:33:23,563 --> 00:33:31,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, you know, I really liked FF12, Rebirth of the Series, really interesting characters, amazing graphics, and I just loved it so much.

522
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:31,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.

523
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:34,649
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, dare I ask Ron Workman, best game of 2006?

524
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:37,531
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to make fun of me, but...

525
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:39,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Burger King, Sneak King.

526
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally fucking right.

527
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, it was the best value of 2006.

528
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:50,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Burger King games were three bucks, four bucks, whatever.

529
00:33:50,137 --> 00:33:54,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I could pay $4.99 or I could pay $5 for a new Rally-X.

530
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:56,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me think.

531
00:33:56,642 --> 00:33:58,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you're really going to lay into me.

532
00:33:58,623 --> 00:34:00,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually bought that shit, didn't I, when I was drunk.

533
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:02,625
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought Rally-X.

534
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:03,966
[SPEAKER_15]: So did I. Let's not tell anyone.

535
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:05,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron, best game.

536
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:06,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Out with it.

537
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember it when I was a kid, you know, playing with a big steering wheel and stuff.

538
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:13,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Gears of War.

539
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:17,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I really liked Viva Pinata and Call of Duty 3, I think, was underrated.

540
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:20,520
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd have to say, I mean, Gears of War, hands down, it's a no-brainer for me.

541
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,503
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I'm not into the fantasy games like Zelda or Final Fantasy.

542
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing against them, but I just... You're a gun fan.

543
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,748
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing game to me.

544
00:34:31,104 --> 00:34:32,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty 3 is the same way for me.

545
00:34:32,765 --> 00:34:34,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really immersive for me.

546
00:34:34,445 --> 00:34:35,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how they've changed it.

547
00:34:35,746 --> 00:34:36,286
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people...

548
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:01,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Call of Duty 3 definitely on your top 10 for the year at least.

549
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:32,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was a real late bloomer for me that I just wasn't expecting to be that good because I heard so much bad feedback.

550
00:35:32,186 --> 00:35:35,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Call of Duty 2 because I'm a big multiplayer fan.

551
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:38,007
[SPEAKER_06]: My worst game of the year?

552
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:39,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sure, why not?

553
00:35:39,168 --> 00:35:40,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go into worst game of the year.

554
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron, start us off.

555
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:42,249
[SPEAKER_15]: NovaDrome.

556
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:43,489
[SPEAKER_15]: NovaDrome!

557
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:46,030
[SPEAKER_06]: He smacked me in the face for making that game.

558
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,350
[SPEAKER_06]: They owe me $20 for playing the demo.

559
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,191
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I view it.

560
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:51,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm still pissed.

561
00:35:51,920 --> 00:36:00,402
[SPEAKER_15]: What was so... I mean, because I don't know if it's just me, but they really hyped up these end-of-year Xbox Live independent title releases that they were going to do.

562
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wasn't really impressed with any of them, even Assault Heroes.

563
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:05,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't really feeling.

564
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:09,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I was kind of like, I'd almost rather play Rally-X.

565
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:10,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten bucks, you know?

566
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:16,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rally-X, the deciding thing was like, I was like, I'll play this when I was a kid, whatever, you know, five bucks, no big deal, but...

567
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,927
[SPEAKER_06]: $10 on some of those games is a little tough for me to swallow.

568
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:22,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not that I'm tight with money about it.

569
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,553
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I could play the demo, like the Assault Heroes demo was pretty long, that's fine.

570
00:36:28,053 --> 00:36:31,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I've bought Pac-Man and Frogger and Galaga and all those, but Contra.

571
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:36,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Wii downloadable stuff?

572
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you pay $10 for an N64 game?

573
00:36:38,539 --> 00:36:46,389
[SPEAKER_06]: The last time I played a Wii was six months ago at a private show, and I've not played one since, and I'm not even seeing the virtual console stuff.

574
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what it's called, virtual console?

575
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:50,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

576
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:51,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not even seeing it.

577
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:57,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know about the pricing, and it disappoints me that Nintendo's doing that.

578
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:04,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess they can because their fans are, you know, I really hate to get into this, but Nintendo fanboys are pussies.

579
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,362
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys should stand up and fight.

580
00:37:07,943 --> 00:37:10,324
[SPEAKER_04]: You should fight Nintendo.

581
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:14,007
[SPEAKER_06]: You should fight Nintendo to make better shit.

582
00:37:14,147 --> 00:37:15,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo's never going to make better shit.

583
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:19,311
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to come out with subpar consoles and charge too much.

584
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:23,274
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Nintendo fans, you can address those cards and letters to Graybush, Care of Destruction.

585
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:25,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Run Graybush Workman, yeah, exactly.

586
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:39,013
[SPEAKER_06]: but no, it's one of those things where Xbox Live is genius and the reason it's genius is because people are absolute assholes to Microsoft and they're not scared to be if they're pissed, they will flame them to hell and back or write it on their blogs or whatever

587
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:42,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think maybe no one wants to stand up to Reggie because he'd kick your ass?

588
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:47,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo is this golden cow that nobody wants to, you know, they're on a pedestal.

589
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Nintendo can't do anything wrong, blah, blah, blah.

590
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,762
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some shit games out there on the Wii.

591
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:55,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody bitches about them like they would if it was a bad Xbox game, you know?

592
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:57,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

593
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:59,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki kind of went off on cars the other week.

594
00:38:00,009 --> 00:38:02,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it's pretty fair.

595
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:05,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And all the Ubisoft games suck ass.

596
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:08,776
[SPEAKER_12]: I have officially boycotted them for all their Wii launch titles.

597
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,115
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Rayman?

598
00:38:11,036 --> 00:38:16,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Rayman was just average, and that was their best game of the entire lineup.

599
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:17,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

600
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:26,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Rayman was my favorite, but I really wish that people would say, Hey, Nintendo, we don't want a system that only has the graphic power of an Xbox, an original Xbox.

601
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:28,864
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to be able to play DVDs.

602
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:33,026
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to have online multiplayer out of the box and launch games to back it up.

603
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:33,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Or maybe they don't.

604
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:36,718
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to pay $10 for a Mario Bros.

605
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:40,280
[SPEAKER_06]: game we've bought 20 times before.

606
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,101
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dicking their fans over.

607
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:52,365
[SPEAKER_06]: When you add all that stuff into what you spend to have games and play the Wii and to track down four controllers for the damn thing, it's not any cheaper than buying a 360.

608
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:55,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we've got to keep it moving.

609
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,147
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

610
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:57,847
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

611
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:01,409
[SPEAKER_15]: You just sound like you could go all day long on this Nintendo thing.

612
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:08,839
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll leave them to read the Destructoid.com blog to see your further love and adoration for all things Nintendo.

613
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Fight for your rights as a gamer.

614
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:14,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Shearer, what would you say is the worst game of 2006?

615
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:22,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Steel, because you asked me what the biggest disappointment of 2006 was when I said Twilight Princess.

616
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:25,475
[SPEAKER_04]: But Red Steel was the kind of game that I never really had expectations for.

617
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:28,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw it, I was like, that could be cool, but it's probably not going to be.

618
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:30,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played it and it wasn't.

619
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:31,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just so bad.

620
00:39:31,257 --> 00:39:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the multiplayer, like, I'm walking around, dinosaurs shooting me in the face.

621
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what the hell is this?

622
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,700
[SPEAKER_04]: The controls were terrible, the guns were terrible.

623
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hated it with a passion.

624
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:43,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the buzz about that a long time ago before it came out.

625
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, this is going to be really cool.

626
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,900
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can swing your sword around, blah, blah, blah.

627
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, multiplayer.

628
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, this is garbage.

629
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:55,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Y'all heard about that whole, like, they're going to call you and you put the Wiimote to your ear and everybody's like, that's such a cool idea.

630
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:56,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

631
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so retarded.

632
00:39:58,144 --> 00:39:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm playing it.

633
00:39:58,564 --> 00:40:03,446
[SPEAKER_06]: At the time, they were saying you were going to be able to use a microphone that was in the Wiimote because I played it a long time ago.

634
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:04,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that disappeared quick.

635
00:40:04,707 --> 00:40:05,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Which never came about.

636
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:05,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

637
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:26,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was, like, my friend got it, and I was like, dude, let's go play it, and we're playing it, and, uh, like, the multiplayer, as soon as you figure out how to use your stupid sword, like, you run up to people, and you're just like, they're dazed, and you just shoot them in the face, like, 45 times, and it's so annoying, because you can't kill anybody unless you're using your stupid sword, and, like, multiplayer's cheap, uh, and the stupid ring thing is retarded.

638
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Was the game just rushed, you think?

639
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:30,773
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just think it was atrocious.

640
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they don't know what they're doing.

641
00:40:32,614 --> 00:40:36,236
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they were working on it for months, fixing it, so I think it just couldn't pull it off.

642
00:40:36,376 --> 00:40:38,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were just like, yeah, fuck this game, this is terrible.

643
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:39,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what they did.

644
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:45,901
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you would think that they might be able to sell copies of Red Steel 2 if they just said, oh, Red Steel 1 was rushed, sorry, we'll make it better next time.

645
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:47,382
[SPEAKER_15]: But it wasn't.

646
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:48,002
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't.

647
00:40:48,022 --> 00:40:48,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just bad.

648
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:49,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

649
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:51,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Franz, what would you think was the worst game of 2006?

650
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:54,148
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's pretty easy.

651
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:55,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Armado.

652
00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:02,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game on the PSP, and all it is is you're an armadillo rolling around a mountain, and all you do is hit one button to jump at the right time.

653
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:04,051
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the entire $40 game.

654
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:05,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I shit you not.

655
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,772
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not even a homebrew.

656
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,773
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an actual... It's an actual game.

657
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:15,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like a small company's first game, so I hate to knock it, because, you know... You're making shit up to get out of this easy.

658
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows what you're talking about.

659
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:17,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

660
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:25,628
[SPEAKER_05]: It caught my eye in game trailers and I laughed my ass off at it.

661
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:32,293
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, funny enough, that's not, out of all the ones we've heard, that's not the first game somebody mentioned as the worst game that none of us had heard of.

662
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,594
[SPEAKER_15]: So, there you go.

663
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:36,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting to hear the rest.

664
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:41,599
[SPEAKER_15]: So is this why the PSP keeps getting flack for not having the same game power as the PSN?

665
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:42,320
[SPEAKER_05]: PSP's terrible.

666
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That should be my disappointment about 6.

667
00:41:45,282 --> 00:41:45,982
[SPEAKER_05]: They have good games.

668
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:46,703
[SPEAKER_05]: They just don't have enough.

669
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate the PSP.

670
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:50,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it right in front of me.

671
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:50,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate it.

672
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:51,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to throw it out.

673
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,392
[SPEAKER_04]: It cost me so much money, though.

674
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,174
[SPEAKER_15]: But Luminous, Metal Gear... Yeah, 360?

675
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, keep going.

676
00:41:58,495 --> 00:41:59,255
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

677
00:42:00,136 --> 00:42:00,496
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

678
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,018
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we got to wrap it up here.

679
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,862
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you guys have planned for 2007 over at Destructoid, if you can say?

680
00:42:08,302 --> 00:42:09,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of giveaways, that's for sure.

681
00:42:10,164 --> 00:42:11,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, super secrets.

682
00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:12,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of bitches.

683
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:15,127
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, lots of bitching, lots of prizes.

684
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,109
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to give away a Wii a week.

685
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're working on it.

686
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:20,468
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're shooting for right now.

687
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:26,030
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got a big contest going with the Lord of the Rings people, I think, at Microsoft.

688
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've got a big, big, big World of Warcraft thing coming at the end of the month.

689
00:42:31,912 --> 00:42:32,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

690
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:34,072
[SPEAKER_06]: So be sure to check it out.

691
00:42:34,312 --> 00:42:34,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Check it out, you guys.

692

[SPEAKER_15]: Destructoid.com for more information on all these giveaways.

693
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:41,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like you could just log into the site and win something free.

694
00:42:42,035 --> 00:42:45,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Podtoid.com for their podcast.

695
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:47,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you guys have any side projects you want to pimp out while you're here?

696
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:49,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

697
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Not me.

698
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

699
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:55,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron, do you want to print out your 45,000 of them?

700
00:42:55,712 --> 00:42:57,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't talk about them.

701
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Secrets about them.

702
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,793
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very good discreet peoples.

703
00:43:01,633 --> 00:43:02,174
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well.

704
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:04,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for having us, man.

705
00:43:04,574 --> 00:43:05,154
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

706
00:43:05,194 --> 00:43:06,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, dude.

707
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:06,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

708
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:08,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much for coming on, you guys.

709
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:13,437
[SPEAKER_15]: And best of luck to you guys at Destructoid, all 45 or how many of you there are over there in 2007.

710
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:15,993
[SPEAKER_04]: or three thousand of us.

711
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:38,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Big thanks to those guys over there at Destructoid.com for coming on the program and especially to Franz because originally him and I were on another show called Cross Platform together earlier this year which is why I remembered him and originally it was just going to be him that came on but he was like, dude, you want to get some more people on?

712
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:44,215
[SPEAKER_15]: So he got some of his co-bloggers over there at Destructoid.com to come on as well and that was a fun little interview.

713
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:49,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely need to check out more of their own podcast over there because I'm sure it's a riot so.

714
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So check that out over at Destructoid.com One of my favorite gaming blogs, by the way.

715
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:55,636
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean that.

716
00:43:55,896 --> 00:43:57,277
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best site address ever.

717
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:01,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I like their little robot icon that they work into everything.

718
00:44:02,218 --> 00:44:03,038
[SPEAKER_15]: So, pretty cool.

719
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:06,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, who's coming on next, DarkSakura?

720
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:07,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

721
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, I'm joined here now by Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

722
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:18,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Godfrey, you there?

723
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:20,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yup, I'm here.

724
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:20,955
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on, man?

725
00:44:21,055 --> 00:44:21,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, not a lot.

726
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:22,456
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

727
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:24,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything good, man.

728
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:25,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Big fan of the show, man.

729
00:44:25,879 --> 00:44:26,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Big fan.

730
00:44:26,479 --> 00:44:26,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

731
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

732
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,461
[SPEAKER_15]: We're big fans of you guys as well.

733
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:30,362
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys have come a long way.

734
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:34,165
[SPEAKER_15]: You're, what, going to be two years podcasting pretty soon?

735
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:42,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's going to be two years now in February, but I've been also recording before that around 2000, 2001.

736
00:44:42,632 --> 00:44:43,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to have a

737
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:48,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a fantasy star online radio show.

738
00:44:49,042 --> 00:44:52,826
[SPEAKER_09]: At that time, on the Dreamcast, it was like a big community.

739
00:44:53,286 --> 00:44:59,011
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also used to help out these guys, GamingNoise.com, Chip and Zach.

740
00:44:59,792 --> 00:45:00,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know all games, too.

741
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,915
[SPEAKER_09]: They used to do a radio show, too, at that time.

742
00:45:04,095 --> 00:45:04,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they were around.

743
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Just out of curiosity, Phantasy Star Universe was out this year.

744
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you kind of get on board with that?

745
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I was playing a lot of...

746
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:19,339
[SPEAKER_09]: for like a good month, but then, I don't know, I wasn't feeling it like how it used to be with the Dreamcast.

747
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:21,561
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like more strict.

748
00:45:22,221 --> 00:45:27,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Last time on the Dreamcast, it was like more open, and I don't know, it just, I don't know, it felt kind of different.

749
00:45:27,824 --> 00:45:31,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it was because of the next-gen consoles or, you know, I don't know.

750
00:45:31,926 --> 00:45:35,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wasn't too thrilled with the online gaming on that.

751
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:37,005
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

752
00:45:37,265 --> 00:45:38,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I want to ask you about this, too.

753
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:43,287
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys have had a lot of, like, Microsoft celebrities on your program this year, haven't you?

754
00:45:44,267 --> 00:45:45,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, a lot.

755
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:53,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Recently, we had an Xbox Community Awards, and we had a lot of people from the Xbox community, a lot of podcasters in there.

756
00:45:53,610 --> 00:46:01,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, people from Microsoft came to the show to help us out and, you know, just thank the community that has been helping out throughout the years.

757
00:46:02,612 --> 00:46:22,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Major Nelson was there, Trixie, Peter Moore was also part of it, Aaron Greenberg It's been a great year for us, man We've been busting our butts big time this year I want to thank everybody from Microsoft for helping us out Yeah, it sounds like it's really paid off for you guys So congratulations, those are some big names to have on your show

758
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:24,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.

759
00:46:24,873 --> 00:46:26,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if we could do it, anybody could do it, you know?

760
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's just got to be dedicated, man.

761
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:29,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

762
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:37,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to ask you this as well, because your show is mostly centered around Xbox, but do you play Nintendo Wii, PlayStation?

763
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:38,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you play the other consoles, too?

764
00:46:39,123 --> 00:46:39,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I have.

765
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:47,869
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, I was camping out, man, trying to get the Nintendo Wii during launch day.

766
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:50,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in line for at least 12 hours, man.

767
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:52,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing that here and there.

768
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I've only been playing Zelda for the Wii.

769
00:46:58,181 --> 00:47:01,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I downloaded a couple of Virtual Console games, too.

770
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just waiting to see if I can have more games in 2007.

771
00:47:08,471 --> 00:47:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: and Winnie for WarioWare.

772
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:12,734
[SPEAKER_09]: I played that too in the Nintendo Party.

773
00:47:12,754 --> 00:47:15,236
[SPEAKER_09]: They were here in Miami a couple months ago before launch.

774
00:47:16,096 --> 00:47:16,937
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked that game a lot.

775
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:18,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I got to play WarioWare E3.

776
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,799
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one of the few games that didn't have a mile-long line.

777
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:21,460
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty fun.

778
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a good time with it.

779
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:23,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's different, man.

780
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:27,964
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cool to get a group of people to play together in there, you know?

781
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:32,847
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different than the other games in the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox.

782
00:47:33,128 --> 00:47:37,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that game's going to show us just why the Wii is a party console just as much as the GameCube.

783
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:40,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, I think so too, man.

784
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:51,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Godfrey, we've got to get to the game we're playing here, which is the year 06 in review, and we've started off with 15 boxes, but now we only have 6 left, so please, pick a number 1 through 6.

785
00:47:51,948 --> 00:47:56,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so tell them what's going on for this year, man.

786
00:47:57,713 --> 00:47:59,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you've got to tell me what's going on in 2006.

787
00:48:00,235 --> 00:48:02,237
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to pick one of these boxes, 1 through 6.

788
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:06,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me pick number one.

789
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:08,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds pretty cool.

790
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:09,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one.

791
00:48:09,714 --> 00:48:10,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's open it up.

792
00:48:11,535 --> 00:48:12,015
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

793
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:14,436
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

794
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:15,677
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to know your opinion.

795
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:19,039
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think was the best handheld game in 2006?

796
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, handheld.

797
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:24,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, that's a good one.

798
00:48:26,023 --> 00:48:27,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing a lot of BS.

799
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:30,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to say, in my opinion...

800
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing was really cool.

801
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:35,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing that a lot.

802
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:37,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see what else I've been playing.

803
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Luminous, also from the PSP.

804
00:48:39,997 --> 00:48:42,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that came out, was it last year that came out though, right?

805
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,620
[SPEAKER_15]: But you did have Luminous 2 this year.

806
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't played it, but I've been playing a lot of Luminous from the Xbox 360.

807
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:52,188
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so out of all those games you played, which one would you say was the best?

808
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Which version, from the Luminous or...

809
00:48:57,785 --> 00:48:59,226
[SPEAKER_09]: on PSP or the Xbox?

810
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:03,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, for any handheld system, which game would you say was the best?

811
00:49:03,489 --> 00:49:04,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Animal Crossing, man.

812
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:06,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a lot of fun with Animal Crossing this year.

813
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing that a lot, a lot.

814
00:49:08,673 --> 00:49:12,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, yeah, I mean, that's the only game I've been playing a lot on the handheld this year.

815
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:13,817
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty addicting.

816
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:21,362
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you can go online with it and, you know, go visit other people's towns and it seems like it doesn't really end ever, that game.

817
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:24,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, not only that, it's based on real time, too.

818
00:49:24,424 --> 00:49:25,065
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like,

819
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:31,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I wake up and I'll be like, alright, it's daytime over here and I could go online and I might go to somebody else.

820
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:33,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The time is ahead in their town.

821
00:49:33,993 --> 00:49:40,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say somebody from maybe Europe or Japan and their town is based on their time.

822
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:42,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, oh man, it's nighttime over here.

823
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:42,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me check it out.

824
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:47,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's cool because I know Animal Crossing has a great community too.

825
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:53,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you've been checking out this couple of websites called AnimalCrossingCommunity.com

826
00:49:54,581 --> 00:50:00,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, people can exchange their friend codes and exchange items and help each other out and stuff.

827
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:01,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I find that really cool, man.

828
00:50:01,948 --> 00:50:05,471
[SPEAKER_09]: It's different from a lot of other games handheld.

829
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:08,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

830
00:50:08,654 --> 00:50:11,597
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unique and it has a huge community behind it.

831
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:16,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that game was in the GameCube, but one thing that was missing was the online part.

832
00:50:16,488 --> 00:50:17,490
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

833
00:50:29,378 --> 00:50:30,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, for sure, man.

834
00:50:30,919 --> 00:50:34,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but get ready, because I'm going to go to your town and do the same.

835
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,460
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, sounds good.

836
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,942
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to get your opinion on a news story as well.

837
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:43,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course, we're going down the highlights of 2006, and I've got to say, you've got a good one here.

838
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:49,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, you have an audio Daily Double here for the news story, so let's go to the audio.

839
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:52,927

[SPEAKER_08]: and the consumers are ready.

[SPEAKER_01]: Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.

844
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer!

845
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:18,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.

846
00:51:19,129 --> 00:51:21,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's this giant enemy crab.

847
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:23,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Ridge Racer!

848
00:51:24,528 --> 00:51:28,351
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mew attack its weak point for massive damage.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ridge Racer.

850
00:51:30,753 --> 00:51:32,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer.

852
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:35,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Giant enemy crab.

853
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:36,277
[SPEAKER_08]: 599, 599, 599 US dollars.

854
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:36,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Ridge Racer.

855
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:37,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Ridge Racer.

856
00:51:51,101 --> 00:51:51,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that's right.

857
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:58,043
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Sony's infamous press conference from E3 where they got taunted incessantly afterwards.

858
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:02,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Godfrey, were you at E3 this year watching it online?

859
00:52:02,764 --> 00:52:07,365
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, I got together that day during the press conference.

860
00:52:08,565 --> 00:52:11,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also part of Xbox MVP from Microsoft.

861
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:17,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of community members that got invited to E3.

862
00:52:17,327 --> 00:52:20,608
[SPEAKER_09]: We were there having a couple meetings talking about the Xbox and

863
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:29,794
[SPEAKER_09]: All of us got together and we wanted to see the press conference of Sony because that's when they were announcing the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii during E3.

864
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:36,979
[SPEAKER_09]: We were watching it and it was very, very boring, the presentation.

865
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:44,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Nintendo did a really good job this year presenting the Wii and also Microsoft with the Xbox 360, but I don't know.

866
00:52:44,643 --> 00:52:46,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Sony was just straight up boring.

867
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:46,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I

868
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:50,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why it was the hype of the system.

869
00:52:50,648 --> 00:52:53,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody was like, oh my god, the graphics are going to be amazing.

870
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: And look, ever since E3, that happened.

871
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:02,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Look now, they've been getting a lot of bad press ever since.

872
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:05,477
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think caused all that bad press?

873
00:53:05,537 --> 00:53:06,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it the price tag?

874
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:08,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it the giant enemy Krabs line?

875
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:09,299
[SPEAKER_15]: The Ridge Racer?

876
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,340
[SPEAKER_15]: What caused all the bad press, do you think?

877
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:14,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everything combined.

878
00:53:14,342 --> 00:53:16,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the most was the

879
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,451
[SPEAKER_09]: The price, man.

880
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:19,752
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like, you know what it is.

881
00:53:19,812 --> 00:53:24,916
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people have been busting their butts, man, just to try to get a game because now games are like $60, you know.

882
00:53:24,936 --> 00:53:29,679
[SPEAKER_09]: $59.99, it's like people got to be really picky on what they're going to purchase.

883
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:38,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like people are like lining up, getting the PlayStation 3, and once they got it, it was like it felt like it was rushed, you know.

884
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:45,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Sony was under pressure big time because of Xbox, especially here in the United States.

885
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I know in Japan they're not.

886
00:53:46,604 --> 00:53:50,206
[SPEAKER_09]: They're probably concentrating more on the competition with Nintendo.

887
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:51,848
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know.

888
00:53:51,908 --> 00:53:53,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It just feels rushed.

889
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:59,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like the online part, it's not like how it is with the 360.

890
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:06,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I think people are having a better time connecting online where the place isn't portable than the place isn't free.

891
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:10,640
[SPEAKER_09]: And now with exclusives, it's like Assassin's Creed is coming out of the 360.

892
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:15,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Like slowly, a lot of Sony fans are...

893
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:16,723
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

894
00:54:45,912 --> 00:54:50,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that slowly is going to pick up more people to get the PlayStation 3.

895
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:52,496
[SPEAKER_09]: And also they should lower the price, man.

896
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:54,737
[SPEAKER_09]: $600 is a little bit too much.

897
00:54:56,038 --> 00:55:07,304
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were very gassed up that they sold a lot of units with the PlayStation 2 and they thought they were going to do the same thing with PlayStation 3 no matter what price it is.

898
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:10,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And look, now they're struggling, you know, it's like,

899
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:12,675
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they're going to learn from that, man.

900
00:55:12,715 --> 00:55:15,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, next year, their door is down on the price, man.

901
00:55:15,917 --> 00:55:20,699
[SPEAKER_15]: They've got a lot riding, too, on Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy XIII.

902
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:23,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of the only big, big, big exclusives I can think of that are left.

903
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:32,205
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, I think PlayStation 2 this year, in the Christmas season, they had a lot of great games, man.

904
00:55:32,325 --> 00:55:35,826
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot like Bully, the new Final Fantasy.

905
00:55:35,847 --> 00:55:37,707
[SPEAKER_09]: They've been getting a lot of great games, man.

906
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:38,368
[SPEAKER_09]: I think...

907
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,581
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they need, man.

908
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:45,603
[SPEAKER_09]: They need companies to create great games for the system.

909
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:51,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially first party-wise, they don't have no great games right now on the system.

910
00:55:51,845 --> 00:55:57,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Nintendo and Microsoft are coming strong with the first party titles.

911
00:55:57,247 --> 00:56:01,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of great games, that's a good segue into what we want to ask you next, Godfrey.

912
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,529
[SPEAKER_15]: We're tallying it up all night long.

913
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:05,490
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you believe was the best video game of 2006?

914
00:56:07,682 --> 00:56:09,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to me, man, I think it was Gears of War, man.

915
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Gears of War?

916
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:12,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Gears of War.

917
00:56:13,024 --> 00:56:23,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know it's not a perfect game, but I think graphic-wise, the sound, everything put together was amazing in that game, man.

918
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,990
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing that was a little lacking was the story, but it's okay.

919
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:32,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I've been having a blast playing online with my friends and with my brother.

920
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:34,114
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been doing co-op and all that.

921
00:56:34,414 --> 00:56:34,914
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's

922
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:40,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's, to me, the best game for 2006, Gears of War.

923
00:56:40,132 --> 00:56:43,793
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the sleeper hit also was Viva Pinata, in my opinion.

924
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:44,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

925
00:56:45,554 --> 00:56:46,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think so.

926
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:53,376
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Microsoft did a horrible job promoting the game.

927
00:56:53,396 --> 00:56:59,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they were promoting too much on Gears of War, and the attention just went away when Viva came out, you know?

928
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:02,078
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that game is really fun.

929
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:02,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

930
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:09,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I see this game more for older crowd because it's a little bit too confusing for kids.

931
00:57:10,715 --> 00:57:21,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Godfrey, I would have never have guessed that someone who's been doing this radio program about the Xbox and the hip-hop community combined was secretly an Animal Crossing and Viva Pinata fan.

932
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, man.

933
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,440
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with that?

934
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing at all.

935
00:57:25,921 --> 00:57:26,461
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great.

936
00:57:26,661 --> 00:57:29,802
[SPEAKER_09]: It's innovation, man.

937
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:32,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Companies just got to come out different, man.

938
00:57:33,937 --> 00:57:34,998
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the same thing with music.

939
00:57:35,038 --> 00:57:38,220
[SPEAKER_09]: When everybody's doing the same thing, it gets boring.

940
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,222
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I love Nintendo, what they're doing with the Wii Control.

941
00:57:43,243 --> 00:57:44,523
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just different.

942
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,945
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like having a different experience while playing the game.

943
00:57:47,985 --> 00:57:52,608
[SPEAKER_09]: You feel like when you're playing Zelda on the Wii, you think you're in the game.

944
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:55,129
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally different.

945
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:00,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of something totally different, what do you believe was the worst game of 2006, Godfrey?

946
00:58:02,168 --> 00:58:03,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, worst game.

947
00:58:04,149 --> 00:58:06,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I have two choices.

948
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:13,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Either Superman from the Xbox 360 or this game too, Totem Ball.

949
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:18,237
[SPEAKER_09]: That was actually free for the Xbox Live Arcade.

950
00:58:18,397 --> 00:58:20,839
[SPEAKER_09]: You could control with the Xbox Live Vision camera.

951
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:23,460
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was a really bad game.

952
00:58:24,441 --> 00:58:26,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I was playing it and I just got tired playing it.

953
00:58:26,822 --> 00:58:28,563
[SPEAKER_09]: My arms were falling asleep trying to...

954
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:31,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you got the chance to play that game or not.

955
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:35,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I unfortunately did and was bored of it in about five minutes.

956
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I unlocked one achievement, so after I unlocked that achievement, I was like, all right.

957
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:43,443
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one achievement I got really easy by playing the pinball game.

958
00:58:43,463 --> 00:58:48,085
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another game in it that was like a pinball game, and I played it for like two minutes, and I got an achievement somehow.

959
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:49,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

960
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:52,267
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as you download it, you get an achievement, I guess.

961
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,549
[SPEAKER_15]: You actually played this piece of crap.

962
00:58:56,609 --> 00:58:57,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Five points.

963
00:58:58,226 --> 00:58:59,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know.

964
00:58:59,266 --> 00:59:00,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't waste my time on that, man.

965
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:03,387
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of great games on the Xbox Live Arcade.

966
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:04,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't even bother with that one.

967
00:59:04,547 --> 00:59:08,408
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm putting you down for Totem Ball because you ran it a lot longer on that one than you did Superman.

968
00:59:09,768 --> 00:59:11,369
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, all right.

969
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:12,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool, cool.

970
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:18,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of curiosity, do you think the Xbox camera... Because, you know, Totem Ball is kind of like the camera game for Xbox 360.

971
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the Xbox 360 camera... Can it serve a better purpose than this?

972
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think so, man.

973
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:25,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

974
00:59:26,593 --> 00:59:33,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I know during the holidays, one of my good friends, he's a podcaster too, but now he works for Microsoft, Chris Palladino.

975
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:53,011
[SPEAKER_09]: His family, he moved to Seattle ever since he got a job at Microsoft, and during Christmas, they got together with his family in the East Coast and him in the West Coast, and they used the Xbox Live Vision camera to talk, and during Christmas, they went opening presents and all that, so it felt like they were together, you know?

976
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:53,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

977
00:59:54,802 --> 01:00:03,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I think by that or playing games like Uno online, I think it's a great purpose to play that game.

978
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:05,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Godfrey, thanks so much for being here on the show today.

979
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:07,847
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you guys have planned over there at Gamertag Radio for 2007?

980
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:19,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, hopefully in 2007 we're going to launch we're going to still continue with the audio shows, podcasts and also we're working on a video podcast.

981
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:21,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working on that and

982
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:29,007
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my staff members, Pink Sage, is also working on a project, like a Game Attack Radio magazine.

983
01:00:30,428 --> 01:00:33,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now we're keeping it on hold, but it's going to be really cool, man.

984
01:00:33,249 --> 01:00:41,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be something different, and we're still going to be concentrating on the community because there's a lot of websites that's not getting known, and we're trying to

985
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Support them so they can get their name out there.

986
01:00:44,962 --> 01:00:48,502
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have a lot of interviews.

987
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:50,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you guys planning to go to CES this year?

988
01:00:51,223 --> 01:01:01,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any of us are signed up for CES this year, but we're kind of holding out to see hopefully about the new E3 and probably that GamePro Expo and some various anime conventions we'll be going to this year.

989
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:04,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Just don't know about CES because usually not a lot of game content.

990
01:01:05,205 --> 01:01:06,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

991
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:08,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, we're planning to go to CES.

992
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:08,566
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

993
01:01:09,133 --> 01:01:19,478
[SPEAKER_09]: and we also got invited to a community event in Canada by EA, the NBA Street Home Court that's coming out for the Xbox 360 also.

994
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:24,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll just wait for your video and I'll download it to my video iPod and it'll be like I was there.

995
01:01:25,405 --> 01:01:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, there you go.

996
01:01:26,526 --> 01:01:31,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you and everybody support Orange Lodge, man.

997
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big fan.

998
01:01:32,769 --> 01:01:33,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

999
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:34,349
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we got to do.

1000
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to get together all the podcasters and continue to work.

1001
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:46,315
[SPEAKER_15]: We do a lot of talking about that, independent podcasts supporting each other, and that's what we wanted to do tonight with our New Year's special is really bring everybody together.

1002
01:01:46,375 --> 01:01:51,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, we want to thank you for being on board and coming on with this, especially you guys have...

1003
01:01:51,718 --> 01:01:56,803
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a lot, a lot of success, so we're very happy you haven't forgotten your independent roots.

1004
01:01:57,123 --> 01:01:59,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell everybody real quick how they can check out your show, if they want to.

1005
01:01:59,885 --> 01:02:08,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they could go gamertagradio.com, and we have all the shows in there, and also on iTunes, they could check it out and subscribe to the show.

1006
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:11,916
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, go there right now, everyone, gamertagradio.com.

1007
01:02:11,956 --> 01:02:12,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Godfrey, thanks so much.

1008
01:02:13,017 --> 01:02:14,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy holidays, and good luck in 2007, all right?

1009
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy holidays.

1010
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,880
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, take care, man.

1011
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:17,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks a lot.

1012
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:25,238
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

1013
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I did when I got bored with it.

1014
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,077
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

1015
01:03:19,952 --> 01:03:20,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

1016
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:20,833
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you?

1017
01:03:21,053 --> 01:03:21,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1018
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:25,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you used to come on Orange Launch Radio way back in the day.

1019
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:28,319
[SPEAKER_15]: You came on the Wednesday show with me, and we had a lot of fun there.

1020
01:03:28,379 --> 01:03:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: But what have you been up to in 2006?

1021
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,682
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't heard a lot of you in 2006.

1022
01:03:32,662 --> 01:03:35,325
[SPEAKER_03]: A good majority of it has been World of Warcraft.

1023
01:03:35,685 --> 01:03:36,445
[SPEAKER_15]: World of Warcraft?

1024
01:03:36,525 --> 01:03:36,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1025
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:37,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you looking forward to Burning Crusade?

1026
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:38,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.

1027
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:40,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1028
01:03:40,311 --> 01:03:40,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1029
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,472
[SPEAKER_15]: You ready to open up a box?

1030
01:03:43,012 --> 01:03:43,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1031
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:46,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, there's five boxes left on the table, Rice Princess.

1032
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:47,393
[SPEAKER_15]: One through five.

1033
01:03:47,453 --> 01:03:48,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Which one of those do you want to open?

1034
01:03:49,173 --> 01:03:50,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Box number three, Rob.

1035
01:03:50,574 --> 01:03:51,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's open it up.

1036
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:58,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, the gaming category we want to know your opinion on.

1037
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:03,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Game I liked this year that no one else seemed to.

1038
01:04:03,697 --> 01:04:06,777
[SPEAKER_15]: The game you liked this year that no one else seemed to.

1039
01:04:08,098 --> 01:04:09,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a hard one.

1040
01:04:10,689 --> 01:04:16,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't do a lot of console gaming this year, and everything that I did play on consoles was pretty well received.

1041
01:04:17,356 --> 01:04:19,197
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if I have an answer for that.

1042
01:04:19,378 --> 01:04:19,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-oh.

1043
01:04:20,018 --> 01:04:21,259
[SPEAKER_15]: We better think of something quick.

1044
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Elebits.

1045
01:04:26,825 --> 01:04:27,345
There you go.

1046
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:33,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Elebits did get some bad reviews from some gaming press out there, so I guess that'll work.

1047
01:04:34,206 --> 01:04:35,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

1048
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That just kind of came out of my mouth.

1049
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:37,788
[SPEAKER_15]: That works.

1050
01:04:37,828 --> 01:04:38,509
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll take it.

1051
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:39,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1052
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:40,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I have never even played it.

1053
01:04:43,931 --> 01:04:45,812
[SPEAKER_03]: I just watched it last night for the first time.

1054
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one that came to most recent memory, so there you go.

1055
01:04:50,535 --> 01:04:53,877
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why she hasn't been on the network in a year and a half, ladies and gentlemen.

1056
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:54,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Cry, cry, cry.

1057
01:04:55,197 --> 01:04:55,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1058
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:56,178
[SPEAKER_15]: We still love you.

1059
01:04:56,378 --> 01:04:56,678
Yay.

1060
01:04:57,098 --> 01:04:59,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what were some games that you liked that everyone liked then?

1061
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts 2 came out this past year, right?

1062
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:03,846
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one.

1063
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:04,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually did play that.

1064
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XII was really good.

1065
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:11,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Twilight Princess was great.

1066
01:05:11,332 --> 01:05:14,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't actually played it, but I've seen it played and it looks awesome.

1067
01:05:15,295 --> 01:05:17,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just the bigger ones that everyone knows about.

1068
01:05:18,637 --> 01:05:22,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a news story we want to get your opinion on and that would be, and oh, this is a good one for you.

1069
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you a big fan of the Xbox?

1070
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1071
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:25,402
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1072
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:27,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you're going to love this one.

1073
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:33,382
[SPEAKER_15]: What we want to know your opinion on is, what do you think of the Halo 3 madness going on out there?

1074
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:37,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Halo 3 was announced at E3 this year, and it's been building and building.

1075
01:05:37,904 --> 01:05:42,666
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been all this crazy press coverage leading into a release next year of the game.

1076
01:05:43,526 --> 01:05:46,348
[SPEAKER_15]: How important is Halo 3 to the Xbox 360 in 2007?

1077
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it's going to be one of the pillars.

1078
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:56,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it's going to be one of the big sellers, but me personally...

1079
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:57,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1080
01:05:57,364 --> 01:05:58,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give two shits.

1081
01:05:58,345 --> 01:05:58,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1082
01:05:58,825 --> 01:05:59,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you care about Halo 3?

1083
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:02,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't care about the first two.

1084
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:03,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play them.

1085
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:04,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

1086
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you just not a first-person shooter fan?

1087
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:06,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, no.

1088
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:07,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1089
01:06:07,471 --> 01:06:07,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear it.

1090
01:06:08,752 --> 01:06:08,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1091
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:09,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1092
01:06:09,893 --> 01:06:13,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Rice Princess, what, in your opinion, was the best video game of 2006?

1093
01:06:16,117 --> 01:06:17,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that came out in 2006?

1094
01:06:17,118 --> 01:06:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you can't do World of Warcraft.

1095
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:20,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1096
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:20,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, dang it.

1097
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say Kingdom Hearts 2.

1098
01:06:22,602 --> 01:06:23,282
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed it.

1099
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:24,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

1100
01:06:24,663 --> 01:06:25,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Kingdom Hearts is fun.

1101
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:25,804
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1102
01:06:26,294 --> 01:06:27,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1103
01:06:56,374 --> 01:06:58,896
[SPEAKER_15]: There wasn't anything you played that you were just like, what a crap?

1104
01:06:59,497 --> 01:07:00,197
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

1105
01:07:00,377 --> 01:07:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

1106
01:07:00,638 --> 01:07:02,379
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play crap, okay?

1107
01:07:02,859 --> 01:07:03,500
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why.

1108
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Then just say Sonic or Bomberman.

1109
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:08,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic or Bomberman, or both.

1110
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:09,445
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1111
01:07:09,785 --> 01:07:11,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we're not putting anything down for you, and you suck.

1112
01:07:12,187 --> 01:07:14,529
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to resolve to play more games in 2007.

1113
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:16,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, that's a great resolution.

1114
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:17,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that.

1115
01:07:17,331 --> 01:07:17,591
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1116
01:07:17,611 --> 01:07:18,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I promise.

1117
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:18,732
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1118
01:07:19,113 --> 01:07:22,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move over to Extifer is joining us as well from our program.

1119
01:07:22,876 --> 01:07:23,656
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you doing, Extifer?

1120
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:24,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Good, and you?

1121
01:07:24,758 --> 01:07:24,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1122
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:28,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you've become more of a gamer in 2006 than you were in 2005, huh?

1123
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:30,182
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1124
01:07:30,282 --> 01:07:31,062
[SPEAKER_15]: And why would you say that?

1125
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:33,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of your Wii.

1126
01:07:34,664 --> 01:07:35,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

1127
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:36,806
[SPEAKER_15]: My Wii has that effect on people, apparently.

1128
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:40,208
[SPEAKER_11]: I play your Wii all the time, nightly, really.

1129
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:43,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't help those rumors that are going around.

1130
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:43,750
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched him do it, too.

1131
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,211
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.

1132
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:45,872
[SPEAKER_11]: And by your Wii, I mean penis.

1133
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:46,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I get that?

1134
01:07:47,013 --> 01:07:47,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Did I not?

1135
01:07:49,551 --> 01:07:51,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Best Game of 2006, Excite Truck Because I unlocked everything in it

1136
01:08:10,305 --> 01:08:15,108
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it for hours and hours, and I must like it because I played it for hours and hours.

1137
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:21,051
[SPEAKER_15]: So amongst Burnout, Test Drive Unlimited, you choose Excite Truck?

1138
01:08:21,191 --> 01:08:21,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1139
01:08:22,052 --> 01:08:23,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is this game so damn appealing?

1140
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:28,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know a lot of hardcore gamers are passing on Excite Truck because they say it's too junky.

1141
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:36,080
[SPEAKER_11]: They need to play it more, is what I say, because there's a learning curve to it, but once you get past the learning curve, it's so much fun.

1142
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't understand...

1143
01:08:38,642 --> 01:08:44,728
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the graphics, it's not the trophies or achievements or anything like that.

1144
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:46,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the actual gameplay.

1145
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:51,234
[SPEAKER_11]: I really, really like the gameplay and I like the challenges and everything.

1146
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:55,211
[SPEAKER_11]: and on top of that are all the achievements and all the other things that you get.

1147
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:59,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well everyone here at Orange Lounge Radio is welcome to their opinion, even if they're wrong, which you are in this case.

1148
01:08:59,973 --> 01:09:00,514
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm just kidding.

1149
01:09:00,554 --> 01:09:01,474
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Excite Trek's a lot of fun.

1150
01:09:01,494 --> 01:09:02,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was underrated.

1151
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:03,935
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do think it was underrated.

1152
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:09,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I think when it came to racing games this year, I think I like Burnout a little more because there's more fire than there is in Excite Trek.

1153
01:09:09,297 --> 01:09:11,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, no, Excite Trek was better.

1154
01:09:11,518 --> 01:09:14,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well what was the worst game of 2006 in your opinion?

1155
01:09:14,099 --> 01:09:14,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

1156
01:09:16,275 --> 01:09:16,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Sonic the Hedgehog

1157
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,321
[SPEAKER_11]: So where did Sega fuck up?

1158
01:09:48,701 --> 01:09:53,643
[SPEAKER_11]: They just, they went... See, and I like Sonic Adventure when it came out for the Dreamcast.

1159
01:09:53,683 --> 01:10:03,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I really liked that game, so I think they can do it right when they do 3D, but I just, I think their execution and the control and everything was just, it was too much this time.

1160
01:10:04,448 --> 01:10:07,890
[SPEAKER_11]: And they could execute it right, because I did like that other game.

1161
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:11,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well there's four boxes left on the table.

1162
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:12,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me which box do you want to open?

1163
01:10:13,532 --> 01:10:14,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Box number two.

1164
01:10:15,222 --> 01:10:15,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, shit.

1165
01:10:18,825 --> 01:10:19,865
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what number two is.

1166
01:10:20,146 --> 01:10:22,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's open up box number two for Extover.

1167
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:30,853
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think was the best retro revival of 2006?

1168
01:10:31,214 --> 01:10:33,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Meaning, the best game that made a comeback in 2006.

1169
01:10:34,256 --> 01:10:39,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have an answer for that.

1170
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:41,121
[SPEAKER_11]: You better come up with one.

1171
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:44,263
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the best

1172
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:49,065
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to say Bomberman Act Zero.

1173
01:10:50,266 --> 01:10:51,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Why Bomberman Act Zero?

1174
01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:56,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it was so goddamn stylish and they just raped all the gamers on that one.

1175
01:10:57,013 --> 01:10:59,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have to give it to them.

1176
01:10:59,295 --> 01:11:00,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Wasn't it Konami that made that game?

1177
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think so.

1178
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:03,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Hudson's Branch or whatever.

1179
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Good job, is what I have to say.

1180
01:11:06,382 --> 01:11:07,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Best revival ever.

1181
01:11:09,246 --> 01:11:11,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting an orgasm in my pants just thinking about it.

1182
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:15,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, speaking of which, we want to know your opinion on news stories.

1183
01:11:16,331 --> 01:11:24,097
[SPEAKER_15]: The Nintendo console, because you've been playing a lot of the Wii, and one big news story this year was that originally that system was going to be called the Nintendo Revolution, right?

1184
01:11:24,297 --> 01:11:28,140
[SPEAKER_15]: But they changed their mind somewhere along the line, and they decided that

1185
01:11:28,444 --> 01:11:31,186
[SPEAKER_15]: The name of the console is going to be the Nintendo Wii.

1186
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:34,308
[SPEAKER_15]: And folks just, you know, they went nuts.

1187
01:11:34,428 --> 01:11:38,331
[SPEAKER_15]: They said, like, you know, they made every Wii joke under the sun and still do to this day.

1188
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,873
[SPEAKER_15]: What was your reaction when you heard that Nintendo's new console was going to be called the Wii?

1189
01:11:42,534 --> 01:11:46,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was a lot like everyone else's, like, huh?

1190
01:11:47,257 --> 01:11:48,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, what?

1191
01:11:48,878 --> 01:11:57,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't understand how you can go from Revolution to Wii, but then it really was a good business decision on their part, I think, because...

1192
01:11:57,802 --> 01:12:01,986
[SPEAKER_11]: People, it's different, you know, and you'll remember Wii.

1193
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:02,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you will.

1194
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:05,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just one fucking syllable, you know.

1195
01:12:05,169 --> 01:12:07,571
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I said frucking right there.

1196
01:12:08,712 --> 01:12:10,433
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, it's one fucking syllable.

1197
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:15,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also, you know, there's just, everybody knows what it is.

1198
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:17,680
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it was easier to market, I think.

1199
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:24,786
[SPEAKER_11]: When it was the Nintendo Revolution, it would, I think, be going back, you know, going backwards because...

1200
01:12:25,322 --> 01:12:28,063
[SPEAKER_11]: You're used to having video game consoles with those kinds of names.

1201
01:12:29,364 --> 01:12:31,685
[SPEAKER_15]: And penis jokes, have you been making a lot of Wii jokes this year?

1202
01:12:32,365 --> 01:12:33,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, yes, I have.

1203
01:12:33,886 --> 01:12:35,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell us one of your best Wii jokes?

1204
01:12:38,768 --> 01:12:40,609
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no I can't, actually.

1205
01:12:41,089 --> 01:12:49,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I can say, though, that when I was waiting in line for the Wii, you pretty much heard every Wii joke you could possibly hear.

1206
01:12:50,429 --> 01:12:53,630
[SPEAKER_11]: and that was kind of amusing because everybody was just making them all night.

1207
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of them originated from our part of the line.

1208
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:57,191
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't there.

1209
01:12:57,251 --> 01:12:57,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I was sleeping.

1210
01:12:58,872 --> 01:12:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1211
01:12:59,552 --> 01:13:01,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I played with my Wii and then went to sleep.

1212
01:13:02,193 --> 01:13:02,953
[SPEAKER_02]: We woke you up.

1213
01:13:04,553 --> 01:13:04,834
[SPEAKER_15]: It did.

1214
01:13:05,294 --> 01:13:05,734
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1215
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:10,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's thank you guys to Extifer and Rice Princess.

1216
01:13:10,215 --> 01:13:11,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you guys for coming on.

1217
01:13:11,256 --> 01:13:11,856
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate it.

1218
01:13:11,956 --> 01:13:14,537
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1219
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,417
[SPEAKER_15]: There's three boxes left on the table and, hey, three hosts for the show.

1220
01:13:17,537 --> 01:13:19,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So Dark Sakura, one, two, or three?

1221
01:13:20,137 --> 01:13:22,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well, um, two.

1222
01:13:23,339 --> 01:13:24,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Two, you want two.

1223
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:25,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's, uh, oh, you'll let this one.

1224
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an even number.

1225
01:13:26,541 --> 01:13:27,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here we go, box number two.

1226
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:33,204
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, the best party game of 2006.

1227
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:36,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck, I don't play party games.

1228
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:37,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1229
01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:39,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody in the studio is getting one they can't do.

1230
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:42,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I changed my box.

1231
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:43,009
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can't change the box.

1232
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:44,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I returned this one for store credit.

1233
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:44,870
[SPEAKER_15]: No, can't do that.

1234
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Um.

1235
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:49,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Wasn't there a game that people would get together at your house and play a lot this year?

1236
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:50,759
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1237
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:51,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Madden.

1238
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.

1239
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:54,101
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1240
01:13:55,842 --> 01:13:57,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to have to go though.

1241
01:13:57,583 --> 01:14:01,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go universal with party and say Animal Crossing.

1242
01:14:02,365 --> 01:14:02,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1243
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:08,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got so many dirty letters from my friends and so many people.

1244
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:17,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I had someone going around in my village calling everyone a wanker and then I had someone also say shit face and it was great.

1245
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:17,892
[SPEAKER_15]: That's so mature.

1246
01:14:18,093 --> 01:14:18,633
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.

1247
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:23,462
[SPEAKER_02]: and putting dirty t-shirts in my shop.

1248
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:24,643
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty fun.

1249
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:26,165
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1250
01:14:26,285 --> 01:14:32,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the news story we want to know your opinion on, and that would be, remember when Bully, the game Bully on the PlayStation 2 was first released?

1251
01:14:32,951 --> 01:14:38,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Huge controversy when they discovered that your character, a boy, can kiss another boy in the game.

1252
01:14:39,197 --> 01:14:40,738
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think about that whole controversy?

1253
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:42,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that I...

1254
01:14:43,122 --> 01:14:47,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's cool, but these people are stupid.

1255
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:48,607
[SPEAKER_15]: What people?

1256
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:50,689
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who were all up in arms over it.

1257
01:14:50,749 --> 01:14:51,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Tack Johnson?

1258
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:53,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1259
01:14:55,012 --> 01:14:58,775
[SPEAKER_02]: That's somebody who just needs to get butt raped with a corncob.

1260
01:14:59,556 --> 01:15:03,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Do they need to do more of this type of content in games?

1261
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:03,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes!

1262
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,041
[SPEAKER_15]: We need more hot gay action!

1263
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:09,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think gay gaming is fairly represented in games today?

1264
01:15:10,525 --> 01:15:11,465
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1265
01:15:33,849 --> 01:15:38,312
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a vast number of people in the world who have normal relationships.

1266
01:15:38,652 --> 01:15:45,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there should be any distinction made between, oh, straight people are normal, oh, gay people, you know, big thing.

1267
01:15:45,317 --> 01:15:47,718
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be no big deal.

1268
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:52,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so you think that they don't need to go out of their way to incorporate gay content into the games either.

1269
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:59,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should just be, you know, if you've written this character and this character sets off your gaydar...

1270
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them fuck a guy, I don't know.

1271
01:16:01,648 --> 01:16:05,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Then everything should be like The Sims, where it's just play it however the hell you want.

1272
01:16:05,709 --> 01:16:10,451
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sims is the best, I think, way they've done it.

1273
01:16:10,471 --> 01:16:12,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's either or.

1274
01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's tons of gay couples out there who adopt children, who get themselves artificially inseminated, who adopt.

1275
01:16:20,854 --> 01:16:23,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it should just be no big deal.

1276
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:24,015
[SPEAKER_02]: It should just be...

1277
01:16:24,702 --> 01:16:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: CookieMama

1278
01:16:47,944 --> 01:16:49,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Why did I think you were going to say that?

1279
01:16:49,985 --> 01:16:56,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of all the games, out of the Kingdom Hearts 2, the Final Fantasy XII, the Oblivions, the Gears of War, you pick Cooking Mama.

1280
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:57,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm still playing it.

1281
01:16:58,288 --> 01:17:00,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been playing it, and I haven't put it down.

1282
01:17:00,809 --> 01:17:03,170
[SPEAKER_15]: What's so great, what's so freaking great about Cooking Mama?

1283
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Pulling the head off a shrimp.

1284
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:06,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Chopping up meat.

1285
01:17:08,152 --> 01:17:10,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you excited about Cooking Mama Wii that's coming out next year?

1286
01:17:10,673 --> 01:17:13,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I want my Cooking Mama Wii.

1287
01:17:13,474 --> 01:17:14,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Worst game of 2006, Dark Sakura?

1288
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:14,495
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

1289
01:17:19,013 --> 01:17:20,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic, honestly.

1290
01:17:21,135 --> 01:17:21,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it.

1291
01:17:21,975 --> 01:17:24,637
[SPEAKER_02]: It was complete and utter shite.

1292
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:29,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was like, oh my god, it's a bad Sonic game.

1293
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,402
[SPEAKER_15]: And you have been a Sega fangirl for the longest time.

1294
01:17:31,702 --> 01:17:33,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So I asked you what I asked Extifer.

1295
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:34,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Where did Sega go wrong?

1296
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,646
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, putting it on the PS3.

1297
01:17:38,807 --> 01:17:41,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And second of all, really crap control.

1298
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:44,291
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not... it's...

1299
01:17:45,396 --> 01:17:52,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, overall, it looked like it had a lot of potential, but there's so much glitchy bullshit in it.

1300
01:17:52,941 --> 01:18:06,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if they tightened up the control, or maybe even, I don't know if they did, but used the engine from Sonic Adventure, even with the glitches in that game, you could still play through it, and it was a good game.

1301
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:10,594
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to really have that tightness of control that Sonic Adventure had.

1302
01:18:11,078 --> 01:18:12,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well thanks for your opinion.

1303
01:18:12,619 --> 01:18:14,040
[SPEAKER_15]: We know you always like to interject it.

1304
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,561
[SPEAKER_02]: My opinion is awesome.

1305
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, there's two boxes left.

1306
01:18:17,642 --> 01:18:18,102
[SPEAKER_15]: One or two.

1307
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:19,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be reading off the screen.

1308
01:18:19,743 --> 01:18:20,203
[SPEAKER_15]: One or two.

1309
01:18:20,323 --> 01:18:21,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't see the screen.

1310
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:22,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1311
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:22,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Two.

1312
01:18:26,987 --> 01:18:28,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so glad you picked this one.

1313
01:18:28,328 --> 01:18:30,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Best sports title in 2006.

1314
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,511
[SPEAKER_12]: Best sports title in 2006.

1315
01:18:35,792 --> 01:18:36,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I would think...

1316
01:18:39,175 --> 01:18:42,059
[SPEAKER_12]: Not Tecmo Bowl, they didn't release, well, I guess, Title Legends.

1317
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,620
[SPEAKER_12]: No, Title Legends was last year.

1318
01:18:46,103 --> 01:18:52,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say, actually, probably Wii Sports, since that's really, you know, kind of everyone liked that.

1319
01:18:52,691 --> 01:18:53,993
[SPEAKER_12]: It was universally liked.

1320
01:18:54,677 --> 01:19:02,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Whereas, like, you know, any EA sports game is pretty much, you know, you're either a fan of it or... So Wii Sports was kind of that game that got people to cross over.

1321
01:19:02,803 --> 01:19:04,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Even people that were like, I hate Madden.

1322
01:19:04,504 --> 01:19:05,445
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to play Madden.

1323
01:19:05,465 --> 01:19:06,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, you know, can be me sometimes.

1324
01:19:08,126 --> 01:19:09,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I loved Wii Sports.

1325
01:19:09,027 --> 01:19:09,527
[SPEAKER_15]: It was awesome.

1326
01:19:09,748 --> 01:19:10,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Wii Sports was fun.

1327
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:13,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And Madden, I'm sure, on the Wii is probably pretty fun.

1328
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:17,513
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of people were getting into that that don't normally like football.

1329
01:19:17,693 --> 01:19:22,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't follow sports, so, you know, to play a sports game is just kind of, eh.

1330
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:28,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know who anyone is or what the team's strengths and weaknesses are.

1331
01:19:28,753 --> 01:19:34,296
[SPEAKER_12]: You kind of have to be a fan of the sport to be able to play the game well, because you have to know the strengths of each player and stuff.

1332
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:40,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And since I don't do that, nor I wouldn't be able to be any good at it.

1333
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to ask you about this one, because I think Wii Sports would have been my answer to this too, but if I went outside that and wanted to pick an actual sports title, I think I actually would have picked Rockstar's Table Tennis.

1334
01:19:50,045 --> 01:19:50,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you like that game?

1335
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:52,921
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't really play that game that much.

1336
01:19:53,401 --> 01:19:55,062
[SPEAKER_12]: And, no.

1337
01:19:55,262 --> 01:19:58,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Table tennis, you know, I still have trouble thinking that that's a sport.

1338
01:19:58,925 --> 01:19:59,545
[SPEAKER_15]: It's fun!

1339
01:19:59,665 --> 01:20:01,786
[SPEAKER_15]: It was way better than, like, Top Spin 2 was.

1340
01:20:01,826 --> 01:20:03,407
[SPEAKER_15]: That was, like, one of the worst games I played this year.

1341
01:20:03,908 --> 01:20:04,328
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1342
01:20:04,548 --> 01:20:09,311
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say if I was going to pick a sports game, I would... Well, that's even last year, though.

1343
01:20:09,951 --> 01:20:13,113
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say Project Gotham Racing 3, because racing is a sport!

1344
01:20:13,173 --> 01:20:14,014
[SPEAKER_12]: True, alright, alright.

1345
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:20,938
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, if I were to say this year, then maybe best sports game... Burnout's not a sport.

1346
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:23,174
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1347
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what are your thoughts on the Eye of Judgment?

1348
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:48,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Does the PlayStation 3 need this, or does it need to just vaporize like it seems to have?

1349
01:20:49,144 --> 01:21:01,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's vaporizing, but some other things that they were talking about releasing, like the GPS system for the PSP and the camera for the PSP, those are supposed to be coming out fall of this year.

1350
01:21:02,331 --> 01:21:02,971
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are they?

1351
01:21:03,752 --> 01:21:03,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh!

1352
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:05,012
[SPEAKER_12]: They didn't come out!

1353
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:10,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess the GPS came out in Japan, but the more that you think about it,

1354
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:12,410
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1355
01:21:36,994 --> 01:21:47,660
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I can't see anyone actually setting that up to play a card game, which the game on the PlayStation 3 itself does nothing other than kind of visualize, you know, cards.

1356
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,862
[SPEAKER_12]: If it was like holographic or something, that'd be pretty cool, but no, it's not.

1357
01:21:51,982 --> 01:21:58,465
[SPEAKER_12]: So why would you pay for a $600 console to play this really crappy card game that you have to set up this really elaborate set up to play?

1358
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:03,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And to be honest, they also want you to buy these cards too, which...

1359
01:22:04,478 --> 01:22:10,442
[SPEAKER_12]: All anyone has to do is scan it into their computer and you can print it on a piece of paper and play it the exact same way.

1360
01:22:11,363 --> 01:22:14,565
[SPEAKER_12]: The whole idea is just utterly retarded.

1361
01:22:15,746 --> 01:22:18,968
[SPEAKER_15]: What would you say was the best video game in all of 2006, Loki?

1362
01:22:19,229 --> 01:22:22,051
[SPEAKER_12]: That's tough because there's a lot of games out there.

1363
01:22:22,751 --> 01:22:28,896
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd say my favorite game of 2006, the one I've been playing the most of, I'd have to say

1364
01:22:30,765 --> 01:22:36,408
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, oddly enough, it's a tie between, like, Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Liberty City Stories.

1365
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:41,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though Liberty City Stories came out last year, the multiplayer is fun on those.

1366
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:47,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Then Saints Row would have to be up there, too, because Saints Row, I think, right now, Saints Row was the most fun for me on the 360.

1367
01:22:47,714 --> 01:22:49,294
[SPEAKER_15]: So which one of those would you put on the list?

1368
01:22:49,314 --> 01:22:49,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Saints Row.

1369
01:22:49,795 --> 01:22:50,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Saints Row.

1370
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:53,236
[SPEAKER_12]: And why?

1371
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:55,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Just because you love, you love those gun games.

1372
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:58,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I love those Grand Theft Auto, I love sandbox games, and

1373
01:22:58,837 --> 01:23:27,933
[SPEAKER_12]: they're just really fun and Crackdown I think is going to be really fun next year but you know I don't know we'll see if Microsoft is able to capture the same kind of feel as that really it doesn't matter next year anyways because once Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out there's no trumping unless they really fuck it up which is possible because they've fucked up the multiplayer every single Grand Theft Auto PSP version that's come out yet we still seem to play it and kind of just you know accept the really glitchiness of the game and I don't know it

1374
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:30,491
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be fun multiplayer, I think.

1375
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:32,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, and the worst game of 2006.

1376
01:23:32,453 --> 01:23:35,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man, the worst game of 2006.

1377
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:42,181
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, everyone's saying Sonic the Hedgehog, and I think they're saying that because it's fresh in their mind, but actually Sonic isn't that bad of a game.

1378
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:47,466
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, just the controls are a little bit crappy, but I wouldn't say it's the worst game of 2006.

1379
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:55,833
[SPEAKER_12]: If anything, I would go with some of the Ubisoft titles for the Wii that are really awful, like Monster 4x4 World Circuit.

1380
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:09,388
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'd say overall the worst game of 2006, it's got to be Bomberman because Bomberman, it was just a boring game and it wasn't really fun at all.

1381
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:13,231
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know, it's just, it's bad.

1382
01:24:13,331 --> 01:24:18,074
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, if I were to, you know, peg a company as the worst company of 2006, it'd be Ubisoft.

1383
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:21,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright, well, there's one box left, so I guess I get to open it.

1384
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:22,650
[SPEAKER_12]: So, here I go.

1385
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey look, I got the million dollars!

1386
01:24:49,647 --> 01:24:50,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

1387
01:24:50,749 --> 01:24:53,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, now I got a best use of music in a game.

1388
01:24:54,185 --> 01:24:56,346
[SPEAKER_15]: and Hands Down, Elite Beat Agents.

1389
01:24:56,406 --> 01:24:56,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

1390
01:24:57,146 --> 01:25:01,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, that was one of my favorite, definitely my top three of the whole year was that game.

1391
01:25:01,307 --> 01:25:02,308
[SPEAKER_15]: That game is incredible.

1392
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:09,210
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, some people criticized it for the song list, but I thought it was actually kind of fun and it made you appreciate maybe songs that you had forgot about.

1393
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:11,431
[SPEAKER_15]: And the covers were, you know, well done.

1394
01:25:11,551 --> 01:25:15,052
[SPEAKER_15]: And yes, even Ashley Simpson's song was actually kind of fun in the game.

1395
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:16,792
[SPEAKER_15]: The game's got a great sense of humor.

1396
01:25:16,812 --> 01:25:18,133
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of the most hilarious games I've played.

1397
01:25:18,573 --> 01:25:22,637
[SPEAKER_15]: and it keeps you coming back because it's got a lot of difficulty levels in it and multiplayer.

1398
01:25:22,877 --> 01:25:25,939
[SPEAKER_15]: The game is incredible and horribly, horribly underrated.

1399
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,221
[SPEAKER_15]: I think more people should be checking out Elite Beat Agents.

1400
01:25:28,342 --> 01:25:30,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely the best use of music in a game in 2006.

1401
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,246
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the news topic I have would be...

1402
01:25:34,215 --> 01:25:36,916
[SPEAKER_15]: The Horse Armor expansion for Oblivion.

1403
01:25:37,256 --> 01:25:37,937
[SPEAKER_15]: That was retarded.

1404
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:48,920
[SPEAKER_15]: E.A.'

1405
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:49,481
[SPEAKER_15]: 's Pay-to-Cheat System

1406
01:26:13,883 --> 01:26:20,446
[SPEAKER_12]: It's dumb, especially when you have games like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter, that the cheats are in there, and you still get achievement points.

1407
01:26:20,846 --> 01:26:24,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, granted, you can't use them online, but it's easy achievement points.

1408
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:26,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's awesome.

1409
01:26:26,168 --> 01:26:27,729
[SPEAKER_15]: You're an achievement point whore.

1410
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:30,270
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of expansions would you like to see available on Marketplace in 2007?

1411
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:38,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Saints Row would be, you know, what they're doing with Crackdown, for example, they're going to have actually portions of the city that they're going to add later on.

1412
01:26:39,174 --> 01:26:39,574
[SPEAKER_12]: That's cool.

1413
01:26:39,614 --> 01:26:43,276
[SPEAKER_12]: They've built the game with that kind of expansions in mind.

1414
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:47,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Saints Row would have been cool with some, you know, they're doing like maps and stuff.

1415
01:26:47,848 --> 01:26:49,509
[SPEAKER_12]: And actually, they've had some pretty good stuff.

1416
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:54,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe more missions would be kind of cool or like a whole other section of the game.

1417
01:26:55,092 --> 01:26:59,975
[SPEAKER_15]: I definitely think in, as far as Xbox 360 goes, you know, they need more RPGs.

1418
01:27:00,095 --> 01:27:01,515
[SPEAKER_15]: They need their Blue Dragon this year.

1419
01:27:01,575 --> 01:27:03,296
[SPEAKER_15]: They need some of those other titles to come out.

1420
01:27:03,676 --> 01:27:05,497
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love SideQuest, man.

1421
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:10,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Those downloadable SideQuest was an awesome idea for Oblivion and really, really adds just hundreds and hundreds of hours to that game.

1422
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:11,581
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's great.

1423
01:27:11,941 --> 01:27:12,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1424
01:27:12,791 --> 01:27:14,432
[SPEAKER_15]: That is all 15 boxes.

1425
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:15,892
[SPEAKER_15]: We made it all the way through.

1426
01:27:16,112 --> 01:27:16,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you believe it?

1427
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:17,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my best and worst.

1428
01:27:17,513 --> 01:27:19,233
[SPEAKER_12]: I've got to say mine because we've got to tally it up, huh?

1429
01:27:19,853 --> 01:27:20,373
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what?

1430
01:27:20,453 --> 01:27:29,536
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish Bethesda would make a game like Oblivion but set in modern day so I can have the guns and be able to exert my power over the woodland.

1431
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:32,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think there will be an Elder Scrolls V, though?

1432
01:27:32,357 --> 01:27:35,098
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course there's going to be an Elder Scrolls V. I heard it here first.

1433
01:27:36,479 --> 01:27:37,539
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course there's going to be.

1434
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:41,158
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, my favorite game of the year, it's really close.

1435
01:27:41,258 --> 01:27:46,681
[SPEAKER_15]: I really want to say Oblivion, but, you know, it's a great game, don't get me wrong.

1436
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:51,845
[SPEAKER_15]: It would definitely be my number two pick, but I would say the best game of the year, it has to be Zelda, Twilight Princess.

1437
01:27:51,885 --> 01:27:53,386
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it really took...

1438
01:27:54,216 --> 01:27:57,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything that was about... Even though the game was developed originally for the GameCube, yeah, whatever.

1439
01:27:57,999 --> 01:28:04,603
[SPEAKER_15]: It really does show what the Wii is capable of doing to what you always thought about the games that you played.

1440
01:28:04,804 --> 01:28:05,344
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean?

1441
01:28:06,265 --> 01:28:07,526
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a prime example of that.

1442
01:28:07,946 --> 01:28:10,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it really is kind of everything the Wii stands for.

1443
01:28:10,388 --> 01:28:13,670
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's absolutely the greatest game to have come out this year and well worth the wait.

1444
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:19,114
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, tons of playability and great puzzles and, you know, just fun.

1445
01:28:19,254 --> 01:28:20,895
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a different playing experience...

1446
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:21,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1447
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:39,917
[SPEAKER_15]: My God.

1448
01:28:40,618 --> 01:28:46,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Bomberman would have been so much better if they just had compacted it to 50 megs and made it an Xbox Live title.

1449
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:51,143
[SPEAKER_15]: The biggest problem with Bomberman is that it was a piece of shit game that they put out for $60.

1450
01:28:51,283 --> 01:28:53,224
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you, Konami.

1451
01:28:53,244 --> 01:28:58,146
[SPEAKER_15]: You did some great work this year, but this game was somebody made a really bad decision.

1452
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:06,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking what happened is that there were some deadlines that had to be met so this game got out and it's just so obvious in the final product.

1453
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:06,671
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not even funny.

1454
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:09,092
[SPEAKER_12]: The problem with some of these companies is they forget that

1455
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:10,330
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1456
01:29:33,192 --> 01:29:38,119
[SPEAKER_12]: And the whole thing with Bomberman is like, I'm all, wow, that looks kind of cool, you know, when they showed the videos and stuff.

1457
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:45,890
[SPEAKER_12]: It would have been cool as like an action game, maybe like MDK or something like that, you know, where, like, let's just kind of branch the franchise a little bit off

1458
01:29:47,098 --> 01:29:50,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you could have the party mode or the classic mode or something like that.

1459
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,984
[SPEAKER_15]: You're charging people $60 for what essentially is an Xbox Live arcade game.

1460
01:29:56,004 --> 01:29:58,606
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the only good aspect of the game is playing it on live.

1461
01:29:58,886 --> 01:30:03,810
[SPEAKER_15]: And because the game's $60 and nobody has it, so you can't even find people on live to play it with.

1462
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:07,993
[SPEAKER_15]: They just made some huge mistakes with that game that just ruined it.

1463
01:30:08,193 --> 01:30:10,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely ruined it and made it the worst game of 2006.

1464
01:30:12,176 --> 01:30:13,337
[SPEAKER_15]: So now we've got to tally it up.

1465
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:14,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's look.

1466
01:30:14,733 --> 01:30:16,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, we're going to tally up the votes.

1467
01:30:16,255 --> 01:30:17,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's start with the worst game of 2006.

1468
01:30:18,397 --> 01:30:32,734
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like, tallying it up, we had two votes for Totem Ball, two votes for Bomberman, but it looks like between Black Wolf, Extifer, and DarkSakura, Sonic the Hedgehog with three votes is the worst game of 2006.

1469
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:33,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Sega.

1470
01:30:36,673 --> 01:30:37,413
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't that bad.

1471
01:30:37,473 --> 01:30:38,754
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know what, though?

1472
01:30:38,874 --> 01:30:42,835
[SPEAKER_12]: At least you get a second chance with Sonic and the Secret Rings.

1473
01:30:43,415 --> 01:30:49,036
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree they can redeem themselves, but seriously, do a focus group or something with this game next time.

1474
01:30:49,816 --> 01:30:51,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody could have told you the controls were fucked.

1475
01:30:51,377 --> 01:30:56,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, here's the thing, too, is they made this game like Shadow of the Hedgehog, and Shadow of the Hedgehog got shitty-ass reviews.

1476
01:30:57,178 --> 01:31:03,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So, the problem is you can only make a Sonic game so fast before it becomes uncontrollable.

1477
01:31:03,660 --> 01:31:04,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And just a reminder, some of the other ones...
