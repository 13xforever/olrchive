Alright everybody, help me welcome Travis from Travis Donovan Live to the program, Travis

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
you there?

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Yeah, me here.

10
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
How you doing Travis?

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,840
Surviving, Iím sitting here in the dark with my pants down.

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,200
Hey now, this is a family show, what the heck is going on there, where youíre at, youíre

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,700
in Texas right?

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,100
We are in Texas and right now we are experiencing typical Texas weather.

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
Which means?

16
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,440
Thunderstorm warning, tornado watch.

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Oh fun.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,920
And no power.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,760
No video games for you then today?

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,560
No and I just got my Wii today.

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,160
Oh no, how did you finally get a Wii?

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:41,840
With two EB games of all places and just randomly after stopping at GameStop and asked GameStop

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
first and they said no, they had PS3 then, but now Wii just went to EB Games and said

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
hey do you got a Wii?

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,120
And the guy just looked at me and went ìyeahî and I said ìhook me up my brotherî.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Some stroke of luck.

27
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
What games did you get for your Wii?

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,760
I got Raymond, the rabid one that everybody hates.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,960
Weíve heard some pretty good things about that from some of the other guests weíve

30
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,460
had on the program.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,560
I figure if everyone else hates it then Iím going to love it.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,880
Alright, well then we definitely want to know your opinion on some of the best and worst

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,400
in 2006 because if your opinion is the opposite then that should be kind of interesting.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,960
So we have ten boxes left, please pick a box, one through ten.

35
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,320
Alright weíll go with lucky number seven.

36
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:32,160
Lucky number seven, here we go, letís open the box and the category we want to know your

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,680
opinion on is best game to play online.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,280
What was the best game to play online in 2006?

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,320
Well thatís going to be difficult seeing how I didnít play a lot online and it would

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,320
have been 360 only.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,000
Iím going to take a book or a page from my family here and Iím going to go with what

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,400
they play online all the time and it has to unfortunately be the soul-stealing Final Fantasy.

43
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,120
Final Fantasy XI then on 360, right?

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,400
Yes, well no, on PC.

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,520
Oh theyíre still playing PC, well weíre going to have to say the 360 version because

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,720
the PC one came out a couple of years ago but the 360 one was this year.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Okay well then let me change my damn answer.

48
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,160
Alright, alright, alright, what then?

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,840
Best game this year to play online, oh what the hell.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
Gears of War.

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:30,320
Gears of War, very popular choice, any particular reason why you chose Gears of War?

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,720
I have it for the 360 and I played it online like twice and it was fun.

53
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,880
Have you played the co-op mode?

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,840
I hear a lot of people, I think the reason why a lot of folks really enjoy Gears of War

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,440
is because of the co-op and not a lot of games encourage co-op.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,480
No because nobody on my friends list bothers to play.

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,960
I would play with you Travis at some point.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,240
Okay thatís just kinky and wrong.

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Alright then fine, the choice stands as it is and Iím not going to play online with

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
you.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright well then how about this news topic, Iíd be very curious to know your opinion

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,040
on this, earlier this year there was a TV station that used to represent gamers a long

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,100
time ago that changed their slogan earlier this year and that was G4 Television and their

64
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,960
new slogan as of earlier this year was ìWe Get Guysî.

65
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,280
You ever watch a G4 TV Travis?

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Unfortunately I have accidentally stumbled upon it because on my channel listing itís

67
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,320
awfully close to BBC America and stuff like that so I accidentally tuned into it.

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,720
I see, did you ever watch G4 Tech TV back in the day right when they first merged?

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,640
In its heyday, well actually before it merged, Tech TV was the bomb.

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,160
It was the ìshiz nitî as they say in the ghetto.

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,120
It was the best thing for geeks and gamers out there.

72
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,520
Then when G4 took over it was fine, it was okay, there were some bumps in the road but

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,440
unfortunately now it is what I like to call a partial birth abortion of a network.

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
What happened, what went wrong?

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,520
They have no idea or concept of how to program a network around gaming and technology.

76
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Theyíre too ratings conscious and unfortunately they have a talent pool which makes a West

77
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,120
Virginia gene pool look like genius status.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Do you think that thereís a need out there for a video game network or do you think online

79
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,640
kind of fills that void?

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,080
The internet of course fills it.

81
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
It fills it extremely well.

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,840
There are tons of sources whether youíve got your GameSpot, your IGN, your 1UP, your

83
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
joystick, whatever.

84
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,080
Print wise, magazine wise you also have a plethora of magazines you can buy.

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,360
Television wise it would be good to have somebody or a network that wasnít jockeyed one way

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:10,600
or the other by advertising dollars to sort of twist their slant on gaming in the industry

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,760
because Iíll tell you right now you can tell on G4 that the almighty dollar really does

88
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,120
affect some of what they say on that network.

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,440
Iím not a big fan of that network.

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,360
I think what theyíve done to my holy grail which is Star Trek is ridiculous and stupid

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,880
with that whole 2.0 shit, pardon my English, and now theyíre showing cops.

92
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Iím sorry.

93
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
Cops are going to be onÖ

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,400
I was flipping the other day and I saw cops on there and I was like wow, itís very interesting.

95
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,920
Why do you think then people continue to in the gaming world care about G4 because I noticed

96
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,320
that once in a while game blogs and game sites run these stories on G4 television and I canít

97
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,800
help but personally wonder and I know weíve talked about it on our own program previously,

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,760
why do people continue to care if G4 is not giving the gamer world what we need?

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,080
Why is the gamer world continuing to give them free press?

100
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,600
So long as you have any type of mass media outlet, everybody is going to try to take

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,880
advantage of as many of those outlets as possible and G4 is one of those.

102
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:29,360
You have the talking heads on that network which are there to shield their products and

103
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,680
thatís why people still care unfortunately about G4.

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:44,280
I give G4 credit to be one of the very few Americanized networks that actually employ

105
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:57,560
a shemale, Morgan Webb, and a spasmatic schizo with severe bipolar disorder, Adam Sessler,

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,920
and the rest of their lineup and I love how they steal British interactive television

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,040
game shows and claim them as their own, i.e. that late night video game or that game call-in

108
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:22,800
show that they do which is a steal from a British show that they do over there.

109
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
So long as theyíre on the air, game companies will use them as an outlet to shield their

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,240
products because the attention span of the American public is that of a fruit fly.

111
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Theyíll get their media anywhere they can.

112
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,080
We here at Orange Lounge have given them too much airtime as it is so we need to move right

113
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,080
on to the next topic.

114
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,800
But thank you for your input.

115
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,200
What did you think was the best video game of 2006, weíre tallying it up tonight?

116
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
The best game of 2006, again, Iím going to fall back on is Gears of War just because

117
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,600
it took the first person shooter, it really didnít ratchet up a notch as far as the style

118
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,240
of gameplay, itís still the same run, duck, cover, shoot, but the graphics quality, I

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,800
think itís the first true game of 2006 to take advantage of the next gen console and

120
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,720
itís going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the other next gen console,

121
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
the PS3.

122
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,920
I donít throw the ìweî into the category of next gen because graphics-wise itís the

123
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,000
same but the 360 and the PS3, youíre finally seeing the developers get a hold of this and

124
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,520
Iím looking forward to 2007.

125
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,360
I think ìweî tries to classify itself more as a ìnew genî than ìnext genî, so it

126
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
could be interesting to see how that all plays out.

127
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,760
It is.

128
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,560
I mean, the ìweî is definitely revolutionary and it is going to be fun to play and itís

129
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,040
going to be innovative and itís going to be fun to see how publishers take advantage

130
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
of that as well.

131
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,320
All right, what was your worst game of 2006?

132
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Oh, God, we donít have enough time on the show.

133
00:09:49,840 --> 00:10:01,440
Iím going to go from a standpoint of a letdown as far as genre is concerned and that would

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
have to be Star Trek Legacy.

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,320
Ooh, wow, why is Star Trek Legacy?

136
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:15,940
The single-player story missions are incredible and theyíre fun and the graphics are great

137
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,880
and itís great that you have the voice of all the captains and that partís wonderful.

138
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Whatís killing this game from being as hot as Bridge Commander was on the PC, and as

139
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,480
I went into it on my show, is the multiplayer.

140
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,360
The multiplayer on this game literally sucks.

141
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:41,320
I mean, it sucks big floppy donkey dongs, so half the time you canít even get into

142
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,000
a game, you get kicked out, the connections are horrid, the lag times are not bad when

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you finally get a game, but the problem is getting a game.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,520
You think itís possible maybe the developers will push a patch out that hopefully will

145
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,080
fix some of it?

146
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:03,160
Well, they were quick to push a patch out for the multiplayer on the PC.

147
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,840
They literally had that out the same day it was released on PC, but Legacy was a port

148
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,240
from 360 to PC, so that was because they were having problems with GameSpy and GameSpy is

149
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,040
well known for having compatibility issues with games anyways.

150
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,600
But if there was going to be a patch, it would have been out by now and I donít think.

151
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,640
I think Bethesda Soft is just taking CBS Biocomís money and saying, ìHere, we gave you three

152
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:36,200
games, thank you for the money, good luck and thanks for all the fish,î kind of thing.

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,560
I know Star Trek is something near and dear to your heart because you do the sci-fi program

154
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,680
here on Orange on Saturday night, yes?

155
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,480
Not so much sci-fi anymore, but yes.

156
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,800
What exactly can the fans expect to hear when they tune into Travis Donovan Live on Saturdays?

157
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,560
Thatís great, being the station manager and such as you are, keeping up to speed with

158
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
the shows, Rob.

159
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,640
I do throw a little sci-fi and geek into it, of course, but Iím now getting to the point

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,880
where Iím so pissed off with the morons in television and the morons on the internet

161
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,640
totally infecting reality that itís time that reality gets put back in its place and

162
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,240
thatís what my showís all about.

163
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,200
Itís enough of hearing about Britney Spearsí coup and Lindsay Lohanís drunken tirades.

164
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,680
Itís time to slap people upside the head with a large fish and get them to realize

165
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,440
thereís more important things in this world.

166
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,000
So youíre the angry geek?

167
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,120
Iím the angry, pissed off, motherfucking, hetero white middle-aged man.

168
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,280
Well, Iím not so much middle-aged, but for your listeners, I would be considered middle-aged.

169
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:52,440
Itís sort of what Travis Donovan Live is all about now.

170
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,200
The tagline is putting reality back in its place.

171
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,320
What are you looking forward to most in the geek world in 2007?

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Not necessarily games, but anything.

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Anything geek?

174
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,440
Well, Iím interested to see how well Vista plays out when Windows Vista releases, how

175
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,680
well of an operating system thatís going to be.

176
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,280
Is it just going to be fancy new graphics and user interface, or is it actually going

177
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,960
to be something substantial, because nowadays itís so easy to steal information and corrupt

178
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,520
data via the internet.

179
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,760
Iím just wondering how much more secure Vista is going to be.

180
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,040
Itís already been hacked, from what I understand, so thatís not a good sign.

181
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,080
The rest of technology, thatís up in the air right now.

182
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Things are moving at such a pace.

183
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Itís always fun to see what the Japanese bring out.

184
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,080
They bring out robots to help the invalid, so Iím hoping soon theyíll bring out a robot

185
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,400
thatíll help wipe my butt, because again, Iím a lazy American and I donít like to

186
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,000
do that.

187
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,160
On that note, I think we should probably say goodbye.

188
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,720
Thanks so much for being on the program tonight.

189
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Oh, good.

190
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,920
Letís end the call on the brown note.

191
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Thatís great.

192
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,480
Or as weíve called it on the show previously, the brown eye of judgment.

193
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,600
We should have to go back to the archives for that one.

194
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
TravisDonovanLive.com for more information on the program.

195
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,080
Saturday nights here on Orange Launch Radio, and podcasts on your own site too, yes?

196
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,480
Oh my God, you remembered the URL.

197
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I did.

198
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
Pay attention.

199
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,040
I podcast via my site.

200
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,400
Iím also on iTunes.

201
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,000
Search him out, Travis Donovan.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,320
Thanks so much for being here, and best of luck to you in í07.

203
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
No problem.

204
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:44,120
Hopefully itíll be great.

205
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,760
For those that donít know, if you go way, way back in the broadcast history of myself

206
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,760
in Dark Sakura, we actually started on a show with Travis.

207
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,680
He did a long time ago called Understation Alive, and heís still pretty funny after

208
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,600
all these many, many, many years.

209
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,360
I was the fill-in person slash most frequent guest.

210
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,720
Yes, and I was the gay guy that was on the show, I guess.

211
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
I donít know what the hell my role was there, but we didnít get to talk a lot of games

212
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
back then.

213
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,640
I remember one of the biggest interviews we ever had is we interviewed the guy who ran

214
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,000
the bunny ranch on our program.

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,360
I remember making the calls to pay phones in Disneyland.

216
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
So that was a weird show.

217
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,600
That was kind of a shock job kind of show.

218
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,720
How did the pay phone calls go?

219
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Someone answered one.

220
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
We did get one.

221
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,840
From what I remember, we had somebody answer it once, and we actually had a conversation

222
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:35,160
with them, but then we called back and the call mysteriously dropped, and we were theorizing

223
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,160
that the Disneyland police had tapped our conversation and dropped the calls, because

224
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,520
you know Disneylandís got some scary security.

225
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,600
The whole point of it, though, is that they are presentingóthis is why all the stuff

226
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,920
that happens around the park is called behind the scenes for a reason.

227
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,700
Everythingóthe employees are cast members.

228
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,000
Everything there is sent to present something, and a phone callóthey donít want to get

229
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
in the way of that.

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All right.

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,800
Well, speaking of craziness, our next guests are crazy, but in a good way.

232
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Yes, Dark Sakura?

233
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Yeah.

234
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:14,440
We have Franz here and Ron Workman from Destructoid.com.

235
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
All right.

236
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
We are joined here now on our Orange Ons Radio year-end special with one, two, three people

237
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,720
joining us from the website Destructoid.com.

238
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
Say hello, everybody, to Franz.

239
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Franz, you there?

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is Franz from Destructoid.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hey, how you doing, Franz?

242
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Man of many words.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

244
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
And the voice you hear there is Ron.

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hey.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How you doing?

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Hey.

248
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Graybush Workman.

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How you doing?

250
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Graybush in the house.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Thanks for having us.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Not a problem.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And also joining us, say hello to Shir.

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Whatís up, guys?

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yeah.

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I donít have anything to say.

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Iím boring.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Thatís all right.

259
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,160
We often donít either, but we somehow fill three hours every week.

260
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,920
Iím so fucking laid back.

261
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,540
So you guys all blog for the Destructoid.com website, but do you guys participate in their

262
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,520
podcast as well, Podtoid?

263
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Occasionally.

264
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Yeah, sometimes.

265
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Usually, Ron.

266
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,800
Yeah, Iím usually turning into the comic relief for the show.

267
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,080
They beg, but I have things to do to leave me alone.

268
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,960
How many bloggers do they have over at Destructoid?

269
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,560
Because when Iím looking at the list of people, it looks like Iím looking at a picture of

270
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
The Last Supper or something.

271
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
There are so many people.

272
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,360
I think what are we looking at?

273
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,160
Probably mid to high 30s, I mean in January weíre maybe looking at over 40, hopefully.

274
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Wow.

275
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah.

276
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
A couple more people.

277
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,640
Weíve got well over a dozen people that post daily and consistently and stuff like that,

278
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,480
and thatís kind of our thing, what weíre shooting for, is to update information.

279
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,680
Gregory made a joke last night, hey, weíre the only website that posts at 3.30 in the

280
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
morning every day.

281
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Yeah.

282
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,320
Weíve got people that are up all night messing around with stuff.

283
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,200
So you guys really are an army of robots when you say that.

284
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,760
It seems that way.

285
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,800
Weíre turning into the Detroit Army, I guess.

286
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
All right.

287
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,880
So weíre going to pick the Armyís brain here a little bit on some of the gaming topics

288
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,440
in a little game we call Year in Review 2006.

289
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,840
So we have nine boxes left, because people have been plucking all the other boxes.

290
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,020
And Franz, weíll start with you.

291
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,680
Which box do you want to open up?

292
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,800
Box one through nine, any one of them.

293
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,440
If thereís a PS3 in it, Iím returning it, though.

294
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Weíll see.

295
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,880
Iíll go with nine.

296
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Box nine, letís take a look.

297
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,080
We want to know, Franz, what did you think was the most creative game in 2006?

298
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,640
Damn.

299
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
Most creative game in 2006.

300
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Come on.

301
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
Viva Pinata.

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Viva Pinata.

303
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
Actually, no.

304
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Ronís actually got a point.

305
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
Itís one of the two games heís played.

306
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Viva Pinata.

307
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,960
When you get a game where you re-rate the engine to make it look more kitty, and itís

308
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,660
mating animals that dance around for the whole game, thatís pretty damn creative.

309
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,160
You said there was two going around in your mind?

310
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,840
What was the other one, out of curiosity?

311
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,320
No, that was just the only game around in Wartmanís Blotting this year.

312
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,280
Oh, I see.

313
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
Is Viva Pinata really for kids, though?

314
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
Because I know when I played it, I was like, if I was seven, my controller would be through

315
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
the window right now.

316
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Itís going to be tough for kids to understand it.

317
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Itís like Pokemon in the sense that anybody can enjoy it.

318
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,480
Like, I played Pokemon, and that was a great game.

319
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
I donít know.

320
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,960
Thereís some stuff in Viva Pinata that my gray bush ass couldnít figure out how to

321
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
do, thatís for sure.

322
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
I know.

323
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I was getting frustrated with Viva Pinata.

324
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,080
I was looking stuff up on the internet, and people were feeling bad for me, like, ìHere,

325
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,520
Iíll send you Pinata Vignata.î And Iím like, ìNo, I want these damn mice to have

326
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,240
sex.î And weíre all of a sudden fucking Mensa.

327
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,800
My Vignattas kept beating each other.

328
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
It was like Lord of the Wise.

329
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Yes.

330
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Horrible.

331
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,960
So Viva Vignata, most creative game.

332
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,520
Franz, the newest topic we want to know your opinion on, and I donít know if you have

333
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,760
any friends over in the UK, but it seems like one of the recurring themes in 2006 is that

334
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,920
our buddies in the UK keep getting the shaft.

335
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,840
I think thatís when the story of their lives, thatís definitely true.

336
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,480
Why does Britain keep getting fucked over when it comes to release dates or system launches,

337
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
prices of games?

338
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,000
Why do they keep getting picked on?

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,640
I think itís a shame.

340
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,760
If Microsoft would jump on that and divvy up their sales a lot more, I think that would

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
give them a lot more price.

342
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,040
Now, didnít the Wii just come out two days ago or something?

343
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,720
They could barely do pre-sales over there.

344
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
No, like two days.

345
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,360
They came out like two weeks ago.

346
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Oh, okay.

347
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,560
And theyíre waiting until March, I guess, to do the PlayStation over there?

348
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Yeah, then I mean you get a taste of it.

349
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
Jesus.

350
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, hell, half the United States didnít get a taste of it in there.

351
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,160
Although itís important to note too that they banned games thatís kind of unnecessary

352
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
too.

353
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,280
Like even Rule of Rose and stuff, so maybe theyíre hesitant to help them out any time

354
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
soon.

355
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Did you guys play Rule of Rose?

356
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
It wasnít that bad.

357
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
I didnít think it was that bad.

358
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
I heard it was terrible.

359
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,280
The game itself is kind of something I feel like I played before, but I mean the game

360
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
was okay.

361
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,280
I certainly played worse games this year, but I didnít think the story was that bad.

362
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,040
It just involved sexual themes that kind of had kids.

363
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,880
What was that out on?

364
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
PS2.

365
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
PS2.

366
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Yeah.

367
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
It was easy.

368
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,160
I just think the problem with Rule of Rose, it was a full-price title, wasnít it?

369
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,240
It was like a $49.99 they wanted for it?

370
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah.

371
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Yeah, so that was the biggest problem is because PS2, you know.

372
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,400
Well, thatís just Atlus because theyíre retarded and still think they can get $49.99

373
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,360
for a PlayStation 2 game at the end of its life cycle, so.

374
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,240
Well, you know, I guess if Square can get $59 for a collectorís edition of Final Fantasy

375
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
XII, which has nothing special, by the way, nothing special.

376
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,200
Oh, Final Fantasy XII, I love this in Final Fantasy.

377
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
It is a sexy game.

378
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
Iíll give you that.

379
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
All right.

380
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
And itís actually GameStop that thinks they can get $59.99 for the special edition of

381
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Final Fantasy XII.

382
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,720
Well, they got it from me, but thatís because Iím a corporate whore.

383
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,640
Shira, itís your turn.

384
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,360
Why donít you pick a box?

385
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,040
Now we have one through eight left.

386
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,200
Hmm, Iíll pick number three.

387
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
Box number three.

388
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,560
Letís open it up.

389
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Box number three.

390
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
Oh, this is a good one.

391
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,760
What do you believe was the most disappointing game of 2006?

392
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,880
Hmm, Iím going to get a lot of flak for this.

393
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,200
Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess.

394
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Oh, snap.

395
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Ouch.

396
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Why, uh, why Zelda Twilight Princess?

397
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,720
I donít know, because Zeldaís the type of game where everyoneís like, this game is

398
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
better than unicorns fucking pixies.

399
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
But itís not.

400
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Itís not so great.

401
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
And that would be great.

402
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
I donít know about you guys.

403
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Thatís funny.

404
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Thatís exactly how I described it on the last episode of Orange Lounge.

405
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Itís amazing.

406
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
I was likeÖ

407
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Yeah, but everyoneís like, this is going to be the greatest game ever.

408
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,400
And then I played it and I was like, yeah, this isnít the greatest game ever.

409
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
I donít know.

410
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
My only little comment for that is it came out two years late.

411
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah.

412
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Itís part of the thing that makes it a disappointment.

413
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Sure.

414
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Is that the problem for you, is that this is essentially a GameCube game with Wii controls?

415
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Well, no.

416
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Thatís not the problem.

417
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Itís just that I donít really like Zelda then.

418
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Like, I like games in that genre, I like Ocarina of Time is okay, I like Majoraís Mask, like

419
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Wind Waker.

420
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
But this one is just, like, boring, thereís no real character depth, and I was just like,

421
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
yeah, fuck this.

422
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
All right.

423
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
Iím going to chime in on what they think the most disappointing game of 2006 was.

424
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Rare didnít come out with anything, did they?

425
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
No, perfect.

426
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Thatís a lie.

427
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
Didnít they just release Viva Pinata?

428
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
Viva Pinata?

429
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
Oh, yes.

430
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
It is.

431
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
Thatís a rare game.

432
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
I donít know whatÖ

433
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Oh, no, Novadrome.

434
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Novadrome for Xbox Live Arcade.

435
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Why Novadrome?

436
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh, it was garbage.

437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
It killed me.

438
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
Have you played it?

439
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah, I have.

440
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I have.

441
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I have.

442
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I have.

443
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
I have.

444
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,960
It was just, you look at it, itís like $10 for this thing.

445
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,960
It was like a really bad, like, I only played a few minutes, it was that bad that I was

446
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,400
just laughing, but $10 for a game thatís a real bad twisted metal.

447
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Oh, Red Steel 2, Novadrome.

448
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Red Steel was atrocious.

449
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Can you believe they green-lighted a sequel to Red Steel?

450
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Yeah, because I think a lot of people were really looking forward to it and really, like,

451
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,400
looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, yeah, letís do this.

452
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Iím looking for all the new concepts and theyíre like, man, this is going to be the

453
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
greatest game ever.

454
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,400
And Ubisoft, when they released it, everyone was like, well, this isnít that good.

455
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
There are a lot of things you could do better.

456
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
So Ubisoft is going to take that into account, make a better game with the, you know, the

457
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,400
similar core gameplay, and itís just going to be fucking awesome.

458
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,400
I realize thatís what I hope happens.

459
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
All right.

460
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Weíll see.

461
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,920
Shir, the news topic I want to know your opinion on has to do with the price ranges for video

462
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,900
game systems in 2006.

463
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,760
We heard at one point that, you know, even though I think most of us knew this was BS,

464
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,160
but the revolution was going to be $99.

465
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,480
This is when it was still called the revolution, not the Wii.

466
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,640
And then, you know, suddenly it was, okay, 250, more reasonable, probably what we expected.

467
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,280
But then all the way up to $600 for the PlayStation 3 or $500 for the low end, depending on how

468
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
you look at it.

469
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,880
So weíve had systems cost anywhere at one point or another in theory or whatever it

470
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,440
would be, $99 to $600.

471
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,780
How important do you think price is of these systems in the console wars that are going

472
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,680
on here in 2006 and on into í07?

473
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,880
Iím glad I got this topic because Iím broke as hell, so this is just the perfect topic

474
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
for me.

475
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,720
And itís a big factor for me when Iím buying systems.

476
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,400
For example, I donít have a 360 because Iím broke.

477
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:25,320
Itís like 400 bucks and you canít play without live, really, and then it requires a yearly

478
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,600
fee that I really donít have because Iím broke.

479
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
No.

480
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
400 bucks live comes with it.

481
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Shut the hell up, Ron.

482
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
You always miss that.

483
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,440
You always see these press releases and theyíre like, and then youíve got to buy live.

484
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
So it comes with it for 400 bucks.

485
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Dude, the gold package or whatever.

486
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,480
Well, who gives a shit?

487
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,680
If you want to play games online, you can play with silver.

488
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,560
Thereís no difference aside from multiplayer.

489
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,200
You canít have four people on your Xbox plan.

490
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,640
Goldís a better color.

491
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
It is.

492
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,960
We have to be 24.

493
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,440
And yeah, so anyway, Wiiís $250.

494
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,960
I thought it was going to be cheaper instead of everyone else, but I really didnít care

495
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,000
because I could scrape up $250.

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,520
I canít scrape up $400 because I suck, and the PS3 is just way out there, and even if

497
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,880
you want to go on eBay, itís like a grand.

498
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,880
And so yeah, itís a bit ñ

499
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,360
Dude, for such dollars, go buy a cheap remote, spray paint it white, and spray paint your

500
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
GameCube white.

501
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Youíve got to Wii.

502
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
No, you donít.

503
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Neither one of them can play BBB.

504
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,360
I canít argue with you, Ron, because youíre just the biggest dick in the world.

505
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
They both have subpar graphics.

506
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
But you canít play Elibits on the GameCube.

507
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
That makes a point.

508
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,240
Theyíre not going to drop that.

509
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Theyíre not going to push it out on the ñ

510
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I guess there wouldnít be any way to do it with the controls.

511
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Damn right.

512
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
You just lost.

513
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
All right.

514
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Well, we got to keep it moving here.

515
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Thanks.

516
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Thanks for your input.

517
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Letís move on over to Graybush.

518
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Oh, great.

519
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Please be a question about how to get rid of crabs.

520
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
Please be how to get rid of crabs.

521
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
One through seven.

522
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Take your pick.

523
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
I will take number four.

524
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Number four.

525
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,880
Letís open up case number four.

526
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,400
Most downloadable content for a game.

527
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,600
Oh, content?

528
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,520
Oh, God.

529
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,440
Youíre going to brag on me on this one.

530
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,240
I hate to say this, but the damn UNO player packs.

531
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Really?

532
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,960
Are you a big cameo card fan?

533
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,200
The thing I had the most fun with this year is all ñ

534
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Iím coming out of the closet, Ron.

535
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I know, man.

536
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Iím Ricky Martin all over again with this.

537
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,800
Iím just ñ I canít ñ best downloadable add-on to a game.

538
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,360
Well, Call of Duty map packs, obviously, were cool for me.

539
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,600
Well, I thought you said UNO.

540
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,000
I thought we were going with UNO here.

541
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,400
Well, Iím just trying to think.

542
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,640
Iím arguing back and forth here.

543
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Iíd say Call of Duty map packs I probably had the most fun with, but the UNO stuff got

544
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,120
me to play UNO for some odd reason.

545
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,640
Iíd be on Xbox Live and have all this money in this machine, and weíd be sitting there

546
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,360
on our video cameras chatting with each other on UNO, and it was just like, what kind of

547
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,560
revolution is this?

548
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,240
I would have to be a tie between the stupid add-on packs that actually got me to play

549
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,360
UNO and stay up all night with people bullshitting on there, and the Call of Duty 2 maps.

550
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,160
Does it have anything to do with the webcams on UNO?

551
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,640
Thatís one news story that didnít quite make our cut for being included tonight.

552
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,440
When they first came out, it was really funny because there would be three or four of us

553
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,640
in a room and weíd be like, ìOh, look, thereís somebodyís ass and somebodyís boobs.î

554
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
I guess the novelty wore off real quick, but it was a really funny thing.

555
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,440
But it was cool because I could sit on my back porch and smoke cigarettes and play UNO

556
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,440
because the controller vibrates when itís your turn, and UNO is so hard you just hit

557
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
the A button.

558
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
You donít even have to look at the screen.

559
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,560
I mean, seriously, there would be media nights Iíd be sitting outside smoking a cigarette.

560
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,880
I couldnít even see, but Iíd be chatting on my headset.

561
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
When the controller vibrated, I hit the button and it would throw a card out there because

562
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,540
it doesnít matter, itís UNO.

563
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,720
Playing UNO on live is weird for me now because I feel like Iím always playing against lonely

564
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,280
girl 15 with the webcam.

565
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:05,040
But itís one of those things where I never expected to have fun ever, ever playing UNO.

566
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,800
I never even expected to play UNO.

567
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,120
When we get in there, itís just a bunch of us friends and we bullshit and we have a good

568
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
time.

569
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,360
Itís not as much about UNO gameplay, but I remember when we added the new decks to

570
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,880
it and changed the game and we started playing with strategy.

571
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,600
It was like, ìWeíre actually playing fucking UNO.î It was one of those types of things

572
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,480
where somebodyís done something right if weíre actually playing UNO.

573
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,560
Now, are you guys big on the shit-talking on UNO, like drop form, motherfucker, and

574
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,560
things like that?

575
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Yeah, but itís always joking.

576
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,360
Reverse bitch.

577
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,960
Speaking of fun games, the news story we wanted to ask you about would be Guitar Hero because

578
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,520
we obviously had Guitar Hero 2 come out this year, which is the sequel to a monster hit

579
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,400
last year, and then they announced, and this is still a bit of a rumor status, but that

580
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,000
thereís going to be a quartet of new Guitar Hero games coming out through the next year.

581
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
You know, the one on the 360 and so on and so on.

582
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,280
Is too much Guitar Hero too much of a good thing?

583
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,880
Iíve never played it because itís a video game that involves me dancing around with

584
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,360
a plastic toy guitar.

585
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,920
And yet you play UNO and you wonítÖ

586
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,320
There is nothing thatís ever going to be cool about a grown man dancing around with

587
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,040
a plastic toy guitar.

588
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I know.

589
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
I get you.

590
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
You play fucking UNO.

591
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,160
Sitting on the back porch playing UNO smoking cigarettes is fucking rad, huh?

592
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Yeah, I know.

593
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,400
Iím not beat to answer around with a plastic guitar.

594
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
It looks to me like a rock star.

595
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,120
Guitar Hero is like the lamer version of DDR for me.

596
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I know people love it and get into it, but itís just like you play it with a plastic

597
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
toy.

598
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,920
It would be like me playing Call of Duty with a squirt gun, hiding behind couches and everything.

599
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Ron Workman is a communist.

600
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,960
Ron, out of curiosity, Ron, have you ever heard of a Japanese game calledÖ

601
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
No.

602
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Alright, just donít.

603
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Donít ever look it up because youíll hate it.

604
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Is it a rhythm game?

605
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,840
Yeah, itís based on this old Japanese style of dancing that was done by girls wearing

606
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,440
these big tall boots and they wave their hands around like to Eurobeat music.

607
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Itís something to behold.

608
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,440
Iíll give you that.

609
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,440
Mine is one of those things, like, I would never let someone see me in public playing

610
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,640
DDR unless I was completely just wasted drunk off my ass because when I see people playing

611
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,720
DDR, Iím just like, ìYou look ridiculous!î Iím one of those guys thatís just like,

612
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
ìLook at that guy playing DDR!

613
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,200
He looks like an idiot!î Iíve always been like that and Guitar Heroís kind of the same

614
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
thing.

615
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,520
I hate toÖ Iím not condemning it, but I canít see myself playing it with a plastic

616
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
toy dancing around.

617
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,960
But in the privacy of your own home when no oneís looking?

618
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Maybe I would.

619
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,440
Itís kind of like the ìween awayî where if you play it at home, people are going to

620
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,280
see it and people like Ron wonít want to play it, but the others will be interested

621
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
and theyíll pick it up.

622
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,280
I donít see the 360 sales doing well with it, but six months from now I donít see it

623
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
doing well.

624
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
And when they come out with a wireless guitar?

625
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
I love guitar.

626
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Yeah.

627
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,400
And that actually looks pretty tough, so maybe Iím going to get one when I do that.

628
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
All right.

629
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
All right.

630
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,360
Weíre going to go around now and Iím going to ask everybody what they believe the best

631
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,760
game of 2006 was and the worst game we hear at Orange Launch Radio.

632
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,200
Weíre tallying it up, so weíll start with the best game.

633
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Franz, what do you think the best game was of 2006?

634
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,200
Cliche, but Twilight Princess.

635
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,760
Why Twilight Princess over everything else?

636
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Waiting for Shearís answer now.

637
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Because Iíll admit that itís not quite as good as I hoped.

638
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,600
I think the wolf part downplays it a little bit, but if you forget about it, itís a Zelda

639
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,480
game and if you just pretend it was a completely new game and you compare it to any other game

640
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
from 2006, the game plays solid.

641
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
Thereís not a lot to complain about.

642
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,320
Itís a high nine, so I think it wonít have a top, but not even Gears.

643
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,080
Itís a game thatís topping a lot of peopleís list.

644
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,080
Shear, what did you think the best game of 2006 was?

645
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,720
Final Fantasy XII, hands down.

646
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Final Fantasy XII.

647
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,320
That game just ripped me apart.

648
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
I got it.

649
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,760
I played it for like 20 hours in the first three days.

650
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,920
I just played it nonstop.

651
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I love that game.

652
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Itís so good.

653
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,720
Have you always been a Final Fantasy series whore or was XII kind of your enabler?

654
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,520
I played Final Fantasy VII, loved it.

655
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,160
Played Final Fantasy VIII, fuck you guys, loved it.

656
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,320
Played Final Fantasy IX, hated FFX and hated everything else after FFX, so FFXII was kind

657
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
of the last.

658
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Which would be FFXI.

659
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Yeah, FFXI and then the spinoff games.

660
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
Oh, yeah.

661
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
True.

662
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
Theyíre just a bit of some crap.

663
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,040
No, I deleted those from my brain.

664
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,480
FFXII doesnít exist to me.

665
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,760
Yeah, so I really liked FFXII, Rebirth of the Series, really interesting characters,

666
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,280
amazing graphics and I just loved it so much.

667
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
Itís so good.

668
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,560
All right, dare I ask, Ron Workman, best game of 2006.

669
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,640
Youíre going to make fun of me, but Burger King, Sneak King.

670
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,080
Iím totally fucking around.

671
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,600
Come on, what was the best value of 2006, at least notó

672
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,120
Yeah, the Burger King games were three bucks, four bucks, whatever.

673
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:56,640
Yeah, gee, I could pay $4.99 or I could pay $5 for a new Rally-X. Let me think.

674
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
Hey, youíre really going to lay it to me.

675
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,600
I actually bought that shit, didnít I, when I was drunk.

676
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I bought Rally-X.

677
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
So did I.

678
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Letís not tell anyone.

679
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:12,560
I remember it when I was a kid, you know, playing with a big steering wheel and stuff.

680
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,200
Gears of War, I mean, I really liked Reba Pinana and Call of Duty 3, I think, was underrated,

681
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,840
but I have to say, I mean, Gears of War, hands down, itís a no-brainer for me, you know,

682
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,440
and Iím not into the fantasy games like Zelda or Final Fantasy, nothing against them, but

683
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I justó

684
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
Youíre a gun fan.

685
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,800
Yeah, itís an amazing game to me, you know.

686
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,640
I like, you know, Cliffy B, they did some really innovative stuff, in my opinion, and

687
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,000
thereís things that were like, you play those first person shooters and stuff, and youíre

688
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,600
always looking for the next gimmick, but this wasnít the same thing, itís, I donít know,

689
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,560
it was immersive, like you got into it, and it was a different thing.

690
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,480
And Call of Duty 3 is the same way for me, itís really immersive for me.

691
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,220
I like how they changed it, like a lot of people donít like it because they were used

692
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,440
to the Unreal Tournament 100 mile an hour multiplayer with Call of Duty 2, where it

693
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,160
wasnít like a war game at all.

694
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,680
And lately Iíve been reallyóI didnít get 3 until a few weeks ago, but Iíve been really

695
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,160
impressed and, you know, me and Suma even discussed it, weíre like, we donít understand

696
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
why people donít like it.

697
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,280
Itís a really underrated game, but, you know, Gears of War, hands down, itís better than

698
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
it, so.

699
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,840
But probably Call of Duty 3 definitely on your top 10 for the year, at least.

700
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,440
Yeah, it was a real, like, late bloomer for me that I just wasnít expecting to be that

701
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,600
good because I heard so much bad feedback, you know, and I liked Call of Duty 2 because

702
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,200
Iím a big multiplayer fan, so.

703
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
My worst game of the year?

704
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Novadrome.

705
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Yeah, sure, why not?

706
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Well, letís go into worst game of the year.

707
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Ron, start us off.

708
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Novadrome.

709
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Novadrome.

710
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,560
He smacked it in the face for making that game.

711
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,080
They owe me 20 bucks for playing the demo, thatís how I view it, and Iím still pissed.

712
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,920
What was soóI mean, because, I donít know if itís just me, but they really hyped up

713
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,680
these end-of-year Xbox Live independent title releases that they were going to do, and I

714
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,560
wasnít really impressed with any of them, even Assault Heroes.

715
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,280
I wasnít really feelingóI was kind of like, Iíd almost rather play Rally-X.

716
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
Ten bucks, you know?

717
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,000
Yeah, Rally-X, the deciding thing was like, I was like, ìAh, Iíll play this one as a

718
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,760
kid, whatever, you know, five bucks, no big deal, but $10 on some of those games is a

719
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,040
little tough for me to swallow, and itís not that Iím tight with money about it, you

720
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
know?

721
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,960
But if I could play the demo, like, the Assault Heroes demo was pretty long, and thatís fine,

722
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
you know?

723
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
Like, Iíve bought Pac-Man and Frogger and Galaga and all those, but, contra.

724
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,120
Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Wii downloadable stuff?

725
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
Would you pay $10 for an N64 game?

726
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:43,500
The last time I played a Wii was six months ago at a private show, and Iíve not played

727
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,920
one since, and Iím not even seeing the virtual console stuffóor, yeah, is that what itís

728
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
called?

729
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,920
Virtual console?

730
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
Yeah.

731
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Yeah, not even seeing it.

732
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,560
But I do know about the pricing, and it disappoints me that Nintendo is doing that.

733
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,880
You know, I guess they can, because their fans are, you know, I really hate to get into

734
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,760
this, but Nintendo fanboys are pussies.

735
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,040
You guys should stand up and fight.

736
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,120
You should fight Nintendo to make better shit.

737
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Nintendoís never going to make better shit, and theyíre going to come out with subpar

738
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
consoles and charge too much.

739
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,920
All right, Nintendo fans, you can address those cards and letters to Graybush, Care

740
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,920
of Destruction.

741
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,440
Non-Graybush workmen, yeah, exactly, but no, itís one of those things where, like, Xbox

742
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,600
Live is genius, and the reason itís genius is because people are absolute assholes to

743
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,840
Microsoft and theyíre not scared to be.

744
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,680
If theyíre pissed, they will flame them to hell and back, or write it on their blogs

745
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
or whatever.

746
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,920
Do you think no one wants to stand up to Reggie because heíd kick your ass?

747
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,880
Nintendo is this golden cow that nobody wants to, you know, theyíre on a pedestal, and

748
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,920
come on, Nintendo canít do anything wrong, blah, blah, blah, thereís some shit games

749
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,920
out there on the Wii.

750
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,440
Nobody bitches about them like they would if it was a bad Xbox game, you know, like

751
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Xbox Live.

752
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,560
I donít know, Loki kind of went off on Cars the other week.

753
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,200
And all the Ubisoft games suck ass.

754
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,120
I have officially boycotted them for all their Wii launch titles.

755
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
What about Rayman?

756
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,680
Rayman was just average, and that was their best game of the entire lineup.

757
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:19,160
The show Rayman was my favorite.

758
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,720
I really wish that people would say, ìHey, Nintendo, we donít want a system that only

759
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,360
has the graphic power of an Xbox, an original Xbox.

760
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,960
We want to be able to play DVDs.

761
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,600
We want to have online multiplayer out of the box and launch games to back it up.

762
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:41,040
We donít want to pay $10 for a Mario Brother game weíve bought 20 times before, you know?

763
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,600
Itís dicking their fans over, if you add all that stuff into what you spend to have

764
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:51,240
games and play the Wii and to track down 4 controllers for the damn thing, itís not

765
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,360
any cheaper than buying a 360.î

766
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,920
Alright, weíve got to keep it moving.

767
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Thatís alright, sorry.

768
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
No, thatís ok.

769
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Let me get over my fanboy.

770
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,760
You just sound like you could go all day long on this Nintendo thing.

771
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,540
Iíll leave him to read the Destructoid.com blog to see your further love and adoration

772
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,040
for all things Nintendo.

773
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,080
Iíd like for your rights as a gamer.

774
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,800
Shear, what would you say is the worst game of 2006?

775
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Red Steel.

776
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,880
Because you asked me what the biggest disappointment of 2006 was, and I said Father Princess, but

777
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,680
Red Steel was the kind of game that I never really had expectations for.

778
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,880
I saw it, I was like, ìThat could be cool, but itís probably not going to be.î And

779
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,360
I played it and it wasnít, it was just so bad.

780
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,400
And even the multiplayer, walking around, dinosaurs shooting me in the face, Iím like,

781
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,920
ìWhat the hell is this?î The controls were terrible, the guns were terrible.

782
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,120
I just hated it with a passion.

783
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,040
I remember the buzz about that a long time ago before it came out, it was like, ìThis

784
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,680
is going to be really cool, you can swing your sword around and blah, blah, blah.î

785
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
Oh man, the multiplayer.

786
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,240
It was like, ìThis is garbage.î You all worry about that whole, theyíre going to

787
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,400
call you and you put the Wiimote to your ear and everybodyís like, ìThatís such a cool

788
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
idea.î Yeah, exactly.

789
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Itís so retarded.

790
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,640
And at the time, they were saying you were going to be able to use a microphone that

791
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,720
was in the Wiimote, because I played it a long time ago, which never came about.

792
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,800
But my friend got it and I was like, ìDude, letís go play it.î And weíre playing it.

793
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,080
And the multiplayer, as soon as you figure out how to use your stupid sword, like you

794
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,680
brought it up to people and you just like, theyíre dazed and you just shoot them in

795
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,040
the face like 45 times and itís so annoying because you canít kill anybody unless youíre

796
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,040
using your stupid sword.

797
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,440
And the multiplayer is cheap and the stupid ring thing is retarded.

798
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,840
Was the game just rushed, you think?

799
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,520
No, I just think it was atrocious.

800
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I think they donít know what theyíre doing.

801
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,040
They said they were working on it for months, fixing it, so I think it just didnít pull

802
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
it off.

803
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,160
I think they were just like, ìYeah, fuck this game, this is terrible.î I donít know

804
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,160
what they did.

805
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,720
You know, you would think that they might be able to sell copies of Red Steel 2 if they

806
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,400
just said, ìOh, Red Steel 1 was rushed, sorry, weíll make it better next time.î But you

807
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
know, it kind ofÖ

808
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
But it wasnít.

809
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
It wasnít.

810
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
It was just bad.

811
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
All right.

812
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,360
Franz, what would you think was the worst game of 2006?

813
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,760
This oneís pretty easy.

814
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,920
Armado, itís a game on the PSP and all it is is youíre an armadillo rolling around

815
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
the game and all you do is hit one button to jump at the right time.

816
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Thatís the entire 40-dollar game.

817
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
I shit you not.

818
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
And itís not even a homebrew.

819
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
Itís an actual game.

820
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,640
It was like a small companyís first game, so I hate to knock it because, you knowÖ

821
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Youíre making shit up to get out of this easy.

822
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Nobody knows what youíre talking about.

823
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Nobody knows what youíre talking about.

824
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
One of us down there at big names, Franz, is like, ìArmado.

825
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I hate it.î

826
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
It caught my eye in game shows and I laughed my ass off at it.

827
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,120
You know, funny enough, thatís not, out of all the ones weíve heard, thatís not the

828
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
first game.

829
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:31,760
Somebody mentioned itís the worst game that none of us had heard of, so there you go.

830
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,080
Itíll be interesting to hear the rest.

831
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,840
So is this why the PSP keeps getting flack for not having the same game power as the

832
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
PSP?

833
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
PSPís terrible.

834
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
That shit is only disappointed about six.

835
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
I just donít think they have enough good games.

836
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
They have good games.

837
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
They just donít have enough.

838
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
I hate the PSP.

839
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
I had it written for me.

840
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
I hate it.

841
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
I want to throw it at them.

842
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,440
It cost me so much money, though.

843
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,080
But Luminous, Metal Gear.

844
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Yeah, 360.

845
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Yeah.

846
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
Keep going.

847
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
All right.

848
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
All right.

849
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,840
Anyway, weíve got to wrap it up here.

850
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,480
What do you guys have planned for 2007 over at Destructoid, if you can say?

851
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Lots of giveaways, thatís for sure.

852
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Yeah.

853
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,480
Super secrets.

854
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,480
Lots of bitches.

855
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
All right.

856
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
Lots of bitching.

857
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Lots of prizes.

858
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
We want to give away a Wii a week.

859
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,480
Yeah.

860
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Weíre working on it.

861
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Weíre shooting for it right now.

862
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Wow.

863
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,360
And weíve got a big contest going with the Lord of the Rings people, I think, at Microsoft.

864
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,120
And weíve got a big, big, big World of Warcraft thing coming at the end of the month.

00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,120

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Not really.

873
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
Not me.

874
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
I donít know.

875
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440

I canít talk about them.

00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Oh.

Welcome.

881
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Thanks for having us, man.

882
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
No problem.

883
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Yeah, absolutely.

884
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
Dude, awesome.

885
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
Thanks.

886
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Thanks so much for coming on, you guys.

887
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:13,240
And best of luck to you guys at Destructoid, all 45 or how many of you there are over there

888
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
in 2007.

889
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
Well, 3,000 of us.

890
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:27,600
Big thanks to those guys over there at Destructoid.com for coming on the program and especially

891
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,580
to Franz because originally him and I were on another show called Cross Platform together

892
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,020
earlier this year which is why I remembered him and originally it was just going to be

893
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,320
him that came on, but he was like, ìDude, you want to get some more people on?î So

894
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,040
he got some of his co-bloggers over there at Destructoid.com to come on as well and

895
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,080
that was a fun little interview.

896
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,480
I definitely need to check out more of their own podcast over there because Iím sure itís

897
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,040
a riot, so check that out over at Destructoid.com, one of my favorite gaming blogs, by the way,

898
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
and I mean that.

899
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,400
Thatís the best side address ever.

900
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,280
I like their little robot icon that they work into everything, so pretty cool.

901
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,280
All right.

902
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
Whoís coming on next, DarkSakura?

903
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,840
I have Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

904
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:17,960
All right, Iím joined here now by Godfrey from Gamertag Radio.

905
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,960
Godfrey, you there?

906
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
Yeah, Iím here.

907
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
Whatís going on, man?

908
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
Hey, not a lot.

909
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,680
How you doing?

910
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Everything good, man.

911
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,680
Big fan of the show, man.

912
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Big fan.

913
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
Thank you.

914
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Appreciate it.

915
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Weíre big fans of you guys as well.

916
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
You guys have come a long way.

917
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:34,320
Youíre what, going to be two years podcasting pretty soon?

918
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,200
Yeah, itís going to be two years now in February.

919
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:48,280
Iíve been also recording before that around 2000, 2001, like a Phantasy Star Online radio

920
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
show.

921
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,360
At that time, on the Dreamcast, it was like a big comedian.

922
00:44:53,360 --> 00:45:01,040
But I also used to help out these guys, gamingnoise.com, Chip and Zach, and I know all games, too.

923
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,760
They used to do a radio show, too, at that time, 2001.

924
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Yeah, they were around.

925
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,880
Just out of curiosity, Phantasy Star Universe was out this year.

926
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,680
Did you kind of get on board with that?

927
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,600
Yeah, I was playing a lot for a good month.

928
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,440
But then, I donít know, I wasnít feeling it like how it used to be with the Dreamcast.

929
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,440
It seemed more strict.

930
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,240
Last time on the Dreamcast, it was more open.

931
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,840
I donít know, it felt kind of different.

932
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,840
I donít know if it was because of the next-gen consoles or, you know, I donít know.

933
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,440
I just wasnít too thrilled with online gaming on that.

934
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,680
Thatís all right.

935
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,360
Now, I want to ask you about this, too.

936
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:43,920
You guys have had a lot of Microsoft celebrities on your program this year, havenít you?

937
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,160
Yes, a lot.

938
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,760
Recently, we had an Xbox community, and we had a lot of people from the Xbox community,

939
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,680
a lot of podcasters in there.

940
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,720
And also, people from Microsoft came to the show to help us out and just thank the community

941
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,680
that theyíve been helping out throughout the years.

942
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,240
Major Nelson was there, Trixie, Peter Moore was also part of it, Aaron Greenberg.

943
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,720
And itís been a great year for us, man.

944
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,240
Weíve been busting our butts big time this year, and I want to thank everybody from Microsoft

945
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
for helping us out.

946
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,160
Yeah, it sounds like itís really paid off for you guys, so congratulations.

947
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,320
Those are some big names to have on your show.

948
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,320
Yeah, man.

949
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,200
Yeah, I mean, we could do it, anybody could do it, you know, everybodyís just got to

950
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,200
be dedicated, man.

951
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,200
Absolutely.

952
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:34,920
I want to ask you this as well, because your show is mostly centered around Xbox, but do

953
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,840
you play Nintendo Wii, PlayStation, do you play the other consoles too?

954
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:47,280
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was camping out, man, trying to get the Nintendo Wii during

955
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
launch day.

956
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,840
I was in line for like at least 12 hours, man.

957
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Wow.

958
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Iíve been playing that here and there.

959
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:00,680
Iíve only been playing Zelda for the Wii, and I downloaded a couple of virtual console

960
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,680
games too.

961
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,680
Thatís why Iíve been spending most of my timeÖ

962
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:11,040
Iím just waiting to see if I can have more games in 2007, waiting for WarioWare, I played

963
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,440
that too, and the Nintendo party, they were here in Miami a couple months ago before launch.

964
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,440
Awesome.

965
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,440
I like that game a lot.

966
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,200
Yeah, I got to play WarioWare at E3, it was one of the few games that didnít have a mile

967
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
long line.

968
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,200
It was pretty fun.

969
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,200
Yeah, itís different, man.

970
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Itís cool to get a group of people to play together in there, you know?

971
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,040
Itís different than the other games in the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox.

972
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,720
I think that gameís going to show us just why the Wii is a party console just as much

973
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,720
as the GameCube.

974
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,520
Yup, I think so too, man.

975
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,160
Well, Godfrey, we got to get to the game weíre playing here, which is the Year 06 in review,

976
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,000
and weíve started off with 15 boxes, but now we only have six left, so please, pick

977
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,720
a number one through six.

978
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,800
All right, so tell them whatís going on for this year, man.

979
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,880
Well, you got to tell me whatís going on in 2006, you got to pick one of these boxes

980
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:02,880
one through six.

981
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,240
Let me pick number, let me pick number one, that sounds pretty cool.

982
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,080
Number one, letís open it up.

983
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:19,120
All right, we want to know your opinion, what did you think was the best handheld game in

984
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
2006?

985
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
Ooh, handheld.

986
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,400
Ooh, thatís a good one, man.

987
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,680
Iíve been playing a lot of BS.

988
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:35,680
I have to say, in my opinion, Animal Crossing was really cool, Iíve been playing that a

989
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
lot.

990
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,440
Let me see, what else have I been playing, Luminous, also from the PSP, I know that came

991
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,040
out, what was it last year that came out, though, right?

992
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,840
But you did have Luminous 2 this year.

993
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,360
No, Iíve been playing it, but Iíve been playing a lot of Luminous from the Xbox 360.

994
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,560
So out of all those games youíve played, which one would you say was the best?

995
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:00,360
Which version, from the Luminous or from the PSP or the Xbox?

996
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,560
For any handheld system, which game would you say was the best?

997
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,560
Animal Crossing, man.

998
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,640
I had a lot of fun with Animal Crossing this year, Iíve been playing that a lot, a lot.

999
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,880
I mean, yeah, thatís the only game Iíve been playing a lot on the handheld this year.

1000
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,480
Itís pretty addicting, I mean, you can go online with it and go visit other peopleís

1001
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:21,400
towns, and it seems like it doesnít really end, ever, that game.

1002
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,640
Exactly, and not only that, itís based on real time, too, so itís like I wake up and

1003
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,320
Iíll be like, ìAll right, itís daytime over here,î and I could go online and I might

1004
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,800
go to somebody else that the time is ahead in their town, letís say for somebody from

1005
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,680
maybe Europe or Japan, and their town is based on their time, so itís like, ìOh, man, itís

1006
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,200
nighttime over here, let me check it out,î and itís cool, because I know Animal Crossing

1007
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,640
has a great community, too.

1008
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:54,720
I donít know if youíve been checking out a couple of websites called animalcrossingcommunity.com,

1009
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,920
where people can exchange their friend codes and exchange items and help each other out

1010
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,920
and stuff.

1011
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,920
I donít know, I find that really cool, man.

1012
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:08,160
Itís different from a lot of other games handheld, so, you know, thatís what it is.

1013
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:15,720
I know that game was in the GameCube, but one thing that was missing was the online

1014
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,720
park, which, when it came out on the DS, I know a lot of people enjoyed that a lot, too.

1015
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,840
Now, Iím sure Animal Crossing on the Wii will be inevitable, so, you know, you will

1016
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,040
give me your friend code at that point, let me come chop down your trees, right?

1017
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,800
Oh, for sure, man, yeah, but get ready, because Iím going to go to your town and do the same.

1018
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,800
All right, sounds good.

1019
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,000
We want to get your opinion on a news story as well, of course, weíre going down the

1020
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,880
highlights of 2006, and Iíve got to say, youíve got a good one here.

1021
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,200
Actually, you have an audio Daily Double here for the news story, so letís go to the audio.

1022
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,480
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai.

1023
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:56,160
Ridge Racer.

1024
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,560
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change, and the consumers are ready.

1025
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,280
Genji 2 is an Ashen game, which is based on Japanese history.

1026
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,620
Ridge Racer.

1027
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:15,800
Being based on history, the stages of the game will also be based on famous battles,

1028
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,480
which actually took place in ancient Japan.

1029
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,120
So hereís this giant enemy crab.

1030
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,640
Ridge Racer.

1031
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,760
And you attack its weak point for massive damage.

1032
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,840
Itís Ridge Racer.

1033
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Ridge Racer.

1034
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:46,960
E3 will retail for $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, $599, itís Ridge

1035
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Racer.

1036
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
Ridge Racer.

1037
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,600
Yes, thatís right, itís Sonyís infamous press conference from E3, where they got taunted

1038
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,480
incessantly afterwards.

1039
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,200
Godfrey, were you at E3 this year, watching it online?

1040
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:10,400
As a matter of fact, that day during the press conference, Iím also part of the Xbox MVPs

1041
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
from Microsoft.

1042
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Itís a lot of community members that got invited to E3, and we were there, you know,

1043
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,840
having a couple meetings, talking about the Xbox, and then all of us got together and

1044
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,280
wanted to see the press conference of Sony, because thatís when they were announcing

1045
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:34,160
the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii during E3, so we were watching it, and I donít know,

1046
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,360
it was very, very boring, like the presentation.

1047
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,800
I think Nintendo did a really good job this year presenting the Wii and also Microsoft

1048
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,600
with the Xbox 360, but I donít know, Sony was just like straight up boring, and I donít

1049
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,840
know why it was the hype or the system, you know, like everybody was like, ìOh my God,

1050
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:59,480
the graphics are going to be amazing,î and look, ever since E3, that happened, look now

1051
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,880
like theyíve been getting a lot of bad press ever since, you know?

1052
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,620
What do you think caused all that bad press?

1053
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,840
Was it the price tag?

1054
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,920
Was it the giant enemy crabs line, the Ridge Racer?

1055
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,480
What caused all the bad press, do you think?

1056
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,920
Oh man, I think everything combined, but I think the most was the price, man.

1057
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,560
You know it is, a lot of people have been busting their butts, man, just to try to get

1058
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:28,000
a game because now games are like $60, you know, $59.99, itís like people got to be

1059
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,840
really picky on what theyíre going to purchase, and itís like people are lining up, getting

1060
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:39,520
the PlayStation 3, and once they got it, it felt like it was rushed, you know?

1061
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,320
I think Sony was under pressure big time because of Xbox, especially here in the United States.

1062
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:51,520
I know in Japan, theyíre probably concentrating more on the competition with Nintendo, but

1063
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:58,240
I donít know, it just, it feels rushed, and itís like the online part, itís not like

1064
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,320
how it is with the 360.

1065
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:05,280
I think people are having a better time connecting online with the places in portable than the

1066
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,840
places in 3, and now with exclusives, itís like Assassinís Creed is coming out of 360,

1067
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,400
like slowly, a lot of Sony fans are going to go and purchase the other consoles because

1068
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,400
they donít have no choice.

1069
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:25,320
They canít find a console in stores or, you know, thereís not many great games, so right

1070
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:31,000
now only Resistance is an okay title for the Sony, so I donít know, man.

1071
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:36,000
What do you think Sony can do to give themselves some good press in 2007, to really turn their

1072
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
car around and get back on track?

1073
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,280
I think itís the games, man, itís all about the software, man.

1074
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,960
If they have the right games, and itís fun, I think that slowly is going to pick up more

1075
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,480
people to get the places in 3, and also they should lower the price, man, $600 is a little

1076
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,780
bit too much.

1077
00:54:55,780 --> 00:55:02,200
I think they were very gassed up that they sold a lot of units with the places in 2,

1078
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,740
and they thought they were going to do the same thing with places in 3, no matter what

1079
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:11,440
price it is, and look, now theyíre struggling, you know, itís like, I know theyíre going

1080
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,480
to learn from that, man, so hopefully next year theyíre going to lower down the price,

1081
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,480
man.

1082
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,960
Theyíve got a lot riding, too, on Metal Gear Solid 4 and Final Fantasy 13, kind of the

1083
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,600
only big, big, big exclusives I can think of that are left, soÖ

1084
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:30,720
As a matter of fact, I think places in 2, this year, in the Christmas season, they had

1085
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,240
a lot of great games, man, a lot like Bully, the new Final Fantasy, theyíve been getting

1086
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,120
a lot of great games, man, I think thatís what they need, man, they need companies,

1087
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,760
you know, to create great games for the system, you know, and especially first-party-wise,

1088
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,760
they donít have no great games right now on the system, so Nintendo and Microsoft are

1089
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,920
coming strong with the first-party titles, you know.

1090
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,120
Well, speaking of great games, thatís a good segue into what we want to ask you next, Godfrey,

1091
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:06,360
weíre tallying it up all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of

1092
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,360
2006?

1093
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,240
Well, to me, man, I think it was Gears of War, man.

1094
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Gears of War.

1095
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,240
Gears of War.

1096
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,240
Yeah, Gears of War.

1097
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:21,360
I mean, I know itís not a perfect game, but I think, like, graphic-wise, the sound, everything

1098
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,120
put together was, like, amazing in that game, man.

1099
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,400
The only thing that was really lacking was the story, but itís okay, I think Iíve been

1100
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,960
having a blast, like, playing a lot with my friends and with my brother, weíve been doing

1101
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,320
co-op and all that.

1102
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:41,200
I think thatís, to me, like, the best game for 2006, Gears of War, and I think the sleeper

1103
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,360
hit also was Viva Pinata, in my opinion, man.

1104
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,360
Really?

1105
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,760
Yeah, I think so.

1106
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,200
I think Microsoft did a horrible job promoting the game, I think they were promoting too

1107
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,400
much on Gears of War, and the tension just went away when Viva came out, you know?

1108
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,640
So I think that game is really fun.

1109
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,040
Personally, I see this game more for older crowd, because itís a little bit too confusing

1110
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,040
for kids.

1111
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,460
Godfrey, I would have never have guessed that someone whoís been doing this radio program

1112
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:21,920
about the Xbox and the hip-hop community combined was secretly an Animal Crossing and Viva Pinata

1113
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,920
fan.

1114
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:23,920
Yeah, man.

1115
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,920
I donít know about that, you know?

1116
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,920
It doesnít think at all.

1117
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Itís great.

1118
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,920
You know, itís great.

1119
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
You know what it is, man?

1120
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Itís innovation, man.

1121
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,480
People, companies just gotta come out, like, different, man, like, thatís the same thing

1122
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,480
with music.

1123
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,920
When everybodyís doing the same thing, it gets boring, you know, and thatís why I love

1124
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:45,680
Nintendo, what theyíre doing with the Wii control, and itís just different, itís like

1125
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,640
having a different experience while playing the game.

1126
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,720
Itís like, you feel like, when youíre playing Zelda on the Wii, you think youíre in the

1127
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,720
game, you know?

1128
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,200
Itís totally different, man, soÖ

1129
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,200
All right.

1130
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,200
Well, now, speaking of something totally different, what do you believe was the worst game of

1131
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,760
2006, Godfrey?

1132
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,760
Wow, worst game!

1133
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:14,920
Man, I have two choices, either Superman from the Xbox 360 or this game too, Totonball.

1134
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,920
They was actually free for the Xbox Live arcade with the, you could control with the Xbox

1135
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,920
Live Vision camera.

1136
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Yeah.

1137
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,200
It was a really bad game.

1138
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,120
I was playing it, and I just got tired playing it, like, my arms was, like, falling asleep

1139
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
trying toÖ

1140
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,720
I donít know if you got the chance to play that game or not.

1141
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,640
I, unfortunately, did, and was bored of it in about five minutes.

1142
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,120
I mean, I unlocked one achievement, so after I unlocked that achievement, I was like, ìOh,

1143
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
right.î

1144
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,320
There was one achievement I got really easy by playing the pinball game.

1145
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,240
Like, there was another game in it that was, like, a pinball game, and I played it for,

1146
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,280
like, two minutes, and I got an achievement somehow.

1147
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,280
Oh, okay.

1148
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,920
I seen you download it, you get an achievement, I guess.

1149
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,760
You actually played this piece of crap.

1150
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
Five points.

1151
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,760
Yeah, man.

1152
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,760
I donít know.

1153
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,760
I wouldnít waste my time on that, man.

1154
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,160
Thereís a lot of great games on Xbox Live Arcade.

1155
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,480
Donít even bother with that one.

1156
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,760
Iím putting you down for Totonball, because you ran it a lot longer on that one than you

1157
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,760
did Superman.

1158
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,760
Yeah.

1159
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
All right, all right.

1160
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:11,760
Cool, cool.

1161
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,480
Out of curiosity, do you think the Xbox camera, because, you know, Totonball is kind of, like,

1162
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,400
the camera game for Xbox 360.

1163
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,520
Does the Xbox 360 camera, can it serve a better purpose than this?

1164
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,600
Yeah, I think so, man.

1165
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:31,200
I mean, I know during the holidays, one of my good friends, he used to be a, heís a

1166
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,560
podcaster, too, but now he works with Microsoft, Chris Paladino.

1167
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:41,740
His family, he moved to Seattle ever since he got a job at Microsoft, and during Christmas,

1168
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:45,120
they got together with his family in the East Coast and him in the West Coast, and they

1169
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:50,640
used the Xbox Live Vision camera to talk, and during Christmas, they went opening presents

1170
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,960
and all that, so it felt like they were, like, together, you know?

1171
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,960
Thatís nice.

1172
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,320
I think by that, or playing games like Uno online, I think itís a great purpose to play

1173
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,320
that, man.

1174
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
All right.

1175
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,680
Well, Godfrey, thanks so much for being here on the show today.

1176
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,680
What do you guys have planned over there at GamerTag Radio for 2007?

1177
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:14,600
Yeah, right now, weíre hopefully, in 2007, weíre going to launch, weíre going to still

1178
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:21,120
continue with the audio shows, podcasts, and also, weíre working on a video podcast, weíre

1179
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:27,480
working on that, and one of my staff members, Pink Sage, is also working on a project, like

1180
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,560
a GamerTag Radio magazine.

1181
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,200
Right now, weíre keeping it on hold, but itís going to be really cool, man.

1182
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,440
Itís going to be something different, and weíre still going to be concentrating on

1183
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,520
the community, because thereís a lot of websites thatís not getting known, and weíre trying

1184
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:47,280
to support them so they can get their name out there.

1185
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,520
We can have a lot of interviews.

1186
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,880
Are you guys planning to go to CES this year?

1187
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,080
I donít think any of us are signed up for CES this year, but weíre kind of holding

1188
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,440
out to see, hopefully, about the new E3, and probably that GamePro Expo, and some various

1189
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,400
anime conventions weíll be going to this year.

1190
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,800
Just donít know about CES, because thereís usually not a lot of game content.

1191
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,800
Okay.

1192
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:12,320
Yeah, well, weíre planning to go to CES, and also got invited to a community event

1193
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,560
in Canada by EA, the NBA Street home court thatís coming out for the Xbox 360 also.

1194
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,560
Well, weíll just wait for your video, and Iíll download it to my video iPod, and itíll

1195
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:24,560
be like I was there.

1196
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
All right, there you go.

1197
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,560
All right.

1198
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:31,560
I want to thank you, and everybody, support Orange Lodge, man.

1199
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,560
Iím a big fan.

1200
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,560
Thank you.

1201
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,560
Thatís what we got to do.

1202
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,160
We got to get together all the podcasters, and I continue to work.

1203
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,920
We do a lot of talking about that, independent podcasts supporting each other, and thatís

1204
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,960
what we wanted to do tonight with our New Yearís special is really bring everybody

1205
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,960
together.

1206
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:50,960
So really, we want to thank you for being on board and coming on with this, especially

1207
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:56,400
you guys have had a lot of success, so weíre very happy you havenít forgotten your independent

1208
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,400
roots.

1209
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,840
Tell everybody real quick how they can check out your show, if they want to.

1210
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:06,520
Yeah, they could go on gamertagradio.com, and we have all the shows in there, and also

1211
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,040
on iTunes, they could check it out and subscribe to the show.

1212
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,040
All right.

1213
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,040
Go there right now, everyone, gamertagradio.com.

1214
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,160
Godfrey, thanks so much.

1215
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,360
Happy holidays, and good luck in 2007, all right?

1216
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,360
Happy holidays, man.

1217
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,360
All right.

1218
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,360
Take care, man.

1219
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:24,400
Thanks a lot.

1220
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,260
Big thanks to Godfrey from Gamertag Radio for coming on, and heís been doing his show

1221
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,260
a long time.

1222
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:34,560
He did not realize that before he was podcasting, he actually did another type of recordable

1223
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:40,240
show, so thatís pretty cool, and I love the fact that heís an Animal Crossing fan, Viva

1224
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,240
Pinata fan.

1225
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,240
Thatís cute.

1226
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,520
You two should be the best of friends, Dark Soccer, because you never shut up about Animal

1227
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,640
Crossing on this program.

1228
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,960
I did when I got bored with it.

1229
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,240
Just imagine when it comes out for the Wii.

1230
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
I know.

1231
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,800
Thatís what we were saying there at the end there is that I cannot wait to go to his village

1232
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:58,680
on the Wii and chop down all his trees and send his villagers some nasty e-mails.

1233
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,720
Thatíll be tons of fun, wonít it?

1234
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,360
Anyway, we still have some boxes left to open here in studio, so weíre going to go around

1235
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,480
and have some folks open the remaining boxes, Dark Soccer and Loki, but also we brought

1236
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:16,400
in some other guests live, some folks from Orange Lounge Radio, past and present, so

1237
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,600
say hello first to Rice Princess.

1238
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,100
How you doing, maíam?

1239
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,100
Pretty good.

1240
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,100
How about you?

1241
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
Good.

1242
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,360
Now, you used to come on Orange Lounge Radio way back in the day.

1243
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:28,960
You came on the Wednesday show with me, and we had a lot of fun there, but what have you

1244
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,960
been up to in 2006?

1245
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,200
We havenít heard a lot of you in 2006.

1246
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,840
A good majority of it has been World of Warcraft.

1247
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
World of Warcraft?

1248
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
Yep.

1249
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
Are you looking forward to Burning Crusade?

1250
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
Hell yeah.

1251
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
All right.

1252
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
Yep.

1253
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
All right.

1254
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
You ready to open up a box?

1255
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Sure.

1256
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
All right.

1257
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,560
Thereís five boxes left on the table, Rice Princess, one through five.

1258
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,440
Which one of those do you want to open?

1259
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,440
Box number three, Rob.

1260
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,440
All right.

1261
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,440
Letís open it up.

1262
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,120
All right.

1263
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,480
The gaming category we want to know your opinion on, game I liked this year that no one else

1264
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,760
seemed to.

1265
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,200
The game you liked this year that no one else seemed to.

1266
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,640
Oh, thatís a hard one.

1267
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,100
I didnít do a lot of console gaming this year, and everything that I did play on consoles

1268
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:19,280
was pretty well received, so I donít know if I have an answer for that.

1269
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,280
Uh-oh.

1270
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,280
Yeah.

1271
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,280
What do you think?

1272
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,480
Um, well, uh, Elibits.

1273
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,200
There you go.

1274
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:33,400
Well, Elibits did get some bad reviews from some gaming press out there, so I guess thatíll

1275
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
work.

1276
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
I have no idea.

1277
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,400
That just kind of came out of my head.

1278
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
That works.

1279
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Weíll take it.

1280
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,400
Okay.

1281
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,400
I have never even played it.

1282
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,360
I just watched it last night for the first time.

1283
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,360
Itís the one that came to most recent memory, so there you go.

1284
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,320
This is why she hasnít been on the network in a year and a half, ladies and gentlemen.

1285
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
Cry, cry, cry.

1286
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:56,320
Just kidding.

1287
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,320
We still love you.

1288
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,320
Yay.

1289
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,320
Well, what were some games that you liked that everyone liked then?

1290
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,320
Kingdom Hearts 2 came out this past year, right?

1291
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,320
That was one.

1292
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,560
I actually did play that.

1293
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,880
Final Fantasy XII was really good.

1294
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,280
Twilight Princess was great.

1295
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,680
I havenít actually played it, but Iíve seen it played, and it looks awesome.

1296
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,680
Yeah, just the bigger ones that everyone knows about.

1297
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,160
Hereís a news story we want to get your opinion on, and that would beóand oh, this is a good

1298
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,320
one for youóare you a big fan of the Xbox?

1299
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,320
No.

1300
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,920
Then Iím sure youíre going to love this one.

1301
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,520
What we want to know your opinion on is what do you think of the Halo 3 madness going on

1302
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,520
out there?

1303
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,840
Halo 3 was announced at E3 this year, and itís been building and building.

1304
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,540
Thereís been all this crazy press coverage leading into a release next year of the game.

1305
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:48,240
How important is Halo 3 to the Xbox 360 in 2007?

1306
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,520
Iím pretty sure itís going to be one of the pillars.

1307
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,280
Iím sure itís going to be one of the big sellers, but me personally, I donít care.

1308
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,280
I donít give a shit.

1309
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,280
Whatever.

1310
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,640
Why donít you care about Halo 3?

1311
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,280
Because I didnít care about the first two.

1312
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,280
I didnít play them.

1313
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,280
I donít care.

1314
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,040
Are you just not a first-person shooter fan?

1315
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,040
Not really, no.

1316
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,040
All right.

1317
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Sorry to hear it.

1318
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Yeah.

1319
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
Okay.

1320
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:16,280
Well, Rice Princess, what in your opinion was the best video game of 2006?

1321
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,280
Something that came out in 2006?

1322
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,280
Yeah.

1323
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,280
So you canít do World of Warcraft.

1324
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,280
Sorry.

1325
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,280
Yeah.

1326
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,280
Dang it.

1327
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,280
Iím going to say Kingdom Hearts 2.

1328
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,280
I really enjoyed it.

1329
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,280
Itís a good game.

1330
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Kingdom Hearts is fun.

1331
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,280
Yeah.

1332
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,280
It is.

1333
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,280
It really is.

1334
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,280
All right.

1335
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,280
Is it just because of the story, or is it the action?

1336
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,280
Because some people say this gameís too easy.

1337
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,280
You just hit X, X, X all the time.

1338
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Yeah.

1339
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,240
The actionís pretty much the same as the first one, so itís not like they really did

1340
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,880
a lot with that, but the story was really, really good.

1341
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,880
All right.

1342
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
Yeah.

1343
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,720
Whatís the best game of 2006, Rice Princess?

1344
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,520
Chirp, chirp.

1345
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,720
I donít really know.

1346
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,120
I canít make an informed decision on that.

1347
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:56,440
Iím sure thereís a lot of bad games.

1348
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:59,360
There wasnít anything you played that you were just like, ìWhat a crap.î

1349
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,360
No, not really.

1350
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,360
Really?

1351
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,360
I donít play crap.

1352
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,360
Okay?

1353
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,360
Thatís why.

1354
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,400
Then just say Sonic or Bomberman.

1355
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Sonic or Bomberman, or both.

1356
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
All right.

1357
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,240
Then weíre not putting anything down for you, and you suck.

1358
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,880
You need to resolve to play more games in 2007.

1359
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,880
Oh, my God.

1360
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:16,880
Thatís a great resolution.

1361
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,880
Iíll do that.

1362
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,880
All right.

1363
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:19,880
I promise.

1364
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:20,880
All right.

1365
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,760
Letís move over to Extafur is joining us as well from our program.

1366
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:23,760
How you doing, Extafur?

1367
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,760
Good, and you?

1368
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
Good.

1369
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,880
Now, youíve become more of a gamer in 2006 than you were in 2005, huh?

1370
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,880
Yeah.

1371
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,880
And why would you say that?

1372
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,780
Because of your Wii.

1373
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,780
Pretty much.

1374
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,780
My Wii has that effect on people, apparently.

1375
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,780
Yeah.

1376
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,240
I play your Wii all the time nightly, really.

1377
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,080
And donít help those rumors that are going around, Extafur.

1378
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,080
Iíve watched him do it, too.

1379
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,080
It was great.

1380
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,080
And by your Wii, I mean penis.

1381
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,080
Did I get that?

1382
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:49,680
Did I not?

1383
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,200
Like I said, please, those rumors are bad enough as it is.

1384
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Oh.

1385
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,200
All right.

1386
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,400
Well, so do you feel like maybe youíre pretty well informed to make some decisions on the

1387
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
best and worst game of 2006?

1388
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
I think so.

1389
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,400
All right.

1390
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,080
What would you say was the best game of 2006, Extafur?

1391
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,880
Best game of 2006, Excite Truck.

1392
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,880
Wow.

1393
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:06,880
Really?

1394
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,880
Why?

1395
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,080
Because I unlocked everything in it.

1396
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,920
I played it for hours and hours, and I must like it because I played it for hours and

1397
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:15,920
hours.

1398
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,520
So amongst Burnout, Test Drive Unlimited, you choose Excite Truck.

1399
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,520
Yes.

1400
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,160
Why is this game so damn appealing?

1401
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,560
Because you know, a lot of hardcore gamers are passing on Excite Truck.

1402
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,560
I know.

1403
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,560
Because they say itís too junky.

1404
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,440
They need to play it more, is what I say.

1405
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:35,300
Because thereís a learning curve to it, but once you get past the learning curve, itís

1406
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,300
so much fun.

1407
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:43,240
And I donít understand, you know, itís not the graphics, itís not the, you know, trophies

1408
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,560
or achievements or anything like that, itís the actual gameplay.

1409
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,920
I really, really like the gameplay, and I like the challenges and everything.

1410
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,280
And on top of that are all the achievements and all the other things that you get.

1411
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:08,520
Alright, well everyone here at Orange Longs Radio is welcome to their opinion, even if

1412
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,520
theyíre wrong.

1413
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:10,520
Which you are in this case.

1414
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,520
No, Iím just kidding.

1415
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,520
No, Excite Truckís a lot of fun.

1416
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,520
I think it was underrated.

1417
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,520
I think, I really do think it was underrated.

1418
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
Yeah.

1419
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,520
I think when it came to racing games this year, I think I like Burnout a little more

1420
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,520
because thereís more fire than there is in Excite Truck.

1421
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,520
Yeah.

1422
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
No, no Excite Truck was better.

1423
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
Alright.

1424
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,520
Well, what was the worst game of 2006 in your opinion?

1425
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
Well, I actually have to jump on the bandwagon and say Sonic the Hedgehog, because I actually

1426
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,520
played that.

1427
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,680
Iíve only been really getting into video games heavily within the last two months,

1428
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,320
I would say, like in the last year or whatever, you know.

1429
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:36,420
So like, and that was one of the games I played, and that was so god-awful, I just could not

1430
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:37,420
play it.

1431
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,240
I just, it was just god-damn awful.

1432
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,480
But you played the old Sonics, right?

1433
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,480
Yeah.

1434
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,480
And you loved those games.

1435
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,440
My favorite, one of my favorite games ever is Sonic the Hedgehog 2.

1436
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,760
So where did Sega fuck up?

1437
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,680
They just, they went, see, and I liked Sonic Adventure when it came out for the Dreamcast.

1438
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,520
I really liked that game, so I think they can do it right when they do 3D.

1439
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:02,400
But I just, I think their execution and the control and everything was just, it was too

1440
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,920
much this time.

1441
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:08,360
And they could execute it right, because I did like that other game.

1442
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,320
Alright, well thereís four boxes left on the table.

1443
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,760
Tell me which box do you want to open.

1444
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,320
Box number two.

1445
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,960
Like, shit.

1446
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,120
Thatís what number two is.

1447
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:26,840
Alright, letís open up box number two for extrovert.

1448
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,760
What did you think was the best retro revival of 2006, meaning the best game that made it

1449
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,840
like a comeback in 2006?

1450
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,440
I donít have an answer for that, because I donít.

1451
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,400
You better come up with one.

1452
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:50,320
I think that the best, Iím going to say Bomberman Act Zero.

1453
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,640
Why Bomberman Act Zero?

1454
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:56,960
Because it was so goddamn stylish, and they just raped all the gamers on that one.

1455
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,120
I just have to, I have to give it to them.

1456
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,080
Wasnít it Konami that made that game?

1457
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,600
Yeah, I think so, Hudsonís Branch or whatever, yeah.

1458
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,560
Good job, what I have to say.

1459
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,000
Best revival ever.

1460
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,880
Iím having, Iím getting an orgasm in my pants just thinking about it.

1461
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,400
Well, speaking of which, we want to know your opinion on news stories.

1462
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,760
The Nintendo console, because youíve been playing a lot of the Wii, and one big news

1463
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,720
story this year was that originally that system was going to be called the Nintendo Revolution,

1464
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,720
right?

1465
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,840
But they changed their mind somewhere along the line, and they decided that the name of

1466
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:34,480
the console was going to be the Nintendo Wii, and folks just, you know, they went nuts.

1467
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,200
They said, like, you know, they made every Wii joke under the sun, and still do to this

1468
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,200
day.

1469
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,480
What was your reaction when you heard that Nintendoís new console was going to be called

1470
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,480
the Wii?

1471
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:49,640
I think it was a lot like everyone elseís, like, huh, like, what, I donít understand

1472
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:55,480
how you can go from revolution to Wii, but then it really was a good business decision

1473
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,760
on their part, I think, because people, itís different, you know, and youíll remember

1474
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,760
Wii.

1475
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,880
I mean, you will, itís just one fucking syllable, you know, itís like, I said fucking right

1476
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:13,680
there, but anyhow, itís one fucking syllable, and thereís also, you know, thereís just,

1477
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,560
everybody knows what it is, you know, it was easier to market, I think, when, if it was

1478
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:24,360
the Nintendo Revolution, it would, I think, be going back, you know, going backwards,

1479
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:29,520
because youíre used to having video game consoles with those kinds of names, you know.

1480
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,080
And penis jokes, have you been making a lot of Wii jokes this year?

1481
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:36,360
Actually, yes, I have, Iíve been Can you tell us one of your best Wii jokes?

1482
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:45,160
No, no I canít, actually, I can say, though, that when I was waiting in line for the Wii,

1483
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:51,080
you pretty much heard every, every Wii joke you could possibly hear, and that was kind

1484
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,640
of amusing, because everybody was just making them all night.

1485
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,360
I think a lot of them originated from our part of the line.

1486
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,400
I wasnít there, I was sleeping.

1487
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,400
Yeah.

1488
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,240
I played with my Wii and then went to sleep.

1489
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:04,580
We woke you up.

1490
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,580
It did.

1491
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:11,280
Anyway, letís thank you guys to Xtifer and Rice Princess, thank you guys for coming on,

1492
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,280
we appreciate it.

1493
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,580
Alright, thereís three boxes left on the table, and hey, three hosts for the show,

1494
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:20,920
so Dark Sakura, one, two, or three?

1495
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:23,200
Uh, well, um, two.

1496
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,760
Two, you want two, alright, letís, oh, youíll let this one.

1497
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:26,760
Itís an even number.

1498
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,280
Alright, here we go, box number two.

1499
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,800
Dark Sakura, the best party game of 2006.

1500
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,120
Oh, fuck, I donít play party games.

1501
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:41,320
Everybody in the studio is getting one they canít do.

1502
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:42,320
I changed my box.

1503
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,320
No, you canít change the box.

1504
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,320
I returned this one for store credit.

1505
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:45,320
Nope, canít do that.

1506
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,680
Wasnít there a game that people would get together at your house and play a lot this

1507
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,680
year?

1508
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,680
No.

1509
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:52,680
Madden.

1510
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,680
Fuck.

1511
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,680
Madden.

1512
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,680
No.

1513
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,440
Um, okay, Iím gonna have to go though, Iím gonna go universal with party and say Animal

1514
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Crossing.

1515
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,440
Oh, okay.

1516
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:09,160
Because I got so many dirty letters from my friends, and so many people, I had someone

1517
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:14,160
going around in my village calling everyone a wanker, and then I had someone else say

1518
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:17,160
shit face, and it was great.

1519
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
Thatís so mature.

1520
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,160
Thatís awesome.

1521
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:24,760
And, you know, putting, you know, putting dirty t-shirts in my shop, and it was pretty

1522
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,760
fun.

1523
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,760
Alright.

1524
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,500
Now, the news story we want to know your opinion on, and that would be, remember when Bully,

1525
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,160
the game Bully on the Playstation 2 was first released?

1526
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:37,720
Which controversy when they discovered that your character, a boy, can kiss another boy

1527
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:38,720
in the game?

1528
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,720
What did you think about that whole controversy?

1529
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:46,840
I thought that I really didnít care, because it was kind of, I was like, thatís cool,

1530
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,240
but these people are stupid.

1531
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:49,240
What people?

1532
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,840
The people who were all up in arms over it.

1533
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,240
Like Tack Jomsom?

1534
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,240
Oh, God.

1535
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,580
Thatís somebody who just needs to get butt raped with a corn cob.

1536
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:03,520
Do they need to do more of this type of content in games?

1537
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,520
Yes.

1538
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,120
We need more hot gay action.

1539
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,840
Do you think gay gaming is fairly represented in games today?

1540
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,320
Well, not really, because I think a lot of itís more sensationalized, you know, because

1541
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:19,520
like, oh, if we put two hot chicks, you know, kissing, then itíll attract the straight

1542
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,520
white male quotient.

1543
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,660
No, they just need to have, like, actual just, they need what they need to, and I think this

1544
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,900
was in any media, they need to remove the sensational aspect from it and just make it

1545
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,480
like any other thing.

1546
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,480
You know?

1547
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,480
Itís normal.

1548
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:39,080
There are a vast number of people in the world who have normal, you know, I donít think

1549
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,920
that there should be any distinction made between, oh, straight people are normal, oh,

1550
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:47,800
gay people, you know, that big thing, it should just be no big deal.

1551
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,820
So yeah, so you think that they donít need to go out of their way to incorporate gay

1552
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:52,820
content in the games either?

1553
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:57,120
I think it should just be, you know, if this, if youíve written this character and this

1554
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,760
character, you know, sets off your gaydar, have them fuck a guy, I donít know.

1555
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,720
Then everything should be like The Sims, where itís just played however the hell you want.

1556
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:12,520
The Sims is the best, the best, I think, way theyíve done it, because itís either or,

1557
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,640
you know, and thereís tons of gay couples out there who adopt children, who, you know,

1558
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,840
get themselves artificially inseminated, who adopt, you know, I think that it should just

1559
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:27,040
be no big deal, it should just be, because I think, and this is how I feel about a lot

1560
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,120
of stuff, is that whenever you make a big deal about something, thereís gonna be other

1561
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,300
people who make a big deal about it, who treat it as some sort of pet topic, when really

1562
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,520
it should just be average, it should just be accepted.

1563
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,520
All right.

1564
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,520
So thatís what I think.

1565
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:41,520
All right.

1566
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:42,520
Thanks for your opinion.

1567
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:46,320
Now, we also want to know, what did you think was the best game of 2006, Dark Sakura?

1568
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,320
Cookie Mama.

1569
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,080
Why did I think you were gonna say that?

1570
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,360
Out of all the games, out of the Kingdom Hearts II, the Final Fantasy XII, the Oblivion, the

1571
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,280
Gears of War, you pick Cookie Mama.

1572
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:00,960
Because Iím still playing it, and Iíve been playing it, and I havenít put it down.

1573
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,280
Whatís so great, whatís so freaking great about Cookie Mama?

1574
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,880
Pulling the head off a shrimp.

1575
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,200
Chopping up meat.

1576
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,960
Are you excited about Cookie Mama Wii thatís coming out next year?

1577
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,560
Yeah, yeah, I want my Cookie Mama Wii.

1578
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,080
Worst game of 2006, Dark Sakura?

1579
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:21,040
I mean, Sonic, honestly.

1580
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,040
I canít help it.

1581
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,480
It was a complete and utter shite.

1582
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:29,400
I just was like, ìOh my God, itís a bad Sonic game.î

1583
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:33,800
And you have been a Sega fangirl for the longest time, so I ask you what I asked X to for.

1584
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Where did Sega go wrong?

1585
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:42,240
First of all, putting it on the PS3, and second of all, really crap control.

1586
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:51,360
I mean, overall, it looked like it had a lot of potential, but thereís so much glitchy

1587
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,360
bullshit in it.

1588
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:58,120
I think if they tightened up the control, or maybe even, I donít know if they did,

1589
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:04,600
but used the engine from Sonic Adventure, even with the glitches in that game, you could

1590
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,560
still play through it, and it was a good game.

1591
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:11,000
They need to really have that tightness of control that Sonic Adventure had.

1592
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,680
Alright, well thanks for your opinion.

1593
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,400
We know you always like to interject it.

1594
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:15,720
My opinion is awesome.

1595
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,680
Loki, thereís two boxes left.

1596
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,680
One or two.

1597
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,760
Donít be reading off the screen.

1598
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,760
One or two.

1599
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,760
I canít see the screen.

1600
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:22,760
Good.

1601
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,760
Two.

1602
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,600
Iím so glad you picked this one.

1603
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,920
Best sports title in 2006.

1604
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,600
Best sports title in 2006.

1605
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,160
Actually, I would think...

1606
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,920
Not Tecmo Bowl, they didnít release Tecmo, well I guess Title Legends, no, Title Legends

1607
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,920
was last year.

1608
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,880
I would say actually, probably Wii Sports, since thatís really, you know, kind of everyone

1609
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,880
liked that.

1610
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,080
It was universally liked, and where itís like, you know, any EA sports game is pretty

1611
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:01,640
much, you know, youíre either a fan of it or, so Wii Sports was kind of that game that

1612
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,720
got people to cross over, even people that were like, ìI hate Madden, I donít want

1613
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,960
to play Madden,î which, you know, can be me sometimes.

1614
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,960
I loved Wii Sports.

1615
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:09,960
It was awesome.

1616
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah, Wii Sports was fun, and Madden, Iím sure, on the Wii is probably pretty fun.

1617
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,560
I know a lot of people were getting into that, that donít normally like football.

1618
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,760
I donít follow sports, so, you know, to play a sports game is just kind of, eh.

1619
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:27,320
I donít know what, you know, who anyone is, or what the teamís, you know, strengths and

1620
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,800
weaknesses are.

1621
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,280
You kind of have to be a fan of the sport to be able to play the game well, you know,

1622
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,160
because you have to know the strengths of each player and stuff, and since I donít

1623
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:40,920
do that, nor, you know, I wouldnít be able to be any good at it.

1624
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,360
I have to ask you about this one, because, yeah, I think Wii Sports would have been my

1625
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,680
answer to this, too, but if I went outside that and wanted to pick an actual sports title,

1626
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:50,080
I think I actually would have picked Rockstarís Table Tennis.

1627
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,200
Did you like that game?

1628
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:57,040
I didnít really play that game that much, and, no, Table Tennis, you know, I still have

1629
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,000
trouble thinking that thatís a sport.

1630
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Itís fun.

1631
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,920
It was way better than, like, Topspin 2 was.

1632
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,680
That was, like, one of the worst games I played this year.

1633
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,680
I donít know.

1634
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,760
I would say if I was going to pick a sports game, I would, you know, thatís even last

1635
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,760
year, though.

1636
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,240
I was going to say Project Gotham Racing 3, because racing is a sport.

1637
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,240
True.

1638
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,240
All right, all right.

1639
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:20,960
And so, if I were to say this year, then maybe best sports game, you know, Burnoutís not

1640
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:21,960
a sport.

1641
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:22,960
That doesnít really count.

1642
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,440
All right, and that leaves you with this news topic.

1643
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,880
Iím so excited you got this one.

1644
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:31,560
One thing that Sony announced at their press conference that suddenly kind of seemed to

1645
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,200
disappear throughout the year was the Eye of Judgment.

1646
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:40,840
Now, I remember Loki went off on the Eye of Judgment not too long ago on this program,

1647
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,440
but Loki, what are your thoughts on the Eye of Judgment?

1648
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:48,440
Does the PlayStation 3 need this, or does it need to just vaporize like it seems to

1649
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,440
have?

1650
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,920
I donít know if itís vaporizing, but some other things that they were talking about

1651
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:59,080
releasing, like the GPS system for the PSP and the camera for the PSP, those are supposed

1652
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:02,480
to be coming out fall of this year.

1653
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,480
Where are they?

1654
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:04,480
Oh!

1655
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,480
They didnít come out.

1656
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:11,880
Well, I guess the GPS came out in Japan, but the more that you think about it, those peripherals

1657
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,880
are just kind of lame.

1658
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:17,680
And the only thing about the Eye of Judgment, I mean, I guess it could be cool if it was

1659
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:21,960
just the eye toy and they were just kind of souping up the eye toy, that would be a little

1660
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,400
bit better to recognize your face and stuff like that and to be able to tell different

1661
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,720
things based on that.

1662
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:32,720
That would be cool, but this whole giant setup where they had like, almost looked like some

1663
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:38,160
sort of desk lamp stand with the camera pointing down at the paper, I mean, I canít see anyone

1664
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:44,160
actually setting that up to play a card game, which the game on PlayStation 3 itself does

1665
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,720
nothing other than kind of visualize, you know, card stuff.

1666
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:52,040
If it was like holographic or something, that would be pretty cool, but no, itís not.

1667
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:56,400
So why would you pay for a $600 console to play this really crappy card game that you

1668
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:01,360
have to set up this really elaborate set up to play, and to be honest, they also want

1669
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,520
you to buy these cards too, which, you know, all anyone has to do is scan it into their

1670
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:10,280
computer and then you can print it out on a piece of paper and play it the exact same

1671
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:11,280
way.

1672
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,640
So the whole idea is just utterly retarded.

1673
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,080
Alright, what would you say was the best video game in all of 2006, Logie?

1674
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:24,080
Thatís tough, because thereís a lot of games out there and, you know, Iíd say my favorite

1675
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:31,080
game of 2006, the one Iíve been playing the most of, well, Iíd have to say, you know,

1676
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,360
oddly enough, itís a tie between like Grand Theft Auto Vice City Stories and Liberty City

1677
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,360
Stories.

1678
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,400
Even though Liberty City Stories came out last year, the multiplayer is fun on those.

1679
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,440
Then Saints Row would have to be up there too, because Saints Row, I think right now

1680
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,000
Saints Row was the most fun for me on the 360.

1681
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,440
So which one of those would you put on the list?

1682
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,440
Saints Row.

1683
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:52,960
Saints Row.

1684
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
And why?

1685
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,680
Because you love gun games.

1686
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:01,680
I love sandbox games and theyíre just really fun and Crackdown I think is going to be really

1687
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:07,160
fun next year, but, you know, I donít know, weíll see if Microsoft is able to capture

1688
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,960
the same kind of feel as that.

1689
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,520
Really it doesnít matter next year anyways, because once Grand Theft Auto IV comes out,

1690
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:17,040
thereís no trumping it unless they really fuck it up, which is possible because they

1691
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,480
fucked up the multiplayer every single Grand Theft Auto PSP version thatís come out, yet

1692
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,160
we still seem to play it and kind of just, you know, accept the really glitchiness of

1693
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:30,720
the game and, I donít know, itíll be fun multiplayer I think.

1694
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,960
Alright, and the worst game of 2006.

1695
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,920
Oh man, the worst game of 2006.

1696
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,120
You know, everyoneís singing Sonic the Hedgehog and I think theyíre saying that because itís

1697
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,440
fresh in their mind, but actually Sonic isnít that bad of a game, I mean, just the controls

1698
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,760
are a little bit crappy, but I wouldnít say itís the worst game of 2006, if anything

1699
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:54,000
I would go with some of the Ubisoft titles for the Wii that are really awful like, you

1700
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:02,800
know, Monster 4x4 World Circuit, but Iíd say overall the worst game of 2006, itís

1701
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:09,040
gotta be Bomberman because Bomberman, it was just a boring game and it wasnít really fun

1702
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:16,080
at all and, I donít know, itís just bad, but you know, if I were to, you know, peg

1703
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:19,240
a company as the worst company of 2006, itíd be Ubisoft.

1704
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:24,640
Alright, I mean, granted, I love Ghost Recon, it was fun to cheat in that game and thank

1705
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,360
God that they put cheat codes in the game that you can still get achievement points

1706
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:35,700
for, so props for them for that, but Iím sorry, you know, all their Wii launch titles,

1707
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,440
with the exception of Rayman being average suck balls.

1708
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:44,680
Alright, well, thereís one box left, so I guess I get to open it, so here I go.

1709
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:53,000
Hey, look, I got the million dollars, whoo, alright, no, I got a best use of music in

1710
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,960
a game and hands down Elite Beat Agents, hello, like, that was one of my favorite, definitely

1711
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,400
my top three of the whole year was that game.

1712
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:05,000
That game is incredible and, you know, some people criticize it for the song list, but

1713
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,280
I thought it was actually kind of fun and it made you appreciate maybe songs that you

1714
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:13,520
had forgot about and the covers were, you know, well done and yes, even Ashley Simpsonís

1715
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,400
song was actually kind of fun in the game.

1716
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,640
The gameís got a great sense of humor, itís one of the most hilarious games Iíve played

1717
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:21,640
and it keeps you coming back because itís got a lot of difficulty, you know, levels

1718
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,880
in it and multiplayer.

1719
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,080
The game is incredible and horribly, horribly underrated, I think more people should be

1720
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:31,600
checking out Elite Beat Agents, absolutely the best use of music in a game, in 2006.

1721
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:37,320
And then the news topic I have would be the horse armor expansion for Oblivion.

1722
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
That was retarded.

1723
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,960
And this would be what, the topic or the horse armor?

1724
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:41,960
No, the horse armor.

1725
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,720
Because at Oblivion, when I think of games that have great add-ons, Oblivion is like

1726
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,720
at the top of the list.

1727
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,320
You know, this horse armor was one little bump in the road of otherwise what was an

1728
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:53,200
awesome expandable game was Oblivion.

1729
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,440
Probably the best expansions of the year was Oblivion.

1730
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,400
But this horse armor, man, when it first came out a lot of people were like 250 points for

1731
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,420
some frigginí horse armor, what the F?

1732
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,720
You know, and I kind of agree.

1733
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:07,560
And this just goes along in general with some of these downloads that companies have put

1734
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,560
up this year.

1735
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,040
Itís gonna help us think about as well EAís pay to cheat system.

1736
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,040
Thatís dumb.

1737
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,040
Yeah.

1738
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:17,680
Itís dumb especially when you have games, like I said, like Ghost Recon, Advanced Warfighter,

1739
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,440
that the cheats are in there and you still get achievement points.

1740
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:24,920
I mean, grand, you canít use them online, but itís easy achievement points.

1741
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:25,920
I mean, thatís awesome.

1742
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:27,840
Youíre an achievement point whore.

1743
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,520
What kind of expansions would you like to see available on Marketplace in 2007?

1744
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,880
Saints Row would be, you know, what theyíre doing with like Crackdown, for example, theyíre

1745
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,880
gonna have actually portions of the city that theyíre gonna add later on.

1746
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,880
Thatís cool.

1747
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:44,200
And theyíve built the game with that kind of expansions in mind.

1748
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:47,880
Saints Row would have been cool with some, you know, theyíre doing like maps and stuff.

1749
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:50,740
And actually theyíve had some pretty good stuff.

1750
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,960
Maybe more missions would be kind of cool or like a whole other section of the game.

1751
01:26:54,960 --> 01:27:00,100
I definitely think in, as far as Xbox 360 goes, you know, they need more RPGs.

1752
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,600
They need their Blue Dragon this year.

1753
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:03,760
They need some of those other titles to come out.

1754
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,580
And I love side quests, man.

1755
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,000
Those downloadable side quests was an awesome idea for Oblivion and really, really adds

1756
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,880
just hundreds and hundreds of hours to that game.

1757
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,920
So itís great.

1758
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,540
That is all 15 boxes.

1759
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,200
We made it all the way through.

1760
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,200
Can you believe it?

1761
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,200
Oh, my best and worst.

1762
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,640
I gotta say mine because we gotta tally it up, huh?

1763
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:20,640
You know what?

1764
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:26,280
I wish Bethesda would make a game like Oblivion but set in modern day so I can have the guns

1765
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,800
and be able to exert my, you know, power over the Woodlands.

1766
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,360
Do you think thereíll be an Elder Scrolls V though?

1767
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,240
Of course thereís gonna be an Elder Scrolls V.

1768
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:36,960
I heard it here first.

1769
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,480
Of course thereís gonna be.

1770
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:39,480
All right.

1771
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:41,200
Well, my favorite game of the year, itís really close.

1772
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:46,760
I really want to say Oblivion but, you know, and itís a great game, donít get me wrong.

1773
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,000
It would definitely be my number two pick but I would say the best game of the year.

1774
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,820
It has to be Zelda, Twilight Princess.

1775
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:56,400
I mean, it really took everything that was about, even though the game was developed

1776
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,580
originally for the GameCube, yeah, whatever, it really does show what the Wii is capable

1777
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:04,860
of doing to what you always thought about the games that you played.

1778
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:05,860
You know what I mean?

1779
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:10,160
Itís a prime example of that and I think it really is kind of everything the Wii stands

1780
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,240
for and itís absolutely the greatest game to have come out this year and well worth

1781
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:14,240
the wait.

1782
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:19,000
I mean, tons of playability and great puzzles and, you know, just fun.

1783
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,640
Itís a different playing experience, something you would never have had before, I think.

1784
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,060
Itís something new.

1785
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,840
So thatís why it stands out in my mind as the best game of 2006.

1786
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,840
Worst game of 2006?

1787
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:30,840
Iím with Loki.

1788
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Itís Bomberman X0.

1789
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,840
Absolutely.

1790
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,400
I mean, how can you fuck up a franchise like Bomberman, okay?

1791
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:41,820
Fucking up Sonic, I can see that but fucking up Bomberman, my God, I think Bomberman would

1792
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:46,400
have been so much better if they just had compacted it to 50 megs and made it an Xbox

1793
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,400
Live title.

1794
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,820
The biggest problem with Bomberman is that it was a piece of shit game that they put

1795
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:52,400
out for $60.

1796
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,400
I love you, Konami.

1797
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:58,120
You did some great work this year but this game was somebody made a really bad decision

1798
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,120
toÖ

1799
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:02,800
Iím thinking what happened is that there were some deadlines that had to be met so

1800
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,720
this game got out and itís just so obvious and the final product is not even funny.

1801
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,720
The problem with some of these companies though is they forget that, you know, theyíre screwing

1802
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:14,880
up like the simple stuff, the stuff thatís like essential, that would be the first thing

1803
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:15,880
Iíd check.

1804
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:21,720
Like, no save system, yeah, that might be important, you know, putting a save system.

1805
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:27,060
Gee, I can do multiplayer on live but I canít do it in the same room when I could at E3.

1806
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:33,320
That is the biggest sign to me that something got really fucked up in the development process.

1807
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,800
And the whole thing with Bomberman is like, ìOh, wow, that looks kind of cool, you know,

1808
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,880
when they show the videos and stuff.î It would have been cool as like an action game,

1809
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,640
maybe like MDK or something like that, you know, where like letís just kind of branch

1810
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:48,680
the franchise a little bit off differently and then you could have, you know, the party

1811
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,120
mode or the classic mode or something like that.

1812
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:56,640
Youíre charging people $60 for what essentially is an Xbox Live arcade game, thatís the only

1813
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:01,720
good aspect of the game is playing it on live and because the gameís $60 and nobody has

1814
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:05,360
it, so you canít even find people on live to play it with.

1815
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,520
They just made like some huge mistakes with that game, they just ruined it, absolutely

1816
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:12,200
ruined it and made it the worst game of 2006.

1817
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,240
So now weíve got to tally it up, letís look, letís see, weíre going to tally up the votes.

1818
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,160
Letís start with the worst game of 2006.

1819
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:25,640
It looks like, tallying it up, we had two votes for Totem Ball, two votes for Bomberman

1820
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:31,340
but it looks like between Black Wolf, Extrofer and Dark Sakura, Sonic the Hedgehog with three

1821
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,680
votes is the worst game of 2006.

1822
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:40,680
Sorry Sega, it wasnít that bad but you know what though, at least you get a second chance

1823
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,960
with Sonic and the Secret Rings.

1824
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:48,500
I agree they can redeem themselves but seriously, do a focus group or something with this game

1825
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,060
next time.

1826
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,360
Anybody could have told you the controls were fucked.

1827
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,760
Well hereís the thing too, they made this game like Shadow the Hedgehog, Shadow the

1828
01:30:54,760 --> 01:31:01,440
Hedgehog got shitty ass reviews so the problem is you can only make a Sonic game so fast

1829
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:28,040
before it becomes uncontrollable.
