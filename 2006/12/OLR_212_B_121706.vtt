00:00.000 --> 00:22.400
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.800
This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.040
the last live segment of 2006.

00:31.040 --> 00:35.280
We'll still have some more stuff going to our audio archive, podcast, audio RSS, whatever

00:35.280 --> 00:36.280
you call it.

00:36.280 --> 00:37.760
We'll still have some more audio going there.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.240
We are going to bring you some specials for Christmas week and New Year's week, but since

00:41.240 --> 00:44.760
Sunday our live night happens to be Christmas eve and New Year's eve, we're going to be

00:44.760 --> 00:46.720
taking a couple weeks off from live.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.300
And I'll tell you what, for those of you guys that don't listen live, you missed a great

00:51.300 --> 00:54.220
live only segment this week because we've got to do some special stuff for our live

00:54.220 --> 00:58.120
listeners where we just had an amazing gift exchange and we were just all high on the

00:58.120 --> 01:01.800
love in the studio and just gushing, so it was an amazing time.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.080
You can catch it on all games radio though.

01:04.080 --> 01:10.080
They get access to the live part too and that airs our rebroadcast Monday at 5 o'clock Pacific

01:10.080 --> 01:14.520
Standard Time on allgames.com and then Tuesday I believe only one time at 9 o'clock because

01:14.520 --> 01:19.840
we're so freaking long that they can only afford to air it one time.

01:19.840 --> 01:24.680
Let's get back into some gaming news because our live listeners have been waiting a while

01:24.680 --> 01:26.900
for us to get back into some gaming news.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.260
This was a huge story this week.

01:29.260 --> 01:34.420
The Nintendo Wii Mote, now I got some email messages and some text messages and phones

01:34.420 --> 01:38.980
from listeners and people going, did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?

01:38.980 --> 01:44.080
Somebody hit a panic button, so I want to clarify right now, the Wiis were not recalled.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.400
I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.

01:46.400 --> 01:53.040
What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps which

01:53.040 --> 01:58.420
are six tenths of a millimeter in diameter for a new beefed up strap that is one millimeter

01:58.420 --> 01:59.480
in diameter.

01:59.480 --> 02:03.620
This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are

02:03.620 --> 02:07.660
breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.

02:07.660 --> 02:12.740
You've probably seen that site, wehaveaproblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up

02:12.740 --> 02:13.740
there.

02:13.740 --> 02:21.340
I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo tested them, they withstand about 50 pounds

02:21.340 --> 02:22.340
of pressure.

02:22.340 --> 02:26.920
So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress

02:26.920 --> 02:28.420
that should be applied to these things.

02:28.420 --> 02:32.980
So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they are offering this program

02:32.980 --> 02:38.420
for anybody who has a concern.

02:38.420 --> 02:43.660
I've been playing the Wii for a long time, I can't imagine how that thing would break.

02:43.660 --> 02:46.820
If it was starting to break, I think I'd be able to tell pretty quickly.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.260
So people have really got to be going crazy.

02:49.260 --> 02:52.460
So let me ask a couple questions here first and a lot of questions people have been asking

02:52.460 --> 02:56.160
themselves this week.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.020
These people that have the broken Wii straps, are they doing something wrong?

03:00.020 --> 03:01.200
Is it a fluke?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
What's the issue?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.200
Mass stupidity.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.800
Think across the board, you don't think there's flukes out there?

03:07.800 --> 03:10.680
There may be very few if any.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.380
I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to

03:15.380 --> 03:17.860
swing this just like a baseball bat.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.260
I'm going to backhand this this way.

03:20.260 --> 03:26.500
I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.

03:26.500 --> 03:31.220
The thing is, is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii

03:31.220 --> 03:34.620
sports games or any of the others.

03:34.620 --> 03:41.300
These people are basically using the system in a way other than, I think, intent because

03:41.300 --> 03:46.420
there was even a warning put out for using the Wii mote.

03:46.420 --> 03:50.420
If you give me a moment, I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal,

03:50.420 --> 03:52.500
except she replaced Wii with penis.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.660
They basically need to just, you know, calm down.

03:55.660 --> 03:59.140
They're really kind of swinging the remote really fast.

03:59.140 --> 04:03.580
I saw a video of one that went through like a wall or something like that because and

04:03.580 --> 04:05.140
they were showing how they were playing with it.

04:05.140 --> 04:10.620
The guy was like throwing like he was doing like a professional baseball toss or something.

04:10.620 --> 04:15.900
Question number two, would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional

04:15.900 --> 04:19.640
videos we've seen from the Wii because Nintendo kind of says one thing that you don't need

04:19.640 --> 04:24.060
to move the Wii mote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting

04:24.060 --> 04:25.940
into it when it's like on the news and everything.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.260
Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?

04:28.260 --> 04:32.100
Even though they may be flailing around like looking like complete idiots, they are not

04:32.100 --> 04:33.860
doing it uncontrollably.

04:33.860 --> 04:39.420
I mean, when they're showing them, you know, diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii

04:39.420 --> 04:41.700
test, they're not swinging super hard.

04:41.700 --> 04:45.660
They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.

04:45.660 --> 04:52.620
Okay, here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.080
Safety information for playing Wii.

04:54.080 --> 04:58.220
As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii remote, we would like you to

04:58.220 --> 05:02.100
take a few minutes to review some important safety information, which when followed will

05:02.100 --> 05:04.540
help ensure a fun playing experience for all.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.180
One, wear the wrist strap.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.840
Make sure that all players using the Wii remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has

05:09.840 --> 05:12.300
been tightened using the strap lock.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.880
When sharing the Wii remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the

05:15.880 --> 05:19.280
Wii remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.680
Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii remote from flying across the room

05:21.680 --> 05:23.540
if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.260
Now the second part is the important one.

05:25.260 --> 05:28.740
Two, hold the Wii remote firmly and do not let go.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.020
Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii remote during

05:32.020 --> 05:34.540
gameplay and do not use excessive motion.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.620
For example, in Wii sports bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is

05:38.620 --> 05:40.860
to release the B button on the Wii remote.

05:40.860 --> 05:44.380
Do not let go of the Wii remote itself in bold letters.

05:44.380 --> 05:48.700
If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.

05:48.700 --> 05:52.460
If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii remote, the wrist strap may break

05:52.460 --> 05:54.460
and you could lose control of the Wii remote.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.600
This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.920
They said this in their warning.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.720
You people are stupid!

06:01.720 --> 06:04.040
Okay, interesting comments from chat, I want to say here.

06:04.040 --> 06:08.240
BearWhoDriveCars says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that

06:08.240 --> 06:11.420
stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.420
By the way, I love that nickname.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.420
Well, the thing...

06:13.420 --> 06:16.760
Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangetonsradio.com.

06:16.760 --> 06:21.520
Airtoast says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.520
Interesting thought.

06:22.520 --> 06:26.440
It wouldn't have been any good if people were letting go of it anyway.

06:26.440 --> 06:31.160
The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically, you're dealing

06:31.160 --> 06:34.240
with basic laws of physics.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.960
You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.

06:38.960 --> 06:47.200
Darkknight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt happy fun Wiimote.

06:47.200 --> 06:51.800
Winner.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.240
Question number three, will Nintendo get sued over this?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.240
No.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.240
Yes.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.240
Yes, they will.

06:57.240 --> 06:59.760
And they will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.760
Amen.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.960
No, okay.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.960
Will they attempt to get sued?

07:02.960 --> 07:03.960
No.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
Will it go through?

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
No.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
Okay, having taken business law...

07:06.960 --> 07:13.400
Hold on, I'm getting Dark Sakura's soapbox, let's see, I'm going to pull it out of the

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
closet here.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.840
Hey, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.760
Anyway, the whole, all right, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened

07:25.760 --> 07:29.960
a while back in Oklahoma, and you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.

07:29.960 --> 07:35.680
There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker, and it said, do not

07:35.680 --> 07:38.040
allow small children within so many feet of it.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.040
Well, the little kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped

07:42.040 --> 07:46.340
off with a weed whacker when it recoiled off a rock.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.720
Not a default in the object itself, but the company still got sued and they won.

07:50.720 --> 07:57.120
The thing is, is that with any type of material object, any type of device, where Nintendo

07:57.120 --> 08:02.240
is going to have to prove is that the device is being used improperly.

08:02.240 --> 08:07.760
That enough warning was given for proper use of the system for them to have a defense against.

08:07.760 --> 08:14.120
If Nintendo did not provide enough anti-stupidity warnings, because keep in mind, like Bill

08:14.120 --> 08:19.880
Engvall says, the reason why we have warnings on everything is because stupid people have

08:19.880 --> 08:22.880
done it.

08:22.880 --> 08:30.600
Legend of Zaku in Chat says, Tack Jomson says, Wiimote is a murder simulator.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.600
Fuck simulating, dude, you'll throw it through someone's head, actual murder.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.800
I think there was a YouTube video of that.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.680
Anyway, we welcome your thoughts on that, Bill.

08:37.680 --> 08:43.720
To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.800
Nintendo's duty of responsibility is to make the warning available.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.840
I'd like to mention though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about,

08:51.840 --> 09:00.360
you know, federal government agencies looking into this, and apparently there have been

09:00.360 --> 09:09.040
recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.040
That is it.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.880
I mean, this isn't like killing people.

09:12.880 --> 09:18.200
This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV, you know, I caused

09:18.200 --> 09:22.080
a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week, I mean, just stupid shit like that.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.080
I just want to say this real quick.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.160
I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.100
Funny Dale in our chat room says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering

09:30.100 --> 09:34.800
a recall, and then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's

09:34.800 --> 09:35.800
a problem.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.120
Well, they didn't, it's a gray area, they didn't admit there's a problem per se.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.640
I see this as a cover your ass, I think it's a cover your ass, I think.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.200
It's the same thing with, remember the Pokémon toys that Burger King was putting out, and

09:47.200 --> 09:52.160
the babies were suffocating on the ball, when it clearly said, do not let anyone under three

09:52.160 --> 09:54.640
years of age have a Poké Ball?

09:54.640 --> 09:56.080
Or they might get trapped inside.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.800
The duty of responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.280
Babymon, I choose you!

10:02.280 --> 10:08.080
But hey, but it is a likely thing, babies will put stuff in their mouths.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.840
They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.

10:10.840 --> 10:17.640
So it was really the parents' responsibility, but Burger King still recalled the Poké Balls,

10:17.640 --> 10:21.880
so that they would not be held further liable for damages.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.880
And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.400
Now here's the thing I have to ask you.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.880
We have to keep it moving after this comment.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.200
Okay, if, like for example, if I have a baseball bat, and I throw the baseball bat and it hits

10:33.200 --> 10:36.880
someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.

10:36.880 --> 10:42.640
I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company for the injury caused by that baseball

10:42.640 --> 10:43.640
bat.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
Same thing goes with the Wiimote.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.040
I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through

10:48.040 --> 10:53.360
your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself, because you're an idiot.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.360
It's as simple as that.

10:55.360 --> 10:59.800
Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on

10:59.800 --> 11:04.200
the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.

11:04.200 --> 11:09.480
A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes, as the case

11:09.480 --> 11:15.880
would be with one that was posted here on Joystiq showing how easily it can be done.

11:15.880 --> 11:20.520
And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.

11:20.520 --> 11:25.120
Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw

11:25.120 --> 11:26.920
you, you're not helping.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.320
I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.

11:29.320 --> 11:33.600
I mean, what, I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills, and if you say

11:33.600 --> 11:37.600
on it it's a fake or whatever, you know, then fine, you know, have fun with your Photoshop

11:37.600 --> 11:38.720
abilities.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.680
But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously,

11:43.680 --> 11:44.800
screw you.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
Because you're not helping.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.240
You're the same people who are the stupid, lame people who sell PS3s.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.680
Why don't you make a sign that says, pay attention to me?

11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Anyway.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.440
Flip side of the argument is...

11:55.440 --> 11:59.400
Oh, by the way, audio archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment, because

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
they don't know you're here yet.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.400
So hi, Drew Nami.

12:01.400 --> 12:07.040
Flip side of the argument is, okay, they're showing how easily it can be Photoshopped,

12:07.040 --> 12:11.880
showing how easily the people who are bringing it to court could be faking it with quote

12:11.880 --> 12:13.360
unquote photographic evidence.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.360
Oh, yeah, I don't have a problem with the demonstration.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.320
There could be a public service in that way.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.120
I don't, I don't, I don't mind that.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.440
I don't mind when they're saying, hey, look, look how easily this can be faked.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.660
I mind the people that are trying to pass off the fake things as real.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.880
That's what I mind.

12:27.880 --> 12:35.520
They're the same people, they are in the same category as people who sell PS3s on eBay.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.720
We can't go back to that subject.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
We'll be here all night.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
All right.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
Well, how about some good news?

12:39.720 --> 12:40.720
Yes, please.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.800
Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?

12:42.800 --> 12:44.280
Please say Kid Icarus.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.280
Not yet.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
Guardian Legend.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
Crystalis.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.280
Blaster Master.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.280
Bible Adventure.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.280
No.

12:50.280 --> 12:56.800
Street Fighter II is, the World Warrior is going to be heading to, Capcom finally loves

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
us.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.800
Another, though.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.600
But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.600
Yeah.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
So what?

13:03.600 --> 13:07.800
But a number of other games are going to be coming.

13:07.800 --> 13:14.120
There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch Out, and hey Rob, Kid Icarus.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.120
Fuck yes.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.120
Thank you.

13:16.120 --> 13:22.320
So, but Capcom is starting to eke him out.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
We love you, Capcom.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.320
Sort of.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.320
Leave my phone.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.520
Hold on a minute.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.240
If Street Fighter II comes out on virtual console, this will cost me eight dollars,

13:31.240 --> 13:32.240
yes?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
Yeah.

13:33.240 --> 13:38.000
Could I not for two dollars more get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on

13:38.000 --> 13:43.580
Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?

13:43.580 --> 13:46.000
What if you don't own an Xbox?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Okay.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.960
But that would be the only reason you should get this then.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.680
Because if you have an Xbox- Not everybody is in the same financial bracket

13:52.680 --> 13:54.440
or nerdom as us.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.000
No, I understand that.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
That's fine.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.440
I'm just saying, if you're in the- Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.920
You have them both, okay?

14:02.920 --> 14:04.000
Seriously.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Why would you buy this?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Why not?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Why not?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.160
Well, because you have a better version for two dollars more on the 360.

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
Rob.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.160
What?

14:13.160 --> 14:14.160
I have it on MAME.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.160
I have it on the Genesis.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.920
Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.560
I have it on the fucking Saturn.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.600
And you'll buy this on virtual console?

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Probably.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
You sad, sad woman.

14:25.600 --> 14:26.600
Rob.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.600
Why would you buy Metal Slug?

14:27.600 --> 14:28.600
I don't really.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.360
Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?

14:32.360 --> 14:34.080
I have Metal Slug on Wii.

14:34.080 --> 14:39.600
I hope- Why would people buy horse turds?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.400
Because they like the PlayStation 3.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.400
Because they're large and smelly.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Because they like to beat them to their dogs.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
Seriously.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.400
Hey, Chaz, you want some ice for that burn?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
Anyways.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
Seriously.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.400
All right.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.720
Well, I hope that game comes out soon.

14:52.720 --> 14:58.560
Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working

14:58.560 --> 15:03.240
on another Zelda title for the Wii.

15:03.240 --> 15:08.800
This one that they were making on GameCube was just going on and stuff, but this whole

15:08.800 --> 15:11.880
time since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back

15:11.880 --> 15:15.480
and made the Wii Hansmans or whatever you want to call it.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.200
This all- It really does look like a GameCube game on

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
the Wii.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.440
Well, that there is another Zelda game possibly sooner than you might think.

15:22.440 --> 15:26.320
This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnezine.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.320
Very interesting.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.040
I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.620
I like the way it looked.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.680
The cel shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't

15:35.680 --> 15:41.160
really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to

15:41.160 --> 15:45.480
go to make a really good-looking game.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.480
Hope for that.

15:47.480 --> 15:53.080
Now, I mentioned I think a few weeks ago that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but

15:53.080 --> 15:57.760
of course, if you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that,

15:57.760 --> 16:08.200
you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit WirelessSensorBar.com,

16:08.200 --> 16:13.040
and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt

16:13.040 --> 16:14.040
battery.

16:14.040 --> 16:23.860
It can give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play, so interesting if you have a projection screen

16:23.860 --> 16:27.680
set up for your Wii, definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than

16:27.680 --> 16:31.800
the cord there, so that might be the way to go.

16:31.800 --> 16:39.040
Or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy.

16:39.040 --> 16:46.120
Speaking of other things for the Wii, now this makes me particularly happy.

16:46.120 --> 16:51.080
It's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii, and for anyone who doesn't know,

16:51.080 --> 16:57.960
the freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on

16:57.960 --> 16:59.680
your system.

16:59.680 --> 17:05.040
I've got one for my GameCube, fabulous thing, I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul

17:05.040 --> 17:12.400
Calibur thanks to that, and I have not yet tried my freeloader on the Wii, because our

17:12.400 --> 17:18.260
Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house, but they don't

17:18.260 --> 17:22.820
have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is,

17:22.820 --> 17:42.560
I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games,

17:42.560 --> 17:46.880
because you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did, but one way or another, Europe

17:46.880 --> 17:51.360
has sold a lot of Wii's, you know, it just recently launched over there this past week,

17:51.360 --> 17:59.020
and they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days, and of course, just like here in the US, Zelda

17:59.020 --> 18:04.420
Twilight Princess, being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying

18:04.420 --> 18:11.340
off shelves at the retail price of 179 pounds, by the way, that's $350 US, and considering

18:11.340 --> 18:15.880
we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas

18:15.880 --> 18:19.180
getting screwed a little bit on the price point, sorry guys, don't know what to tell

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
you.

18:20.180 --> 18:26.900
So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii, I know people that might not

18:26.900 --> 18:34.560
have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter,

18:34.560 --> 18:41.140
but fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB ethernet

18:41.140 --> 18:50.460
device with, from actual, like Newegg, they're selling one for $19.99, and it's an ethernet

18:50.460 --> 19:00.580
adapter that you can buy, it's Kinemax USB 2.0 to RJ45 fast ethernet 10-100 base T network

19:00.580 --> 19:06.140
adapter, that's a pretty long name there, but at least that's going to be out now, whereas

19:06.140 --> 19:11.740
the USB one from Nintendo probably won't be out until next year, so if you need wired

19:11.740 --> 19:14.740
internet, that's the way to go.

19:14.740 --> 19:19.180
I thought my friend had this whole thing already, like the Nintendo already had this stuff out

19:19.180 --> 19:21.940
on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?

19:21.940 --> 19:25.540
Well, that's the Wi-Fi Max, that's that USB thing for wireless internet, this actually

19:25.540 --> 19:29.500
plugs into your Wii, and converts one of the USB ports to an ethernet port.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.280
Oh, okay, I get it, so it works the other way, instead of plugging it into your computer,

19:33.280 --> 19:34.940
you plug it into the Wii, I get it.

19:34.940 --> 19:40.100
Well, this is not for a wireless internet, this is wired internet, it's just a converter.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.660
Does it work if you have a USB router?

19:43.660 --> 19:47.060
I don't know, that's a good question.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.020
Try it, find out.

19:49.020 --> 19:53.180
Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email, because we

19:53.180 --> 19:55.140
like to read emails every week here on this program.

19:55.140 --> 20:04.060
One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lawns Radio is that it's not just

20:04.060 --> 20:08.100
us, because we're just some people on the internet just like you, and we know you have

20:08.100 --> 20:11.860
an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and

20:11.860 --> 20:13.580
one of those is the mailbag.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.700
Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of her favorite emails

20:16.700 --> 20:20.660
and shares them with you in our little segment we call the mailbag.

20:20.660 --> 20:21.660
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

20:21.660 --> 20:30.180
First email comes from our friend AZHP.

20:30.180 --> 20:35.980
Hey, OLR, I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called the

20:35.980 --> 20:40.700
year ahead in tech by some research analysts, a choice quote from it.

20:40.700 --> 20:44.460
Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.380
I should tell that to my co-workers.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.660
Please do.

20:49.660 --> 20:53.500
Sony will end up with egg on its face as Konami releases a Metal Gear game.

20:53.500 --> 20:59.100
I only coveted Sony Playstation exclusive on the Microsoft Xbox 360.

20:59.100 --> 21:04.420
Sony will also dramatically cut the price of its PSP handheld as a result of the constant

21:04.420 --> 21:06.940
beating administered by the Nintendo DS Lite.

21:06.940 --> 21:11.640
Microsoft will either cut or even completely eliminate the cost of its Xbox Live Gold online

21:11.640 --> 21:13.540
gaming service.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.940
So that was the quote.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.220
I would actually believe that.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.020
How do people this stupid get jobs?

21:19.020 --> 21:20.220
I would believe it.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.780
Well, let me finish reading.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.180
Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot

21:25.180 --> 21:26.180
this guy is.

21:26.180 --> 21:28.860
I would myself, but the email would get too long.

21:28.860 --> 21:35.420
Your show is now some of it.

21:35.420 --> 21:39.260
I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.

21:39.260 --> 21:44.660
However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii, on a Wii game coming up, I have a

21:44.660 --> 21:50.380
feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii or a game in the metal in the Metal

21:50.380 --> 21:51.380
Gear family.

21:51.380 --> 21:54.940
I get the sense that Konami is willing to risk something on every platform.

21:54.940 --> 21:59.500
So I think it will be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear

21:59.500 --> 22:02.180
thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami

22:02.180 --> 22:04.220
and some of the other big publishers.

22:04.220 --> 22:10.460
In regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down that they would make online competitive

22:10.460 --> 22:14.440
play free for everyone, that's actually come up before speculation-wise.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.660
So this person is actually not saying anything new.

22:16.660 --> 22:22.340
This whole thing started when gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier,

22:22.340 --> 22:25.900
and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star universe beta.

22:25.900 --> 22:29.660
Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different

22:29.660 --> 22:30.900
direction for a while now.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.580
So that's nothing new, actually.

22:32.580 --> 22:35.420
I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially

22:35.420 --> 22:40.100
if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these Xbox Live kits and stuff and now

22:40.100 --> 22:43.700
you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.

22:43.700 --> 22:48.980
I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining

22:48.980 --> 22:50.740
the bandwidth.

22:50.740 --> 22:56.060
I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for, so I think

22:56.060 --> 22:59.660
the competitive play is going to stay on gold and you're still going to have to pay for

22:59.660 --> 23:00.660
it.

23:00.660 --> 23:04.020
You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three

23:04.020 --> 23:05.620
months and then it's free afterwards.

23:05.620 --> 23:07.980
That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?

23:07.980 --> 23:10.700
I don't think it would work, not in the long run.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.180
These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.

23:13.180 --> 23:14.180
They are.

23:14.180 --> 23:20.720
However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver

23:20.720 --> 23:21.720
and silver.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.980
That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.

23:23.980 --> 23:26.500
They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there, why the hell not?

23:26.500 --> 23:29.660
It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.

23:29.660 --> 23:33.820
Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind

23:33.820 --> 23:34.820
of game.

23:34.820 --> 23:36.060
You just buy the game.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.060
Yeah.

23:37.060 --> 23:41.460
I wish it had more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.

23:41.460 --> 23:45.740
There's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you

23:45.740 --> 23:50.060
don't have to pay some monthly fee for and I think a lot of people would be looking for

23:50.060 --> 23:57.060
something like that.

24:20.060 --> 24:38.460
I

24:38.460 --> 24:42.580
was thinking about this whole PS3 versus Wii thing everyone is going off about and how

24:42.580 --> 24:47.260
Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.

24:47.260 --> 24:48.260
Too true.

24:48.260 --> 24:53.820
Well, I have an analogy, an analogy also has the word anal in it.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.940
Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo Generations.

24:56.940 --> 25:00.940
Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.

25:00.940 --> 25:05.580
Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader

25:05.580 --> 25:07.420
except better.

25:07.420 --> 25:08.580
Everyone knew what Nintendo was.

25:08.580 --> 25:14.540
Well, after those generations look at Nintendo now, they aren't exactly cheerleader worthy

25:14.540 --> 25:18.580
anymore even though this could change this generation.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.700
Could the same thing happen to Sony?

25:20.700 --> 25:25.620
Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.080
Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his bot

25:29.080 --> 25:31.580
the death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?

25:31.580 --> 25:33.460
He doesn't understand.

25:33.460 --> 25:39.780
I could kick his ass at any day and he knows it so there's no problem there.

25:39.780 --> 25:43.380
I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit just like Nintendo's did

25:43.380 --> 25:46.140
after the Super Nintendo, they are already freaking headed that way.

25:46.140 --> 25:50.860
So what do the world famous hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, www.orangetownsradio.com, think

25:50.860 --> 25:51.860
of this.

25:51.860 --> 25:57.220
PS, put an M in the middle of the PS and that's what Rob is going through right now, oh snap

25:57.220 --> 25:58.220
for reals.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.220
PMS3?

25:59.220 --> 26:04.580
Is that like some advanced form of PMS?

26:04.580 --> 26:06.780
Like it's mute to elbow.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.780
Jiranami says it's PMS Beyond.

26:08.780 --> 26:09.780
Alright, anyway.

26:09.780 --> 26:10.780
It's UPMS.

26:10.780 --> 26:11.780
We built PMS.

26:11.780 --> 26:18.740
Yeah, but I think that Sony is already heading down the pooper.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.860
In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons.

26:21.860 --> 26:25.500
Just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?

26:25.500 --> 26:29.060
And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when when we were doing the separate

26:29.060 --> 26:34.020
program one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360 people were comparing it to Dreamcast

26:34.020 --> 26:38.620
and I think the 360 is showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast so

26:38.620 --> 26:42.940
it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence and one

26:42.940 --> 26:48.740
could say that Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo

26:48.740 --> 26:53.300
64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge based and didn't go

26:53.300 --> 26:59.240
on to the CD and all that stuff and one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake

26:59.240 --> 27:03.940
here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat but it's still too soon to tell.

27:03.940 --> 27:08.700
The war ain't over yet, like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one so you

27:08.700 --> 27:14.500
never know what games might come out next year.

27:14.500 --> 27:23.260
I actually liked Blu-ray but I liked Betamax too and what happened to that, bastards?

27:23.260 --> 27:29.460
And you know what's funny, price aside, UMD's not bad either, price aside, that's the one

27:29.460 --> 27:30.460
problem I have with UMD.

27:30.460 --> 27:37.100
But now you go to Tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.

27:37.100 --> 27:42.260
Next one comes up from Misty, hey everyone, what's up, Misty here, thanks to the Podlines

27:42.260 --> 27:47.180
service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th St. Louis

27:47.180 --> 27:49.700
time of course because I was up anyway.

27:49.700 --> 27:54.740
Like usual on my days off from work I slept quite late, amen to that, I made it to the

27:54.740 --> 27:59.300
library before dark but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading

27:59.300 --> 28:03.620
the podcasts and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's

28:03.620 --> 28:07.300
no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.

28:07.300 --> 28:12.060
Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again, with a combination of the game center,

28:12.060 --> 28:16.780
the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online, heck

28:16.780 --> 28:21.120
I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.

28:21.120 --> 28:25.540
With that gone though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little

28:25.540 --> 28:28.660
time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.

28:28.660 --> 28:33.260
That tends to get me out at about midnight or 1am depending on the day, being too wired

28:33.260 --> 28:36.960
for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late

28:36.960 --> 28:39.620
as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.

28:39.620 --> 28:41.900
I can sympathize with that.

28:41.900 --> 28:47.420
I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime

28:47.420 --> 28:50.140
convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.

28:50.140 --> 28:52.140
Aren't you going to ASUN?

28:52.140 --> 28:53.140
Me?

28:53.140 --> 28:54.140
Yeah.

28:54.140 --> 28:55.140
Yes I am.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.140
Chris will be at ASUN.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.140
I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.140
Sweet.

28:58.140 --> 29:01.260
She's going to have some promo cards.

29:01.260 --> 29:02.260
In April we'll talk.

29:02.260 --> 29:03.260
Absolutely.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.980
Well, that's where the rest of this is where this email is heading.

29:05.980 --> 29:09.580
That reminds me, the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening

29:09.580 --> 29:12.340
to, from Podlines from my cell phone.

29:12.340 --> 29:15.800
I know this may be a stupid idea, but what the hell, I'm going to say it, why not come

29:15.800 --> 29:17.700
to ASUN and do a panel or something?

29:17.700 --> 29:21.580
I know the timing is not the best considering it's so soon after SakuraCon and halfway across

29:21.580 --> 29:24.380
the country, but at least my conscience is clear on the subject.

29:24.380 --> 29:28.940
Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing because remember, we don't get paid for doing

29:28.940 --> 29:34.340
this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing

29:34.340 --> 29:35.340
houses do.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.340
Hey, folks who run ASUN, send me a ticket.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.420
I'll come out and do a panel.

29:38.420 --> 29:41.300
But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart because she's already going for

29:41.300 --> 29:44.980
other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.

29:44.980 --> 29:49.100
I will go there and I will hand out lots of flyers.

29:49.100 --> 29:51.820
Actually I was thinking, I was going to ask you guys permission if I could get a shirt

29:51.820 --> 29:52.820
that said OLR on it.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.820
Of course.

29:53.820 --> 29:54.820
I could go around and people will know who I am.

29:54.820 --> 29:56.820
Hopefully by that time next year, we'll have official shirts.

29:56.820 --> 29:58.540
That's been an on and off again topic.

29:58.540 --> 30:01.220
And I'm going to be doing interviews and stuff like that because I really...

30:01.220 --> 30:02.220
Just look for the blue hair.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.220
Look for the blue hair.

30:03.220 --> 30:06.100
Yeah, I will have blue streaks in my hair, so I've got to have brown and powder blue

30:06.100 --> 30:07.100
hair.

30:07.100 --> 30:10.820
By the way, I also want to mention that what Misty refers to the Podline service is... Now

30:10.820 --> 30:12.100
we don't support this.

30:12.100 --> 30:14.700
This is another organization, but I will give it a shout out.

30:14.700 --> 30:18.740
Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio over the telephone

30:18.740 --> 30:28.080
by calling this number, one for long distance, area code 650-523-6855.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.540
Keep in mind that's not an official endorsement of the service.

30:30.540 --> 30:31.840
We don't know much about them.

30:31.840 --> 30:37.180
All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone,

30:37.180 --> 30:38.420
so use at your own risk.

30:38.420 --> 30:43.700
It's Podlines.net, but it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks

30:43.700 --> 30:47.420
who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that where they can't listen to the show on

30:47.420 --> 30:52.240
the go is easier, access to a computer 24-7, so that's kind of neat.

30:52.240 --> 30:58.340
This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard,

30:58.340 --> 30:59.340
but I'll read it anyway.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.340
You're getting drunk.

31:00.340 --> 31:01.340
Dude, I'm drunk.

31:01.340 --> 31:02.960
I love you, Rob.

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
My girlfriend love you too.

31:03.960 --> 31:04.960
Seriously, DMN?

31:04.960 --> 31:05.960
That man needs a cookie.

31:05.960 --> 31:12.060
DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself into AA, okay?

31:12.060 --> 31:15.060
That's all I have to say.

31:15.060 --> 31:19.980
And like Britney Spears, put some panties on.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.260
Yes, please DMN, put some panties on.

31:21.260 --> 31:24.900
That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.

31:24.900 --> 31:30.300
Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show, plug, plug, plug.

31:30.300 --> 31:31.940
Thank you.

31:31.940 --> 31:38.340
Anyway, this one comes from Michael, long time listener, first time emailer.

31:38.340 --> 31:43.700
I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style and

31:43.700 --> 31:46.460
the vocal mix you played sometime is fantastic.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.980
However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.

31:49.980 --> 31:52.620
I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate here.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.740
Any chance you could help?

31:54.740 --> 32:02.780
There is a Vincent de Mor compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, what's the other

32:02.780 --> 32:03.780
crap?

32:03.780 --> 32:05.300
Fly Away.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.300
All of those on it.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.460
Some of the dance manias do.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.300
So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.

32:11.300 --> 32:17.460
Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday

32:17.460 --> 32:21.700
night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up, but I didn't say that.

32:21.700 --> 32:26.100
No, but seriously though, if you do, and we would encourage that you get the originals,

32:26.100 --> 32:31.580
go CD Japan, go to some of the, in fact, I remember seeing on one of the TransNation

32:31.580 --> 32:32.580
CDs.

32:32.580 --> 32:42.260
I think it was the TransNation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition, has quite a number of

32:42.260 --> 32:45.580
really good trance stuff on it and one of them is Flotation.

32:45.580 --> 32:48.860
Was it Flotation or was it Fly Away?

32:48.860 --> 32:52.380
The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.

32:52.380 --> 32:57.500
I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.460
And the last one- No, wait, God damn it, Rob left the room.

33:01.460 --> 33:04.860
Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.

33:04.860 --> 33:12.140
This actually was sent to us by our friend, Rob, with two Bs.

33:12.140 --> 33:17.820
It was a story from a blog that he sent us that-

33:17.820 --> 33:28.780
Sorry, this won't make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout

33:28.780 --> 33:32.340
errors on our end and I don't know if that's live 365 or our fault, so I was just saying

33:32.340 --> 33:36.340
in studio if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled because

33:36.340 --> 33:37.340
I don't know what's going on.

33:37.340 --> 33:40.260
It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.

33:40.260 --> 33:43.980
I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us because it sends me several.

33:43.980 --> 33:47.660
Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.

33:47.660 --> 34:01.580
Gama Sutra posted a story about Activision, it's the NIMF e-grade given to a ESRB, and

34:01.580 --> 34:05.060
let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.

34:05.060 --> 34:09.820
Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB, so basically, and it's a really

34:09.820 --> 34:16.060
good article and I'm gonna link it in the chat room, but basically parents support the

34:16.060 --> 34:21.220
ESRB, they think it's a good idea, certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think,

34:21.220 --> 34:25.740
makes it easier for them to be able to judge what their children are playing, I think it's

34:25.740 --> 34:26.740
a good idea.

34:26.740 --> 34:35.620
Now, this last one is interesting, I'm going to read it and Rob has to pay attention.

34:35.620 --> 34:36.940
Maybe I should let Chris read it.

34:36.940 --> 34:37.940
No.

34:37.940 --> 34:38.940
Okay.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.100
The whole point was for you to read it, dammit.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.860
This was sent to us by Chris.

34:43.860 --> 34:44.860
Hi.

34:44.860 --> 34:48.540
Hi guys, it's me, Chris.

34:48.540 --> 34:52.860
I'm a big lesbian, I did not say that.

34:52.860 --> 34:55.380
It's true, but I didn't say that.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.580
People sure attract some weirdos.

34:57.580 --> 35:02.860
Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, writing in a sleigh, he asked me

35:02.860 --> 35:05.220
to send you this email.

35:05.220 --> 35:11.500
Dear OLR crew, you wrote ORL?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.500
It was the guy.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.500
Yeah.

35:13.500 --> 35:15.900
On your laptop.

35:15.900 --> 35:16.900
Good evening, OLR.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.980
Oh, and good evening, chat room.

35:18.980 --> 35:22.620
I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.620
It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room, that they detected

35:26.620 --> 35:27.620
a strange anomaly.

35:27.620 --> 35:32.580
It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in, all for your radio show, hoping for the

35:32.580 --> 35:34.260
best in the new year.

35:34.260 --> 35:37.900
This had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.

35:37.900 --> 35:41.100
After a while it came to me, I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift

35:41.100 --> 35:48.300
that I hope will be of use to help your show.

35:48.300 --> 35:51.860
From the wishes of the chat room, to the wishes of the message board, to the wishes of the

35:51.860 --> 35:55.420
listeners not known, all have a very special gift for you.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.900
To Sky Loki and Dark Sakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year.

35:58.900 --> 36:02.700
From SCPS, I left the gift with a strange blue haired girl.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.820
She should be handing it to you right now.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.380
And you have to open it.

36:06.380 --> 36:07.940
Oh my.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.900
People attract the weirdest of guys.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.900
Oh my.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.900
That's old.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.300
That's Rob that attracted me.

36:13.300 --> 36:18.140
You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air, and I said,

36:18.140 --> 36:19.140
was he hot?

36:19.140 --> 36:22.260
That's the question I asked.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.080
Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show, and the first question

36:25.080 --> 36:27.580
I go, was he hot?

36:27.580 --> 36:31.420
No, you like old dudes?

36:31.420 --> 36:37.540
Am I okay to open this?

36:37.540 --> 36:41.060
It's an envelope, two O-L-R from Santa and the fans.

36:41.060 --> 36:44.020
Oh, I licked it, sorry.

36:44.020 --> 36:47.020
Do you have an oil fixation?

36:47.020 --> 36:48.020
Yeah.

36:48.020 --> 36:49.020
No, really.

36:49.020 --> 36:50.020
Hurry up, Rob.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.020
I'm trying.

36:51.020 --> 36:52.020
I don't want to ruin it.

36:52.020 --> 36:53.020
No, no, no, no.

36:53.020 --> 36:54.020
Yes, please.

36:54.020 --> 37:04.020
Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.

37:04.020 --> 37:22.180
Chris, I- I didn't do it, Santa did.

37:22.180 --> 37:25.660
I'm just not paying attention to anything, I'm actually looking.

37:25.660 --> 37:33.580
I don't know what to say, I'm- Wow, that old guy was cool.

37:33.580 --> 37:34.580
Are you sure?

37:34.580 --> 37:49.980
I don't know what to say, I'm- This is embarrassing, in a way.

37:49.980 --> 37:54.800
Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their

37:54.800 --> 37:55.800
bodies, so-

37:55.800 --> 38:04.580
For stuff that you need, because you guys said that you wanted to do a lot of promotion

38:04.580 --> 38:10.740
and you guys might need some stuff, so I thought that I would- it's from the chat room and

38:10.740 --> 38:14.380
from everybody, because it would be really hard to email every single person to ask if

38:14.380 --> 38:15.540
they could donate.

38:15.540 --> 38:20.660
So this is for anything that you guys might need, any trips you guys want to send, any

38:20.660 --> 38:23.740
equipment that you might need, or something you want to buy.

38:23.740 --> 38:26.300
So that's what it is for.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.300
Can I say what it is?

38:28.300 --> 38:31.380
It's- I guess you could call it- It's right there.

38:31.380 --> 38:37.580
I'm throwing it up, throwing it around the whole place.

38:37.580 --> 38:44.380
I guess you could call it seed money to take a well art to the next level, and something

38:44.380 --> 38:50.640
I think a lot of us always like, we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.

38:50.640 --> 39:00.460
It was always- No, I'm sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.460
Bandit's on the right track.

39:01.460 --> 39:08.160
It's a- Oh, you're on the right track, I'll put it that way.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.900
It's basically $4,000 in seed money.

39:11.900 --> 39:15.420
It sounds so strange to say.

39:15.420 --> 39:23.860
That kind of- Just to bring you guys to do what we do here, and really be able to take

39:23.860 --> 39:24.860
this to the next level.

39:24.860 --> 39:29.540
Oh God, I'm so embarrassed that- I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her

39:29.540 --> 39:36.380
permission to service you.

39:36.380 --> 39:40.020
I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.

39:40.020 --> 39:45.060
I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I didn't

39:45.060 --> 39:47.980
know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about, you guys want to do

39:47.980 --> 39:51.780
all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could

39:51.780 --> 39:52.780
do that.

39:52.780 --> 39:57.660
It's for promotion, it's for anything you guys want to use it for, completely at your

39:57.660 --> 39:58.660
disposal.

39:58.660 --> 39:59.660
Thank you so much.

39:59.660 --> 40:00.660
Strippers.

40:00.660 --> 40:01.660
I don't know where to begin.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.660
I don't know where to begin.

40:02.660 --> 40:03.660
Yeah, strippers.

40:03.660 --> 40:08.740
Now, it's kind of like that I'm looking at this, I'm like, I don't know.

40:08.740 --> 40:09.740
I don't know where to begin.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.820
I think we need to set up that account now.

40:12.820 --> 40:21.140
I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now, and maybe we'll

40:21.140 --> 40:25.580
be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon, who knows, I don't know, but thank you

40:25.580 --> 40:26.580
so much.

40:26.580 --> 40:30.620
Consider it on your hands.

40:30.620 --> 40:32.620
Thank you.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.420
Are you okay, Loki?

40:35.420 --> 40:38.540
I'm not even looking at chat, I don't even want to know.

40:38.540 --> 40:44.460
I don't buy all games.com, I don't think that's going to be happening.

40:44.460 --> 40:49.300
And it's telling us to drop by 365.

40:49.300 --> 40:56.260
That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.

40:56.260 --> 40:57.500
My heart's racing very quickly.

40:57.500 --> 41:03.980
I know, I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of, no, it's fine, it's fine, I don't

41:03.980 --> 41:06.660
know what to say.

41:06.660 --> 41:11.100
This just doesn't happen.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.100
But it is.

41:12.100 --> 41:20.460
I know, I know, I just don't know what to say, I'm sorry.

41:20.460 --> 41:21.460
He's a little...

41:21.460 --> 41:23.740
Read another fucking email, all right?

41:23.740 --> 41:25.140
That was the last email.

41:25.140 --> 41:30.180
God damn it, read another one, make something up, make something up.

41:30.180 --> 41:34.800
Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.340
Love the queen.

41:37.340 --> 41:40.300
You play everything on Doctor Who.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.980
All you would play is Doctor Who.

41:41.980 --> 41:44.020
We'd have BBC Who.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.020
No.

41:45.020 --> 41:48.180
Anyways, I'll take it from here.

41:48.180 --> 41:51.500
Please do, if I had a story up, somebody else needs to do that, I'm sorry.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.220
I'll make up a story.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.900
So anyways, we've got some pretty interesting stuff.

41:55.900 --> 42:02.860
If you happen to have some sort of Bluetooth device, whether it be a USB support for your

42:02.860 --> 42:09.620
computer or laptop, etc., you can actually exchange Miis.

42:09.620 --> 42:13.980
There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Miis to your remote, which you can do

42:13.980 --> 42:21.780
via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Miis exchange.

42:21.780 --> 42:31.580
It's actually available on wimodwi.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Miis, and you

42:31.580 --> 42:36.800
can actually submit your Miis there that you've created, as well as download other celebrity

42:36.800 --> 42:44.260
Miis, including such things as Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca,

42:44.260 --> 42:50.380
Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc., God, Harry Potter.

42:50.380 --> 42:52.300
So definitely check that out.

42:52.300 --> 42:56.540
Of course you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that, and available also

42:56.540 --> 43:01.740
on wimodwi.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that,

43:01.740 --> 43:05.180
and it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.

43:05.180 --> 43:06.340
So definitely worth checking out.

43:06.340 --> 43:11.380
I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have

43:11.380 --> 43:13.780
Chuck Norris on my Wii console.

43:13.780 --> 43:14.780
That is a requirement.

43:14.780 --> 43:16.780
Chuck Norris would shatter your Wii.

43:16.780 --> 43:20.860
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story, and then I'm going to run

43:20.860 --> 43:22.860
out of the room for a minute.

43:22.860 --> 43:29.860
Something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement

43:29.860 --> 43:34.020
of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.660
Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this

43:37.660 --> 43:43.100
week, and the big shock, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.

43:43.100 --> 43:49.740
These games are of biblical proportions in Japan, but the fact that Dragon Quest IX protectors

43:49.740 --> 43:54.980
of the starry sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.

43:54.980 --> 43:58.740
It will feature 3D graphics, there were some screenshots released, it looks very similar

43:58.740 --> 44:06.500
in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was recently out on the PlayStation 2, and they are trying

44:06.500 --> 44:09.940
to make it ready by 2007.

44:09.940 --> 44:19.340
By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade game called Dragon Quest Monster Battle

44:19.340 --> 44:20.340
Road.

44:20.340 --> 44:23.940
Both these games being developed by Level 5.

44:23.940 --> 44:29.100
This brings up a good point, and I hate Sony bashing, but I got to mention this.

44:29.100 --> 44:32.800
There's games that come out on the DS and stuff, it's like games that you're looking

44:32.800 --> 44:34.380
forward to coming out.

44:34.380 --> 44:38.140
Can you name a game that you're looking forward to coming out on the PSP?

44:38.140 --> 44:40.020
I can't, and that's pretty sad.

44:40.020 --> 44:45.340
I own a PSP, and to be honest, I play the PSP a lot more than my DS, and I've pretty

44:45.340 --> 44:50.060
much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Brothers and Mario Kart,

44:50.060 --> 44:57.100
and I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have

44:57.100 --> 44:58.100
games.

44:58.100 --> 45:02.060
It's just a lot of filler, it seems like, a lot of ports of stuff that end up on the

45:02.060 --> 45:08.900
PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or ooh, Final Fantasy.

45:08.900 --> 45:12.340
I think that's why their system is not doing this well.

45:12.340 --> 45:17.940
Ereto says Silent Hill Origins.

45:17.940 --> 45:23.020
We just have another Untold Legends, or other Dynasty Warriors...

45:23.020 --> 45:27.740
It's GS-191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon

45:27.740 --> 45:29.740
Quest IX for DS.

45:29.740 --> 45:37.700
Enus is going to sue somebody now.

45:37.700 --> 45:39.500
So I don't know what else to say about that.

45:39.500 --> 45:42.740
I was pretty surprised to hear that myself, because I don't know, I'm so used to playing

45:42.740 --> 45:46.020
Dragon Quest on my television, but then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon

45:46.020 --> 45:50.420
Quest on the Game Boy years ago, I mean, they ported one too, and all that.

45:50.420 --> 45:53.380
There will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii, so...

45:53.380 --> 45:56.900
Ooh, I forgot about that, that's right, that was supposed to be a launch title.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.940
I think it was in Japan, so...

45:59.940 --> 46:00.940
All right.

46:00.940 --> 46:05.500
Well, I definitely want to check this out, I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on

46:05.500 --> 46:10.140
the DS, I don't see any... you know, Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate

46:10.140 --> 46:13.140
very well to the DS, I don't see why this will be a problem.

46:13.140 --> 46:15.260
It's Toriyama, you can't go wrong with him.

46:15.260 --> 46:19.940
I think it'll be good, and also that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it,

46:19.940 --> 46:21.540
which is good news.

46:21.540 --> 46:23.540
Call Blimey!

46:23.540 --> 46:31.600
Anyways, so, now, bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for

46:31.600 --> 46:39.980
you guys, I thought I'd bring this up, you can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain

46:39.980 --> 46:44.740
program, you can make your Wii sound like a light saber when you swing it around.

46:44.740 --> 46:48.940
Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why did someone create this?

46:48.940 --> 46:54.980
For the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so, you know, the prevent from dropping it

46:54.980 --> 46:58.860
on the ground, it senses that it's falling and shuts it off or whatever.

46:58.860 --> 47:07.420
So that tilt sensor, using the app, you can actually, with the Darwin remote program,

47:07.420 --> 47:12.700
and run this program called Wii Saber, and it's basically flinging your remote around

47:12.700 --> 47:16.860
and makes the sounds of a light saber.

47:16.860 --> 47:20.420
Completely useless, but I guess fun if you have a Mac and a Wii.

47:20.420 --> 47:24.660
I foresee an entirely new generation of Star Wars, kid.

47:24.660 --> 47:26.380
Oh, God.

47:26.380 --> 47:27.380
Wii Saber.

47:27.380 --> 47:28.380
Heaven help us all.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.460
Well, how about I redeem the world now?

47:31.460 --> 47:32.460
Please do.

47:32.460 --> 47:36.380
Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you

47:36.380 --> 47:38.220
know who Kevin Smith is.

47:38.220 --> 47:39.220
Yes.

47:39.220 --> 47:42.860
Noggin of the nooch.

47:42.860 --> 47:47.460
That talk, well, he's interested in making a game based on J.N.

47:47.460 --> 47:49.460
Silent Bob.

47:49.460 --> 47:56.560
To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining,

47:56.560 --> 48:00.840
basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make

48:00.840 --> 48:03.220
the levels and stuff in it.

48:03.220 --> 48:07.140
So he basically is going to be concept director.

48:07.140 --> 48:16.320
Well, I think that Joystick pointed out something very good on this, that the things going against

48:16.320 --> 48:22.300
him is the types of dialogue that he's known for and the types of humor that go in the

48:22.300 --> 48:24.780
game, that will go in his stories.

48:24.780 --> 48:30.060
I think it would definitely be an older crowd he'd cater to.

48:30.060 --> 48:36.700
And I mean, I love how they say, especially if the game is based off of Blutland and Chronic,

48:36.700 --> 48:41.760
it should definitely go, he should do it, but it's going to be an M game.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.500
And that's great.

48:43.500 --> 48:45.500
So she had Dogma the game.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.380
We have to, that'd be awesome.

48:48.380 --> 48:52.020
We have to fight legions of angels.

48:52.020 --> 48:54.220
And with Alanis says God.

48:54.220 --> 48:59.420
Do we get to watch Muse strip because we are not going to watch him do the silence of the

48:59.420 --> 49:00.420
lambs dance.

49:00.420 --> 49:01.420
No Muse.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.420
No Muse.

49:02.420 --> 49:03.420
Serendipity.

49:03.420 --> 49:04.420
Oh, I thought you meant.

49:04.420 --> 49:05.420
Selma Hayek, man.

49:05.420 --> 49:06.420
Okay.

49:06.420 --> 49:08.140
I thought you were talking about Jason Muse because they refer to him by his last name

49:08.140 --> 49:09.140
in there.

49:09.140 --> 49:10.140
Oh, no, no, no, no.

49:10.140 --> 49:11.140
The Muse.

49:11.140 --> 49:12.140
Serendipity.

49:12.140 --> 49:13.140
Yeah.

49:13.140 --> 49:14.140
Oh, yeah.

49:14.140 --> 49:15.140
Boobies.

49:15.140 --> 49:16.140
Well.

49:16.140 --> 49:17.140
Boobies.

49:17.140 --> 49:21.960
You know what, James Tom Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be

49:21.960 --> 49:26.180
a collective nerdgasm heard around the world in this type of game.

49:26.180 --> 49:27.180
Oh, my God.

49:27.180 --> 49:28.180
Seriously.

49:28.180 --> 49:29.180
Okay.

49:29.180 --> 49:30.180
Wow.

49:30.180 --> 49:37.220
Well, going to the complete opposite end of the spectrum into things maybe we don't want

49:37.220 --> 49:39.020
to hear about.

49:39.020 --> 49:40.820
Get this.

49:40.820 --> 49:44.740
And I'm looking at something that's for sale at Barcade.com.

49:44.740 --> 49:47.060
It's created by a company called Baytech Games.

49:47.060 --> 49:52.700
It's an arcade version of American Idol Superstar.

49:52.700 --> 49:56.140
It has a, quote, fun and addicting light pattern game.

49:56.140 --> 49:59.460
It has artwork and audio from the American Idol game.

49:59.460 --> 50:04.820
What you do is you press a stop button to light five stars in a row for a prize or you

50:04.820 --> 50:09.260
can continue on and play for a stupid prize, a super prize.

50:09.260 --> 50:11.580
You can go along and play for a super prize.

50:11.580 --> 50:16.340
Once you get the light pattern down, you know, you can get it and light up all the things.

50:16.340 --> 50:19.440
And if you get the super prize, though, it's a lot more difficult to be going for that.

50:19.440 --> 50:23.840
So it's another one of those freaking ticket redemption games based off of American Idol.

50:23.840 --> 50:26.900
Kill it with fire.

50:26.900 --> 50:32.420
After all, they have this ticket game based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.

50:32.420 --> 50:38.180
No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick

50:38.180 --> 50:44.060
in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.

50:44.060 --> 50:49.700
To quote DJ Dark Knight, NOOOOOOO!

50:49.700 --> 50:54.260
And also, to get back on a previous subject, to quote Gara who Drive Car, Ma rats the game,

50:54.260 --> 50:56.620
remove the kids sitting on the escalator level.

50:56.620 --> 51:02.700
Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American

51:02.700 --> 51:09.420
Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great

51:09.420 --> 51:14.420
arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur IIIs that could be in these arcades, the Time

51:14.420 --> 51:20.420
Crisis IVs, the DDR Supernovas, that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.

51:20.420 --> 51:23.420
And does this piss you off as much as it does us?

51:23.420 --> 51:33.700
Because it makes us so mad we have to rant large the FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.

51:33.700 --> 51:41.020
The first FU of the week goes to Extrofer for not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity

51:41.020 --> 51:45.420
photo shoot butt bleaching.

51:45.420 --> 51:50.260
We were going to get Extrofer a gift certificate for intimate photographs.

51:50.260 --> 51:53.940
And an anal bleaching.

51:53.940 --> 51:55.540
That fell through.

51:55.540 --> 52:01.340
I would however like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful

52:01.340 --> 52:03.980
facial responses from my husband.

52:03.980 --> 52:05.620
It was gorgeous.

52:05.620 --> 52:33.940
Watching Dan's quorum makes me happy sometimes.

52:33.940 --> 52:35.780
This one's definitely for Nellie.

52:35.780 --> 52:41.540
Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she

52:41.540 --> 52:50.140
could buy candy and had to count out her like four dollars worth of purchases with pennies

52:50.140 --> 52:56.060
in front of us slowly and she kept messing up and had to recount them.

52:56.060 --> 52:57.060
It was horrible.

52:57.060 --> 52:59.180
That's why you get paper rolls first.

52:59.180 --> 53:03.460
When I was in college we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll

53:03.460 --> 53:04.460
them and then go to the movies.

53:04.460 --> 53:09.220
She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.

53:09.220 --> 53:10.220
I know the rules.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.900
I hope you don't mind me saying that.

53:12.900 --> 53:16.820
We used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went

53:16.820 --> 53:17.820
where we were going.

53:17.820 --> 53:24.140
See that's what considerate people would do but you forget she's a dumb bitch.

53:24.140 --> 53:28.780
I had something but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.

53:28.780 --> 53:33.060
So no it's fine trust me.

53:33.060 --> 53:37.660
I guess my F.U. would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on a radio

53:37.660 --> 53:38.660
program.

53:38.660 --> 53:39.660
I'm so sorry.

53:39.660 --> 53:40.660
I'm so sorry.

53:40.660 --> 53:41.660
No, no, no.

53:41.660 --> 53:49.940
Please, please don't feel sorry.

53:49.940 --> 53:53.780
I had a serious F.U. and I seriously oh I know what it was I just remembered it I finally

53:53.780 --> 53:56.540
remembered it and F.U. did in fact I didn't go to bed until six thirty in the morning

53:56.540 --> 54:01.820
yesterday because that's my own downfall but it doesn't make me feel any better because

54:01.820 --> 54:03.660
my Sunday is like completely gone.

54:03.660 --> 54:07.460
Uh oh wait oh hello we still have other people that have to do their F.U.s.

54:07.460 --> 54:08.460
Uh Drew.

54:08.460 --> 54:19.460
First off F.U. to the World of Warcraft 2.0 patch for forcing me into a prediction relapse.

54:19.460 --> 54:23.980
F.U. to certain parts of that patch that break all your interface add-ons.

54:23.980 --> 54:32.420
Can we say remember remember the 5th of December the day all the add-ons are drawn and F.U.

54:32.420 --> 54:37.940

saves everybody else takes half damage I love D&D geek jokes anyways so hey what do you

58:19.620 --> 58:24.900
say we continue on with some stories yes so if you don't have enough money to spend on

58:24.900 --> 58:31.100
PlayStation 3 or you know a 360 or even a Wii for that matter what can you do what can

58:31.100 --> 58:37.300
you do well you can buy retro and you know for the same matter why bother buying virtual

58:37.300 --> 58:41.900
console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on so shop

58:41.900 --> 58:48.540
eBay shop your local thrift stores find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper

58:48.540 --> 58:55.820
hell go to if you're in the California area here go visit a tower or hell I think around

58:55.820 --> 59:00.980
the they're all around the country but visit our records they're closing down so I get

59:00.980 --> 59:07.020
some old ass games there if they have some used stuff but yeah eBay is your friend you

59:07.020 --> 59:10.220
can find lots of consoles for cheap especially when people are trying to earn some extra

59:10.220 --> 59:16.060
money to buy the new ones I like eBay eBay has been taking a lot of my money lately well

59:16.060 --> 59:21.380
something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800 the system

59:21.380 --> 59:27.380
that is most notoriously known breaking you can have a working AC adapter those are pretty

59:27.380 --> 59:35.740
hard to come by too but the systems no no no out of five that I've played all of them

59:35.740 --> 59:41.940
broke so yeah but some people decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on

59:41.940 --> 59:49.980
the 7800 we have pac-man collection for the 7800 and again 7800 is a good system don't

59:49.980 --> 59:59.780
get me wrong but it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob decrescendo

59:59.780 --> 01:00:08.540
that don't decrescendo sorry and it includes pac-man puck man hangley man which is the

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:15.220
best name ever ultra pac-man random mazes miss pac-man miss pac attack and miss random

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.100
mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:29.260
play options junior pac-man and super pac-man are both missing and it's a $30 package there

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:38.700
is a let's see there's apparently the link on Atari age.com you can find it there a new

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:43.260
pac-man for a system nobody plays anymore be still my fleeting heart I actually or nobody

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:47.580
wants to play because last year god damn much last year we did by super pac-man for as I

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:52.860
miss pac-man for the 5200 the prototype well that's a 5200 I know well I love this 200

01:00:52.860 --> 01:01:02.540
200 is freaking rad it has kicks on it well too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:07.620
everybody's is broken no but you know what for somebody who's like an old school gaming

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:12.700
collector type thing they are gonna be just simply amazed at this you know and I kind

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:16.260
of think pick it up I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.260
like this you know tease this game all you want but just the fact that there is so much

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:24.780
love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together it's pretty

01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:32.700
rad it's pretty rad anyway what's not so rad is that Nintendo having to do these programs

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:38.220
recently we talked about the strap thing earlier in the show well they also this is a full

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:46.380
fledged recall in Japan not here but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS lights have

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.740
been recalled overseas keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:59.340
over here so this news does not affect us here in the US but those are being recalled

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:04.200
so if you're in Japan you might want to look to your local press for some more information

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.180
on how you can do that usually you just take it into the store and all that stuff so interesting

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:16.780
yes and in case those exploding AC adapters don't kill you well then the Wi-Fi will yes

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.500
apparently everybody loves you know creating a scare where whether it be you know cell

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:28.620
phones causing cancer or you know Xboxes causing home fires or you know stuff like that but

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:37.820
now people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:45.980
some sort of brain damage or stuff like that why would people actually think this I mean

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:53.740
that's like thinking that the earth is flat or that I don't know the that the earth or

01:02:53.740 --> 01:03:01.300
the Sun revolves around the earth and vice versa people are stupid this is why people

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:07.940
will fling remotes at the TV because they're retarded they'll believe this shit you you

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:13.420
know what I swear to God when this that whole story with the Wiimotes you know them offering

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:19.220
the extra thick strap for the Wiimote so many people at my work came up to me go have you

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:24.220
heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things this is a good cross

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:27.700
section of the people of the United States you know the people I work with right here

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:32.940
and they're all idiots so you know they just unfortunately they were you know getting the

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:39.100
story spun by you know God knows what news program and so they didn't get the you know

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:42.660
pure facts for it and that's unfortunately how people are gonna see this whole problems

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.660
and eventually when people catch on this whole Wi-Fi thing that they're gonna be like oh

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:55.540
my god oh my god get in the bomb shelter now the world is coming to an end so people suck

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:01.660
yes they do but something that doesn't suck of gear is Gears of War the game has broken

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:10.060
two million copies worldwide and that's one million in the u.s. alone since the fastest

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:18.700
selling next-gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:28.780
but basically though there is an official press release put out about this just stating

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:36.180
that that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell who's the corporate vice president

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:41.300
of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation was saying

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:45.780
corporation corporation was saying Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.820
of must-have a game of the year it's phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:55.060
is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday we've always

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.900
had high hopes for Gears of War but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:02.300
from critics and gamers all over the world that's a quote from Michael cap set up at

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:14.300
games so that's pretty cool and I also said another fun stat that on Xbox Live that the

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:22.340
total of the gameplay sessions online reach 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:31.460
so oh my gosh and I have paid with those paid registrations on Xbox Live have gone over

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:39.300
50% more since the game has launched wow all right well I know you guys have been dying

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:43.340
to want to call into the show it's been a very interesting night tonight to say the

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:49.340
least it's kind of like our um well what do we keep threatening to do last year we're

01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:53.380
gonna do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that it's certainly been a

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:56.980
very uh interesting evening if we were gonna share if we were gonna want to do something

uh... here's what's going on week

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:38.660
either this is the poll and i was just looking a lot to be podcast when you

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.300
guys were talking about

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.400
the point system for the week

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:46.660
on downloading game and i wanted to note that i actually do have to pay tax i

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.460
live in nashville tennessee

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:51.880
and when i buy point online with my credit card it does charge tax

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.640

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.940
we have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down because we know

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.300
those of us in california aren't paying the tax on the wee points but now we know

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.060
tennessee our listener here pennsylvania probably some other states are charging

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.340
very interesting how that's all breaking down not a whole lot set on that

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.540
it is

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:16.680
a transaction you are paying for a service

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.780
so it's sensible

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.060
at the same time it's it

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.780
there's just a little bit of it seems bizarre to me

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.700
well i just

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:26.660
icon

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.300
i could be curious to know like

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.380
do you get taxed on xbox points to

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.740
that would be kind of what i'd be wondering about so

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.160
uh... and and folks in the other areas as well that are getting taxed on the

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.380
we points i'm kinda wondering what the differences

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.580
cuz i'm not taxed on microsoft points either

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:45.700
so i'm kinda curious why there'd be a difference what true

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.260
an internet tax maybe i don't know

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.460
all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now uh... our username on

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.240
skype is orange lounge radio and our number one eight seven seven game o l r

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.780
the calls are already coming in let's go to the first call higher on orange

01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.620
launch radio is this

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:06.140
is production hi paradox vincent what's on your mind buddy

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.140
i

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.700
discard b mania two d x happy sky

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.540
uh... that's right i think i've heard i've only heard that i talked to me

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.620
clinton earlier this week and he had played it

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:19.780
uh... and he said it was ok but there's been better releases what are your

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:24.140
thoughts on b mania two d x happy sky

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.080
well

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.340
wake up a limited edition

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.560
and uh... i would like that

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.900
everything the package together was really nice

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:36.580
uh... i haven't got a chance to watch the dvd yet because i don't have a

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.020
region free

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.020
but the game itself

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.380
the uh... the skin for it

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.140
i'd say the great improvement over anything they've ever done

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:48.960
and i like the fact that you can change that

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.960
music when you're selecting the song

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.180
might only great

01:08:55.180 --> 01:09:01.180
really be the new difficulty setting but i haven't really gotten used

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.780
to uh... creating them by twelve

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:04.940
that's eight

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.980
all yeah i was new in happy sky right

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.360
basically

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.500
there was uh...

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.520
i can only

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.620
play on uh... seven on three x red

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.460
and there was a really big gap between

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:20.660
really easy

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:25.860
seven songs and really hard seven songs that's about where i'm at yep

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:26.900
yeah

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.100
that's been pretty much split down between seven and eight difficulty now

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:36.660
the song list itself though i was really happy with

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.300
and uh...

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.440
my biggest complaint about the songs

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.300
would be the difficulty of uh...

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:45.720
may and zephyr

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.820
which were my two favorite songs

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:49.660
and

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:52.340
they're nearly impossible

01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.260
on

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.100
seventy and another

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.140
but

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.280
on white mode

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.620
they're just too easy

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:06.660
interesting so there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.820
in some songs

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.420
giant gap in difficulty uh...

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.580
i think blue

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:14.780
blue mirage was another one of those

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:19.180
overall i was really happy with it

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.740
uh... one other quick question i have for you to get a move on to some of the

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:25.700
calls what would you say you would like to see konami do if they put out

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:30.340
uh... beatmania thirteen or beatmania distorted out on the console would you

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.340
like to see them

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.820
what they need to most improve on with their next release

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:42.700
most improve on with the next release

01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.140
i stopped you know i'm

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:49.500
yeah i'm really happy with the beatmania system

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:52.880
and you can't really change the note charts

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.780
would you like to see an edit mode or something? I don't know

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:59.660
edit mode

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.020
where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.140
key map them however you want might be interesting

01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.820
if they could make it work

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:11.380
that might be interesting

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.900
i'd say add

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.960
something new

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.140
because they have

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:17.660
customized now they have class mode

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.460
they have all these modes and i would really like to see them add

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.500
some kind of new thing

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.720
long mixes

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.200
might be kind of cool too

01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.260
alright we'll see

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:31.860

here hello maggie long time no see

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.160
how are things you know i think we have a bit of a lag tonight because of the

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.100
internet drop pitch problems we've been having so i think that's causing a bit

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:07.740
of a delay so we'll do the best we can

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.420

uh... first of all nintendo makes high quality stuff they wouldn't make faulty

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.980

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.300
and second if you're throwing your we most so hard at the stress in a break

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.960

sis says something about the brick consoles let's speculate what was rama

01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.420
trying to say about the brick consoles you think

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:02.300
you should try to build a house out of xbox three sixties

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.460
uh...

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:05.900

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.540
house that was built out of newspapers

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.020
and the house that was built out of gravestones

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:19.880

the best gaming moment of 2006 was actually winning that wii i was

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:29.900
super excited when you went like oh look who won it and i was like it can't be

orange bat to clobber her with when she starts that shit

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.180
I just got one of those off eBay.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.180
You just bought a rocket launcher?

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:08.180
I want a rocket launcher!

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:11.180
Oh, it's a USB rocket launcher on eBay.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.180
All right, yes, Ravenstaufen.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:21.180
I just want to say DMN is drunk and rage and lives on crazily on Friday.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.180
DMN is not even here and his tail is between his legs somewhere else.

01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.180
I don't know what to say.

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:27.180
I don't know where he is.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:30.180
He's drunk and a pod somewhere.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.180
He's drunk fapping on the Internet.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:35.180
All right, Ravenstaufen, we've got to let you go to get to some more calls.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:38.180
We appreciate it, though, and I hope you had a good week.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.180
Bye, guys.

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.180
And everyone else there, bye.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:43.180
All right, let's go to this call.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.180
I think this might be Raman's cell phone.

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.180
Oh, can I even pick up another call?

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.180
Why isn't it a little...

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.180
Oh, damn it.

01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.180
That's all right. Well, fine, we'll go to someone else.

01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:52.180
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.180
Who's this?

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.180
Hey, this is Solarwing.

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:55.180
Hi, Solarwing.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:57.180
What's on your mind?

01:18:57.180 --> 01:19:00.180
Solarwing, I'm sorry, I thought you said celery.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.180
Sorry.

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.180
Celery's good for you.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.180
It's a good thing.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.180
No.

01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:06.180
Solarwing, what's on your mind?

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.180
Wii straps.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.180
How can people even think that they would break?

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.180
Well, because they have been.

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.180
No, they haven't.

01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:22.180
Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.180
breaking, we assume.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:24.180
Not at their own volition.

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.180
It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.180
Right.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:35.180
I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one, and I tried it.

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.180
I could not break it.

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.180
I tried.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.180
I know.

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:42.180
I've been kind of, like ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been kind of trying

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.180
to break mine, and you can't.

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:49.180
I don't know how people do it.

01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:53.180
Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?

01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.180
What kind of games do you want to get with it?

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.180
Of course, the classic Zelda.

01:19:55.180 --> 01:20:00.180
At a bit, so I want to try that.

01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:02.180
Alibits is pretty fun.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180
It's a good game.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.180
All right.

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:07.180
Well, good luck to you on your Wii Quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:11.180
We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:13.180
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?

01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:15.180
Just happy holidays to you guys.

01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.180
Thank you so much.

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:17.180
Same to you.

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.180
I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a Wii under your tree.

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.180
That would be fun.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.180
Oh, yeah.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:22.180
All right.

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.180
Good luck.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.180
Bye.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.180
Bye-bye.

01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.180
All right.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:30.180
Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.180
Hi.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.180
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.180
Who's this?

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.180
It's Ron.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:35.180
I finally made it back on my cell phone.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.180
Finally.

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:37.180
All right.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.180
What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:39.180
My thing is this.

01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:44.180
If you're spending so much money on these consoles, it wouldn't kill you to drop an

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:47.180
extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.

01:20:47.180 --> 01:20:51.180
That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through a rigmarole with shipping out

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:56.180
the unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.180
hour.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:00.480
Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.540
It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:04.900
be shoved down my throat.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.540
And I'm one of those people that's like, when somebody tells me I have to get something

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:11.060
or I need it, I'm like, no.

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.060
Don't tell me.

01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.060
I don't know.

01:21:13.060 --> 01:21:17.620
There's a difference between friendly advice and people that are trying to pressure me

01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:19.600
so much into buying these warranties.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.020
And plus, it's tough because you do feel like it's wasted money when you don't use it, and

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.020
it all adds up.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.540
You know what I mean?

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.140
I know exactly how you mean it.

01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:30.140
I do this for a living.

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:33.260
I sell cameras and laptops and stuff.

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.540
I tell people about the warranty, and I tell them the positives about it.

01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.620
I tell them, you don't have to get it, but it's just a piece of mind.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.700
I completely understand.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.340
I never force it like it got in your throat.

01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:49.380
Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:53.180
you by your management, and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:57.980
Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:01.540
personal experience because I've been dealing with this for a very long time.

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:02.540
Fair enough.

01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:03.540
Fair enough.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.540
I mean, but I don't know.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:07.300
I kind of find that the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's

01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:11.180
faulty, it's going to break in the first few days, but I can understand why people are

01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:14.580
about the extended warranty, but I don't know.

01:22:14.580 --> 01:22:20.180
I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.620
To Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?

01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.940
No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.

01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:30.860
Well, you know, it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will,

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:31.860
you know?

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:32.860
All right.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.860
Yeah.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:34.860
Rama, we got to let you get over so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:35.860
calling us back, all right?

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.860
All right.

01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.860
Sure.

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:38.860
Hey, no problem.

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:39.860
Happy holidays.

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:40.860
Bye.

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.860
Do you have something for Rama?

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:42.860
No.

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.860
Oh, all right.

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860
Do you have something here in town?

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860
She'll give it to you later.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:55.540
No, not like that, but I have something to play for people because this is what's on

01:22:55.540 --> 01:23:01.260
my mind about work tomorrow.

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.780
You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.

01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.780
That's all right.

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.780
A lot of people do.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.780
A lot of people do.

01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780
I'm sure.

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.780
That's fine.

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:10.620
No, I get it, but I have to have it explained to me.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:14.540
All right, anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories,

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.540
boys and girls.

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:18.540
I have a story.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:20.120
Yes.

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:24.940
My story has to do with a baseball player.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:32.060
The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaya, actually hurt his arm.

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:38.220
He was complaining of aches and pains in his arm because he was playing too much Guitar

01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.220
Hero.

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:43.740
When he examined his pain in his forearm, it was determined that it was more like that

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:48.580
of the guitar player and suggested that he stopped playing Guitar Hero.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.580
It was actually severe masturbation.

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.580
Fap attack.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:24:00.460
Anyway, he stopped, improved, and went on to play in the World Series.

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:08.100
He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.820
I thought it was funny.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:12.820
That was pretty funny.

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.580
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.140
Yeah, I have one.

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.860
This is going to piss people off.

01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:25.860
With Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan being one of the first

01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.740
online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.220
Guess what that would be?

01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:33.340
Another 12-digit friend code.

01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:37.860
Because apparently the friends list on Pokemon Battle Revolution is different than your normal

01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:42.820
friends list and you have to swap Wii codes with other people in other places.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:45.300
Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.420
I thought they promised one friend code.

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:50.020
They just meant for the system itself?

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:52.380
Uh, yes.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:56.580
The problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.

01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.820
You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.660
Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:08.380
You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.

01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:13.780
I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole people afraid about their

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:20.200
kids or whatever, but seriously, it's simple enough that both people have to have each

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:23.580
other listed before they can even communicate with each other.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.580
That's effective enough.

01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:25.940
End of story.

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.500
There's no need for this 5,000 friend code stuff.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:31.940
That's horrible.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:36.340
I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?

01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:38.140
After all, they launched a new next-gen system.

01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:39.780
Where's that report coming from?

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:42.660
Forecolor Rebellion, which they're pretty good at.

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:43.660
Respectable Source.

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.660
Oh, man.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:45.660
That's horrible.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:52.300
Actually, and the other thing too, this is actually Forecolor Rebellion is reporting

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:58.880
IGN articles, so that's even better.

01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.980
They don't get it, do they?

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:01.460
They just don't get the online.

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.340
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:06.900
Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.

01:26:06.900 --> 01:26:09.340
Somebody's going to call Nintendo to the carpet over this one.

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.420
I mean, because this is ridiculous.

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.980
This whole friend code crap.

01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:15.900
So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?

01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:21.100
Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send Miis to each other, which only support

01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:24.940
one game so far?

01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.940
Very disappointing.

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:28.100
Xbox really gets it in the online world.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.100
They do.

01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.100
They do.

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.060
They of course aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't, but of

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:40.380
course there is no service to charge for, so I'm just very disappointed.

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.380
Me too.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:43.060
That's a bad thing to end on.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:46.140
I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.340
All right.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.860
That's a heck of a thing to have as a last minute story.

01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.020
That must have been just late breaking, huh?

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:53.940
Was it just posted a little while ago or before we...

01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.940
I think it's today.

01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:56.940
Interesting.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:57.940
All right.

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:02.980
Damn, that's the end of the show, so we're going to go around and give everybody's final

01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:03.980
thought.

01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:10.460
Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.260
Really appreciate it a lot, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.740
Oh, me first?

01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.740
Yes.

01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.740
Okay.

01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:18.740
Happy holidays.

01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:21.300
I hope everyone has fun.

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:25.940
I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so I'll probably...

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:30.900
We're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.

01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:31.900
Cute.

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:33.260
That'll be fun.

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.780
Just have fun, but not too much fun.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:39.700
It's going to be basically, ah, ah.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:42.620
Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.

01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:44.700
Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.

01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.540
Sorry you didn't get to participate in part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:49.540
Any final thoughts?

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.540
Hey, hey, hey.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:54.300
I didn't know I was invited.

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.300
You can come whenever.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.300
Oh, okay.

01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.300
I'm flattered.

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.940
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.

01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.940
All right.

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:04.940
Loki, your final thought?

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:08.340
My final thought is, I've got to return Far Cry.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.500
I'm thinking it's going to suck.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.380
My final thought is Banana Muffin.

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.300
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.300
Exterminate.

01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.300
Exterminate.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:24.300
Okay, I was told one more.

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.860
Okay.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:30.700
Reject false icons, bitches.

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:31.700
I take that back.

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:34.180
This is the best Far Cry vengeance trailer I've seen.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.500
It has a rabbit in it.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:39.500
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and Chris is awesome.

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:40.500
All right.

01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:41.500
You're welcome.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Just so you guys, I agree.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:43.500
I agree.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:48.220
Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, it's

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:51.900
January 7th of 2007, but fear not.

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:55.620
I know a lot of you guys listen to our audio archive podcast, audio RSS, whatever the hell

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.900
you want to call it.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.420
There will be more content coming for you guys there.

01:28:59.420 --> 01:29:03.940
So we'll see you on the podcast and until then have a happy holidays, whatever it is

01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.980
you celebrate, even if you don't celebrate anything at all.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:13.180
Just stay curled up under the blankets and I hope you have a, have fun drinking hot cocoa

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:14.180
or whatever.

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.180
Bite.

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:16.180
Yeah.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.160
If it doesn't work, try adding a little vodka.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:20.160
Have a great night everybody.

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.380
We'll see you next time on Orange Laundry.

01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.820
Thank you for supporting independent radio.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:52.380
Bye.

01:29:52.380 --> 01:30:21.380
Bye.
