13183	26748	Tonight, December 31st, 2006, it's our year-end special with guests from The Bobby Blackwolf Show, STFU, Video Game Outsiders, Pod Culture, Travis Donovan Live, Destructoid.com, and Gamer Tag Radio.
31656	32397	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
57333	58113	Among other things, I'm sure.
58133	58674	Among other things.
58934	59214	All right.
59574	61915	Also, say hello to the one and only Tech Master, Loki.
62155	62375	Hello.
62395	63316	How are you doing, Loki?
64056	64616	I'm doing good.
64936	65237	Awesome.
65637	65837	All right.
65857	68358	Well, tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of show tonight.
68398	70899	We've invited a lot of special guests to come on tonight.
70919	72640	And you're probably wondering, why did we do that?
73020	78222	Well, you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're dedicated to independent radio and giving everyone a voice.
78262	84865	And we do that through the Skype line every week, taking your calls to our 800 number, your voicemails of the week that you leave at 877-GAME-OLR.com.
86246	87767	DarkSakra, how was your gaming week?
112572	113573	It was pretty fun.
114053	118335	I played Cooking Mama at the doctor's office, which was entertaining.
118455	120476	You were poking Mama's steak at the doctor's office?
120496	120936	That's gross.
121177	122938	I was pulling the heads off of shrimp.
123258	123558	I see.
124438	136785	And then went to Roosevelt Golf Line last night, the horrible place that it is, and played lots of Derby Owners Club until it pissed me off that the G1 race was for mares and I had a stallion.
138343	139864	But my horse, Pulp Eater, is awesome.
140244	147990	For those that have never played Derby Owner's Club, because they don't have a lot of these machines everywhere, please explain real quickly, for those that may not know, what is Derby Owner's Crack?
150292	154535	The way the machine looks is you've got two, are they plasma screens?
154635	155716	I think they are.
155936	156256	I believe so.
156276	157337	They're projection screens.
157557	160639	Okay, well, the one at Resolve has a ton of burn-in anyway.
161060	166564	But they're two screens side-by-side so that you get a very, very large widescreen.
166994	168294	Then you have different consoles.
168314	170555	They have one that's either four or eight.
171435	173576	And you sit at that.
173696	176057	You can pay money to breed horses.
176697	178738	And then you train your horse.
178778	180858	You race your horse.
181499	190261	And after a while, after you start breeding your own horses off of your little cards that you get, you can get zebra-looking horses, albino horses.
191702	194343	One person last night had one that looked like that weird...
196553	199396	I want to say it's in the same family as Antelope.
200097	203801	It's got the white jaw, the zebra-striped legs.
204161	205603	One of the other jokes of God.
206644	207465	Hi, I think I'm here.
208105	210608	So what is so alluring about Derby Owner's Crack?
211523	212303	You race your horses.
212463	212964	It's crack.
213324	214044	It's just addicting.
214664	215585	I actually was playing this game.
215605	216665	Why do people play Pokemon?
216905	222567	I was playing this game last night as well, and I had a horse called Paris Hilton, because you get to whip your horse as part of the game.
222607	224468	So it's kind of fun to say, hey, I'm beating Paris Hilton.
224668	225668	My horse was a throwaway.
225708	229349	I named him Poopeater, which I guess DJ Poopeater might appreciate.
229810	230730	I didn't even think about it.
230950	233611	But my next horse I'm going to do, if I get a mare, I'm going to name it Your Mom.
235131	236552	So people say, what were you doing?
236632	238172	Oh, I was with your mom last night.
239213	239373	So...
239998	241378	You're so mature.
241398	243059	I played DDR Supernova.
243959	244839	That machine sucks.
245420	246420	I mean, the game was fun.
246460	247100	It was pretty cool.
247860	253942	Except the pads were, it was the same old crappy extreme machine that was at Roosevelt Golf Land, and the pads were shitty.
254502	262424	And I think, though, when we were playing You're Not Here, I think I twisted my knee, because on the last song, my right knee just started to really kill me.
263424	263784	I'm sorry.
263845	265005	That's why I stopped, right?
265045	266365	Because you know me, I don't stop.
266505	269186	I was like, hell, am I old?
269960	271681	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
295188	296329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
317873	318033	No.
318373	319874	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
319894	324836	Well, other than watching Extrovert play Alien Crush on the Virtual Console.
324856	325837	He's been obsessed with that game.
325857	328238	It needs Devil's Crush, though, because Devil's Crush is so cool.
328278	332800	He says Alien Crush is the best Virtual Console game out there right now, which I entirely disagree with.
332840	337882	Well, Gunstar Heroes was a pretty... I was actually pretty impressed at how well emulated some of these games are.
338442	340283	Super Castlevania IV for life, yo.
341063	344245	They need to somehow put Dracula X on there, because then that would be...
345046	346187	Not the shitty Super Nintendo 1.
346267	346768	Oh, no, no, no.
346868	347408	No, no, no, no.
347428	347969	No, no, no, no.
348629	349110	All right, Loki.
350011	351432	I, too, played a game with a horse.
351832	353013	I played Oblivion.
353033	353794	Final Furlong.
354154	354335	No.
354555	354835	All right.
354995	359139	Elder Scrolls Oblivion, because I thought I had sold it back, but apparently I hadn't.
359639	364524	So I just loaded up a new save game and went around, and I was...
365228	371270	Punching horses and deer and basically destroying small woodland critters.
372010	375471	And it was funny, though, because when you start attacking a horse, they'll actually come after you.
375511	378052	So I opened the gate, and it chased me around for quite a while.
378572	382933	And then a sheep, I managed to kill a sheep, and it made it roll it down the hill.
383253	388334	And finally, I stole a horse and jumped it off a cliff, and then the horse, you know, tumbled to its death, which is funny.
388694	393956	And then a deer, it was funny because there was a deer from far away, and I was just far enough away where I could hit it with, like, my...
395033	403255	Magical Missile Magic Missile If there's any chicks there I want to do them You will only ever hear Rob say that I played the demo I am hell not buying this game Novadrome Horrible Horrible game It was awful
423976	425317	I would never play that game again.
427038	427538	Why not?
427958	428379	Why not?
428559	430480	Because the game looks like it's very cheap.
430760	435303	It wants to be like a Twisted Metal type of game, but it's nowhere near like a Twisted Metal.
435363	443027	It's just very boring and just very... I didn't even really know what the hell I was supposed to do in certain points of the game.
443827	444268	It was dumb.
444628	445268	It was really dumb.
445629	447350	The arenas are very basic and stupid.
448610	450391	No, I don't think so.
451552	453153	Then, of course, let's see...
453737	456678	I played more of Call of Duty 3, actually.
457058	458819	More multiplayer on that, because that's fun.
459519	468102	And we've been doing the thing now where it's either the anti-armor class or the sniper class or whatever.
468543	471664	And so it's either rockets, pistol, or sniper rifle.
471944	474345	And we just play a match just using just those.
474365	474765	Who's we?
475245	475865	You and your coworkers?
475905	479087	Yeah, my coworkers and I will do it during lunch.
479667	479787	And...
480652	481092	It's fun.
481552	486253	It's really fun with rockets and stuff because I'll be driving Jeeps over them and stuff.
487354	488174	It's a lot of fun.
489934	490314	Anything else?
492335	493975	No, that's pretty much it.
495116	497396	Well, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff this week.
497856	499617	I went back to some really weird games.
499797	501197	I went back and played 99 Nights.
501217	504158	I have no idea why, but I think I just wanted to get more achievements.
504534	505475	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
527338	528559	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
555493	564353	Watched me play the game one time, and then I said, here, you play on your account, and he unlocked 20 achievement points just like that, playing one time through the game, having no idea what the eff he was doing.
564533	566097	He got 20 achievement points just like that.
566716	572939	So, if you want some easy achievement points, you whores, go and play RallyX and you can increase your e-penis standings.
573259	579723	By the way, if you are a new Orange Lounge Radio listener, check out our forums, OrangeLoungeRadio.com and check out the OL Army section.
579983	588167	It's our little clan we have across different video games dedicated to just playing games and the number one rule of the OL Army clan is don't be a dick.
588786	594429	So if you think you can do that, then join the OL Army clan and join with some players who aren't being dicks.
594829	609456	And you can join our e-penis leaderboard, which is provided through mygamercard.net, and you can see the standings of all the different people and how many achievement points they have, or as we say on the program, how big your e-penis is, because that's pretty much what achievement points go towards, is how big your e-penis is.
610285	610946	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
639039	640100	Thanks for watching!
657383	664064	The first mixed show is basically dance and club music, some trance music mixed with video game music.
664104	665384	So you have long versions.
665785	680047	I think for this week, for example, we had long versions of some of the Luminous tracks, some stuff from Luminous 2, stuff from DDR, and then of course mixed in with other trance and dance and club music and stuff.
680327	681167	So that was pretty cool.
681867	685728	Then the second show is called
686226	687047	OLR Underground
708055	724869	and that one actually is kind of a smorgasbord of stuff normally stuff you might not normally hear on the radio like synth pop and stuff like that or you know theme shows it's kind of what I used to do on the old live wire not necessarily all dance music but just theme shows and stuff you may not have heard before
725390	729651	I'm looking at some of the feedback because we debuted it for the first time on Friday, December 29th.
729731	731091	I'm looking at some of the feedback in the thread.
731111	732051	You got a lot of great feedback.
732371	733811	23rd Magus says, Rock on, dude.
734131	736212	First broadcast, kick some serious ass.
736592	738372	Sycoon says, Whoa, this is good stuff.
738392	740753	You should post a list of what music you use so I can go find it.
740993	742153	And look at this from Vandalus.
742593	743593	This is awesome, Loki.
743793	745613	Plan on selling some mix CDs sometime?
745713	746554	I'll buy them from you.
746734	748994	Otherwise, may I contract you to make some mix CDs?
749234	749874	I'm serious.
749974	751494	I'll compensate your time and media.
751594	754095	I love well-done mixes and your stuff is always fab.
754115	754815	That's a great compliment.
755606	756006	Thank you.
756927	757808	No, it was fun.
757888	762392	It's a lot of work, but I'm going to stick to it.
762712	766275	The whole point is to have something for everybody at some point.
767316	769998	Maybe you're not into trance music, but maybe you're into hardcore stuff.
770158	771319	I don't know.
771439	780406	The other cool thing about it for the UK listeners is we rebroadcast it on Saturdays at noon, which is 8pm London time.
780566	782108	So it's
783328	784049	DarkSakura.com
794439	796381	Let's start off the show tonight.
796521	797962	Let's talk about a little bit of news.
798022	802847	Because even though it's been a slow news week because of the holidays and everything, there have been some stories.
803127	805869	We're going to do something a little different from our usual game.
806009	808852	Usually we all go around and we'll all share a little bit of news.
809112	817299	But because tonight's show is a little bit special and the focus of tonight's show is really our guests, we're just going to give Loki about five or ten minutes to just run down some of the latest news headlines.
817319	818540	So Loki, take it away.
818620	819681	Tell us what's been going on this week.
819921	821582	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
846668	850534	So that's actually pretty sweet, and they've had some pretty cool videos up from that.
852156	862369	Of course, now another thing that we've heard about is price drops in the 360, and what's going to make that possible, of course, is the brand new 65 nanometer processors.
863053	866355	which are going to be a lot smaller, a lot cheaper to produce, and a lot cooler.
866636	870538	Of course, right now those aren't ready, and so it's actually being delayed now.
871138	874661	Instead of quarter one 2007, it's going to be mid-2007.
874721	877322	Do you think that's actually going to cause 360's price to drop?
878083	881565	For Microsoft it will, but they're not going to drop the price, at least not until Christmas.
881585	883406	They just want to make money on their consoles for a little bit.
883907	885748	They won't drop it until they have to drop it.
886701	891382	Do you think when Sony finally comes around and drops the price of their console, that'll be what Microsoft's response is?
891722	892022	Definitely.
893262	897323	Mario Kart 64 is one of the titles slated to head to the Virtual Console in January.
898943	899703	Yay!
899763	900403	Toad's Highway!
900584	903244	We're probably going to get it at some point as well.
903724	905024	This will make you happy, though.
905524	908965	Additional classics coming to the Virtual Console also announced for Japan.
909185	914786	Ice Climber, Kid Icarus, and Zelda 2 Adventures of Link will be
915362	917823	Hedden as well, and then of course, you know, more Genesis.
917883	919164	God damn it, Nintendo.
919384	920084	God damn you.
920265	922306	Give us a new Kid Icarus.
922686	924107	Don't screw with the formula.
924147	927668	Just a fun little 2D game with, you know, like New Super Mario Brothers was.
928289	930690	Just a fun little game that I can play on the console.
931562	933063	Me love you long time if you do that for me.
933223	934204	Please, Nintendo.
934544	939048	Did you see the new things that they have over, was it the Club Nintendo Store or whatever they have?
939068	941690	Was it Tingle's Balloon Fight?
942130	942870	Not in this country.
943011	944031	Yeah, not in this country.
944692	951497	I have the thing tied to my Nintendo account, so every time I buy a virtual console game, it attaches to my Nintendo account.
951757	956160	And believe me, I have almost filled up a second screen of channels on the Wii.
956200	959743	That's how many of those stupid virtual console games I've bought on Total Impulse Buys.
960413	962354	Not a damn reward thing from Nintendo yet.
962474	962994	I'm open.
963454	967135	There are three months of Nintendo Power, which is lame.
967155	969856	Yeah, I got that a long time ago, though, when I registered my GameCube.
970036	970576	Whoop-de-doo.
970936	971496	Okay, anyways.
972596	977258	Sega Sammy is going to be teaming up with Sanrio to make some Hello Kitty games.
977558	977958	Woo-hoo!
978378	978758	Oh, goody.
979658	981679	And that's all I'm going to report for that.
981799	983039	Bad Batsamaru the game.
983059	983600	Okay, thanks.
984580	984880	Anyways.
985843	997855	Capcom, they're slated to release an amazing number of titles 77 new titles across all platforms Games on multiple platforms count more as one How many of those will be Street Fighter 2 rehashed?
998816	999897	I don't know, I think these are new games
1001343	1011989	7 of which I believe are going to be for the, no actually 6 are going to be for the Xbox 360 so that's kind of cool because they've had some good runs wait out of 77 new games 6 for the 360?
1013490	1028739	77 games total but those 77 games are on multiple platforms so if they have something on like 6 platforms that counts as 6 games I get it now 2 rumored titles of course were going to be God Hand and Okami but that ended up being a mistranslation of
1029226	1031047	Techin5 Techin Dark Resurrection Techin5
1059386	1060886	I'm still holding out for Tekken 6 though.
1062147	1069508	Anyways, of course, not a big surprise, but Christopher Gans is talking about doing a Silent Hill 2.
1071248	1072308	Yay!
1072428	1073529	You just want more Pyramid Head.
1074009	1074369	No!
1075329	1079350	Okay, first of all, Red Pyramid is not my focus in Silent Hill.
1079830	1083231	It's all the other creepy, cool stuff that goes on that makes me all happy.
1083291	1085671	I love the psychological parts behind it.
1086391	1088292	You know, I was checking something out.
1088312	1091953	I was looking at the various game blogs this week, and I saw something that totally made me think of you.
1091993	1097994	And I want to say I saw it over on Destructoid.com that they ran this story earlier this week about a pillow that involved Pyramid Head.
1098014	1099075	Let me see if I can find it here.
1099895	1103936	We're still taping live, boys and girls, so pardon the delay here.
1103976	1104316	Here we go.
1104376	1104736	I found it.
1104756	1105056	There it is.
1105517	1109358	It's a little homemade Pyramid Head pillow that says, Rape, Sweet Rape.
1110618	1111798	And I thought of you when I saw that.
1112459	1113719	That's so sweet.
1115494	1120998	Actually, somebody on DeviantArt put up a Pyramid Head plushie, and I want one.
1121498	1122239	So it's funny.
1122459	1124981	It's a bit of irony, I guess.
1125361	1131706	But remember last week we were talking about the British sites getting penalized for selling Halo 3 beta codes.
1131726	1132546	Wait, wait, back up for a minute.
1132947	1138591	On the Silent Hill thing, I heard that the writer, or whoever they said was supposedly writing it, came out and said, no, I'm not really writing it.
1139091	1141493	So is it still kind of a question mark, or what?
1141513	1143635	I think Christopher Gans wants to do it, but, you know.
1143815	1144115	All right.
1144759	1152863	Anyway, so as I mentioned, a bit of irony from last week where Microsoft was punishing those British sites for selling Halo 3 beta codes.
1153844	1166010	Well, come to find out, according to the latest issue of GamePro Magazine, Microsoft will be selling Halo 3 beta invitations with Crackdown, their brand new game coming out in March, or not March, February.
1166890	1173674	And, I mean, personally I was going to buy Crackdown anyways, but this is more incentive to buy it, even if you might not want to play Crackdown, you're going to buy it to get a Halo 3 beta.
1174690	1178131	It's like rain on your wedding day.
1178571	1179651	But Crackdown's an awesome game.
1179671	1181472	You should pick it up anyways.
1182472	1190274	But if you're not a fan of Crackdown and you maybe have a PC and were a little bit disappointed by Red Steel, you'll be happy to... A little bit disappointed.
1190694	1192714	A lot disappointed in Red Steel.
1192854	1202397	GoldenEye Source, the beta has been launched and you can download it now from the official website which is GoldenEyeSource.com and it looks pretty.
1203137	1203697	Definitely pretty.
1204532	1219947	Um, and then, you know, we report on this probably about every month or so, but, um, brand new game coming to the Dreamcast, uh, Karos, um, and it's apparently a game, a new side-scroller, like, shooter game, and it's kind of a
1220919	1225002	Black and White, actually, giving it kind of a gothic feel.
1225042	1227845	Dreamcast fans, look, I know you're really attached to your system.
1227905	1237253	Dreamcast was a horribly underrated and great system, I understand that, but seriously, you will not have another game as good as Soul Calibur or any of those games that were as good on Dreamcast.
1237293	1237693	You won't.
1238053	1243478	You think these new games are going to be like classics as good as some of those games you had on Dreamcast?
1243698	1246140	For the benefit of our listeners, I'm frumping it, Rob.
1248738	1249479	I like quirky games, right?
1272183	1276907	and I'm saying that there's going to be some sort of built-in flash drive or hard drive into it.
1277327	1286614	Well, some more stuff coming out from Samsung actually, a presentation that they did showcasing their 60 gigabyte 1.8 inch hard drive.
1287455	1293560	It's not really a confirmation, however, there was a nice little illustration that they had
1294148	1299875	I'm showing a PSP and it says, tagline, enjoy the movies everywhere.
1299996	1308887	Look, you could put arms and legs on the PSP so it could vacuum my house and do my fucking dishes, but nobody's going to buy them until they actually have more of those must-have games.
1308967	1310509	Metal Gear Portable Ops, good start.
1310609	1312792	Luminous, yes, but needs more.
1314386	1339213	and then one last thing I'd like to mention because we were watching it before we started the show here and I highly recommend checking it out on YouTube Saints Row Glitches the Musical and absolutely hilarious if you haven't checked it out yet you can check it out on the original website that it came out on which was www.cabel.name that's C-A-B-E-L dot N-A-M-E
1343494	1351922	slash 2006 slash 12 and then buggy-saints-row-musical.html I hope you guys can write that.
1352182	1356406	Or just go to cabal.name and I'm sure that they have a link on there.
1357747	1363452	Hilarious musical and all I gotta say is where's my fucking car?
1365405	1371690	Alright, well, as we promised, we want to bring on some special guests to talk about the year 2006 in review.
1371730	1373612	It's been a really interesting year.
1373652	1376234	What would you guys say were some of the highlights of 2006?
1377315	1381538	Not just in gaming, but just in your lives that go around gaming.
1381578	1383520	Like, you know, I think of one of the highlights being E3.
1383540	1385121	You know, every year E3 is one of the big highlights.
1385141	1388864	And just us getting to go down to the E3 outpost and everything and have a good time there.
1388884	1389985	What were some of the highlights you guys thought of 2006?
1390105	1393448	Corny, but I'm going to go ahead and say it.
1393468	1393888	And that was
1394403	1394563	E3 Loki
1421738	1427683	Being one of the first people in the United States to actually be able to play the DDR Supernova machine at Konami's Gamer Day.
1428163	1428964	Ah, okay, cool.
1429464	1429905	That's right.
1430705	1431246	And then the Wii.
1433868	1438091	Of course, some of that fire burnt out when the actual console launched.
1438331	1439052	It was exciting.
1439132	1441694	Okay, it's like just everything.
1441734	1445437	Yeah, but that's because you've allowed yourself to buy a lot of crap games for that system.
1445477	1446798	You should have just beat Zelda.
1447599	1449040	You should have just played Zelda until you beat it.
1449060	1450641	No, I really haven't been playing Zelda much.
1450701	1451162	What the hell?
1451570	1452471	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1471630	1476412	We never have talked to before, but we thought maybe they'd want to come on and say hi and be a part of this.
1476452	1479854	So we want to thank everybody who came on, and let's kick it off.
1479894	1482895	Jamie, who's going to come on our show first and open up the first box?
1482915	1485336	Let's have Bobby Blackwolf from allgames.com.
1491879	1495161	All right, let's go to the phones where Bobby Blackwolf is there.
1495321	1496081	Bobby, you there?
1496702	1497382	Yeah, I am.
1497422	1497782	What's up?
1497982	1499043	Hey, not a lot.
1499063	1499723	How are you doing?
1500399	1500999	I'm doing good.
1501059	1502040	How was your holidays?
1502300	1503540	It wasn't too bad.
1503580	1504220	How about yourself?
1505081	1505701	I did pretty good.
1505741	1506381	I did pretty good.
1506621	1509422	Yeah, you've had a pretty good year all around over at All Games, haven't you?
1510643	1511743	Well, we're trying, yeah.
1512343	1521767	Well, it seems to me that just recently I was on dig.com looking at their podcasting list, and someone's kicking our butt by a mile on the rankings there, and I think his name is Bobby.
1521787	1522387	Y'all are joining him.
1522647	1522887	What?
1522927	1523667	Y'all are coming up.
1524868	1528609	Well, you're doing pretty darn good there for just one guy doing his own show there.
1529932	1535216	Yeah, it's hard to try to do it every week and know that I have no net, but people seem to enjoy it, so I just keep on doing it.
1535476	1536437	Well, very good there.
1536917	1539118	Well, Bobby, you know, you've been a longtime friend of the show.
1539138	1544042	We had a great time with you at the E3 Outpost this year and just hanging and, you know, bringing us into the All Games family.
1544062	1546363	We've had an awesome time with everybody over there at that site.
1546744	1551967	We definitely wanted you to be one of the first to play our little game here called the Year 06 in Review.
1551987	1552408	So you ready?
1553068	1553428	I'm ready.
1553528	1556250	All right, we've got 15 cases there.
1556771	1558072	Pick one of the cases, 1 through 15.
1560922	1562243	All right, let's open up seven.
1565845	1570948	All right, what did you think was the best voice acting in a game in the year 2006?
1571669	1575751	Now, keep in mind, Bobby had no idea of these categories in advance.
1576091	1577052	This is all surprise.
1577392	1579193	The best voice acting, in your opinion?
1580274	1580594	Damn.
1581694	1582595	You picked a tough one.
1583055	1583595	Yeah, I did.
1583976	1585356	I screwed Lucky Seven there.
1587299	1589980	Because Uno had no voice acting, so I can't choose that.
1591501	1596242	Well, Uno kind of did have the people going, you know, F you, draw four, bitch, right?
1596723	1601404	Did you play any of the, you know, well, you can't do Zelda either, because Link doesn't really talk in Zelda.
1601444	1601784	Hey!
1603005	1603285	Hey!
1604085	1604866	Come over here!
1605066	1605446	Listen!
1606286	1611008	One of the ones, I actually was really impressed, and I like some of the voice acting so far in Final Fantasy XII.
1613280	1619646	which may not be something a lot of people talk about because it's an old PS2 game but I want to give that game a lot of props because I have been enjoying it.
1621328	1625952	Final Fantasy XII is kind of interesting because it's such a landmark series, the Final Fantasy series.
1626132	1635682	I've personally been a Final Fantasy whore for the longest time but XII kind of got lost in this whole shuffle of next-gen systems which seems like such a shame because it's such an awesome game.
1636818	1646000	Right, and, you know, that's why I'm not that far in it, because I keep having to, like, look at other things that's going on and stuff, so I definitely want to keep playing it and get farther.
1646040	1649260	It's just, you know, right now I don't have the time to get into it.
1649360	1651441	And there's so many side quests, too, in that game.
1651481	1658222	Like, I feel like I'm barely making any progress in that game at all, you know, with all the people that you can talk to and the hunts and all that other stuff, so.
1658342	1658642	Yeah.
1658662	1660483	Do you have a favorite character in Final Fantasy XII?
1661043	1662323	Ask me when I'm a little bit farther in the game.
1662529	1663890	All right, I'm going to tell you this.
1664251	1666653	I think it's all about Balthier, by the way.
1666733	1670216	I don't know how far you're in it, but he's the bomb, and he has a great voice actor.
1670236	1672678	I think that's one of my favorite performances of the year.
1673138	1678443	Okay, well, since that was a tough category to pick a game for, you get a really easy news topic.
1678503	1679924	I'm curious about your thoughts.
1680225	1683187	The news topic that's in your case is Bye Bye E3.
1683247	1689693	Of course, the big news, E3 2006, the last year as we know it, quote, unquote.
1689913	1694876	What was your reaction when you heard the news about E3, you know, kind of going away and changing for the new year?
1695637	1697478	You killed my birthday, you bastards.
1698019	1699420	Did that news come out on your birthday?
1700060	1701461	No, but E3 was on my birthday.
1702001	1702802	Oh, that's right.
1702822	1704703	And they're talking about changing the time frame to it, too.
1705103	1705344	Yeah.
1706764	1717492	So, no, to be serious about E3 for a second, I mean, it really got to be too much of a circus and it was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see because I had to wait for...
1718231	1719731	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1744927	1746208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1763695	1764435	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1786987	1789088	I probably should put these on YouTube.
1789168	1793749	I actually stunk my video camera in in some of the early years to the Square presentation and videoed the whole thing.
1794029	1794410	Wow.
1794830	1800732	And I should probably try to get some of that because it's on old VHSC tapes from my old camera.
1800752	1806313	So I was trying to get into a format that I can put up on YouTube or something because you're not supposed to have the cameras in there.
1806553	1808014	Yeah, you get big trouble for that.
1808573	1811255	E3 was getting worse and worse off and harder to get things done
1832347	1833948	and it just became more of a spectacle.
1833988	1840110	So I knew it was going to downsize sometime, but I didn't think it was going to downsize this much and for this reason.
1840490	1854896	Yeah, you know, I don't know how DarkSakura and Loki feel, what they thought when they kind of saw that, but I kind of thought when I was walking around and looking at it, I thought, you know, something's wrong here when we have like this six-hour wait to see the Wii and then a two-hour wait to see Paris Hilton.
1856176	1860718	I remember getting diverted by Paris Hilton's bodyguards and I'm like, something is wrong with this picture.
1861098	1862479	This is not about video games now.
1863479	1863920	Right.
1864020	1868603	It was about a big arcade and a big festival, and it was like the mecca for gamers.
1868703	1874746	And so what they're trying to do with the new, what is actually E3, is saying this is not for the gamers.
1874806	1877608	We're not going to make this attractive for gamers to go to.
1877648	1880029	And in fact, all the gamers are saying the new E3 is boring.
1880850	1883311	But it's exactly what the industry probably needs.
1883411	1885793	So you think this new E3 is going to be a good thing?
1886932	1888613	GamePro Expo GamePro Expo GamePro Expo
1914117	1920542	Gamers want to go to E3, but E3 is not going to go to GamePro Expo, and they're not going to bring the big lavish booths.
1920582	1926866	The booth babes may not be there in as much capacity as they were at E3, and so I think the gamers might get disappointed.
1927286	1939435	So you think they'll have a lot of the same first-year issues that a lot of startup cons have, cons that we've seen in their first year that have needed room to grow, such as the Video Game Expo and Penny Arcade Expo and all those.
1940115	1940535	Exactly.
1941156	1941416	All right.
1941826	1944527	Well, thank you so much for your thoughts on the E3.
1944587	1950929	Now we're going around, we're going to poll everybody today, try to figure out definitively what, in your opinion, was the best game of 2006.
1951169	1958911	Okay, the best game, which is why I didn't vote for this in the best voice acting, is Oblivion.
1959511	1969595	And the reason that I'm saying Oblivion and not any of those first-person shooters that I'm sure everybody else is saying is because I have watched my girlfriend play this game for well over 200 hours.
1969635	1969715	Wow.
1969735	1969855	She's
1971559	1973981	She's beaten the game like twice.
1974621	1979584	She's gotten all the achievements, but she still keeps on going back in and saying, oh, there's another dungeon I can go loot.
1979825	1981005	It's all the add-ons, right?
1981206	1981386	Right.
1981806	1983007	Well, it's not even just the add-ons.
1983027	1986409	She'll finish the add-ons and then just keep on going and finding new dungeons.
1986469	1988090	And she's been playing for over 200 hours.
1988551	1997937	So my thing is any game that is offline single player that can hook you in that much, just like a World of Warcraft or an EverQuest could do,
1998755	2000175	That deserves props.
2000555	2006917	Because I don't think people are playing Gears of War single player offline for over 200 hours and still finding new things to do.
2007257	2008858	Alright, interesting perspective.
2008898	2010338	How about the worst game of 2007?
2010618	2010858	Or 2006?
2011058	2015099	We don't know 2007 yet, but worst game of 2006?
2017140	2018040	Sonic the Hedgehog.
2018580	2019461	Ooh, ouch.
2020221	2022161	Any particular platform or just in general?
2023602	2024522	Just in general.
2024882	2025682	What went wrong?
2025762	2027383	Sonic the Hedgehog used to be so rad.
2027403	2027423	3D.
2029506	2029646	Oh.
2030167	2032328	But this isn't the first Sonic 3D game.
2032648	2034429	You can go all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis.
2034870	2037091	But that's where it went wrong.
2037651	2041034	It was great as a 2D game, but I don't think it's working too well as a 3D game.
2041074	2045276	And I liked Sonic Adventure, but it was no original Sonic.
2045997	2046297	All right.
2046795	2050237	Alright, well, I don't think you'll be the only one to pick that as the worst game of the year.
2050938	2064527	Looking forward to 2007, you know, you do a lot of work with independent press, and certainly, you know, Orange Lounge being in this all-games thing, and all-games interactive, and your own show, kind of all pushing towards this independent, you know, news going into 2007.
2065167	2069210	What do you think the impact is going to be of the independent gaming press in 2007?
2069590	2072152	Do you think they're going to be more relevant, less relevant?
2072172	2073913	Do you think their credibility was damaged in 06?
2074373	2076635	What do you think is going to happen in 07 with the independent media?
2078276	2078597	and so on.
2106758	2111862	We're not as in the pocket as the mainstream press.
2112142	2117247	We will actually say what we feel instead of what they want us to say about a game that's in a preview.
2117787	2119108	And so it's really going to be interesting.
2119148	2121970	It depends on how the companies react to the independent press.
2122030	2123151	But Microsoft gets it.
2123852	2130877	I think Nintendo is trying to get it, but I think they're failing right now based on some of the other independent press that I've talked to.
2131418	2132559	And Sony, who knows?
2134073	2137834	Sony just needs any press right now, any good press they can get.
2138895	2140935	All right, well, tell us a little something about your show.
2140955	2144197	We want to let all our guests pimp their show, so tell us a little something about your show.
2144997	2146517	Okay, well, it's the Bobby Blackwolf Show.
2147158	2149078	We do it Sunday nights at 8 p.m.
2149138	2149879	Eastern, 5 p.m.
2149919	2154620	Pacific, and we try our hardest to end right when Orange Lounge Radio starts.
2155461	2156661	We're on All Games Radio.
2156701	2159022	We broadcast live on All Games Radio over at allgames.com.
2160029	2160549	and DarkSakura.com.
2182884	2183965	XNA Game on Live XNA Game on Live
2205100	2211833	Not on live arcade, but there are people that have already created games using the beta XNA because it's been out since September.
2211853	2213856	You don't think anyone's going to break through that barrier?
2215058	2216601	Not to get on live arcade.
2217802	2218422	Thanks for watching!
2235345	2237485	and put them on like a PlayStation Underground CD.
2238486	2245047	Ah, that would be kind of, hey, that would give some of those gaming CDs a little something extra as opposed to the same demos you can download online.
2245087	2245627	That's a good idea.
2246207	2252889	Right, because the thing that sets XNA apart from like Xbox Live Arcade is because Xbox Live Arcade, you know, has like that 50 meg barrier.
2253489	2256029	Well, you have two gigs with XNA.
2256790	2263051	So most people making XNA games probably wouldn't be able to condense it down to an Xbox Live Arcade executable.
2263731	2263891	Hmm.
2264420	2264660	All right.
2264680	2265760	So it may have to be on CDs.
2265801	2266321	All right.
2266341	2268922	Well, I look forward to hearing more about this progress on your program, Bobby.
2269422	2269582	Yep.
2269842	2271483	Bobby Blackwolf, always a good friend of the show.
2271503	2274864	Thanks so much for being here, and happy 2006, and best to come for you in 2007.
2274904	2278545	Yeah, thank you, and Happy New Year to all y'all.
2284607	2284907	All right.
2284927	2287068	Thanks so much to Bobby for coming on the show.
2287188	2292530	It's Best Voice Acting in Bye Bye E3 were the topics he pulled out of that box.
2293157	2296219	So it's kind of sad, though, that E3 is going to be different.
2296339	2299642	It's not going to be the big deal it was before, but I don't know.
2299662	2300863	What do you guys think about that whole thing?
2301263	2302484	Well, hopefully they'll do that.
2302965	2317656	Well, they have a bunch of alternate kind of events going on around that time anyways, and if anything, I think the lack of the official E3 will bring more gaming events, hopefully some in Northern California, and more is better, I think.
2318320	2320121	Big thanks to Bobby for coming on the show.
2321081	2322882	We've actually been working with Bobby pretty much all year.
2323543	2329706	We joined the All Games community probably back in January or February, I believe, is when we joined up.
2329726	2333568	We've really had a good year working with Bobby's show and got to meet him in E3.
2333608	2334588	He's a good guy.
2334988	2335508	Very knowledgeable.
2335689	2339170	You know what my other favorite thing of 2006 was?
2340011	2344473	Meeting Bobby and Scott and Lawrence for the first time in San Jose.
2345276	2346296	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2364361	2364722	I don't know.
2364782	2365763	I don't know if I get this.
2365803	2378959	But then having actually met him and interacted with him, not only is he so knowledgeable with games and just has a real passion for games, but you kind of learn more about how TV can really alter the perception of what a real person is.
2379019	2384325	And I know some other hosts, previous hosts on G4 Network across the board get some bad raps sometimes.
2384645	2389728	Like Tommy Tallarico, I met him at E3, and you would think watching him on TV, like, what a pompous ass.
2390048	2391469	But no, he's actually really cool.
2391549	2392290	He's really nice.
2392570	2394251	And so I really enjoyed that.
2394311	2395031	So it's pretty cool.
2395872	2396112	All right.
2396472	2397593	Jamie, who's coming on next?
2398793	2401375	That would be DMN from STFU.
2407150	2407630	DarkSakura and Loki
2432028	2436550	That was actually quite a fun time, despite all the crap that I did talk on the episode I appeared.
2438130	2442231	Well, did you have a good time handing out the cookies and everything to the Wii line waiters when we did that whole thing?
2442692	2444012	Oh yeah, that was a blast.
2444792	2446753	Alright, here's how it's going to work, DMN.
2446813	2453555	We have 14 cases for you to pick from, and inside the case is a game category and news topic we want your opinion on.
2453575	2454456	So what's it going to be, 1 through 14?
2457697	2458817	Big bucks, no whammies, 14.
2458857	2459277	14, here we go.
2465049	2469671	Alright, your topic is game I most want a sequel for in 2007.
2469891	2472713	This is a no-brainer.
2473073	2473613	Sneak King.
2473993	2474914	Sneak King!
2476314	2477295	Why Sneak King?
2479115	2488120	Well, I got a chance to play it over the weekend, and I have to say that for $4, it's ridiculously simple and actually a lot of fun.
2489040	2492802	And I need another game to buy my dad to scare the crap out of him from 407, so...
2493789	2502292	You know what's interesting is that game being $4 was better than some of the games that, you know, we were paying $5, $10, $8, $6, depending on what system it was.
2502572	2504532	It was better than a lot of the games we were paying more money for.
2504993	2509254	It was better than a lot of the games that were retailing for $40, which is kind of scary.
2509494	2516856	That's true, that's true, because when you consider there's certain games, now I don't want to name names, but Bomberman X Zero, that they're charging $60 for.
2516876	2518637	Don't knock the hedgehog, I'm sorry.
2519417	2522238	Well, we'll get to what you think is the worst game a little later in the show.
2522258	2522918	So, Sneak King.
2523158	2525179	You want to see Sneak King 2 in 2017?
2525639	2530600	I do, and I think Burger King would be smart to do it because those games are actually outselling Gears of War.
2531421	2532461	Well, but wait a minute, though.
2532481	2535762	That's a little bit of a warped statistic because you're putting the three games together.
2536722	2538563	That's still pretty good.
2538583	2539063	Yeah, it's still not bad.
2539083	2541484	They're selling over a million copies combined, which is incredible.
2541504	2542384	Yeah, that's still not bad.
2542664	2547445	Do you think that there's another commercial entity that Microsoft should be hooking up with?
2548986	2549106	Ugh.
2550766	2551526	I don't know.
2553107	2555028	No, I don't know.
2555068	2558169	I like Burger King just because the king scares the crap out of everybody.
2559530	2561871	I really don't see any other corporate icons.
2562551	2564132	It did have a pretty freaky opening movie.
2565163	2565543	Oh yeah.
2565964	2567825	Maybe the Jack thing from Jack in the Box.
2567865	2568906	That guy's kind of creepy too.
2569126	2569746	That might work.
2570527	2572368	Alright, here's the news topic we want your opinion on.
2572408	2575670	Of course, PlayStation 3, very controversial device this year.
2575870	2578952	Specifically, the Blu-ray shortages.
2579072	2583855	The Blu-ray diode shortages causing there to be delays in PlayStation 3s this year.
2584255	2587618	Was it a good idea for Sony to include the Blu-ray with their console?
2589299	2590560	I think it was inevitable.
2590900	2592461	I don't think Sony...
2593407	2593667	and so on.
2617731	2618392	Thanks for watching!
2639960	2647523	How important do you think it is in the war on HD DVD that Blu-ray is waging?
2648364	2652525	Do you think that being in the PlayStation 3 gives it an edge in that war?
2653646	2654226	Yes, I do.
2654706	2667791	I think mainly because the higher, I won't say the higher end because we all know the first generation players are crappy, but the higher priced ones are about $1,000 whereas the low end PS3 is $500 which is half the price
2669540	2672302	and it's about the price of a pretty good HD DVD player.
2672403	2681971	So Sony was smart in releasing at least a $500 price point on one of the versions of the PlayStation 3 to keep up with the HD DVD war.
2682171	2687696	But looking at it, it's about $500 if you get a 360 and an HD DVD drive.
2688116	2688877	So it's the same thing.
2689377	2690859	We'll see what happens in 2007.
2690919	2693461	What Blu-ray movie are you wanting to see really bad?
2694198	2694438	Anything?
2694458	2695178	Talladega Nights.
2695458	2700060	I have no interest to see anything really in Blu-ray or HD DVD yet.
2701660	2703501	I'm looking forward to seeing Silent Hill at some point.
2704241	2705362	Because that should be second.
2706062	2710283	I did say over the weekend I did see Batman Begins on HD DVD and it looked really amazing.
2710923	2711644	Alright, we'll see.
2711984	2715725	Alright, we're also taking everybody's opinion and counting it up by the end of the show.
2715785	2718146	What do you believe was the best game of 2006?
2719986	2723047	The best game of 2006 was not a console game.
2723167	2724747	It was actually a handheld game.
2724887	2726868	I believe that New Super Mario Bros.
2726948	2727688	is the game of the year.
2727888	2729028	New Super Mario Bros.
2729068	2729648	game of the year.
2729728	2734870	Now, this is something I'm seeing in a lot of top ten lists, but I'm not seeing take the cake in many polls.
2735210	2736930	Why does this game take the cake for you?
2737690	2749553	Well, if you've seen throughout maybe the past five, six years, any Mario game that's come out, either has the word party after it, either has something to do with sports, or is a 3D adventure that's awful.
2751339	2760801	It was a breath of fresh air, I think, across all sorts of levels to see a 2D platformer that was fun and somewhat challenging.
2761641	2764721	Alright, what do you think was the worst game of 2006?
2766082	2766982	That's a tough call.
2768382	2771243	I would have to say... Yikes.
2773723	2775343	You must have played quite a few bad ones.
2776083	2777444	Oh, you have no idea.
2777824	2778864	I would have to say...
2780551	2782732	This did come out in 2006, technically.
2783772	2785033	I would have to say Chibi-Robo.
2785733	2786273	What's this?
2786834	2787634	Chibi-Robo.
2787994	2788834	It was released in Europe in 2006.
2788874	2790335	Oh, okay.
2790775	2791515	Why this game?
2793516	2800899	It felt like it was ripping off Katamari Damacy a little bit, and while it was a good idea on paper, it was executed poorly.
2802039	2802299	All right.
2802339	2804740	Well, that's one vote for Chibi-Robo.
2805020	2805340	Is that it?
2805621	2805841	Yes.
2806061	2806781	All right.
2806801	2807561	Chibi-Robo.
2807601	2808302	Chibi-Robo.
2808502	2809522	I've never even heard of that.
2809966	2810766	I love bad games.
2810806	2811486	I'll have to look that up.
2812067	2813067	It's for the GameCube.
2813527	2813807	All right.
2814307	2816588	Hey, I got a question for you also about 2007.
2816968	2821169	Now, you know, I know you've got a lot of loyalty to Nintendo because, you know, you work for Nintendo.
2821189	2827571	So let me ask you specifically about Sony versus Microsoft because Nintendo has kind of decided to go in this whole different direction with the Wii thing.
2827911	2831132	So where do you see the Sony-Microsoft war headed in 2007?
2832712	2835873	I see it headed towards new formats.
2836013	2837914	I think Microsoft's going to be...
2841249	2845972	They're going to try to make some point of making games for that HD DVD drive to sell it.
2847532	2850374	I think Sony is going to be a lot more focused on the PS3.
2850674	2857217	I think one with their marketing campaigns and just the complete lack of games for their PSP, they need to scrap that.
2857577	2864581	As I've said on my own show, that thing needs to be dead by the end of 07 because the more money Sony puts into that portable...
2865367	2867549	and they're going to lose even more money on it.
2867609	2869570	So you think the PSP is a done deal?
2870411	2875714	There's talk about they should re-release a PSP Lite kind of thing like Nintendo did, but you say no.
2875854	2876395	Scrap it all.
2876755	2879036	If you release a PSP Lite, I don't know what you're going to do.
2879056	2893006	I don't know how you're going to make that thing any thinner or more portable because the thing's already... You can hold it enough and the screen's so big and I know Sony's not going to want to sacrifice dumbing down that screen
2893590	2899554	I realize we're talking kind of the end of 2006 here, but do you think Metal Gear Portable Ops gave the system the kick in the pants it needed?
2900174	2900354	No.
2901055	2901835	No, you don't think it's enough?
2902496	2902636	No.
2903796	2904037	Alright.
2904337	2909020	Well, quick, give us a plug for your show, DMN, that you have here on Orange Launch Radio.
2909360	2916965	Yeah, you guys need to listen Thursdays at 7pm, Saturdays at 2pm, STFU with myself and DJ Tyrant.
2917125	2919246	It's a lot quicker than this show is.
2919866	2920607	What are you trying to say?
2921960	2923362	Hey, what are you trying to call small?
2923382	2923482	Yeah.
2942170	2943351	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2970285	2970845	Thanks for watching!
2989979	2990619	DDR cups?
2990999	2994380	Yeah, he sent this picture of a DDR cup from Burger King for no reason to my phone.
2994400	2994980	I want a DDR cup.
2995200	2998681	Do they have those plastic cups, or is it just their normal cardboard cup?
2998701	2999541	I think it's plastic.
2999902	3001622	I'd have to check the picture again.
3001642	3009624	You know what's funny, though, is actually since I do this retail site training for Microsoft, and they have free things.
3009724	3017226	When you go through their training program, you can buy little tchotchkes and stuff, and they have an Xbox 360 Tumblr glass thing.
3017306	3018606	I was thinking about buying that.
3018846	3019647	She'd get one of those.
3019927	3029953	By the way, while we're talking about DDR cups, we want to give a huge Orange Lounge Radio thank you to our listener, Misty, who sent us a copy of the DDR soundtrack that they're selling at Burger King.
3030433	3034836	And not only that, but Misty's always been a really great supporter of Orange Lounge Radio.
3035096	3037178	She sent us a gift certificate for Live 365.
3037258	3041881	So January is Misty month on Live 365 because essentially she's paid for it.
3042801	3044363	So we wanted to say thanks to Misty.
3044383	3046704	And she also sent us samples of the jewelry she's been making.
3047045	3050387	She's been making OL Army jewelry and selling it on our forums.
3050747	3054290	And we gave the OL Army one to Jamie for her cell phone, and she's been using that.
3054450	3055251	It's on my phone.
3055671	3056632	It's oranging it up.
3057256	3058677	So thank you, everybody.
3058717	3059518	Thank you, Misty.
3059638	3060018	Thank you.
3060138	3060739	Thank you.
3060799	3061059	All right.
3062120	3065483	And thank you, DMN, also, as well, for coming to visit and that Wii line.
3065523	3068145	When we went out and gave the cookies and soda to the Wii line.
3068165	3068686	That was fun.
3068826	3070007	We met so many cool people.
3070047	3072029	I hope some of them are still listening to the show.
3072049	3077073	I saw, was it the one chick that he gave, was it a hat to?
3077133	3077353	Yeah.
3077613	3079475	I saw her at GameStop the other day.
3079515	3079855	Really?
3080075	3080496	Yeah.
3080516	3081476	Did she recognize you at all?
3081637	3081937	No.
3082217	3085520	I didn't say anything because I'm an ass and I don't, I don't.
3085840	3088823	Talk to people, but I saw her and I recognized her.
3089144	3090525	She was in line with me and Chris.
3090565	3091586	Yeah, she was cool.
3091646	3092527	She was hanging out with us.
3092567	3094429	Damn it, we should have emailed her and brought her on the show.
3094449	3095310	Oh, well, we'll get her next time.
3096551	3098253	Well, if I see her again, I'll say hi.
3098514	3099254	All right, you do that.
3099495	3101817	All right, in the meantime, let's say hi to some more guests.
3101897	3102998	Jamie, who's coming on next?
3104099	3108284	That would be John and Michelle from Video Game Outsiders.
3115217	3119901	All right, and we're joined on the line by Michelle and John from the Video Game Outsiders.
3119941	3121302	You guys there, Michelle, John?
3122482	3122903	We're here.
3123183	3124324	Hey, how you guys doing?
3124964	3125845	What's up, you mother?
3128147	3130008	Happy 2006, soon to be 2007 to you.
3130348	3132270	That's right.
3132590	3135192	Now, 2006 has been a really good year for you guys, huh?
3136790	3137130	It has.
3137750	3143793	We've actually kind of gone beyond what we thought we would do with this little podcast here, and we're enjoying it.
3144193	3144813	Yeah, awesome.
3144833	3148114	You guys just recently won like an Xbox award, right?
3148915	3149335	We did.
3149495	3150335	Podcast of the Year.
3150375	3151095	How about that, huh?
3151376	3152156	Very cool.
3152196	3153316	Congratulations, you guys.
3153336	3153836	That's awesome.
3153856	3154177	Thank you.
3154357	3155317	It was definitely a shock.
3155597	3157598	Was that something that was like community-based?
3157698	3159579	Were the community voted, or was that like an editorial?
3160479	3165161	It was voted by people who listen to gaming podcasts, I guess, and that's why it was important to me.
3165201	3165881	It wasn't just some
3166394	3167055	DarkSakura.com.
3180038	3180598	www.DarkSakura.com
3207489	3211710	So ladies first, Michelle, why don't you give me a box number 1 through 13.
3211750	3212790	We'll take a look at what's inside.
3214110	3214970	I'll take number 4.
3215751	3217371	All right, box number 4.
3217491	3218131	Let's have a look.
3220291	3226072	All right, the category we would like to know your opinion on, best graphics in a game in 2006.
3226392	3228313	The best graphics of any game in 2006.
3229853	3231033	Best graphics in a game.
3231193	3234454	I have to give it to a game I actually do not like, Gears of War.
3235250	3235990	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3256832	3257212	Exactly.
3257253	3262658	Well, that's a big relief because at our show we had a lot of people writing in like, how dare you hate this game and you're crazy.
3262718	3264500	Stop playing your Tom Clancy stuff.
3264660	3265781	Tell them to sit down.
3265821	3266902	People like what they like.
3267363	3267803	Exactly.
3268764	3271847	I liked it, but the graphics were amazing, so that's my pick.
3272267	3274189	Hey, John, since you're on the line, you want to buy into this too?
3274209	3275210	What do you think is the best graphics?
3275230	3275571	You know what?
3276187	3277409	I definitely agree with Gears of War.
3277429	3281134	The second game that comes to mind, though, is definitely, I think, Splinter Cell is a close second.
3281955	3282756	Double agent.
3282796	3285239	But yeah, Gears of War, I'd say, is definitely the best looking game of the year.
3285820	3286400	Without a doubt.
3286521	3289064	What is it about Splinter Cell that makes it stand out to you?
3290557	3293079	You know, personally I was a little disappointed with Splinter Cell.
3293099	3297141	I thought that the multiplayer just was horrible compared to what they did in the past.
3297181	3298061	I loved Chaos Theory.
3298181	3299802	Yeah, and it was a huge step backwards.
3299822	3306126	But visually, I just, you know, I look at like Sam's noggin on the screen with all the sweat and the detail and the stubble.
3306486	3307066	The lighting.
3307226	3309187	I just love the character models in that game.
3309267	3310588	So it definitely stands out for me.
3311088	3311929	Alright, very cool.
3311969	3319253	Well, now, you not only have a pretty big category there, but you have a really big news topic we want to know your opinion on for the year, Michelle.
3319453	3325717	And this is a news topic that seems to be something that keeps going on and on and on throughout the year.
3325757	3332641	And it's somebody we don't refer to by name here on this program, but we'll call him Tack Johnson.
3334221	3334522	Okay.
3335865	3338067	Alright, you know this guy, right?
3338107	3341510	He's somewhat of a bully in the legal sense.
3342031	3347716	And remember, he actually went to court to try to stop the game Bully on the PlayStation 2 from even coming out.
3348157	3350479	What is it about this guy you think?
3350539	3353562	Why do you think this guy keeps wanting to pick on us gamers?
3353622	3354883	Why won't he just leave us alone?
3355680	3363987	Well, you know, that's funny because a long time ago on our show, I mentioned this kind of violence in video games, and I mentioned the game Bully, and John and Kyle, the other hosts, shot me down.
3364027	3367270	They're like, oh, nothing's become of that, and that's a fine game.
3367310	3368411	It's really not that bad.
3368511	3373256	But, you know, the angle of that with the school kids, and I think that that's what's really getting this guy going.
3373296	3374697	But to me, it's fine.
3374717	3380162	I grew up playing violent video games, and I feel guilty when I kill a gnat, so I think the guy needs to back off.
3381668	3383190	I kind of have an opinion about this.
3383230	3386233	I think it all comes down to parenting and parents and all that in general.
3386674	3389076	And I think that these are just like campaign issues.
3389096	3393140	I know Hillary Clinton kind of lashed onto this as a campaign issue.
3393461	3396184	And I think like the soccer moms, I don't want to get political here.
3396204	3396524	Soccer?
3396924	3406307	I think that there's a certain demographic that don't know enough about video games and they just hear this stuff and they say, oh yeah, we should get on board with this and we should ban this too.
3406947	3407687	It's a bunch of crap.
3407747	3412068	And Jack Thompson doesn't know a dick about video games.
3412388	3413429	He didn't even play Bull.
3413669	3415649	He already decided that he hates it.
3415689	3417630	It's probably one of Rockstar's tamest titles.
3418419	3419160	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3443517	3458349	What do you think recently, and this is all kind of recently in the November, December of the year, it's kind of been that Hillary and, who's the other guy, Lieberman, have seemed to come out kind of embracing the ESRB, like almost that there's been a change in attitude, a little bit.
3459050	3460151	We don't trust Lieberman.
3460171	3463914	I'm from Connecticut, and he ran as an independent, so we all were like, whoever, who cares?
3463934	3468477	First of all, I want to back up here and say, you know, our podcast is not political at all.
3468597	3471660	Yeah, we try not to go there because we get the mail too, yeah.
3472669	3474631	Take us down a road that we never go down.
3474671	3475592	We just want to have fun.
3475672	3479636	But yeah, I think this whole Yashar Bain thing is a joke.
3479876	3483059	Unless the retailers really enforce it, it's absolutely meaningless.
3483940	3488424	I see these kids trying to buy Grand Theft Auto all the time, and I think most of them succeed.
3488824	3492387	Some 50-year-old fat housewife at Walmart is going to sell the kid the game.
3492888	3494089	It's on eBay anyway.
3494369	3496832	These days it's really hard to control that.
3496852	3497272	Right.
3497606	3498107	All right, all right.
3498127	3501630	We better get off this political road because I can see people emailing us already.
3501810	3502570	I don't want to go down there.
3502630	3503511	All right, all right.
3503591	3504492	Let's go to another box.
3504552	3505593	John, it's your turn.
3505633	3506614	Go and pick a box.
3506854	3507915	One through 12 now.
3508896	3509817	Only through 12.
3510097	3510657	How about seven?
3511198	3512539	All right, box number seven.
3512559	3513259	Let's take a look.
3513279	3517183	Most hilarious video game of 2006.
3517483	3518664	Most hilarious.
3523539	3525000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3550271	3554454	It's just got this twisted art direction, which I kind of appreciate.
3554815	3562401	They really create these little mutant-looking rabbit characters, and you just kind of throw it in this little rabbit world, and it's just very bizarre.
3562781	3566364	And it's funny, and I think that's all I can say.
3566784	3567485	All right, very cool.
3567525	3569206	Michelle, would you agree, or do you have a different pick?
3570569	3575891	for me I'm going to have I don't know if this is on the console or anything I'm going to have to go with officiallinewriter.com what?
3576811	3587755	yes it's a little web game of this guy that's on a sled and he goes flying around and I laughed for like an hour when I first played this game well you're simple we'll take it it's PC gaming we'll take it
3588660	3591261	It's a little PC game, I'm telling you, and it's a gem.
3591361	3592521	Try it out and you'll get a good laugh.
3593101	3594121	All right, awesome.
3594361	3602682	All right, yeah, you know, I was trying to pull up Line Rider on the Wii when the browser came out, but now I guess since they're going to make it an official game, they locked everybody out.
3603283	3604883	Yeah, I can't wait for that.
3605063	3610244	Yeah, it's a Flash issue because the Wii only supports Flash 7 or older, and that's like in Flash 9 or something.
3610624	3615565	Oh, we had thought that they shut people out because they're going to be releasing the full version later on as a game.
3616265	3617585	Oh, it's a newer Flash version, yep.
3618038	3618759	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3633744	3639926	and for about a month, people were running wild like, oh my gosh, Microsoft's going to enter the handheld market.
3640186	3642927	They're going to obliterate the PSP and the DS and da, da, da.
3642947	3649149	And then it turns out the Origami is just pretty much this fancy schmancy PC and that's why the screenshot of Halo was on it.
3649849	3654511	So this kind of bears the question about Microsoft entering the handheld market.
3654571	3656412	Is this something Microsoft ought to consider in 2007?
3659213	3661594	Yes, I would definitely say so.
3661634	3662715	I'm a Nintendo fanboy.
3663155	3668717	The DS Lite has sold 34 million units compared to the PSP, which is like 18 million.
3669277	3676420	Nintendo owns that category, and I think that there's definitely a need still for a portable for an older market.
3676460	3680222	The Nintendo is young and skews a little bit older, but
3680342	3680902	DarkSakura.com
3706761	3711604	Do you think that's something they might end up trying to do with Zune because of the iPod games and everything?
3712184	3717248	I do think that because the thing about the Xbox is that you can download movies now.
3717788	3719089	No music is around the corner.
3719369	3721130	The thing is you can't get it off the console.
3721150	3722171	You can't take it with you.
3722231	3726774	So some device is going to enable that, be it the Zune or this other device that comes.
3726834	3728955	So I think that's all part of the big picture.
3729568	3730108	I definitely do.
3730528	3731769	Alright, Michelle, what are your thoughts?
3731849	3733130	Microsoft, they need a handheld?
3733850	3741193	I think they should really get into it because although the Nintendo DS is very cool, I do not like playing multiplayer on it because of the little friend code thing.
3741233	3752778	Now, one thing Microsoft does and does well is the Xbox Live community and if they could get that on a handheld, I would definitely pick it up because to be able to just get up and go and play with your friends no matter where you are, that's something that the DS just doesn't have.
3754566	3757647	If you remember, the DS didn't even get online for about a year and a half.
3757767	3759148	Yep, exactly.
3760888	3765331	I'd agree with you there that Xbox definitely knows what they're doing when it comes to the online stuff.
3765751	3765951	Yep.
3766111	3766531	Very good.
3766571	3768572	All right, well, one more question for you guys.
3768612	3769112	Actually, two.
3769192	3769913	It's a two-parter.
3770233	3774795	We want to know, because we're taking a tally all day long, what do you guys believe is the best game of 2006?
3776516	3777196	Michelle, we'll start with you.
3777216	3778717	Michelle, what do you think is the best game of 2006?
3780830	3789258	Well, for multiplayer, I'm going to give it to Rainbow Six Vegas, but I want to talk about single player, because to me, I was not into single player games until this game came along, and it's Oblivion.
3789998	3799727	I've spent countless hours, and I even played the game twice, and it just really, everybody I ever talked to kind of liked the game, except for people who didn't have time for it, so it seemed to have something for everyone.
3799747	3800107	Yeah.
3800689	3802210	Worst game, do you want me to go right into?
3802430	3803071	Sure, why not?
3803111	3804012	We'll take your worst game.
3804032	3804672	What do you think, Michelle?
3804692	3810837	Worst game is going to be, although there were worse games, it's going to be Gears of War because I had the most hype.
3811217	3815841	Yes, because I wanted that to be good because it had the capability to be good and it just wasn't.
3816141	3816621	and DarkSakura.com.
3844301	3852264	because when I looked at E3, I thought, boy, the cover, it seems so neat how one button will do all this stuff.
3852504	3856446	But then when I actually sat down and played it, I was like, I don't like this.
3856726	3859867	I want to just run out there and start shooting people like Quake or Halo.
3860748	3861068	All right.
3861388	3862969	John, what do you think was the best game of 2006?
3865360	3869803	My favorite game by far this year so far is Zelda for the Wii, Twilight Princess.
3870204	3872025	Definitely the best single player game of the year.
3872365	3873806	It's just absolutely immersive.
3874266	3878450	The art direction, the plot, everything about it I just absolutely love.
3878490	3879290	It's what I live for.
3879790	3891279	And then my favorite multiplayer game, I agree with Michelle, it's Rainbow Six Vegas with a close second Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter because I think at the end of the day that's the game I probably played the most this year is Ghost Recon.
3891937	3892718	All right, interesting.
3892738	3899045	All right, so we'll put you down for it because I think it sounds like you're very passionate about the Zelda, so we'll put that down as the single best game.
3899065	3900047	Yes, very much so.
3900267	3902269	Yeah, I would say so.
3902550	3902790	All right.
3902810	3903310	Worst game.
3903350	3904792	You want to hear my totem ball?
3905153	3906614	What the hell is that?
3907355	3912241	I wonder when someone was going to go to the Xbox Live and some of their questionable picks this year.
3913354	3917076	So even though the game was free, you still say it's not worth being free.
3917697	3920158	Yes, it was an embarrassment to Xbox Live.
3922160	3922580	I'll give you that.
3922600	3925021	You know, what is it about camera games anyway?
3925101	3928864	Everybody seems to want to do camera games, but it seems to me like no one's done it right.
3929544	3932326	Well, the eye toy, the Sony eye toy was pretty successful, though.
3932987	3935388	It was successful, but how fun was it, really?
3935669	3935929	I know.
3936089	3937190	Yeah, exactly.
3937850	3941112	Fun for like an hour, and then it kind of, I don't know, the thrill is lost.
3941172	3941812	It's a novelty.
3942273	3945915	Well, hey, best of luck to you guys in 2007.
3945995	3949437	Tell our listeners really quick who may not be familiar with your program, tell them a little bit about your show.
3950458	3952559	We have a really stupid podcast.
3952759	3953620	Oh, stop.
3955100	3959783	Basically, we have a very relaxed kind of podcast in the atmosphere of you're just kind of talking with your friends.
3959803	3961364	We're not game experts.
3961384	3962385	We're not in the industry.
3963595	3967577	and we have a really great forum and community and I think that's what makes our show so great as well.
3967897	3974180	Yeah, we have awesome listeners and there's actually a third host who's not here, Kyle Jones, and he's Canadian.
3974360	3976461	Yeah, she's our resident Canadian.
3977001	3979542	So check us out, VideoGameOutsiders.com.
3979562	3980203	We have a forum.
3980243	3983104	You can download the episodes and all that, show archives, blah, blah, blah.
3983524	3986045	VideoGameOutsiders.com Alright, very cool.
3986146	3986806	Check that out you guys.
3986846	3988247	It's VideoGameOutsiders.com.
3988287	3989828	Congratulations to you guys on an awesome 2006.
3990588	3992169	Thanks for coming on our program tonight.
3992429	3993189	We appreciate it.
3993330	3994190	Thanks for having us.
3994470	3995271	And we'll see you in 2007.
3995471	3995811	Awesome.
3996551	3997052	Happy New Year.
4003575	4006797	We definitely want to thank John and Michelle for coming on from VideoGameOutsiders.com.
4007082	4009543	You know, that was one of those people that we contacted.
4009563	4019226	We really didn't know them, but we just kind of thought we'd get along with them just because, hey, you know, it's two guys and a girl that do their show, and they all met through a gaming community, and we know some of our listeners are in common.
4019286	4022987	So it was very cool of them to come on without really maybe knowing who we were.
4023047	4024548	I don't know if they knew beforehand or what.
4024888	4026208	So that was just very cool.
4026368	4031430	And I got to say, that Michelle, she's got some pretty big balls, naming Gears of War the worst game of the year.
4032577	4036599	Well, I mean, it was kind of a disappointment sometimes, but maybe I need to play it more.
4036779	4038140	I know it's fucking hard, though.
4038200	4042702	Like, all my coworkers that bought that game said, my God, this game is so fucking hard.
4042722	4046444	I'm playing it on easy, and I can't fucking pass the goddamn beginning of the game.
4046524	4050106	No, I mean, I can't say I disagree with her.
4050146	4054448	I don't know if I would have called it the worst game of the year, but definitely one of the biggest disappointments for me, personally.
4055048	4055848	You know what?
4055868	4060310	I'm going to go on the record saying I think the best game of next year is going to be Earth Defense Force 2017.
4062333	4062593	What?
4063293	4064373	It's an awesome game.
4064413	4067234	You're fighting giant ants and robots and stuff.
4067654	4069535	Okay, maybe it's not the best game, but it's a game I want.
4070115	4070375	All right.
4070635	4074676	Well, thanks again to those guys over at VideoGameOutsiders.com.
4074696	4075236	They're pretty rad.
4075256	4078576	They just need to release the whole Simple 2000 series over here.
4078897	4079477	That would be fun.
4080437	4080757	All right.
4080777	4083878	You're looking at this whole other world right now, Loki.
4085878	4086378	As usual.
4086778	4088238	All right, who's our next interview?
4088739	4090579	The next one is Brad from PodCulture.
4096790	4100291	and I'm joined here by Brad from PodCulture.
4100331	4101571	Welcome to the program, Brad.
4101591	4102111	How you doing?
4102631	4103332	I'll beat you, Kane.
4103552	4111614	Hey, now this is a little different because PodCulture, not exactly exclusively a games podcast, but you're still a games fan, yes?
4112094	4112434	Oh, yeah.
4112574	4115155	What kind of stuff do you talk about over there on PodCulture, for those that don't know?
4116055	4117935	Basically just geek life.
4118575	4124617	You know, it's me, a friend of mine I've known for, I guess, almost 20 years now, and my girlfriend, and the three of us...
4125748	4134597	Just sit around and talk about what TV we're watching, what games we're playing, what movies we're watching, that kind of stuff.
4134837	4137680	Sounds just like what we do here but a little more geeky.
4141038	4143599	More in the pop culture business, so I guess.
4143839	4144860	Nothing wrong with that.
4144920	4146800	Well, thanks for coming on the show today, Brad.
4146860	4148401	And we want to play a little game with you.
4148821	4152122	And it's called the Year 2006 in Review.
4152542	4154483	So we have 11 boxes left.
4154783	4156403	Why don't you pick one of those boxes, 1 through 11.
4156844	4158244	We'll open it up and see what's inside.
4159144	4159684	Number 9.
4159985	4160685	All right, number 9.
4160745	4161125	Here we go.
4165058	4167720	The best puzzle game of 2006.
4168381	4170782	Are you a big puzzle game fan?
4171463	4172344	I like some of them, yeah.
4172624	4172924	All right.
4172964	4176147	Well, did you have a particular favorite that you would call the best puzzle game of 2006?
4176227	4182011	Well, I don't know if it came out in 2006, but I started playing it in 2006.
4182451	4182972	We'll take it.
4183772	4184393	Astro Pop.
4184993	4185554	Astro Pop.
4185574	4187735	I believe technically that was a release this year.
4187875	4189637	So on Xbox Live Arcade.
4190160	4190360	Yeah.
4190720	4196964	Interesting choice, because some of those PopCap games, some folks say they don't belong on Xbox Live.
4197004	4199706	What is it about the Astro Pop game that you like so much?
4200186	4210693	Well, it's, I have ADD when it comes to games, so when it comes to trying to play something for a long time, I kind of lose interest in it a lot.
4211534	4214235	So, you know, pick that up and just run with it.
4214616	4218418	So Astro Pop's one of those games that you really sit down and you only play it for a little while at a time.
4219022	4220243	I haven't got any on Astropop.
4220263	4220764	That's a tough game.
4235919	4246187	All right, well, we also want to know your opinion on a particular news topic, and the one we have in box number nine is the PlayStation 3 line versus the Wii line.
4246467	4251991	Of course, in November, big, big console launches, and you hear about this violent outbreak.
4252011	4260498	I think there was this comic that put it so well, is that there was this violent outbreak going on in the PlayStation 3 lines where people were getting shot and pushed into telephone poles.
4260778	4264381	And then you go to the Wii line, and it's like people are wearing buttons that say, free hugs.
4264781	4266682	and it's just, you know, Kumbaya and everything.
4267343	4270905	Why do you think there was such a radical difference between the two lines this year?
4273907	4281372	I don't know if it's just that the Nintendo's more of a fun system versus the hardcore gamers on the P3 or what.
4283413	4286695	I really don't know.
4286715	4291618	Nintendo's always had more of a fun thing around their system.
4291658	4292299	It's been less...
4293789	4297111	Hardcore gamers than the PlayStations have been.
4297411	4298231	At least to me, anyway.
4298531	4314959	So you think maybe when you say it's more fun, maybe the fact that there were more people in the Wii line that were really dedicated and you knew that those people were going to be playing the Wii versus the eBaying that they say was going on in the PlayStation 3 line where half those people were camping to put it on eBay.
4315599	4321022	Yeah, and you're looking at it where the system costs half as much too.
4321082	4322823	More people are going to be able to afford to
4323649	4324149	and DarkSakura.com
4353723	4355643	You're only talking a couple of days there, really.
4355864	4356464	I guess that's true.
4356764	4359544	It was, what, a week, maybe a week, a couple of days?
4359564	4360645	About like four days, yeah.
4360925	4361505	I guess that's true.
4361985	4365946	All right, well, hey, just out of curiosity, did you end up waiting in line for one of these systems?
4367306	4371987	No, I've never been a get-it-at-the-moment kind of guy.
4373208	4378029	It's only been within the past four or six months that I've even got an Xbox 360.
4379569	4382150	So you're going to wait this little war out and see what happens, huh?
4382702	4386905	Yeah, I didn't feel like fighting the crazy lines to get a Wii.
4386925	4393369	I thought about getting a Wii, but I kind of looked around and then the day they went on sale, I had to work anyway.
4393589	4396711	And by the time I got off, everybody had sold them all out at the Targets.
4397131	4401734	Do you think if there wasn't all this craziness around the Wii still that you might have one right now?
4402995	4406497	If I had $250, yeah, you betcha I'd have one.
4407077	4409939	I guess this is the wrong time of year to be asking right after Christmas.
4410560	4410840	Oh, yeah.
4410860	4410980	Yeah.
4411656	4413497	Alright, well thanks so much for your opinion.
4413538	4415959	We want to get your opinion on a couple more things here real quick.
4416400	4422124	We also want to know, we're taking a poll all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of 2006?
4422584	4425386	And your opinion using whatever criteria you want.
4426487	4434273	The best video game that I've gotten, and this is kind of weird because it conflicts with my ADD and games, but Phantasy Star Universe.
4434873	4439857	I've loved that whole series and I picked that up because I love the Dreamcast version and
4440791	4444796	and all that and I picked up PSU and I've had a blast with that.
4445217	4447920	Are you playing more of the single player or more of the online in that game?
4448601	4450103	About 50-50.
4450823	4451945	Maybe a little more online.
4452955	4455155	This game was a little bit, I think, overlooked.
4455436	4462257	I agree that Phantasy Star Universe is actually a much better title than I think a lot of people are giving it credit for, in my opinion.
4462917	4471939	I think part of the reason people are overlooking it is because it came out right around the same time that you had Final Fantasy XII, a real powerhouse RPG on Sony's PlayStation.
4472839	4474779	Do you think people are overlooking this game?
4475940	4482121	Well, as far as I can remember, Phantasy Star hasn't been the big
4483194	4488578	Blowout, you know, that hadn't had the fanboy following maybe that Final Fantasy has.
4489719	4490019	I see.
4491420	4496023	So what is it about Phantasy Star Universe that appeals you to that game as opposed to a game like Final Fantasy XII?
4497425	4499906	Well, having never played any of the Final Fantasy games.
4500347	4500687	Wow.
4502428	4510654	It's just, you know, I create my own character, I go through it, and it's not, it doesn't seem to be as complex, or at least the...
4512045	4513974	Phantasy Star Online didn't seem to be as complex.
4513994	4516004	Now Phantasy Star Universe is a little more...
4516735	4517475	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4546485	4555668	Oh, the worst game, it's weird because it's a fun game, but it's the worst controls, is Sneak King.
4556248	4558868	Oh, Sneak King, worst game.
4558928	4560229	Why'd you say Sneak King?
4561549	4565030	Because it's hard as hell to control that damn thing, at least to me.
4565928	4569292	So even for $4, it's too much, you think?
4570813	4571314	$4 is $4.
4571814	4575458	That's not that big of a deal, but it's hard as hell to discontrol it.
4575758	4583366	Do you think it was a little bit of a throwaway title just because of the commercial tie-in that maybe the people who developed it thought, eh, you know, it's a $4 game.
4583526	4584647	We don't need to purchase it.
4584667	4585248	Oh, exactly.
4586109	4586369	All right.
4587335	4589156	I guess the quality showed up there in the end.
4589216	4591997	All right, well, thank you for sharing your opinion with us there.
4592418	4598441	So we've got Phantasy Star Universe and Sneak King for best and worst of 2006, and we'll tally it up throughout the night and see where we end up.
4599701	4602383	Brad, what are your plans for 2007 with PodCulture?
4602423	4606165	Just going to kind of keep on doing the same old, same old, or any big things coming up for 2007?
4608526	4610107	We've tweaked the format a little bit.
4610167	4612568	We're starting to go weekly rather than biweekly.
4613985	4617048	with the show, and who knows what lies in the future.
4617068	4621052	Trying to get the word out and getting some more people listening to the show.
4621353	4621573	Awesome.
4621593	4622554	Well, get the word out right now.
4622614	4626017	Tell them how they can tune in to PodCulture for some more geek and sci-fi chat.
4626898	4629000	Be over at podculture.net.
4630242	4630802	All right.
4631443	4634586	And there's three or four different ways to subscribe to it.
4634706	4636388	Got an iTunes link, audio link.
4637648	4642054	and just the regular RSS feed and we're listed on Dig and PopCurrent and all that fun stuff.
4642274	4642554	All right.
4642714	4643495	Go give them a dig.
4643575	4645157	PodCulture.net.
4645197	4647140	Brad, thanks so much for coming and joining us on the show.
4647160	4653768	I know you've been a long-time listener of Orange Lounge and we appreciate the support and we're glad to have you on to support your independent program as well.
4654549	4655230	Thank you very much.
4661468	4664631	Big thanks to Brad from PodCulture for coming on the air.
4664691	4669955	And a little birdie told me that we might be doing some more work with PodCulture in 2007, so stay tuned.
4670355	4675619	And I liked having Brad on, and I know some of you guys might think, boy, Brad kind of had some interesting choices there.
4675639	4680823	But keep in mind, this is about giving every gamer their voice, from the casual gamer to the hardcore gamer.
4680923	4684126	So we don't want to just bring on a bunch of hardcore gamers, but it's important.
4684586	4685427	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4708371	4709052	and DarkSakura.
4732967	4737769	I'm thinking, you know, there's a lot of people that, you know, they shuffle into a bus and go to a casino, you know.
4738050	4742792	If you can bring that experience home, you'll maybe have the Wii puff out some cigarette smoke.
4744453	4747194	Maybe that's that hidden feature of the Wii no one knows about yet.
4747454	4748615	It'll blow smoke in your face.
4750335	4751316	You are so strange.
4751836	4752116	All right.
4752577	4759440	Anyway, we're going to take a little detour here because we're going to bring on some more people in segment B of our show.
4759480	4761481	But first, it would not be...
4762442	4763183	I blame you for this, Rob.
4763203	4764244	I blame you for this so hardcore.
4789796	4795180	This, uh, the site of the week is one that, uh, Rob turned me onto.
4796381	4798443	It's the Catterday Live Journal community.
4799423	4804807	Which I've been looking over and, yeah, I love Catterday.
4805628	4808870	The sole reason I still really go to 4chan anymore is for Catterday.
4809591	4815015	So this one, um, is community.livejournal.com slash Catterday, C-A-T-T-U-R-D-A-Y.
4815075	4815235	And, uh,
4817831	4822674	I'm looking at one right now that has a cat with one of those frilly head things and a little wand.
4822694	4825535	It says, ban your fairy kitty, plot your death for this.
4826816	4827716	Fantastic.
4828677	4834620	I'm thinking in 2007 we ought to just change the name of the segment to DarkSakura's Cat Picture Site of the Week.
4834640	4835220	No, no, no.
4835240	4836361	Because that's all you ever pick.
4836461	4839142	No, no, no, no, no, because I also pick Doctor Who sites.
4839502	4839802	That's true.
4839822	4842404	God forbid they come out with a Cat Doctor Who site.
4845273	4847074	or Doctor Who gets a little cat companion.
4847574	4849475	No, because he doesn't like cats.
4849835	4850615	Well, what a bastard.
4850955	4861479	Look, I've got to say, though, in all honesty, you may think Jamie's a little weird for her Doctor Who obsession, but she finally did her best to make me a Doctor Who fan this week, and it's actually kind of working.
4861719	4865000	We've been watching season one, and we're, what, like five episodes in?
4865420	4866840	And I actually really enjoy it.
4866900	4868061	It's a really good show.
4868121	4869321	It really is good.
4869641	4870341	I'm enjoying it a lot.
4870361	4870922	We're more than that.
4870962	4871722	We're on the...
4872412	4872712	The Daleks
4883112	4883973	X-Terminate.
4904824	4906345	You can't do a Doctor Who MMO anymore.
4933788	4939672	You know the reason why I love the British version of Queer as Folk is I have a total crush on Vince, who is the nerdy one there.
4940052	4940932	I don't like the other guy.
4941233	4941433	I know.
4941453	4942814	He's a stew-ass.
4942974	4943354	Stew-ass?
4943614	4944054	Stew-ass.
4944895	4945235	All right.
4945355	4952279	Anyway, but I've got to say that I like the BBC Queer as Folk more than the American one because it was over in like eight episodes, which is better.
4952299	4954040	I've only seen one episode of the U.S.
4954140	4955701	one, and that was with the lesbians getting married.
4956621	4957502	Oh, isn't that sweet?
4957722	4960964	Anyway, before this show gets any gayer, we better take a break.
4961750	4966752	And we'll be back here on Orange Lounge Radio Part B to talk more about the year in review.
4966872	4967252	Stay tuned.
4967272	4970093	We have Travis Donovan from Travis Donovan Live coming on.
4970113	4972253	We have some folks from Destructoid.com.
4972574	4973334	We love that blog.
4973454	4977655	And Gamertag Radio getting some representation up in Part B. Stay tuned.
4977695	4978616	We'll be back after this.
4979036	4983997	Orange Lounge Radio is taped live on Sunday nights and is podcast to the world twice a week.
4984437	4988759	Stay tuned to our podcast feed for the conclusion of this week's Orange Lounge Radio.
