7000	13000	We're your hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky, and the Lowkey
13000	27000	Tonight, December 31st, 2006, it's our year-end special with guests from the Bobby Black Wolf Show, STFU, Video Game Outsiders, Pod Culture, Travis Donovan Live, Destructoid.com, and Gamer Tag Radio
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello everybody and welcome to another week, a very special week of Orange Lounge Radio
36000	41000	We are that podcast dedicated to video games, the gaming lifestyle, and gamer culture
41000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to my awesome co-host back there, it's Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers
48000	49000	Yo
49000	50000	How you doing?
50000	51000	I'm amused
51000	52000	Amused?
52000	53000	Yeah
53000	55000	Are you amused at this year-end special we're putting on tonight?
55000	56000	Yeah
56000	58000	Okay, among other things I'm sure
58000	59000	Among other things
59000	62000	Alright, also say hello to the one and only tech master, Lowkey
62000	63000	Hello
63000	64000	How you doing Lowkey?
64000	65000	I'm doing good
65000	66000	Awesome
66000	71000	Alright, well tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of show tonight, we've invited a lot of special guests to come on tonight
71000	73000	You're probably wondering why did we do that?
73000	78000	Well you know, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're dedicated to independent radio and giving everyone a voice
78000	86000	And we do that through the Skype line every week, taking your calls through our 800 number, your voice mails of the week that you leave at 877-GAME-OLR
86000	88000	The forums, the mailbag, all of that
88000	96000	And since we always talk about supporting other independent podcasts, we wanted to invite some folks that either we've worked with
96000	99000	Or even some folks we've never worked with before that just caught our eye
99000	103000	We wanted to invite them on tonight to just talk about the year 2006 and reveal
103000	108000	We'll get into that in a little bit, but it would not be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio, certainly not the last episode of the year
108000	110000	If we didn't start it off with How Was Your Gaming Week?
110000	112000	DarkStakra, how was your gaming week?
112000	114000	It was pretty fun
114000	118000	I played Cooking Mama at the doctor's office, which was entertaining
118000	121000	You were poking mama's steak at the doctor's office? That's gross
121000	123000	I was pulling the heads off of shrimp
123000	124000	I see
124000	127000	And then went to Roseville Golf Run last night
127000	130000	The horrible place that it is
130000	137000	And I played lots of Derby Owners Club until it pissed me off that the G1 race was for mares and I had a stallion
137000	140000	But my horse pole-beater is awesome
140000	144000	For those that have never played Derby Owners Club, because they don't have a lot of these machines everywhere
144000	148000	Please explain real quickly, for those that may not know, what is Derby Owners Crack?
148000	156000	The way the machine looks is you've got two, are they plasma screens? I think they are
156000	157000	I believe so
157000	158000	They're projection screens
158000	161000	Well, the one at Roseville Golf Run has a ton of burn-in anyway
161000	167000	But they're two screens side-by-side so that you get a very, very large widescreen
167000	171000	Then you have different consoles, they have one that's either four or eight
171000	176000	And you sit at that, you can pay money to breed horses
176000	180000	And then you train your horse, you race your horse
180000	185000	And after a while, after you start breeding your own horses
185000	190000	Off of your little cards that you get, you can get zebra-looking horses, albino horses
190000	200000	One person last night had one that looked like that weird, I want to say it's in the same family as Antelope
200000	204000	That's got the white jaw, the zebra-striped legs
204000	208000	One of the other jokes of God, to say, hi, I think I'm here
208000	211000	So what is so alluring about Derby Owners Crack?
211000	214000	You race your horses, it's crack, it's just addicting
214000	216000	I actually was playing this game
216000	217000	Why do people play Pokemon?
217000	220000	I was playing this game last night as well and I had a horse called Paris Hilton
220000	223000	Because you get to whip your horse as part of the game
223000	225000	So it's kind of fun to say, hey, I'm beating Paris Hilton
225000	227000	My horse was a throwaway, I named him Poop Eater
227000	231000	Which I guess DJ Poop Eater might appreciate, I didn't even think about it
231000	235000	But my next horse I'm going to do, if I get a mare, I'm going to name it Your Mom
235000	239000	So people say, what were you doing? Oh, I was with your mom last night
239000	241000	So, anyway
241000	242000	You're so mature
242000	244000	I played DDR Supernova
244000	245000	That machine sucks
245000	247000	I mean, the game was fun, it was pretty cool
247000	252000	Except the pads were, it was the same old crappy extreme machine that was at Roseville Golf Land
252000	254000	And the pads were shitty
254000	258000	And I think, though, when we were playing You're Not Here
258000	260000	I think I twisted my knee because on the last song
260000	263000	My right knee just started to really kill me
263000	264000	I'm sorry
264000	267000	That's why I stopped right, because you know me, I don't stop
267000	270000	And I was like, hell, am I old?
270000	272000	It was kind of fun to go back to the good old days
272000	274000	Because, you know, when the show started about four and a half years ago
274000	276000	Wherever the hell long we've been doing this now
276000	278000	We all met playing DDR at the arcade
278000	280000	Which some people who listen to this program may not realize
280000	281000	So it's kind of funny
281000	283000	But I went back to an old love
283000	285000	I played Drummania
285000	286000	I played a lot of Drummania
286000	287000	I have a blister on my hand, it's great
287000	290000	What do you think would happen if Harmonix put out Drum Hero next?
290000	291000	Would you play it?
291000	292000	Oh, hell yeah
292000	294000	As long as it plays like Drummania
294000	297000	I mean, honestly, it was a lot of fun
297000	300000	Now the thing is, they had a tall stool there, so I had to put it in auto-base
300000	303000	Although I did try to play with the base a couple times
303000	307000	And it's just really hard, because I'm short and the stool was not
307000	311000	So I just put it in auto-base and just played all my favorite
311000	313000	I was playing the old stuff more than I was playing the new stuff
313000	315000	But it is pretty cool
315000	316000	Anything else you want to share with the gaming week?
316000	318000	Um, no
318000	320000	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
320000	322000	Well, other than watching Extrovert play Devil's Crush
322000	324000	Not Devil's Crush, Alien Crush
324000	325000	On the virtual console?
325000	326000	Yeah
326000	328000	It's Devil's Crush, though, because Devil's Crush is so cool
328000	331000	He says Alien Crush is the best virtual console game out there right now
331000	333000	Which I entirely disagree with
333000	335000	Well, Gunstar Heroes was a pretty-
335000	338000	I was actually pretty impressed at how well emulated some of these games are
338000	341000	Super Castlevania IV for life, yo
341000	345000	They need to somehow put Dracula X on there, because then that would be
345000	346000	Not the shitty Super Nintendo 1, though
346000	348000	Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
348000	350000	Alright, Loki
350000	352000	I, too, played a game with a horse
352000	353000	I played Oblivion
353000	354000	Final Furlong
354000	355000	No
355000	356000	I played Elder Scrolls Oblivion
356000	358000	Because I thought I had sold it back
358000	359000	But apparently I hadn't
359000	362000	So I just loaded up a new save game
362000	364000	And went around
364000	367000	And I was punching horses and deer
367000	371000	And basically destroying small woodland critters
371000	372000	And it was funny, though
372000	374000	Because when you start attacking a horse
374000	375000	They'll actually come after you
375000	378000	So I opened the gate and it chased me around for quite a while
378000	379000	And then a sheep
379000	381000	I managed to kill a sheep
381000	383000	And it made it roll it down the hill
383000	385000	And finally I stole a horse and jumped it off a cliff
385000	387000	And then the horse, no tumble to its death
387000	388000	Which was funny
388000	389000	And then a deer
389000	391000	It was funny because there was a deer from far away
391000	394000	And I was just far enough away where I could hit with my
394000	396000	You know, magical missile or whatever
396000	397000	Magic missile
397000	399000	So I kept shooting at the deer
399000	402000	And apparently the deer doesn't mind being caught on fire
402000	403000	So I thought it was funny
403000	406000	If there's any chicks there, I want to do them
406000	407000	I love Oblivion
407000	410000	You will only ever hear Bob say that
410000	413000	I played the demo
413000	417000	Because I am hell not buying this game
417000	418000	Novadrome
418000	420000	Horrible
420000	421000	Horrible game
421000	423000	It was awful
423000	425000	I would never play that game again
425000	427000	Why not?
427000	428000	Why not?
428000	430000	Because the game looks like it's very cheap
430000	433000	It wants to be like a Twisted Metal type of game
433000	435000	But it's nowhere near like a Twisted Metal
435000	440000	It's just very boring and just very
440000	442000	I didn't even really know what the hell I was supposed to do
442000	443000	At certain points of the game
443000	444000	And it was dumb
444000	445000	It was really dumb
445000	447000	The arenas are very basic and stupid
447000	448000	It's just
448000	449000	No
449000	450000	I don't think so
450000	453000	Then of course, let's see
453000	456000	I played more Call of Duty 3 actually
456000	458000	More multiplayer in that
458000	459000	Because that's fun
459000	461000	And we've been doing the thing now
461000	466000	Where it's either the anti-armor class
466000	468000	Or the sniper class or whatever
468000	471000	And so it's either rockets, pistol, or sniper rifle
471000	474000	And we just play a match just using those
474000	475000	Who's we?
475000	476000	You and your co-workers?
476000	479000	Yeah, my co-workers and I will do it during lunch
479000	481000	And it's fun
481000	483000	It's really fun with rockets and stuff
483000	486000	Because I'll be driving Jeeps over them and stuff
486000	488000	And it's a lot of fun
488000	489000	Alright
489000	490000	Anything else?
490000	493000	No, that's pretty much it
493000	496000	Well, I've been playing a lot of the same old stuff this week
496000	498000	I went back to some really weird games
498000	500000	I went back and played 99 Nights
500000	501000	I have no idea why
501000	503000	But I think I just wanted to get more achievements
503000	504000	So I'm going to play that
504000	505000	But probably the only new game
505000	506000	I gave some time to this week
506000	508000	Was New Rally-X
508000	509000	Stop laughing
509000	510000	I really did get this
510000	511000	New Rally-X is cool
511000	512000	You know what's interesting though
512000	514000	It's getting a lot of shit this week
514000	516000	Because it was an arcade release
516000	518000	That kind of let people down
518000	520000	Because they had a bunch of independent releases
520000	521000	Hey, it's New Rally-X
521000	525000	It was a free game on a PSP game
525000	528000	The only reason I got it
528000	530000	Is because I do remember Rally-X
530000	531000	From when it was in the arcades
531000	533000	And I did kind of like the game
533000	535000	I did play Dig Dug and some of those other stuff
535000	538000	So I actually got it for the nostalgia value
538000	540000	The achievements are the easiest
540000	542000	I'm so close to having the 200 out of 200
542000	543000	There's only one more achievement I need
543000	545000	And that's the I get to round 7 perfectly
545000	547000	And I can get to round 6 perfectly
547000	548000	So I'm almost there
548000	550000	So probably the easiest achievements
550000	551000	Of any Xbox game I've ever played
551000	553000	In fact, I even put it to the test
553000	556000	Xtavor watched me play the game one time
556000	557000	And then I said
557000	558000	Here, you play on your account
558000	560000	And he unlocked 20 achievement points
560000	561000	Just like that
561000	562000	Playing one time through the game
562000	564000	Having no idea what the eff he was doing
564000	565000	He got 20 achievement points
565000	566000	Just like that
566000	568000	So if you want some easy achievement points
568000	569000	You whores
569000	570000	Go and play Rally-X
570000	572000	And you can increase your e-penis standings
572000	575000	By the way, if you are a new Orange Launch Radio listener
575000	576000	Check out our forums
576000	577000	OrangeLaunchRadio.com
577000	579000	And check out the OL Army section
579000	582000	It's our little clan we have across different video games
582000	585000	Dedicated to just playing games
585000	587000	And the number one rule of the OL Army clan
587000	588000	Is don't be a dick
588000	590000	So if you think you can do that
590000	592000	Then join the OL Army clan
592000	594000	And join with some players who aren't being dicks
594000	596000	And you can join our e-penis leaderboard
596000	598000	Which is provided through MyGamerCard.net
598000	601000	And you can see the standings of all the different people
601000	602000	And how many achievement points they have
602000	603000	Or as we say on the program
603000	605000	How big your e-penis is
605000	608000	Because that's pretty much what achievement points go towards
608000	610000	Is how big your e-penis is
610000	612000	Alright, let's get into some housekeeping tonight
612000	614000	Before we start bringing on the guests
614000	616000	First off, we want to say we've been taped for the past couple weeks
616000	617000	Because of the holiday
617000	620000	But we will be back live on OrangeLaunchRadio.com
620000	621000	We tape live on Sunday nights
621000	624000	I know a lot of folks listen to us through our audio RSS
624000	625000	Or podcasting feed
625000	627000	But we do tape live on Sunday nights
627000	629000	At 6 o'clock Pacific time
629000	631000	Check it out over on OrangeLaunchRadio.com
631000	634000	We'll be back live Sunday, January 7th
634000	636000	Also, speaking of live
636000	637000	This is a great show
637000	639000	It's a new show we have on Orange Launch Radio
639000	640000	That's live only
640000	644000	It's not podcast because it involves RIAA music
644000	646000	And you know you can't podcast that stuff
646000	647000	But it's Loki's brand new mix show
647000	648000	It's called Club OLR
648000	649000	Tell them really quickly, Loki
649000	651000	What they can expect on Club OLR
651000	653000	Fridays at 7 Pacific
653000	655000	Basically, it's three different mix shows
655000	657000	Kind of in one long block
657000	659000	The first mix show is basically
659000	661000	Dancing, club music
661000	664000	Some trance music mixed with video game music
664000	665000	So you have like long versions
665000	667000	Like I think for this week for example
667000	671000	We had long versions of some of the Luminous tracks
671000	673000	Some stuff from Luminous 2
673000	675000	Stuff from DDR
675000	678000	And then of course mixed in with other trance and dance
678000	680000	And club music and stuff
680000	681000	So that was pretty cool
681000	686000	Then the second show is called Fragged
686000	688000	And this one is hardcore music
688000	693000	It's basically got a lot of hardcore speedcore
693000	694000	Metal
694000	695000	You can throw some metal in there
695000	696000	Drum and bass
696000	697000	Just really you know
697000	700000	It's basically touted as music to kick ass to
700000	701000	You know the perfect thing to pop on
701000	703000	While you're playing a first person shooter
703000	704000	Or something like that
704000	707000	And the last one is the OLR Underground
707000	710000	And that one actually is kind of a smorgasbord
710000	712000	Of stuff normally
712000	714000	Stuff you might not normally hear on the radio
714000	716000	Like synth pop and stuff like that
716000	718000	Or you know theme shows
718000	720000	It's kind of what I used to do on the old live wire
720000	722000	Not necessarily all dance music
722000	723000	But just theme shows
723000	725000	And stuff you may not have heard before
725000	726000	I'm looking at some of the feedback
726000	728000	Because we debuted it for the first time
728000	729000	On Friday December 29th
729000	731000	I'm looking at some of the feedback in the thread
731000	732000	You got a lot of great feedback
732000	733000	23rd Magus says
733000	734000	Rock on dude
734000	736000	First broadcast kick some serious ass
736000	737000	Psycoon says
737000	738000	Whoa this is good stuff
738000	739000	You should post a list of what music you use
739000	740000	So I can go find it
740000	742000	And look at this from Vandalous
742000	743000	This is awesome Loki
743000	745000	Plan on selling some mix CDs sometime
745000	746000	I'll buy them from you
746000	749000	Otherwise may I contract you to make some mix CDs
749000	750000	I'm serious
750000	751000	I'll compensate your time and media
751000	753000	I love well done mixes
753000	754000	And your stuff is always fab
754000	755000	That's a great compliment
755000	756000	Thank you
756000	758000	No it was fun
758000	759000	It's a lot of work
759000	761000	But I'm gonna stick to it you know
761000	762000	And it's really
762000	765000	The whole point is to have something for everybody
765000	766000	You know at some point
766000	767000	You know maybe
767000	768000	Maybe you're not into trance music
768000	770000	Or maybe you're into hardcore stuff
770000	771000	I don't know
771000	772000	So that's what we have
772000	773000	The other cool thing about it
773000	774000	For the UK listeners
774000	777000	Is we rebroadcast it on Saturdays at noon
777000	779000	Or which is 8 p.m.
779000	780000	You know London time
780000	781000	So
781000	782000	Alright
782000	783000	So it's
783000	785000	You know a time that's friendly to you
785000	786000	To listen to it
786000	787000	So
787000	788000	Or if you're you know in the United States
788000	790000	You get to listen to it twice
790000	791000	So don't say we don't love you
791000	792000	Over there in the UK
792000	793000	Yeah we love you
793000	794000	Alright
794000	796000	Let's start off the show tonight
796000	798000	Let's talk about a little bit of news
798000	800000	Because even though it's been a slow news week
800000	801000	Because of the holidays and everything
801000	803000	There have been some stories
803000	806000	We're going to do something a little different from our usual game
806000	809000	Usually we all go around and we'll all share a little bit of news
809000	811000	But because tonight's show is a little bit special
811000	813000	And the focus of tonight's show is really our guests
813000	815000	We're just going to give Loki about 5 or 10 minutes
815000	817000	To just run down some of the latest news headlines
817000	818000	So Loki
818000	819000	Take it away
819000	820000	Tell us what's been going on this week
820000	823000	Okay so there's been new firmware that's been released
823000	824000	For the PSP
824000	825000	Homemade firmware
825000	828000	It's been cracked
828000	830000	Because you know the last firmware
830000	832000	They had the PlayStation 1 emulator added
832000	835000	And they've had stuff on the PlayStation 1 or PlayStation 3
835000	837000	You can download for certain games and stuff
837000	838000	Well someone's cracked that
838000	841000	And now you can dump any PlayStation 1 game
841000	842000	To play it on the emulator
842000	844000	So you've seen like Final Fantasy 7 and all that stuff
844000	846000	This firmware makes it possible
846000	848000	So that's actually pretty sweet
848000	851000	And they've had some pretty cool videos up from that
851000	853000	Of course
853000	855000	Now another thing that we've heard about is
855000	857000	Price drops in the 360
857000	859000	And what's going to make that possible of course
859000	863000	Is the brand new 65 nanometer processors
863000	866000	Which are going to be a lot smaller, a lot cheaper to produce
866000	867000	And a lot cooler
867000	869000	Of course right now those aren't ready
869000	871000	And so it's actually being delayed now
871000	873000	Instead of Quarter 1, 2007
873000	875000	It's going to be mid-2007
875000	878000	Do you think that's actually going to cause 360's price to drop?
878000	879000	For Microsoft it will
879000	881000	But they're not going to drop the price
881000	882000	At least not until Christmas
882000	884000	They just want to make money on their consoles for a little bit
884000	886000	They won't drop it until they have to drop it
886000	887000	So
887000	889000	So when Sony finally comes around and drops the price of their console
889000	891000	That'll be what Microsoft's response is?
891000	892000	Oh yeah
892000	893000	Definitely
893000	897000	Mario Kart 64 is one of the titles slated to head to the Virtual Console in January
897000	898000	Yay!
898000	900000	Toe-tai-way! Toe-tai-way!
900000	903000	We're probably going to get it at some point as well
903000	904000	In March
904000	905000	This will make you happy though
905000	908000	Additional classics coming to the Virtual Console
908000	909000	Also announced for Japan
909000	910000	Ice Climber
910000	911000	Kid Icarus
911000	912000	Yay!
912000	914000	And Zelda II Adventures of Link
914000	916000	Will be heading as well
916000	918000	And then of course more Genesis
918000	919000	God damn it Nintendo
919000	920000	God damn you
920000	922000	Give us a new Kid Icarus
922000	924000	Don't screw with the formula
924000	926000	Just a fun little 2D game
926000	928000	Like New Super Mario Brothers was
928000	931000	Just a fun little game that I can play on the console
931000	933000	Me love you long time if you do that for me
933000	934000	Please, Nintendo
934000	936000	Did you see the new things that they have
936000	938000	Over at the Club Nintendo Store
938000	940000	Whatever they have
940000	942000	Tingle's Balloon Fight
942000	943000	Not in this country
943000	944000	Yeah, not in this country
944000	947000	I have the thing tied to my Nintendo account
947000	949000	So every time I buy a Virtual Console game
949000	951000	It attaches to my Nintendo account
951000	952000	And believe me
952000	955000	I have almost filled up a second screen of channels
955000	956000	On the Wii
956000	958000	That's how many of those stupid Virtual Console games
958000	960000	I've bought on total impulse buys
960000	962000	Not a damn reward thing from Nintendo yet
962000	963000	I'm hoping
963000	966000	There are three months of Nintendo Power
966000	967000	Which is lame
967000	968000	Yeah, I got that a long time ago though
968000	970000	When I registered my GameCube
970000	971000	Whoopie-doo
971000	972000	Okay, anyways
972000	975000	Sega Sammy's going to be teaming up with Sanrio
975000	977000	To make some Hello Kitty games
977000	978000	Woohoo
978000	979000	Oh goodie
979000	981000	And that's all I'm going to report for that
981000	983000	Bad Batsumaru the game
983000	984000	K, thanks
984000	985000	Anyways
985000	986000	Capcom
986000	988000	They're slated to release
988000	990000	An amazing number of titles
990000	991000	77 new titles
991000	992000	Across all platforms
992000	993000	So, you know
993000	994000	Games on multiple platforms
994000	995000	Count more as one
995000	998000	How many of those will be Street Fighter II rehashed?
998000	999000	I don't know
999000	1000000	I think these are new games
1000000	1002000	Seven of which, I believe
1002000	1004000	Are going to be for the
1004000	1005000	No, actually six
1005000	1007000	Are going to be for the Xbox 360
1007000	1008000	So that's kind of cool
1008000	1009000	Because they've had some good ones
1009000	1011000	Wait, out of 77 new games
1011000	1012000	Six for the 360?
1012000	1014000	77 games total
1014000	1016000	But those 77 games are on multiple platforms
1016000	1018000	So if they have something on like six platforms
1018000	1020000	That counts as six games
1020000	1021000	Oh, okay
1021000	1022000	I get it now
1022000	1024000	Two rumored titles
1024000	1025000	Of course were going to be
1025000	1026000	God Hand and Okami
1026000	1028000	But that ended up being a mistranslation
1028000	1029000	Of a press release
1029000	1031000	So, not going to happen
1031000	1034000	Tekken 5 has finally
1034000	1037000	Hit the PlayStation Store
1037000	1038000	In Japan
1038000	1039000	And Dark Resurrection
1039000	1041000	Definitely a really good title
1041000	1043000	For their kind of arcade service
1043000	1045000	Is that out in the US yet?
1045000	1046000	No, I don't think so
1046000	1048000	Jamie, are you going to get that on your PS3?
1048000	1049000	Because you're the only one that has a PS3
1049000	1051000	The Tekken Dark Resurrection?
1051000	1052000	Because I know you're a Tekken fangirl
1052000	1053000	Probably
1053000	1055000	Yeah, 1080p Tekken 5
1055000	1056000	So that's pretty cool
1056000	1057000	Pretty gin, Jamie
1057000	1058000	Pretty gin
1058000	1060000	I'm still holding out for Tekken 6 though
1060000	1061000	Alright
1061000	1062000	Anyways
1062000	1064000	Of course, not a big surprise
1064000	1067000	But Christopher Gens is talking about
1067000	1069000	Doing a Silent Hill 2
1069000	1071000	Yay
1071000	1073000	You just want more Pyramid Head
1073000	1074000	No
1074000	1075000	Okay
1075000	1076000	First of all
1076000	1079000	Red Pyramid is not my focus in Silent Hill
1079000	1081000	It's all the other creepy cool stuff that goes on
1081000	1082000	That makes me all happy
1082000	1085000	I love the psychological parts behind it
1085000	1087000	You know, I was checking something out
1087000	1089000	I was looking at the various game blogs this week
1089000	1091000	And I saw something that totally made me think of you
1091000	1093000	And I want to say I saw it over on Destructoid.com
1093000	1095000	That they ran this story earlier this week
1095000	1097000	About a pillow that involved Pyramid Head
1097000	1099000	Let me see if I can find it here
1099000	1101000	We're still taping live, boys and girls
1101000	1103000	So pardon the delay here
1103000	1104000	Here we go, I found it
1104000	1105000	There it is
1105000	1107000	It's a little homemade Pyramid Head pillow
1107000	1109000	That says, rape sweet rape
1109000	1110000	Aww
1110000	1112000	And I thought of you when I saw that
1112000	1114000	That's so sweet
1114000	1117000	I want to, actually somebody on DeviantArt
1117000	1120000	Put up a Pyramid Head plushie
1120000	1121000	And I want one
1121000	1122000	So it's funny
1122000	1125000	It's a bit of irony I guess
1125000	1127000	But remember last week we were talking about
1127000	1130000	The British sites getting penalized for selling
1130000	1131000	Halo 3 beta codes
1131000	1132000	Wait, wait, back up for a minute
1132000	1133000	On the Silent Hill thing
1133000	1135000	I heard that the writer
1135000	1136000	Or whoever they said was supposedly writing it
1136000	1137000	Came out and said
1137000	1139000	No, I'm not really writing it
1139000	1141000	So is it still kind of a question mark or what?
1141000	1143000	I think Christopher Ganz wants to do it
1143000	1144000	But you know
1144000	1145000	Alright
1145000	1146000	Anyways
1146000	1148000	So as I mentioned a bit of irony from last week
1148000	1151000	Where Microsoft was punishing those British sites
1151000	1154000	For selling Halo 3 beta codes
1154000	1155000	Well come to find out
1155000	1158000	According to the latest issue of GamePro Magazine
1158000	1161000	Microsoft will be selling Halo 3 beta invitations
1161000	1162000	With Crackdown
1162000	1164000	Their brand new game coming out in March
1164000	1167000	Or not March, February
1167000	1169000	And I mean personally I was going to buy Crackdown
1169000	1170000	Anyways
1170000	1171000	But this is more incentive to buy it
1171000	1172000	Even if you might not want to play Crackdown
1172000	1174000	You're going to buy it to get a Halo 3 beta
1174000	1178000	It's like rain on your wedding day
1178000	1179000	But Crackdown's an awesome game
1179000	1180000	You should pick it up anyways
1180000	1181000	So
1181000	1183000	But if you're not a fan of Crackdown
1183000	1185000	And you maybe have a PC
1185000	1187000	And were a little bit disappointed by Red Steel
1187000	1188000	You'll be happy to
1188000	1190000	A little bit disappointed
1190000	1192000	A lot disappointed by Red Steel
1192000	1193000	GoldenEye Source
1193000	1195000	The beta has been launched
1195000	1198000	And you can download it now from the official website
1198000	1201000	Which is goldeneyesource.com
1201000	1203000	And it looks pretty
1203000	1205000	Definitely pretty
1205000	1206000	And then
1206000	1208000	You know we report on this
1208000	1209000	Probably about every month or so
1209000	1210000	But
1210000	1212000	Brand new game coming to the Dreamcast
1212000	1214000	Kuros
1214000	1216000	And it's apparently a game
1216000	1218000	A new side scroller
1218000	1219000	Like shooter game
1219000	1220000	And it's kind of a
1220000	1222000	Black and white actually
1222000	1224000	Giving it kind of a gothic feel
1224000	1226000	Dreamcast fans look
1226000	1228000	I know you're really attached to your system
1228000	1230000	Dreamcast was a horribly underrated and great system
1230000	1231000	I understand that
1231000	1233000	But seriously you will not have another game
1233000	1235000	As good as Soul Calibur
1235000	1237000	Or any of those games that were as good on Dreamcast
1237000	1238000	You won't
1238000	1240000	You think these new games are going to be like
1240000	1241000	Classics
1241000	1242000	As good as
1242000	1244000	As good as some of those games you had on Dreamcast
1244000	1245000	For the benefit of our listeners
1245000	1247000	I'm frumping it Rob
1247000	1249000	Won't be Shenmue
1249000	1250000	I'll tell you that
1250000	1251000	Won't be Shenmue
1251000	1253000	You can get some talented people out there to do stuff
1253000	1254000	I understand
1254000	1255000	But you know
1255000	1256000	It's just
1256000	1257000	It's not going to be
1257000	1258000	Sega Swirl
1258000	1260000	My favorite game on Dreamcast was
1260000	1262000	Freaking Rainbow Cotton
1262000	1264000	Yeah but you're weird
1264000	1265000	Anyway
1265000	1266000	I like quirky games Rob
1266000	1267000	Anyways
1267000	1268000	There's another rumor going around
1268000	1269000	I think we mentioned something like this before
1269000	1270000	About the Playstation
1270000	1272000	Portable 2
1272000	1274000	And saying that there's going to be
1274000	1276000	Some sort of built in flash drive
1276000	1277000	Or hard drive into it
1277000	1278000	Well some more
1278000	1280000	Stuff coming out
1280000	1281000	From Samsung actually
1281000	1283000	A presentation that they did
1283000	1285000	Showcasing their 60 gigabyte
1285000	1287000	1.8 inch hard drive
1287000	1289000	It's not really a confirmation
1289000	1290000	However
1290000	1292000	There was a nice little
1292000	1294000	Illustration that they had
1294000	1296000	Showing a PSP
1296000	1297000	And it says
1297000	1298000	Tagline
1298000	1300000	Enjoy the movies everywhere
1300000	1302000	Look you could put arms and legs on the PSP
1302000	1304000	So it could vacuum my house
1304000	1305000	And do my fucking dishes
1305000	1307000	But nobody's going to buy them until they
1307000	1309000	Actually have more of those must have games
1309000	1310000	Metal Gear Portable Ops
1310000	1311000	Good start
1311000	1312000	Luminous yes
1312000	1314000	But needs more
1314000	1315000	And then
1315000	1317000	One last thing I'd like to mention
1317000	1319000	Because we were watching it before we started
1319000	1320000	The show here
1320000	1322000	And I highly recommend checking it out on
1322000	1323000	YouTube
1323000	1325000	Saints Row
1325000	1327000	Glitches the musical
1327000	1330000	And absolutely hilarious
1330000	1332000	If you haven't checked it out yet
1332000	1334000	You can check it out on the original
1334000	1336000	Website that came out on which was
1336000	1352000	www.cabel.name
1352000	1355000	Or just go to cabel.name
1355000	1357000	And I'm sure that they have a link on there
1357000	1359000	Hilarious musical
1359000	1362000	And all I got to say is
1362000	1365000	Where's my fucking car
1365000	1366000	Alright
1366000	1367000	Well as we promised
1367000	1369000	We want to bring on some special guests
1369000	1371000	To talk about the year 2006
1371000	1372000	In review
1372000	1374000	It's been a really interesting year
1374000	1376000	What would you guys say were some of the highlights
1376000	1377000	Of 2006
1377000	1378000	Not just in gaming
1378000	1380000	But just in your lives
1380000	1381000	That go around gaming
1381000	1383000	Like you know I think of one of the highlights
1383000	1384000	Being E3
1384000	1385000	You know every year E3 is one of the big highlights
1385000	1387000	And just us getting to go down to
1387000	1388000	The E3 Outpost
1388000	1389000	And everything and have a good time there
1389000	1391000	What were some of the highlights you guys thought of 2006
1391000	1392000	Corny
1392000	1394000	But I'm going to go ahead and say it
1394000	1396000	E3 was just getting to meet Chris
1396000	1398000	For the first time this year
1398000	1400000	Because she's been so much fun to hang out with
1400000	1402000	And going to Disneyland
1402000	1405000	Which is why you miss all the shows you do
1405000	1406000	Hey!
1406000	1407000	I love Disneyland
1407000	1408000	E3 was okay
1408000	1410000	I was just sort of sick the whole time
1410000	1411000	So
1411000	1412000	And you know
1412000	1414000	It's sort of like E3 was going out with a bang
1414000	1415000	I guess
1415000	1416000	Trying to anyway
1416000	1417000	But
1417000	1419000	That was I have to say among some of the fun
1419000	1420000	Good stuff
1420000	1421000	Loki
1421000	1423000	Being one of the first people in the United States
1423000	1426000	To actually be able to play the DDR supernova machine
1426000	1427000	At Konami's gamer day
1427000	1428000	Oh
1428000	1429000	Okay cool
1429000	1430000	That's right
1430000	1431000	And then the Wii
1431000	1432000	Alright
1432000	1435000	Of course some of that like fire burnt out
1435000	1437000	When the actual console launched
1437000	1439000	It was exciting and then it's like
1439000	1441000	Okay it's like just everything
1441000	1443000	Yeah but that's because you've allowed yourself to buy
1443000	1445000	A lot of crap games for that system
1445000	1446000	You should have just beat Zelda
1446000	1448000	You should have just played Zelda till you beat it
1448000	1450000	No I really haven't been playing Zelda much
1450000	1451000	What the hell
1451000	1452000	I know
1452000	1453000	Alright
1453000	1454000	Shame
1454000	1455000	Alright well look
1455000	1457000	What we want to do is we devise this little game
1457000	1460000	What we've got is we've got 15 boxes sitting up here on the table
1460000	1464000	And we're going to invite some other podcasters, bloggers
1464000	1466000	Just people throughout the community to come on
1466000	1467000	And open some boxes
1467000	1469000	And throughout the week we've taped some interviews
1469000	1470000	With some of our buddies out there
1470000	1473000	And some people we never have talked to before
1473000	1475000	But we thought maybe they'd want to come on and say hi
1475000	1476000	And be a part of this
1476000	1478000	So we want to thank everybody who came on
1478000	1479000	And let's kick it off
1479000	1480000	Jamie
1480000	1482000	Jamie who's going to come on our show first
1482000	1483000	And open up the first box
1483000	1486000	We have Bobby Blackwolf from AllGames.com
1492000	1495000	Alright let's go to the phones where Bobby Blackwolf is there
1495000	1496000	Bobby you there?
1496000	1497000	Yeah I am
1497000	1498000	What's up?
1498000	1499000	Hey not a lot
1499000	1500000	How are you doing?
1500000	1501000	I'm doing good
1501000	1502000	How was your holidays?
1502000	1503000	It wasn't too bad
1503000	1505000	How about yourself?
1505000	1506000	I did pretty good
1506000	1507000	I did pretty good
1507000	1508000	Yeah you've had a pretty good year all around
1508000	1510000	Over at AllGames haven't you?
1510000	1512000	Well we're trying yeah
1512000	1516000	Well it seems to me that just recently I was on Dig.com
1516000	1517000	Looking at their podcasting list
1517000	1521000	And someone's kicking our butt by a mile on the rankings there
1521000	1522000	And I think his name is Bobby
1522000	1523000	Yeah I think y'all are joining him
1523000	1524000	What?
1524000	1525000	Y'all are coming up
1525000	1527000	Well you're doing pretty darn good there
1527000	1530000	For just one guy doing his own show there
1530000	1532000	Yeah it's hard to try to do it every week
1532000	1533000	And know that I have no net
1533000	1535000	But people seem to enjoy it so I just keep on doing it
1535000	1537000	Well very good there
1537000	1539000	Well Bobby you know you've been a long time friend of the show
1539000	1541000	We had a great time with you at the E3 Outpost this year
1541000	1544000	And just hanging and you know bringing us into the AllGames family
1544000	1546000	We've had an awesome time with everybody over there at that site
1546000	1550000	We definitely wanted you to be one of the first to play our little game here
1550000	1552000	Called the Year 06 in Review
1552000	1553000	So you ready?
1553000	1554000	I'm ready
1554000	1556000	Alright we've got 15 cases there
1556000	1559000	Pick one of the cases 1 through 15
1559000	1561000	7
1561000	1563000	Alright let's open up 7
1563000	1570000	Alright what did you think was the best voice acting in a game in the year 2006?
1570000	1573000	Now keep in mind Bobby had no idea of these categories in advance
1573000	1574000	This is all a surprise
1574000	1577000	The best voice acting in your opinion
1577000	1578000	Damn
1578000	1580000	You picked a tough one
1580000	1581000	Yeah I did
1581000	1583000	I screwed lucky 7 there
1583000	1588000	Cause Uno had no voice acting so I can't choose that
1588000	1593000	Well Uno kind of did have the people going you know F you draw 4 bitch right?
1593000	1598000	How'd you play any of the uh you know well you can't do Zelda either cause Link doesn't really talk in Zelda
1598000	1602000	Hey hey come over here
1602000	1608000	Listen one of the ones I actually was really impressed and I like some of the voice acting so far in Final Fantasy 12
1608000	1610000	Ahh Final Fantasy 12
1610000	1613000	Which may not be something a lot of people talk about cause it's an old PS2 game
1613000	1619000	But I mean I want to give that game a lot of props because I have been enjoying it
1619000	1623000	Final Fantasy 12 it's kind of interesting because you know it's such a landmark series the Final Fantasy series
1623000	1626000	I've personally been a Final Fantasy horror for the longest time
1626000	1634000	But 12 kind of got lost in this whole shuffle of next gen systems which seems like such a shame because it's such an awesome game
1634000	1640000	Right and you know that's why I'm not that far in it because I keep having to like look at other things that's going on
1640000	1647000	And stuff so I definitely want to keep playing it and get farther it's just you know right now I don't have the time to get into it
1647000	1652000	And there's so many side quests too in that game like I feel like I'm barely making any progress in that game at all
1652000	1656000	You know with all the people that you can talk to and the hunts and all that other stuff so
1656000	1660000	Do you have a favorite character in Final Fantasy 12? Ask me when I'm a little bit farther in the game
1660000	1667000	Alright I'm gonna tell you this I think it's all about Balthier by the way I don't know how far you're in it but he's the bomb
1667000	1672000	And he has a great voice actor I think that's one of my favorite performances of the year
1672000	1678000	Okay well since that was a tough category to pick a game for you get a really easy news topic
1678000	1683000	I'm curious about your thoughts the news topic that's in your case is bye bye E3
1683000	1689000	Of course the big news E3 2006 the last year as we know it quote unquote
1689000	1695000	What was your reaction when you heard the news about E3 you know kind of going away and changing for the new year?
1695000	1698000	You killed my birthday you bastards
1698000	1700000	Did that news come out on your birthday?
1700000	1702000	No but E3 was on my birthday
1702000	1705000	Oh that's right they're talking about changing the time frame to it too
1705000	1712000	Yeah so no to be serious about E3 for a second I mean it really got to be too much of a circus
1712000	1718000	And it was very hard for me to see what I wanted to see because I had to wait for
1718000	1728000	The old cash register jockey from Best Buy who got in and stuff and it was really people were treating it like the world's largest arcade set to free play
1728000	1736000	When it was really about trying to get business done and trying to show what was going on in the game industry
1736000	1745000	And things kept going behind closed doors people started like ramping back like the square presentation was not anywhere as good as it used to be
1745000	1750000	Yeah which is strange because the past two years before it it had been pretty awesome it was something I looked forward to seeing
1750000	1756000	But the square presentation I was let down by it this year too every single thing we saw was Final Fantasy something everything
1756000	1762000	Right well you see what the thing that got me was that all we saw in the square presentation was video
1762000	1770000	And I don't know how many E3's you've gone to but square has always put on this big huge theatrical production with the video
1770000	1775000	But it incorporated the audience it was in like 360 degree rooms
1775000	1779000	The first year I went they did that that was like the 360 thing I remember that
1779000	1785000	Right but I mean they had stuff where they had in each chair they had like a little LCD screen that showed other information
1785000	1793000	And I actually I probably should put these on YouTube I actually stunk my video camera in some of the early years to the square presentation and videoed the whole thing
1793000	1804000	And I should probably stick try to get some of that because it's on old VHSC tapes from my old camera so it's trying to get into a format that I can put up on YouTube or something
1804000	1806000	Because you're not supposed to have the cameras in there
1806000	1808000	Yeah you get big trouble for that
1808000	1811000	Yeah I think I have like three or four old square presentations on video
1811000	1817000	Awesome that's right now this was only my 33 this year but this is what you're like your 10th 11th E3?
1817000	1820000	This was my 10th I started going when they were here in Atlanta
1820000	1825000	Wow that's amazing so having been to so many E3's did you see this coming?
1825000	1831000	I saw that E3 was getting kind of worse and worse off and harder to get things done
1831000	1840000	And it just became more of a spectacle so I knew it was going to downsize some time but I didn't think it was going to downsize this much and for this reason
1840000	1845000	Yeah you know I don't know how Dark Soccer and Loki feel what they thought when they kind of saw that
1845000	1850000	But I kind of thought when I was walking around and looking at it I thought you know something's wrong here
1850000	1855000	When we have like this six hour wait to see the Wii and then a two hour wait to see Paris Hilton
1855000	1861000	I remember getting diverted by Paris Hilton's bodyguards and I'm like something is wrong with this picture
1861000	1863000	This is not about video games now
1863000	1868000	Right it was about a big arcade and a big festival and it was like the mecca for gamers
1868000	1875000	And so what they're trying to do with the new what is actually E3 is saying this is not for the gamers
1875000	1880000	We're not going to make this attractive for gamers to go to and in fact all the gamers are saying the new E3 is boring
1880000	1883000	But it's exactly what the industry probably needs
1883000	1886000	So you think this new E3 is going to be a good thing?
1886000	1889000	For the industry yes for the gamers probably not so much
1889000	1893000	So real quickly since we actually don't have this as one of the other topics
1893000	1898000	What do you think about the whole you know this new what was a game pro expo or whatever they're talking about
1898000	1901000	That might pick up that slack of what the gamers want do you think that's needed?
1901000	1907000	I think that those are needed because I mean gamers have been wanting to get into E3
1907000	1914000	But the problem is I don't think that the big companies are going to go into the game pro expo as much as they did with E3
1914000	1919000	Gamers want to go to E3 but E3 is not going to go to game pro expo
1919000	1925000	They're not going to bring the big lavish booths the booth babes may not be there in as much capacity as they were at E3
1925000	1927000	And so I think the gamers might get disappointed
1927000	1932000	So you think they'll have a lot of the same first year issues that a lot of startup cons have
1932000	1940000	You know cons that we've seen in their first year that have needed room to grow such as you know the video game expo and penny arcade expo and all those
1940000	1941000	Exactly
1941000	1944000	Alright well thank you so much for your thoughts on the E3
1944000	1947000	Now we're going around we're going to poll everybody today
1947000	1952000	Try to figure out definitively what in your opinion was the best game of 2006
1952000	1959000	Okay the best game which is why I didn't vote for this in the best voice acting is Oblivion
1959000	1964000	And the reason that I'm saying Oblivion and not any of those first person shooters that I'm sure everybody else is saying
1964000	1970000	Is because I have watched my girlfriend play this game for well over 200 hours
1970000	1971000	Wow
1971000	1980000	She's beaten the game like twice she's gotten all the achievements but she still keeps on going back in and saying oh there's another dungeon I can go loot
1980000	1981000	It's all the add-ons right?
1981000	1988000	Right well it's not even just the add-ons she'll finish the add-ons and then just keep on going and finding new dungeons and she's been playing for over 200 hours
1988000	1998000	So my thing is any game that is offline single player that can hook you in that much just like a World of Warcraft or an EverQuest could do
1998000	2007000	That deserves props because I don't think people are playing Gears of War single player offline for over 200 hours and still finding new things to do
2007000	2016000	Alright the interesting perspective how about the worst game of 2007 or 2006 we don't know 2007 yet but worst game of 2006
2016000	2018000	Sonic the Hedgehog
2018000	2022000	Oh ouch any particular platform or just in general?
2022000	2024000	Just in general
2024000	2028000	What went wrong? Sonic the Hedgehog used to be so rad 3D
2028000	2029000	Oh
2029000	2037000	But this isn't the first Sonic 3D game you can go all the way back to Sonic on the Genesis but that's where it went wrong
2037000	2045000	It was great as a 2D game but I don't think it's working too well as a 3D game and I liked Sonic Adventure but it was no original Sonic
2045000	2050000	Alright well I don't think you'll be the only one to pick that as the worst game of the year
2050000	2057000	Looking forward to 2007 you know you do a lot of work with independent press and certainly you know Orange Lounge being in this all games thing
2057000	2064000	and all games interactive and your own show kind of all pushing towards this independent you know news going into 2007
2064000	2069000	What do you think the impact is going to be of the independent gaming press in 2007?
2069000	2074000	Do you think they're going to be more relevant? Less relevant? Do you think their credibility was damaged in 06?
2074000	2077000	What do you think is going to happen in 07 with the independent media?
2077000	2084000	Some publishers will not understand it still but some will embrace it a lot more
2084000	2092000	Microsoft has done a lot with the independent press because Microsoft actually gets blogging and podcasting and independent sites
2092000	2097000	and there are places like you know I hate to say it because I know you're buddy buddy with them but Konami
2097000	2102000	the way they reacted to Kotaku, Joystick, whichever it was at E3
2102000	2111000	that shows that you know some people just don't understand the independent press because we're not as you know in the pocket as the mainstream press
2111000	2117000	you know we will actually say what we feel instead of what they want us to say about a game that's in a preview
2117000	2122000	and so it's really going to be interesting it depends on how the companies react to the independent press
2122000	2128000	but Microsoft gets it I think Nintendo is trying to get it but I think they're failing right now
2128000	2133000	based on some of the other independent press that I've talked to and Sony who knows
2133000	2138000	Sony just needs any press right now any good press they can get
2138000	2144000	Alright well tell us a little something about your show we want to let all our guests pimp their show so tell us a little something about your show
2144000	2150000	Okay well it's the Bobby Black Wolf Show we do it Sunday nights at 8pm Eastern 5pm Pacific
2150000	2154000	and we try our hardest to end right when Orange Lounge Radio starts
2154000	2159000	we're on All Games Radio we broadcast live on All Games Radio over at AllGames.com
2159000	2164000	it's basically like you said it's me without a net pretty much talking and then I read chat comments
2164000	2172000	I take live calls and basically I try to give my perspective on things because I can get a mic and get on the air
2172000	2178000	one of the things I'm going to be covering a lot in the beginning of 07 is XNA
2178000	2181000	because I am a programmer I've been in the programming industry a lot
2181000	2187000	and I'm really interested in seeing how easy XNA can make game programming for people who can already program
2187000	2192000	and so I'm kind of delving into that in some of the techy side of what XNA really is
2192000	2196000	I'll be very interested to see how this whole XNA thing plays out in 07
2196000	2202000	I think it's just a matter of time before the end of the year I think we'll see our first user created XNA game on live
2202000	2203000	do you think so?
2203000	2212000	well not on live arcade but there are people that have already created XNA games using the beta XNA because it's been out since September
2212000	2214000	you don't think anyone is going to break through that barrier?
2214000	2221000	not to get on live arcade not by the end of 07
2221000	2223000	not by the end of this year
2223000	2227000	by the end of 07 you think someone will break through that barrier?
2227000	2228000	I think someone will
2228000	2233000	it will be kind of like the net euro say hopefully that Sony did
2233000	2238000	where they took a couple of the best games and put them on a Playstation Underground CD
2238000	2245000	that would give some of those gaming CDs a little something extra as opposed to the same demos you can download online
2245000	2246000	that's a good idea
2246000	2253000	right because the thing that sets XNA apart from Xbox Live Arcade is because Xbox Live Arcade has that 50 meg barrier
2253000	2263000	well you have two gigs with XNA so most people making XNA games probably wouldn't be able to condense it down to an Xbox Live Arcade executable
2263000	2266000	so it may have to be on CDs
2266000	2269000	well I look forward to hearing more about this progress on your program Bobby
2269000	2270000	yep
2270000	2276000	Bobby Blackwell is always a good friend of the show thanks so much for being here and happy 2006 and best to come for you in 2007
2276000	2284000	yeah thank you and happy new year to all y'all
2284000	2287000	alright thanks so much to Bobby for coming on the show
2287000	2293000	it's Best Voice Acting in Bye Bye E3 were the topics he pulled out of that box
2293000	2296000	so it's kind of sad though that E3 is going to be different
2296000	2299000	it's not going to be the big deal it was before
2299000	2301000	but I don't know what do you guys think about that whole thing
2301000	2306000	well hopefully they'll do that well they have a bunch of alternate kind of events going on around that time anyways
2306000	2314000	and if anything I think the lack of the official E3 will bring more gaming events hopefully some in Northern California
2314000	2318000	and more is better I think
2318000	2320000	well big thanks to Bobby for coming on the show
2320000	2323000	we've actually been working with Bobby pretty much all year
2323000	2329000	we joined the all games community probably back in January or February I believe is when we joined up
2329000	2335000	and we've really had a good year working with Bobby's show and got to meet him in E3 he's a good guy
2335000	2336000	very knowledgeable
2336000	2345000	you know my other favorite thing of 2006 was meeting Bobby and Scott and Lawrence for the first time in San Jose
2345000	2346000	that was cool
2346000	2349000	that's true because we all went to the not Benihanas but some other type of place
2349000	2350000	just kind of kicked around
2350000	2352000	the almost Benihanas
2352000	2355000	and it was interesting because that was the first time I had seen Scott outside of television
2355000	2357000	so it was kind of interesting
2357000	2358000	surreal
2358000	2363000	yeah I remember seeing him on television I kind of used to watch that G4TV.com
2363000	2366000	and I was kind of like I don't know I don't know if I get this
2366000	2371000	but then having actually met him and interacted with him not only is he so knowledgeable with games
2371000	2373000	and you know just has a real passion for games
2373000	2379000	but you kind of learn more about how TV can really alter the perception of like what a real person is
2379000	2385000	you know and I know some other hosts previous hosts on G4 network across the board get some bad rap sometimes
2385000	2390000	Tommy Tallarico I met him at E3 and you would think watching him on TV like what a pompous ass
2390000	2392000	but no he's actually really cool he's really nice
2392000	2395000	and so I really enjoy that so it's pretty cool
2395000	2396000	alright
2396000	2398000	Jamie who's coming on next?
2398000	2402000	that would be DMN from STFU
2407000	2411000	alright please welcome to the show everybody DMN how are you?
2411000	2412000	hey
2412000	2414000	I'm doing fantastic
2414000	2417000	hey alright it's been a big year for you
2417000	2418000	yeah it has
2418000	2423000	you've gone from OLR fanboy calling in the show every week to having your own dang show on the network
2423000	2425000	yeah that's what I get when I bug you enough
2425000	2431000	would you say that one of the highlights of 2006 was coming out here to meet myself Dark Soccer and Loki?
2431000	2437000	that was actually quite a fun time despite all the crap that I didn't talk on the episode I appeared
2437000	2442000	well did you have a good time handing out the cookies and everything to the we line waiters when we did that whole thing?
2442000	2444000	oh yeah that was a blast
2444000	2449000	alright here's how it's going to work DMN we have 14 cases for you to pick from
2449000	2455000	and inside the case is a game category and news topic we want your opinion on so what's it going to be 1 through 14?
2455000	2460000	big bucks no whammies 14
2460000	2462000	14 here we go
2465000	2471000	alright your topic is game I most want a sequel for in 2007
2471000	2473000	this is a no brainer sneak king
2473000	2477000	sneak king? why sneak king?
2477000	2488000	well I got a chance to play it over the weekend and I have to say that for $4 it's ridiculously simple and actually a lot of fun
2488000	2493000	and I need another game to buy my dad and scare the crap out of him for $4.07
2493000	2502000	you know what's interesting is that game being $4 was better than some of the games that we were paying $5, $10, $8, $6 depending on what system it was
2502000	2504000	it was better than a lot of the games we were paying more money for
2504000	2509000	it was better than a lot of the games that were retailing for $40 which is kind of scary
2509000	2513000	that's true that's true because when you consider there's certain games now I don't want to name names
2513000	2517000	but Bomberman X0 that they're charging $60 for
2517000	2519000	tell him I got a hedgehog sorry
2519000	2523000	well we'll get to what you think is the worst game a little later in the show so sneak king
2523000	2525000	you want to see sneak king 2 in 2007
2525000	2531000	I do and I think Burger King would be smart to do it because those games are actually out selling Gears of War
2531000	2536000	well but wait a minute though that's a little bit of a warped statistic because you're putting the three games together
2536000	2538000	that's still pretty good
2538000	2539000	yeah that's still not bad
2539000	2541000	they're selling over a million copies combined which is incredible
2541000	2542000	yeah that's still not bad
2542000	2548000	do you think that there's another commercial entity that Microsoft should be hooking up with?
2548000	2552000	I don't know
2552000	2558000	no I don't know I like Burger King just because the king scares the crap out of everybody
2558000	2562000	I really don't see any other corporate icons
2562000	2564000	it did have a pretty freaky opening movie
2564000	2566000	oh yeah
2566000	2569000	maybe the jack thing from Jack in the Box that guy's kind of creepy too
2569000	2570000	that might work
2570000	2573000	alright here's the news topic we want your opinion on of course
2573000	2579000	PlayStation 3 very controversial device this year specifically the Blu-ray shortages
2579000	2584000	the Blu-ray diode shortages causing there to be delays in PlayStation 3's this year
2584000	2588000	was it a good idea for Sony to include the Blu-ray with their console?
2588000	2591000	I think it was inevitable
2591000	2596000	I don't think Sony wasn't going to go with the DVD format anymore
2596000	2599000	I think they stepped it up with the PS1
2599000	2601000	they said you can play games and then you have your CD player
2601000	2605000	PS2 was like you can play your DVDs your CDs and your games
2605000	2610000	so Sony almost put it upon themselves to introduce a new format
2610000	2612000	yes it's a cheap Blu-ray player
2612000	2619000	but I think Sony's problem was they were rushing to release this way too quickly
2619000	2623000	and had they have held off to Spring of 07 I think they could have had a better market share
2623000	2627000	but because they released in the holiday season they only got a total of
2627000	2632000	I want to say it worldwide 600,000 consoles if that to consumers
2632000	2637000	it didn't sell well and a lot of those PS3's actually went back on the shelves
2637000	2640000	because they wouldn't go for anything on eBay
2640000	2644000	how important do you think it is in the war on HD DVD
2644000	2648000	the Blu-ray is waging
2648000	2653000	do you think that being in the PlayStation 3 gives it an edge in that war?
2653000	2658000	yes I do I think mainly because the higher
2658000	2662000	I don't say the higher end because we all know the first generation players are crappy
2662000	2665000	but the higher priced ones are about $1000
2665000	2669000	whereas the low end PS3 is $500 which is half the price
2669000	2672000	and it's about the price of a pretty good HD DVD player
2672000	2678000	so Sony was smart in releasing at least a $500 price point on one of the versions of the PlayStation 3
2678000	2682000	to keep up with the HD DVD war
2682000	2688000	but looking at it, it's about $500 if you get a 360 on an HD DVD drive
2688000	2689000	so it's the same thing
2689000	2691000	we'll see what happens in 2007
2691000	2694000	what Blu-ray movie are you wanting to see really bad?
2694000	2696000	Talladega Nights
2696000	2701000	I have no interest to see anything really in Blu-ray HD DVD yet
2701000	2704000	I'm looking forward to seeing Silent Hill at some point
2704000	2706000	because that should be second
2706000	2711000	I did say over the weekend I did see Batman Begins on HD DVD and it looked really amazing
2711000	2716000	we're also taking everybody's opinion and counting it up by the end of the show
2716000	2719000	what do you believe was the best game of 2006?
2719000	2723000	The best game of 2006 was not a console game
2723000	2725000	it was actually a handheld game
2725000	2728000	I believe that New Super Mario Brothers is the game of the year
2728000	2730000	New Super Mario Brothers game of the year
2730000	2732000	now this is something I've seen in a lot of top 10 lists
2732000	2735000	but I'm not seeing Take the Cake in many polls
2735000	2737000	why does this game take the cake for you?
2737000	2741000	well if you've seen throughout maybe the past 5-6 years
2741000	2743000	any Mario game that's come out
2743000	2746000	either has the word party after it
2746000	2748000	either has something to do with sports
2748000	2750000	or is a 3D adventure that's awful
2750000	2756000	it was a breath of fresh air I think across all sorts of levels
2756000	2761000	to see a 2D platformer that was fun and somewhat challenging
2761000	2765000	what do you think was the worst game of 2006?
2765000	2767000	that's a tough call
2767000	2770000	I would have to say
2770000	2772000	yikes
2772000	2775000	you must have played quite a few bad ones
2775000	2777000	oh you have no idea
2777000	2779000	I would have to say
2779000	2782000	this did come out in 2006 technically
2782000	2785000	I would have to say Chibi-Robo
2785000	2786000	what's this?
2786000	2787000	Chibi-Robo
2787000	2789000	it was released in Europe in 2006
2789000	2790000	oh okay
2790000	2791000	why this game?
2791000	2796000	it felt like it was ripping off Katamari Damacy a little bit
2796000	2799000	and while it was a good idea on paper
2799000	2801000	it was executed poorly
2801000	2804000	alright well that's one vote for Chibi-Robo
2804000	2805000	is that it?
2805000	2806000	yes
2806000	2808000	alright we got marked Chibi-Robo
2808000	2809000	I've never even heard of that
2809000	2811000	I love bad games I'll have to look that up
2811000	2813000	it's for the GameCube
2813000	2814000	alright
2814000	2817000	hey I got a question for you also about 2007
2817000	2820000	now I know you've got a lot of loyalty to Nintendo
2820000	2821000	because you work for Nintendo
2821000	2824000	so let me ask you specifically about Sony vs. Microsoft
2824000	2828000	because Nintendo has kind of decided to go in this whole different direction with the Wii thing
2828000	2832000	so where do you see the Sony-Microsoft war headed in 2007?
2832000	2836000	I see it headed towards new formats
2836000	2840000	I think Microsoft's going to be
2840000	2844000	they're going to try to make some point of making games
2844000	2847000	for that HD DVD drive to sell it
2847000	2850000	I think Sony is going to be a lot more focused on the PS3
2850000	2853000	I think one with their marketing campaigns
2853000	2856000	and just the complete lack of games for their PSP
2856000	2857000	they need to scrap that
2857000	2859000	as I've said on my own show
2859000	2862000	that thing needs to be dead by the end of 2007
2862000	2865000	because the more money Sony puts into that portable
2865000	2867000	they're going to lose even more money on it
2867000	2869000	so you think the PSP is a done deal
2869000	2873000	because there's talk about they should re-release a PSP lite
2873000	2875000	kind of thing like Nintendo did
2875000	2876000	but you say no scrap it all
2876000	2879000	if you release a PSP lite I don't know what you're going to do
2879000	2880000	you're going to have to
2880000	2883000	I don't know how you're going to make that thing any thinner
2883000	2884000	or more portable
2884000	2885000	because the things already
2885000	2888000	you can hold it enough
2888000	2889000	and the screen's so big
2889000	2891000	and I know Sony's not going to let a sacrifice
2891000	2893000	dumbing down that screen
2893000	2896000	I realize we're talking kind of the end of 2006 here
2896000	2900000	but do you think Metal Gear Portable Ops gave the system the kick in the pants it needed?
2900000	2901000	No
2901000	2902000	No, you don't think it's enough?
2902000	2903000	No
2903000	2907000	Alright, well quick give us a plug for your show DMN
2907000	2909000	that you have here on Orange Launch Radio
2909000	2911000	Yeah, you guys need to listen
2911000	2914000	Thursdays at 7pm, Saturdays at 2pm
2914000	2917000	STFU with myself and DJ Tyrant
2917000	2919000	it's a lot quicker than this show is
2919000	2921000	What are you trying to say?
2921000	2925000	I'm trying to say it's 45 minutes and not 3 hours
2925000	2926000	I see
2926000	2928000	Of course listen to this show too
2928000	2931000	If you need something a little more compacted
2931000	2935000	STFU is in a much smaller package
2935000	2938000	What are you trying to call small?
2938000	2940000	Emphasis on small package with you DMN
2940000	2944000	Alright, in all seriousness
2944000	2946000	it's been awesome to have you aboard
2946000	2948000	and officially a part of the Orange Launch Radio family
2948000	2951000	and we wish a lot of success for your show in 2007
2951000	2953000	and I hear we're going to step it up
2953000	2956000	and do some more podcasting with STFU in 2007
2956000	2957000	so we can look forward to that as well, right?
2957000	2958000	Oh yes
2958000	2959000	Alright, sounds good
2959000	2960000	DMN, thanks so much for being on the program
2960000	2964000	Thanks, and you have nothing to talk about with small packages
2970000	2973000	It's been a very interesting year, our relationship with DMN
2973000	2974000	wouldn't you say?
2974000	2976000	He kind of started listening earlier this year
2976000	2978000	and now he has his own show on the network, it's crazy
2978000	2980000	He's a very interesting individual
2980000	2982000	It was cool to meet him when he came out here though
2982000	2985000	Who texts my phone with pictures of DDR cups
2985000	2987000	Yes, I got that text yesterday too
2987000	2990000	That's funny, but that was...
2990000	2991000	DDR cups?
2991000	2993000	Yeah, he sent this picture of a DDR cup from Burger King
2993000	2994000	for no reason to my phone
2994000	2995000	I want a DDR cup
2995000	2996000	Do they have those plastic cups
2996000	2998000	or is it just like their normal cardboard thing?
2998000	2999000	I think it's plastic
2999000	3002000	I'd have to check the picture again, but...
3002000	3003000	You know what's funny though
3003000	3006000	is actually since I do this retail site
3006000	3008000	like training for Microsoft
3008000	3009000	and they have free things
3009000	3011000	when you go through their training program
3011000	3013000	you can buy little chachkies and stuff
3013000	3017000	They have an Xbox 360 tumbler glass thing
3017000	3019000	I was thinking about buying
3019000	3020000	I should get one of those
3020000	3022000	By the way, while we're talking about DDR cups
3022000	3025000	we want to give a huge Orange Lounge Radio thank you
3025000	3027000	to our listener Misty
3027000	3029000	who sent us a copy of the DDR soundtrack
3029000	3030000	that they're selling at Burger King
3030000	3032000	and not only that, but
3032000	3034000	Misty's always been a really great supporter
3034000	3035000	of Orange Lounge Radio
3035000	3037000	She sent us a gift certificate for Live 365
3037000	3040000	so January is Misty month on Live 365
3040000	3042000	because essentially she's paid for it
3042000	3044000	So we wanted to say thanks to Misty
3044000	3045000	and she also sent us samples
3045000	3047000	of the jewelry she's been making
3047000	3049000	She's been making OL Army jewelry
3049000	3050000	and selling it on our forums
3050000	3052000	and we gave the OL Army one to Jamie
3052000	3053000	for her cell phone
3053000	3054000	and she's been using that
3054000	3055000	It's on my phone
3055000	3057000	It's orange-ing it up
3057000	3058000	So thank you, Miss
3058000	3059000	Everybody, thank you, Misty
3059000	3060000	Thank you
3060000	3062000	Thank you
3062000	3063000	And thank you DMN also as well
3063000	3064000	for coming to visit
3064000	3065000	and that Wii line
3065000	3066000	when we went out and gave the cookies
3066000	3068000	and soda to the Wii line
3068000	3069000	That was fun
3069000	3070000	We met so many cool people
3070000	3071000	I hope some of them are still listening to the show
3071000	3072000	I saw
3072000	3076000	Was it the one chick that he gave
3076000	3077000	Was it a hat too?
3077000	3078000	Yeah
3078000	3080000	I saw her at GameStop the other day
3080000	3081000	Really?
3081000	3082000	Yeah
3082000	3083000	Did she recognize you at all?
3083000	3084000	No
3084000	3085000	I didn't say anything because I'm an ass
3085000	3087000	and I don't talk to people
3087000	3089000	but I saw her and I recognized her
3089000	3091000	She was in line with me and Chris
3091000	3092000	Yeah, she was cool
3092000	3093000	She was hanging out with us
3093000	3094000	Damn it
3094000	3095000	We should have emailed her
3095000	3096000	and brought her on the show
3096000	3097000	Oh, well, we'll get her next time
3097000	3098000	Well, if I see her again
3098000	3099000	I'll say hi
3099000	3100000	Alright, you do that
3100000	3101000	One more time
3101000	3102000	Let's say hi to some more guests
3102000	3104000	Jamie, who's coming on next?
3104000	3106000	That would be
3106000	3107000	John and Michelle
3107000	3109000	from Video Game Outsiders
3115000	3116000	Alright, and we're joined on the line
3116000	3118000	by Michelle and John
3118000	3120000	from the Video Game Outsiders
3120000	3122000	You guys there, Michelle, John?
3122000	3123000	Woohoo
3123000	3124000	We're here
3124000	3125000	Hey, how you guys doing?
3125000	3127000	What's up, you mother?
3127000	3129000	Happy 2006
3129000	3130000	Soon to be 2007 to you
3130000	3131000	That's right
3131000	3134000	Now, 2006 has been a really good year
3134000	3136000	for you guys, huh?
3136000	3137000	It has
3137000	3140000	We've actually kind of gone beyond
3140000	3141000	what we thought we would do
3141000	3142000	with this little podcast here
3142000	3144000	and we're enjoying it
3144000	3145000	Yeah, awesome
3145000	3146000	You guys just recently won
3146000	3148000	like an Xbox award, right?
3148000	3149000	We did
3149000	3150000	Podcast of the year
3150000	3151000	How about that, huh?
3151000	3152000	Very cool
3152000	3153000	Congratulations, you guys
3153000	3154000	That's awesome
3154000	3155000	Thank you
3155000	3156000	Was that something that was
3156000	3157000	like community-based
3157000	3159000	or was the community voted
3159000	3160000	or was that like an editorial
3160000	3162000	It was voted by people who
3162000	3164000	listen to gaming podcasts, I guess
3164000	3165000	and that's why it was important to me
3165000	3168000	It wasn't just some old fat cat guys
3168000	3170000	in a business room somewhere
3170000	3172000	It was actually by the people
3172000	3173000	That's awesome
3173000	3174000	I think it always feels better
3174000	3175000	when it's something from the community
3175000	3176000	Absolutely
3176000	3177000	That's great
3177000	3178000	What a compliment
3178000	3180000	How are you going to top that in 2007?
3180000	3182000	I have no idea
3182000	3184000	John wants to do a naked episode
3184000	3185000	That's not going to happen
3185000	3186000	We're going to do a musical, actually
3186000	3187000	There you go
3187000	3188000	Wow, all right
3188000	3189000	We'll go with that
3189000	3190000	Oh, the big musical episode, of course
3190000	3191000	But see, that's when you know
3191000	3192000	your shows jump the shark
3192000	3193000	So be careful
3193000	3194000	Yes, exactly
3194000	3196000	All right, well, we've invited you
3196000	3197500	guys on today to play a little game
3197500	3201200	We call the year 2006 in review
3201200	3203000	And what we've got, we got 13 boxes
3203000	3204000	on the table
3204000	3205000	And since there's two of you
3205000	3206000	Oh
3206000	3207000	We'll let you guys each pick a box
3207000	3209000	So, ladies first, Michelle
3209000	3211000	Why don't you give me a box number
3211000	3212000	1 through 13
3212000	3213000	We'll take a look what's inside
3213000	3215000	I'll take number 4
3215000	3217000	All right, box number 4
3217000	3218000	Let's have a look
3218000	3221000	All right, the category we would
3221000	3223000	like to know your opinion on
3223000	3226000	Best graphics in a game in 2006
3226000	3229000	The best graphics of any game in 2006
3229000	3231000	Best graphics in a game
3231000	3232000	I have to give it to a game
3232000	3233000	I actually do not like
3233000	3235000	Gears of War
3235000	3236000	Even though I did not like the game
3236000	3238000	I was blown away by the graphics
3238000	3239000	When I turned that on
3239000	3240000	I was like, wow, this is what
3240000	3241000	next gen is all about
3241000	3242000	And I know we're going to probably
3242000	3243000	have people yelling at me
3243000	3245000	for not liking Gears of War
3245000	3247000	But I'll get to that later
3247000	3248000	You know what's interesting?
3248000	3249000	Not from this audience
3249000	3251000	Because we've said some very similar things
3251000	3252000	on the program
3252000	3253000	I've said the same thing
3253000	3254000	I think the game looks great
3254000	3256000	But I was let down by the way it played
3256000	3257000	Exactly
3257000	3258000	Well, that's a big relief
3258000	3259000	Because at our show
3259000	3260000	We had a lot of people writing in
3260000	3261000	Like, how dare you hate this game
3261000	3262000	And you're crazy
3262000	3264000	Stop playing your Tom Clancy stuff
3264000	3265000	Tell them to sit down
3265000	3267000	People like what they like
3267000	3268000	Exactly
3268000	3269000	Sim it down now
3269000	3270000	I liked it
3270000	3271000	But the graphics were amazing
3271000	3272000	So that's my pick
3272000	3273000	Hey John, since you're on the line
3273000	3274000	You want to buy into this too?
3274000	3276000	What do you think is the best graphics?
3276000	3277000	I definitely agree with Gears of War
3277000	3279000	The second game that comes to mind though
3279000	3280000	Is definitely I think Splinter Cell
3280000	3282000	Is a close second
3282000	3283000	Double Agent
3283000	3284000	But yeah, Gears of War I'd say
3284000	3285000	Is definitely the best looking game
3285000	3286000	Of the year
3286000	3287000	Without a doubt
3287000	3288000	What is it about Splinter Cell
3288000	3290000	That makes it stand out to you?
3290000	3292000	You know, personally I was a little
3292000	3293000	Disappointed with Splinter Cell
3293000	3294000	I thought that the multiplayer
3294000	3296000	Just was horrible
3296000	3297000	Compared to what they did in the past
3297000	3298000	I loved K.S. Theory
3298000	3300000	Yeah, and it was a huge step backwards
3300000	3301000	But visually, I just
3301000	3303000	I look at Sam's noggin on the screen
3303000	3305000	With all the sweat and the detail
3305000	3306000	And the stubble
3306000	3307000	The lighting
3307000	3309000	I just love the character models in that game
3309000	3311000	So it definitely stands out for me
3311000	3312000	Alright, very cool
3312000	3314000	Well now, you not only have a pretty
3314000	3315000	Big category there
3315000	3316000	But you have a really big news topic
3316000	3318000	We want to know your opinion on for the year
3318000	3319000	Michelle
3319000	3322000	And this is a news topic that seems to be
3322000	3325000	Something that keeps going on and on and on
3325000	3326000	Throughout the year
3326000	3328000	And it's somebody we don't refer to by name
3328000	3329000	Here on this program
3329000	3333000	But we'll call him Tack Jomson
3333000	3334000	Okay
3334000	3335000	Alright
3335000	3337000	Alright, you know this guy, right?
3337000	3339000	He's somewhat of a bully
3339000	3341000	In the legal sense
3341000	3343000	And remember, he actually went to court
3343000	3345000	To try to stop the game Bully
3345000	3346000	On the Playstation 2
3346000	3347000	From even coming out
3347000	3349000	What is it about this guy, you think
3349000	3351000	Why do you think this guy keeps wanting
3351000	3353000	To pick on us gamers?
3353000	3355000	Why won't he just leave us alone?
3355000	3356000	Well, you know, that's funny
3356000	3357000	Because a long time ago on our show
3357000	3359000	I mentioned that this kind of violence
3359000	3360000	In video games
3360000	3361000	And I mentioned the game Bully
3361000	3363000	And John and Kyle, the other hosts
3363000	3364000	Shot me down
3364000	3366000	They're like, oh, nothing's become of that
3366000	3367000	And that's a fine game
3367000	3368000	It's really not that bad
3368000	3370000	But, you know, the angle of that
3370000	3371000	With the school kids
3371000	3372000	And I think that that's what's really
3372000	3373000	Getting this guy going
3373000	3374000	But to me, it's fine
3374000	3376000	I grew up playing violent video games
3376000	3378000	And I feel guilty when I kill a gnat
3378000	3380000	So I think the guy needs to back off
3380000	3382000	Well, yeah, and I kind of have an opinion
3382000	3383000	About this
3383000	3384000	I think it all comes down to parenting
3384000	3386000	And parents and all that in general
3386000	3388000	And I think that these are just like campaign issues
3388000	3390000	You know, I know Hillary Clinton
3390000	3391000	Kind of latched on to this
3391000	3393000	As a campaign issue
3393000	3394000	And I think like the soccer moms
3394000	3396000	I don't want to get political here
3396000	3397000	Soccer moms
3397000	3398000	I think that there's a certain demographic
3398000	3401000	That don't know enough about video games
3401000	3402000	And they just hear this stuff
3402000	3405000	And they say, oh, yeah, we should get on board with this
3405000	3406000	And we should ban this too
3406000	3408000	It's a bunch of crap, you know
3408000	3409000	And Jack Thompson doesn't know dick
3409000	3410000	About video games
3410000	3413000	He didn't even play Bully
3413000	3415000	He already decided that he hates it
3415000	3417000	And really, it's probably one of Rockstar's
3417000	3418000	Tamiest titles
3418000	3419000	You know, that's true
3419000	3421000	Is that he really seemed like
3421000	3423000	When they let them all sit down and play the game
3423000	3424000	He seemed kind of mad that
3424000	3426000	They weren't showing enough of the game
3426000	3428000	Like he seemed to know all this stuff about the game
3428000	3429000	But the game hadn't even out
3429000	3430000	How was he able to play it?
3430000	3431000	Exactly
3431000	3432000	Very interesting
3432000	3433000	You know, we've said a lot of the same things
3433000	3434000	On our show here
3434000	3436000	It all comes down to the parents
3436000	3437000	So I think it's very interesting
3437000	3439000	We have very similar perspectives there
3439000	3440000	But I wanted to ask real quickly too
3440000	3442000	About the whole Hillary Clinton
3442000	3443000	And other politicians
3443000	3444000	What do you think recently
3444000	3445000	And this is all kind of recently
3445000	3448000	In the November, December of the year
3448000	3450000	It's kind of been the Hillary and
3450000	3451000	Who's the other guy
3451000	3452000	Lieberman
3452000	3453000	Have seemed to come out
3453000	3455000	Kind of embracing the ESRB
3455000	3457000	Like almost that there's been a change in attitude
3457000	3458000	A little bit
3458000	3459000	You don't trust Lieberman
3459000	3460000	I'm from Connecticut
3460000	3461000	He ran as an independent
3461000	3462000	So we all are like
3462000	3463000	Whoever, who cares
3463000	3464000	And first of all
3464000	3465000	I want to back up here and say
3465000	3466000	You know
3466000	3468000	Our podcast is not political at all
3468000	3470000	Yeah, we try not to go there
3470000	3471000	Because we get the mail too
3471000	3472000	You take us down a road
3472000	3473000	You take us down a road
3473000	3474000	But we never go down
3474000	3475000	You know
3475000	3476000	We just want to have fun
3476000	3477000	But yeah
3477000	3479000	I think this whole ESRB thing is a joke
3479000	3481000	Unless the retailers really enforce it
3481000	3483000	It's absolutely meaningless
3483000	3485000	And I see these kids trying to buy
3485000	3486000	Grand Theft Auto all the time
3486000	3488000	And I think most of them succeed
3488000	3491000	Some 50-year-old fat housewife at Walmart
3491000	3492000	Is going to sell the kid the game
3492000	3493000	So come on
3493000	3494000	It's on eBay anyway
3494000	3495000	I mean these days
3495000	3497000	It's really hard to control that
3497000	3498000	All right, all right
3498000	3500000	We better get off this political road
3500000	3501000	Because I can see people emailing us
3501000	3502000	I don't want to go down there
3502000	3503000	All right, all right
3503000	3504000	Then let's go to another box
3504000	3505000	John, it's your turn
3505000	3506000	Go and pick a box
3506000	3508000	1 through 12 now
3508000	3510000	I'll link to 12
3510000	3511000	How about 7?
3511000	3512000	All right, box number 7
3512000	3516000	Let's take a look
3516000	3521000	Most hilarious video game of 2006
3521000	3522000	Oh
3522000	3523000	Most hilarious
3523000	3525000	Okay, that's easy for me
3525000	3529000	It's actually Rayman Raving Rabbids
3529000	3530000	Whatever the hell it is
3530000	3532000	It's Rayman Raving Rabbids on the Wii
3532000	3534000	Yeah, definitely
3534000	3537000	That game is off the wall crazy
3537000	3538000	So it's one of those laugh-out
3538000	3539000	I have to be honest
3539000	3542000	I personally haven't played this a whole lot
3542000	3544000	But I did notice it was somewhat quirky
3544000	3546000	When I took a look at it
3546000	3547000	It's very quirky
3547000	3550000	What is it about the game that makes it so funny?
3550000	3553000	You know, it's just got this twisted art direction
3553000	3555000	Which I kind of appreciate
3555000	3557000	They really create these little mutant-looking
3557000	3558000	Rabbit characters
3558000	3561000	And you just kind of throw it in this little rabbit world
3561000	3562000	And it's just very bizarre
3562000	3563000	And it's funny, you know
3563000	3565000	And I think that's all it is
3565000	3566000	That's all I can say
3566000	3567000	All right, very cool
3567000	3568000	Michelle, would you agree
3568000	3570000	Or do you have a different pick?
3570000	3573000	For me, I don't know if this is on the console or anything
3573000	3575000	I'm going to have to go with OfficialLineWriter.com
3575000	3576000	What?
3576000	3577000	Yes
3577000	3579000	It's a little web game
3579000	3581000	Of this guy that's on a sled
3581000	3582000	And he goes flying around
3582000	3583000	And I laughed for like an hour
3583000	3584000	When I first played this game
3584000	3585000	Well, you're simple
3585000	3586000	We'll take it
3586000	3587000	It's PC gaming
3587000	3588000	We'll take it
3588000	3589000	It's a little PC game
3589000	3590000	I'm telling you
3590000	3591000	It's a gem
3591000	3592000	Try it out and you'll get a good laugh
3592000	3594000	All right, awesome
3594000	3595000	Yeah, you know
3595000	3597000	I was trying to pull up LineWriter on the Wii
3597000	3599000	When the browser came out
3599000	3601000	But now, I guess since they're going to make it an official game
3601000	3602000	They locked everybody out
3602000	3604000	Yeah, I can't wait for that
3604000	3606000	Yeah, it's a Flash issue
3606000	3608000	Because the Wii only supports Flash 7 or older
3608000	3610000	And that's like in Flash 9 or something
3610000	3612000	Oh, we had thought that they shut people out
3612000	3615000	Because they're going to be releasing the full version later on
3615000	3616000	As a game
3616000	3617000	Yeah, it's a newer Flash version
3617000	3618000	Yep
3618000	3621000	All right, and here's the story I'd like to ask you about
3621000	3623000	This is a little bit dated
3623000	3625000	This kind of goes back to way early in the year
3625000	3628000	But I don't remember if you remember all the furor that went on
3628000	3631000	When Microsoft announced that they were going to be creating this new system
3631000	3633000	Called the Origami
3633000	3637000	And for about a month, people were running wild
3637000	3638000	Like, oh my gosh
3638000	3640000	Microsoft's going to enter the handheld market
3640000	3642000	They're going to obliterate the PSP and the DS
3642000	3643000	And da da da
3643000	3647000	And then it turns out the Origami is just pretty much this fancy schmancy PC
3647000	3649000	And that's why the screenshot of Halo was on it
3649000	3654000	So this kind of bears the question about Microsoft entering the handheld market
3654000	3657000	Is this something Microsoft ought to consider in 2007?
3657000	3659000	Yes
3659000	3661000	I would definitely say so
3661000	3663000	You know, I'm a Nintendo fanboy
3663000	3666000	The DSLY has sold like 34 million units
3666000	3669000	Compared to the PSP, which is like 18 million
3669000	3671000	You know, Nintendo owns that category
3671000	3673000	And I think that there's definitely a need still
3673000	3676000	For a portable for an older market
3676000	3680000	You know, the Nintendo kind of is young and skews a little bit older
3680000	3681000	But not too old
3681000	3684000	And I think that Microsoft, it's ripe for the taking
3684000	3686000	Because they have the installed user base of the 360
3686000	3688000	And yes, I think they should definitely do it
3688000	3693000	Are you saying you want to have a dead or alive extreme volleyball on the go, basically?
3693000	3696000	No, I think that Microsoft's bigger plan though
3696000	3699000	Is like to integrate the Xbox Live market into the handheld
3699000	3701000	So I think that's where the magic's going to be
3701000	3703000	Where you can download movies or music or games
3703000	3706000	And then carry them with you in this portable device
3706000	3709000	Do you think that's something they might end up trying to do with Zune
3709000	3711000	Because of the iPod games and everything?
3711000	3713000	I do think that
3713000	3717000	Because the thing about the Xbox is that you can download movies now
3717000	3719000	No music is around the corner
3719000	3721000	The thing is you can't get it off the console
3721000	3722000	You can't take it with you
3722000	3724000	So some device is going to enable that
3724000	3726000	Be it the Zune or this other device that comes
3726000	3729000	So I think that's all part of the big picture
3729000	3730000	I definitely do
3730000	3731000	Michelle, what are your thoughts?
3731000	3733000	Microsoft, do they need a handheld?
3733000	3735000	I think they should really get into it
3735000	3737000	Because although the Nintendo DS is very cool
3737000	3739000	I do not like playing multiplayer on it
3739000	3741000	Because of the little friend code thing
3741000	3743000	Now one thing Microsoft does and does well
3743000	3745000	Is the Xbox Live community
3745000	3746000	And if they could get that on a handheld
3746000	3747000	I would definitely pick it up
3747000	3749000	Because to be able to just get up and go
3749000	3751000	And play with your friends no matter where you are
3751000	3753000	That's something that the DS just doesn't have
3753000	3756000	If you remember the DS didn't even get online
3756000	3757000	For about a year and a half
3757000	3758000	Yep, exactly
3758000	3761000	I agree with you there
3761000	3763000	That Xbox definitely knows what they're doing
3763000	3765000	When it comes to the online stuff
3765000	3766000	Very good
3766000	3768000	One more question for you guys
3768000	3770000	Actually two, it's a two-parter
3770000	3772000	We want to know, because we're taking a tally all day long
3772000	3776000	What do you guys believe is the best game of 2006?
3776000	3777000	Michelle, we'll start with you
3777000	3779000	Michelle, what do you think is the best game of 2006?
3779000	3783000	For multiplayer, I'm going to give it to Rainbow Six Vegas
3783000	3784000	But I want to talk about single player
3784000	3787000	Because to me, I was not into single player games
3787000	3788000	Until this game came along
3788000	3789000	It's oblivion
3789000	3791000	I've spent countless hours
3791000	3792000	And I haven't played the game twice
3792000	3796000	Everybody I ever talked to kind of liked the game
3796000	3798000	Except for people who didn't have time for it
3798000	3800000	So it seemed to have something for everyone
3800000	3802000	Worst game, do you want me to go right into?
3802000	3803000	Sure, why not?
3803000	3804000	We'll take your worst game
3804000	3805000	What do you think, Michelle?
3805000	3807000	Although there were worst games
3807000	3810000	It's going to be Gears of War because I had the most hype
3810000	3811000	Come on!
3811000	3813000	Yes, because I wanted that to be good
3813000	3815000	Because it had the capability to be good
3815000	3816000	And it just wasn't
3816000	3818000	So that was the biggest letdown for me
3818000	3819000	And that's why I gave it to the worst game
3819000	3822000	That is a gutsy, gutsy statement
3822000	3824000	It's a gutsy thing, everybody bring it on
3824000	3826000	You want to give out your email address, your gamertag?
3826000	3829000	Oh God, you can find us at videogameoutsiders.com
3829000	3830000	Oh, there you go
3830000	3832000	Orange Lines Radio
3832000	3833000	All right, all right
3833000	3835000	You know what, I would actually agree
3835000	3838000	I named Gears of War at E3
3838000	3842000	I said next to Spore, it was the game I was anticipating the most
3842000	3844000	Walking out of the doors of E3
3844000	3847000	Because when I looked at E3, I thought
3847000	3850000	Boy, the cover seems so neat
3850000	3852000	How one button will do all this stuff
3852000	3854000	But then when I actually sat down and played it
3854000	3856000	I was like, ugh, I don't like this
3856000	3858000	I want to just run out there and start shooting people
3858000	3860000	Like Quake or Halo
3860000	3864000	All right, John, what do you think was the best game of 2006?
3864000	3867000	Well, my favorite game by far this year
3867000	3870000	So far is Zelda for the Wii, Twilight Princess
3870000	3872000	Definitely the best single-player game of the year
3872000	3874000	It's just absolutely immersive
3874000	3877000	The art direction, the plot, everything about it
3877000	3879000	I just absolutely love, it's what I live for
3879000	3882000	And then my favorite multiplayer game, I agree with Michelle
3882000	3887000	It's Rainbow Six Vegas with a close second Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
3887000	3889000	Because I think at the end of the day
3889000	3891000	That's the game I probably played the most this year is Ghost Recon
3891000	3893000	All right, interesting
3893000	3895000	All right, so we'll put you down for
3895000	3897000	It sounds like you're very passionate about the Zelda
3897000	3899000	So we'll put that down as the single-player game
3899000	3901000	Yes, very much so
3901000	3903000	Yeah, I would say so
3903000	3905000	Worst game, you want to hear my totem ball?
3905000	3907000	What the hell is that?
3907000	3910000	I wonder when someone was going to go to the Xbox Live
3910000	3913000	And some of their questionable picks this year
3913000	3915000	So even though the game was free
3915000	3917000	You still say it's not worth being free
3917000	3921000	Yes, it was an embarrassment to Xbox Live
3921000	3925000	You know, what is it about camera games anyway?
3925000	3927000	Everybody seems to want to do camera games
3927000	3929000	But it seems to me like no one's done it right
3929000	3932000	Well the iToy, the Sony iToy was pretty successful though
3932000	3935000	It was successful, but how fun was it really?
3935000	3937000	I know, exactly
3937000	3940000	Fun for like an hour and then it kind of, I don't know, the thrill is lost
3940000	3942000	It's a novelty
3942000	3946000	Well hey, best of luck to you guys in 2007
3946000	3948000	Tell our listeners really quick who may not be familiar with your program
3948000	3950000	Tell them a little bit about your show
3950000	3952000	We have a really stupid podcast
3952000	3954000	No stop
3954000	3957000	Basically we have a very relaxed kind of podcast
3957000	3959000	In the atmosphere if you're just kind of talking with your friends
3959000	3962000	We're not game experts, we're not in the industry
3962000	3965000	And we have a really great forum and community
3965000	3967000	And I think that's what makes our show so great as well
3967000	3969000	Yeah, we have awesome listeners
3969000	3972000	And there's actually a third host who's not here
3972000	3974000	Kyle Jones, and he's Canadian
3974000	3976000	Yes, he's our resident Canadian
3976000	3979000	So check us out, videogameoutsiders.com
3979000	3982000	We have a forum, you can download the episodes and all that
3982000	3984000	Show archives, blah blah blah
3984000	3985000	Videogameoutsiders.com
3985000	3986000	Alright, very cool
3986000	3988000	Check that out you guys, it's videogameoutsiders.com
3988000	3990000	Congratulations to you guys on an awesome 2006
3990000	3992000	Thanks for coming on our program tonight
3992000	3993000	We appreciate it
3993000	3994000	Thanks for having us
3994000	3996000	And we'll see you in 2007
3996000	3998000	Happy New Year
4003000	4005000	We definitely want to thank John and Michelle
4005000	4007000	For coming on from Video Game Outsiders
4007000	4009000	You know, that was one of those people that we contacted
4009000	4011000	We really didn't know them
4011000	4013000	But we just kind of thought we'd get along with them
4013000	4015000	Just because, hey, you know, it's two guys and a girl
4015000	4017000	That do their show, and they all met through a gaming community
4017000	4019000	And we know some of our listeners are in common
4019000	4021000	So it was very cool of them to come on
4021000	4023000	Without really maybe knowing who we were
4023000	4025000	I don't know if they knew beforehand or what
4025000	4027000	So it was just very cool
4027000	4029000	And I gotta say, that Michelle, she's got some pretty big balls
4029000	4032000	Naming Gears of War the worst game of the year
4032000	4035000	Well, I mean, it was kind of a disappointment sometimes
4035000	4037000	But maybe I need to play it more
4037000	4039000	I know it's fucking hard, though
4039000	4041000	All my coworkers that bought that game said
4041000	4043000	My God, this game is so fucking hard
4043000	4045000	I'm playing it on easy, and I can't fucking pass
4045000	4047000	To the goddamn beginning of the game
4047000	4050000	No, I mean, I can't say I disagree with her
4050000	4052000	I don't know if I would have called it the worst game of the year
4052000	4054000	But definitely one of the biggest disappointments
4054000	4056000	For me, personally
4056000	4058000	You know what, I'm gonna go on the record saying
4058000	4062000	I think the best game of next year is gonna be Earth Defense Force 2017
4062000	4064000	What?
4064000	4068000	It's the same game, you're fighting giant ants and robots and stuff
4068000	4070000	Okay, maybe it's not the best game, but it's a game I want
4070000	4075000	Alright, well, thanks again to those guys over at VideoGameOutsiders.com
4075000	4079000	They just released the whole Simple 2000 series over here
4079000	4081000	That'd be fun
4081000	4084000	Alright, you're looking at this whole other world right now, Logie
4084000	4086000	So?
4086000	4087000	As usual
4087000	4089000	Alright, who's our next interview?
4089000	4097000	Our next one is Brad from PodCulture
4097000	4100000	And I'm joined here by Brad from PodCulture
4100000	4102000	Welcome to the program, Brad, how you doing?
4102000	4104000	Beachy King
4104000	4107000	Hey, now this is a little different because PodCulture
4107000	4110000	Not exactly exclusively a games podcast
4110000	4112000	But you're still a games fan, yes?
4112000	4113000	Oh yeah
4113000	4116000	What kind of stuff do you talk about over there on PodCulture for those that don't know?
4116000	4118000	Basically just geek life
4118000	4123000	You know, it's me, a friend of mine I've known for I guess almost 20 years now
4123000	4129000	And my girlfriend and the three of us just sit around and talk about what TV we're watching
4129000	4133000	What games we're playing, what movies we're watching
4133000	4135000	That kind of stuff
4135000	4140000	Sounds just like what we do here, but a little more geeky
4140000	4144000	More in the pop culture business, I guess
4144000	4145000	Nothing wrong with that
4145000	4149000	Well, thanks for coming on the show today, Brad, and we want to play a little game with you
4149000	4152000	And it's called The Year 2006 in Review
4152000	4157000	So we have 11 boxes left, why don't you pick one of those boxes, 1 through 11
4157000	4159000	We'll open it up and see what's inside
4159000	4160000	Number 9
4160000	4162000	Alright, number 9, here we go
4165000	4171000	The best puzzle game of 2006, are you a big puzzle game fan?
4171000	4173000	I like some of them, yeah
4173000	4177000	Well, did you have a particular favorite that you would call the best puzzle game of 2006?
4177000	4182000	Well, I don't know if it came out in 2006, but I started playing it in 2006
4182000	4183000	We'll take it
4183000	4185000	Astro Pop
4185000	4190000	Astro Pop, I believe technically that was a release this year, so on Xbox Live Arcade
4190000	4191000	Yeah
4191000	4197000	Interesting choice, because some of those PopCap games, some folks say they don't belong on Xbox Live
4197000	4200000	What is it about the Astro Pop game that you like so much?
4200000	4208000	Well, I have ADD when it comes to games, so when it comes to trying to play something for a long time
4208000	4211000	I kind of lose interest in it a lot
4211000	4214000	So, you know, you can pick that up and just run with it
4214000	4218000	So, Astro Pop is one of those games that you really sit down and you only play it for a little while at a time
4218000	4219000	Mm-hmm
4219000	4221000	Alright, gotcha, okay, I can understand
4221000	4224000	Well, as we say, there are no right or wrong answers, it's your opinion
4224000	4227000	So there you have it, Astro Pop for best puzzle game
4227000	4232000	Aren't those achievements a pain in the butt, though, on Xbox Live? I don't think I have any of them
4232000	4235000	I haven't gotten any on Astro Pop
4235000	4236000	That's a tough game
4236000	4240000	Alright, well, we also want to know your opinion on a particular news topic
4240000	4246000	And the one we have in box number 9 is the PlayStation 3 line versus the Wii line
4246000	4249000	Of course, in November, big, big console launches
4249000	4252000	And you hear about this violent outbreak
4252000	4258000	I think there was this comic that put it so well is that there was this violent outbreak going on in the PlayStation 3 lines
4258000	4261000	Where people were getting shot and pushed into telephone poles
4261000	4265000	And then you go to the Wii line and it's like people are wearing buttons that say free hugs
4265000	4267000	And it's just, you know, kumbaya and everything
4267000	4271000	Why do you think there was such the radical difference between the two lines this year?
4271000	4282000	I don't know if it's just that Nintendo is more of a fun system versus the hardcore gamers on the P3 or what
4282000	4285000	I really don't know
4285000	4292000	Nintendo has always had more of a fun thing around their system
4292000	4298000	It's been less hardcore gamers than the PlayStation has been, at least to me anyway
4298000	4303000	So you think maybe when you say it's more fun, maybe the fact that there were more people in the Wii line
4303000	4308000	That were really dedicated and you knew that those people were going to be playing the Wii
4308000	4313000	Versus, you know, the eBaying that they say was going on in the PlayStation 3 line
4313000	4315000	Where half those people were camping to put it on eBay
4315000	4320000	Yeah, and you're looking at it where the system costs half as much too
4320000	4325000	More people are going to be able to afford to buy that to play
4325000	4331000	And, you know, it's more of a status symbol in a lot of ways
4331000	4334000	You know, I've got a PlayStation 3 that are rare
4334000	4337000	You know, it's hard to get a Wii, sure, but it's a lot harder to get a P3
4337000	4339000	I can agree with the status symbol thing
4339000	4344000	Because I think the media kind of made it to look like the PlayStation 3 was kind of this, you know, big status symbol
4344000	4347000	Especially, you know, when they were covering the lines and everything
4347000	4351000	So do you think some of that might have to do with the fact that the PlayStation 3 came out first?
4351000	4355000	You're only talking a couple of days there, really
4355000	4356000	I guess that's true
4356000	4359000	It was, what, a week, maybe a week, a couple of days
4359000	4360000	About like four days, yeah
4360000	4361000	I guess that's true
4361000	4366000	All right, well, hey, just out of curiosity, did you end up waiting in line for one of these systems?
4366000	4372000	No, I've never been a get-it-at-the-moment kind of guy
4372000	4378000	It's only been within the past four or six months that I've even got an Xbox 360
4378000	4382000	So you're going to wait this little war out and see what happens, huh?
4382000	4386000	Yeah, I didn't feel like fighting the crazy lines to get a Wii
4386000	4393000	I thought about getting a Wii, but I kind of looked around and then the day they went on sale I had to work anyway
4393000	4397000	And by the time I got off, everybody had sold them all out at the Target
4397000	4402000	Do you think if there wasn't all this craziness around the Wii still that you might have one right now?
4402000	4406000	If I had 250 bucks, yeah, you betcha I'd have one
4406000	4410000	I guess this is the wrong time of year to be asking right after Christmas
4410000	4411000	Oh, yeah
4411000	4413000	All right, well, thanks so much for your opinion
4413000	4416000	We want to get your opinion on a couple more things here real quick
4416000	4423000	We also want to know, we're taking a poll all night long, what do you believe was the best video game of 2006
4423000	4425000	In your opinion, using whatever criteria you want
4425000	4432000	The best video game that I've gotten, and this is kind of weird because it conflicts with my ADDN games
4432000	4436000	But Phantasy Star Universe, I've loved that whole series
4436000	4441000	And I picked that up because I love the Dreamcast version and all that
4441000	4445000	And I picked up PSU and I've had a blast with that
4445000	4448000	Are you playing more the single player or more the online in that game?
4448000	4452000	About 50-50, maybe a little more online
4452000	4455000	This game was a little bit, I think, overlooked
4455000	4460000	I agree that Phantasy Star Universe is actually a much better title than I think a lot of people are giving it credit for
4460000	4462000	In my opinion
4462000	4468000	I think part of the reason people are overlooking it is because it came out right around the same time that you had Final Fantasy XII
4468000	4472000	A real powerhouse RPG on Sony's PlayStation
4472000	4475000	Do you think people are overlooking this game?
4475000	4484000	Well, as far as I can remember, Phantasy Star hasn't been the big blowout
4484000	4489000	Hadn't had the fanboy following maybe that Final Fantasy has
4489000	4496000	What is it about Phantasy Star Universe that appeals you to that game as opposed to a game like Final Fantasy XII?
4496000	4500000	Well, having never played any of the Final Fantasy games
4500000	4505000	I create my own character, I go through it
4505000	4509000	It doesn't seem to be as complex
4509000	4514000	Or at least Phantasy Star Online didn't seem to be as complex
4514000	4519000	Now Phantasy Star Universe has a little more depth to it than the other version
4519000	4521000	I can see that
4521000	4525000	Where Phantasy Star Universe and Phantasy Star Online especially were a little more action oriented
4525000	4529000	You actually use the weapons, like you press a button to swing the weapon
4529000	4533000	Whereas Final Fantasy was always a little more weight, cast magic
4533000	4536000	It was a little more think about it in advance type thing
4536000	4540000	Think and then act as opposed to having to react to Phantasy Star Universe
4540000	4541000	Exactly
4541000	4546000	What would you say would be the worst game that you played in 2006?
4546000	4549000	The worst game
4549000	4554000	It's weird because it's a fun game but it's the worst controls
4554000	4556000	Is Sneak King
4556000	4561000	Oh, Sneak King, worst game, why did you say Sneak King?
4561000	4566000	Because it's hard as hell to control that damn thing, at least to me
4566000	4570000	So even for four bucks it's too much, you think?
4570000	4573000	Four bucks is four bucks, that's not that big of a deal
4573000	4576000	But it's hard as hell to just control it
4576000	4580000	Do you think it was a little bit of a throwaway title just because of the commercial tie-in
4580000	4583000	That maybe the people who developed it thought, it's a four dollar game
4583000	4585000	We don't need to
4585000	4586000	Oh, exactly
4586000	4589000	Alright, so I guess the quality showed up there in the end
4589000	4592000	Alright, well thank you for sharing your opinion with us there
4592000	4596000	So we got Phantasy Star Universe and Sneak King for best and worst of 2006
4596000	4599000	And we'll tally it up throughout the night and see where we end up
4599000	4602000	Brad, what are your plans for 2007 with Pod Culture?
4602000	4605000	Just going to kind of keep on doing the same old, same old
4605000	4608000	Or any big things coming up for 2007?
4608000	4610000	We've tweaked the format a little bit
4610000	4614000	We're starting to go weekly rather than bi-weekly
4614000	4617000	With the show and who knows what lies in the future
4617000	4621000	Trying to get the word out and getting some more people listening to the show
4621000	4622000	Awesome, well get the word out right now
4622000	4626000	Tell them how they can tune into Pod Culture for some more geek and sci-fi chat
4626000	4629000	Be over at PodCulture.net
4629000	4630000	Alright
4630000	4634000	And there's three or four different ways to subscribe to it
4634000	4637000	Got an iTunes link, ODO
4637000	4639000	And just the regular RSS feed
4639000	4642000	And we're listed on Dig and Pop Current and all that fun stuff
4642000	4645000	Alright, go give them a dig, PodCulture.net
4645000	4647000	Brad, thanks so much for coming and joining us on the show
4647000	4649000	I know you've been a longtime listener of Orange Lounge
4649000	4650000	And we appreciate the support
4650000	4654000	And we're glad to have you on to support your independent program as well
4654000	4656000	Thank you very much
4685000	4689000	Especially when you're looking at sales trends and what system is ultimately gonna be victorious
4689000	4692000	It's not going to be just the system that appeals to the hardcore gamer
4692000	4696000	But everybody in between from casual gamer on to maybe a mid-level
4696000	4698000	Yeah, I like video games a little bit type thing
4698000	4703000	So, big thanks to Brad for coming on and sharing his perspective on the best puzzle game
4703000	4705000	In the PlayStation 3 line and the Wii line
4705000	4709000	You know what the Wii needs to, what market they need to tap
4709000	4712000	Is the old people that go to the casino market
4712000	4715000	And you can get some games that they can actually gamble and win money
4715000	4718000	Ah, that's a lot of money right there for you
4718000	4721000	You could actually use the Wii controller to pull a slot on a machine
4721000	4722000	Exactly
4722000	4726000	I mean, World Series of Poker are tournament champions for the Wiis
4726000	4729000	And they honestly have that game out there
4729000	4732000	And how it uses the controller is beyond me
4732000	4738000	But I'm thinking there's a lot of people that shuffle into a bus and go to a casino
4738000	4740000	If you can bring that experience home
4740000	4744000	You know, maybe have the Wii puff out some cigarette smoke
4744000	4747000	Maybe that's that hidden feature of the Wii no one knows about yet
4747000	4750000	It'll blow smoke in your face
4750000	4752000	You are so strange
4752000	4756000	Alright, anyway, we're going to take a little detour here
4756000	4759000	Because we're going to bring on some more people in segment B of our show
4759000	4763000	But first, it would not be an episode of Orange Launch Radio
4763000	4765000	If we did not have our very own Dark Sakura
4765000	4767000	Providing us with her perspective
4767000	4769000	From when she surfs up the web, up, down, left
4769000	4772000	I mean, that's all she does at work all day, is surf the web
4772000	4774000	So she's finding the website for you
4774000	4776000	What she believes is the website of the week
4776000	4780000	Dark Sakura, where should the kids be pointing their browsers to this week?
4785000	4787000	I blame you for this, Rob
4787000	4789000	I blame you for this, it's so hardcore
4789000	4796000	This site of the week is one that Rob turned me onto
4796000	4799000	It's the Katerday Live Journal Community
4799000	4802000	Which I've been looking over
4802000	4805000	And yeah, I love Katerday
4805000	4809000	The only reason I still really go to 4chan anymore is for Katerday
4809000	4813000	So this one is community.livejournal.com slash Katerday
4813000	4816000	C-A-T-E-U-R-D-A-Y
4816000	4821000	And I'm looking at one right now that has a cat with one of those frilly head things
4821000	4823000	And a little wand that says
4823000	4826000	Be in your fairy kitty, plot in your death for this
4826000	4828000	Fantastic
4828000	4832000	I'm thinking in 2007 we ought to just change the name of the segment to
4832000	4835000	Dark Sakura's cat picture site of the week
4835000	4836000	No, no, no
4836000	4837000	Because that's all you ever pick
4837000	4839000	No, no, no, no, no, because I also picked Dr. Who's site
4839000	4843000	God forbid they come out with a cat Dr. Who site
4843000	4847000	Or Dr. Who gets a little cat companion
4847000	4849000	No, because he doesn't like cats
4849000	4851000	Well, what a bastard
4851000	4855000	But I got to say though, in all honesty, you know, you may think
4855000	4857000	Jamie's a little weird for her Dr. Who obsession
4857000	4860000	But she finally did her best to make me a Dr. Who fan this week
4860000	4862000	And it's actually kind of working
4862000	4865000	We've been watching season one and we're, what, like five episodes in
4865000	4867000	And I actually really enjoy it
4867000	4868000	It's a really good show
4868000	4869000	It really is good
4869000	4871000	We're actually more than that
4871000	4873000	We're on the third disc
4873000	4876000	So we're on the seventh episode in
4876000	4877000	Oh dang
4877000	4878000	I'm loving it
4878000	4879000	I think it's a great show
4879000	4880000	I can't wait to get to season two
4880000	4882000	This is my favorite episode for the first season
4882000	4883000	The Daleks
4883000	4884000	Exterminate
4884000	4885000	It was good, it was good
4885000	4887000	They should make a video game out of that
4887000	4889000	They actually have made Dr. Who video games
4889000	4890000	Yeah, but like a new one
4890000	4893000	Because it's all a, you know, new resurgence of Dr. Who
4893000	4895000	So they need new Dr. Who games, I think
4895000	4897000	We need to shoot the Cybermen the game
4897000	4898000	Well, we're getting what?
4898000	4901000	I heard we're getting a Battlestar Galactica MMO on 360
4901000	4904000	We're getting, you know, the, what else were they making?
4904000	4905000	A Firefly
4905000	4906000	You can't do a Dr. Who MMO
4906000	4907000	It doesn't have to be an MMO
4907000	4908000	I don't care if it's an MMO or not
4908000	4911000	Make a good, good platformer, good TV tie-in game
4911000	4913000	Well, Rob also showed me another show that made me giggle
4913000	4917000	He showed me the BBC Queer as Folk
4917000	4919000	Yes, because it was actually written by the same guy who did Dr. Who
4919000	4921000	And, well, the new series, anyway
4921000	4923000	And it made me just crack up
4923000	4926000	When the one person watched by teasing one of the main characters
4926000	4927000	Going ex-star-men-a
4927000	4929000	I was like, yeah
4929000	4932000	I have a sonic screwdriver now that I left it at home

4940000	4941000	I don't like the other guy

4942000	4943000	Do it, do it
4943000	4944000	Do it
4944000	4945000	Alright, anyway

4952000	4954000	I've only seen one episode of the US one
4954000	4956000	And that was with the lesbians getting married
4956000	4957000	Aww, isn't that sweet
4957000	4959000	Anyway, before this show gets any gayer
4959000	4961000	We better take a break
