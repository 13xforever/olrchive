[SPEAKER_09]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

2
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:19,138
[SPEAKER_09]: and now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,522
[SPEAKER_10]: This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B, the last live segment of 2006.

5
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:31,350
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

6
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:50,848
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

7
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's get back into some news, some gaming news.

8
00:01:23,445 --> 00:01:26,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Because our live listeners have been waiting a while for us to get back into some gaming news.

9
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:28,448
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a huge story this week.

10
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:30,669
[SPEAKER_10]: The Nintendo Wiimote.

11
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:38,073
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I got some email messages and some text messages and phones from listeners and people going, Did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?

12
00:01:38,413 --> 00:01:39,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So somebody hit a panic button.

13
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:41,495
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to clarify right now.

14
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:43,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The Wiis were not recalled.

15
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.

16
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:59,065
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps, which are six-tenths of a millimeter in diameter, for a new beefed-up strap that is one millimeter in diameter.

17
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:07,089
[SPEAKER_10]: This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.

18
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:12,812
[SPEAKER_10]: You've probably seen that site, WeHaveAProblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up there.

19
00:02:13,737 --> 00:02:19,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was going to say, real quick, I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo actually tested them.

20
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:21,823
[SPEAKER_11]: They withstand about 50 pounds of pressure.

21
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:28,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress that should be applied to these things.

22
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:34,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they're offering this program for anybody who has a concern.

23
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:39,697
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, I've been playing the Wii for a long time.

24
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't imagine how that thing would break.

25
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

26
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,242
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:03,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Mass stupidity.

28
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:05,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Think across the board.

29
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:06,830
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't think there's flukes out there?

30
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,573
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be very few, if any.

31
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to swing this just like a baseball bat.

32
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:20,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to backhand this this way.

33
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.

34
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:31,970
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii Sports games.

35
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:33,215
[SPEAKER_05]: or any of the others.

36
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:51,864
[SPEAKER_05]: These people are basically using the system in a way other than I think intent because there was even a warning put out for using the Wiimote and if you give me a moment I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal except she replaced Wii with penis.

37
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,565
[SPEAKER_11]: They basically need to just calm down.

38
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:56,626
[SPEAKER_11]: They're really kind of

39
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, question number two

40
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional videos we've seen from the Wii?

41
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:25,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Nintendo kind of says one thing, that you don't need to move the Wiimote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting into it when it's on the news and everything.

42
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?

43
00:04:27,673 --> 00:04:33,518
[SPEAKER_11]: But even though they may be flailing around looking like complete idiots, they are not doing it uncontrollably.

44
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:36,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, when they're showing them, you know...

45
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,447
[SPEAKER_11]: Diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii Tennis.

46
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,568
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not swinging super hard.

47
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,790
[SPEAKER_11]: They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.

48
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:51,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.

49
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Safety information for playing Wii.

50
00:04:54,075 --> 00:05:04,160
[SPEAKER_05]: As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii Remote, we would like you to take a few minutes to review some important safety information which, when followed, will help ensure a fun playing experience for all.

51
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:05,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Wear the wrist strap.

52
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:11,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that all players using the Wii Remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has been tightened using the strap lock.

53
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:18,510
[SPEAKER_05]: When sharing the Wii Remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the Wii Remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.

54
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:23,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii Remote from flying across the room if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.

55
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold the Wii Remote firmly and do not let go.

56
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii Remote during gameplay and do not use excessive motion.

57
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:40,529
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, in Wii Sports Bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is to release the B button on the Wii Remote.

58
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not let go of the Wii Remote itself, in bold letters.

59
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:48,552
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.

60
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:54,337
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii Remote, the wrist strap may break and you could lose control of the Wii Remote.

61
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:57,259
[SPEAKER_05]: This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.

62
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,501
[SPEAKER_05]: They said this in their warning.

63
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,222
[SPEAKER_05]: You people are stupid!

64
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, interesting comments from chat I want to say here.

65
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:10,389
[SPEAKER_10]: BearWhoDriveCar says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.

66
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:12,428
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I love that nickname.

67
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:16,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangehaulsradio.com.

68
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:20,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Airtos says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.

69
00:06:21,266 --> 00:06:21,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting thought.

70
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't do any good if people are letting go of it anyway.

71
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:33,510
[SPEAKER_05]: The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically you're dealing with basic laws of physics.

72
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:38,772
[SPEAKER_05]: You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.

73
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:44,074
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Knight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt, happy fun we moat.

74
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:49,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Winner.

75
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:52,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, question number three.

76
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Will Nintendo get sued over this?

77
00:06:54,702 --> 00:06:54,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

78
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:55,622
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they will.

79
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:59,323
[SPEAKER_11]: They will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.

80
00:06:59,543 --> 00:06:59,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.

81
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:01,463
[SPEAKER_04]: No, okay.

82
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:03,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they attempt to get sued?

83
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:03,224
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

84
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:03,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Will it go through?

85
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:04,024
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

86
00:07:04,144 --> 00:07:11,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, having taken business law... Hold on, I'm getting DarkSakura's soapbox.

87
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

88
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to pull it out of the closet here.

89
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Rob.

90
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:16,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, Rob, Rob.

91
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:16,566
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

92
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:16,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

93
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:18,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway...

94
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:26,972
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole... Alright, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened a while back in Oklahoma.

95
00:07:27,252 --> 00:07:29,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.

96
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:32,856
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker.

97
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:37,940
[SPEAKER_05]: And it said, do not allow small children within so many feet of it.

98
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped off with a weed whacker.

99
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

100
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:01,947
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

101
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:31,570
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck simulating, dude.

102
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,870
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll throw it through someone's head.

103
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:33,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Actual murder.

104
00:08:33,911 --> 00:08:35,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there was a YouTube video of that.

105
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:37,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, we welcome your thoughts.

106
00:08:37,213 --> 00:08:42,196
[SPEAKER_05]: To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.

107
00:08:43,017 --> 00:08:47,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's duty and responsibility is to make the warning available.

108
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:57,946
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to mention, though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about, you know, federal government agencies looking into this and

109
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:07,607
[SPEAKER_11]: and apparently there have been recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.

110
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:09,668
[SPEAKER_11]: That is it.

111
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this isn't like killing people.

112
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,133
[SPEAKER_11]: This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV.

113
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:20,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm, you know, I caused a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week.

114
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, just stupid shit like that.

115
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:22,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say this real quick.

116
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:25,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.

117
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:30,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Funnydale in our chatroom says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering a recall.

118
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:35,360
[SPEAKER_10]: And then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's a problem.

119
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they didn't... It's a gray area.

120
00:09:38,122 --> 00:09:40,104
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't admit there's a problem, per se.

121
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:41,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I see this as a cover your ass...

122
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:54,225
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same thing with, remember the Pokemon toys that Burger King was putting out and the babies were suffocating on the ball when it clearly said do not let anyone under three years of age have a Pokeball.

123
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:59,387
[SPEAKER_05]: The duty and responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.

124
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Babymon, I choose you!

125
00:10:02,988 --> 00:10:05,609
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is a likely thing.

126
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:07,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Babies will put stuff in their mouths.

127
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,050
[SPEAKER_05]: They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.

128
00:10:10,772 --> 00:10:12,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really the parents' responsibility.

129
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:21,356
[SPEAKER_05]: But Burger King still recalled the Pokeballs so that they would not be held further liable for damages.

130
00:10:21,837 --> 00:10:25,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.

131
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, here's the thing I have to ask you.

132
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:28,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we have to keep it moving after this comment.

133
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

134
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:36,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, for example, if I have a baseball bat and I throw the baseball bat and it hits someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.

135
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company...

136
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:42,683
[SPEAKER_11]: for the injury caused by that baseball bat.

137
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing goes with the Wiimote.

138
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:51,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself because you're an idiot.

139
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,210
[SPEAKER_11]: It's as simple as that.

140
00:10:54,871 --> 00:11:03,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.

141
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:09,620
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes as would the case be

142
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:15,174
[SPEAKER_11]: with one that was posted here on Joystick showing how easily it can be done.

143
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:20,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.

144
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:25,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw you.

145
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:26,216
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not helping.

146
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.

147
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:33,138
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills.

148
00:11:33,158 --> 00:11:36,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you say on it it's a fake or whatever, then fine.

149
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun with your Photoshop skills.

150
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:44,083
[SPEAKER_10]: But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously, screw you.

151
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:45,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're not helping.

152
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:49,185
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the same people who are the stupid lame people who sell PS3s.

153
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:51,306
[SPEAKER_10]: Why don't you make a sign that says pay attention to me?

154
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:53,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

155
00:11:54,207 --> 00:12:00,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Flip side of the argument is... Oh, by the way, Audio Archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment because they don't know you're here yet.

156
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:00,989
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hi, Drew Nami.

157
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:02,785
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

158
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:36,604
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't go back to that subject.

159
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:37,484
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be here all night.

160
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:37,805
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

161
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about some good news?

162
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

163
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:42,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?

164
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:43,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Please say Kid Icarus.

165
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Not yet.

166
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Guardian Legend, Crystallis, Blaster Master.

167
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:48,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Bible Adventure!

168
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:50,855
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

169
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:56,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter 2, the World Warrior, is going to be heading to... Capcom finally loves us.

170
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:01,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Another, though... But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.

171
00:13:01,423 --> 00:13:02,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so what?

172
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But a number of other games are going to be coming.

173
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch-Out, and hey, Rob, Kid Icarus.

174
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck yes, thank you.

175
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:21,405
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but Capcom is starting to eke them out.

176
00:13:22,326 --> 00:13:23,627
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you, Capcom, sort of.

177
00:13:24,968 --> 00:13:25,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on a minute.

178
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: If Street Fighter II comes out on Virtual Console, this will cost me $8, yes?

179
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:30,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

180
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:43,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Could I not, for $2 more, get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?

181
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:44,695
[SPEAKER_05]: What if you don't own an Xbox?

182
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:46,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

183
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,698
[SPEAKER_10]: But that would be the only reason you should get this, then.

184
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:54,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you have an Xbox... Not everybody is in the same financial bracket or nerddom as us.

185
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:55,843
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I understand that.

186
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:56,363
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

187
00:13:56,744 --> 00:14:00,166
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just saying, if you're in the... Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.

188
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:01,367
[SPEAKER_10]: You have them both, okay?

189
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:01,467
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

190
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, why would you buy this?

191
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:07,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not?

192
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you have a better version for $2 more on the 360.

193
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, I have it on MAME.

194
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it on the Genesis.

195
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:17,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.

196
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:19,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I have it on the fucking Saturn.

197
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And you'll buy this on Virtual Console?

198
00:14:23,115 --> 00:14:23,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably.

199
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:25,096
[SPEAKER_10]: You sad, sad woman.

200
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:27,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, why would anyone buy Metal Slug?

201
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:31,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?

202
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Metal Slug on Wii.

203
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:38,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope... Why would people buy horse turds?

204
00:14:39,383 --> 00:14:40,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they like the PlayStation 3.

205
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:42,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're large and smelly.

206
00:14:43,145 --> 00:14:46,147
They like to feed them to their dogs.

207
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:48,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyways.

208
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, well, I hope that game comes out soon.

209
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working...

210
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:03,014
[SPEAKER_10]: on another Zelda title for the Wii.

211
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:14,217
[SPEAKER_10]: This one that they were making on GameCube was going on and stuff, but this whole time, since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back and made the Wii Handsmans, or whatever you want to call it.

212
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It really does look like a GameCube game on the Wii.

213
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:22,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that there is another Zelda game, possibly sooner than you might think.

214
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,922
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnesine.

215
00:15:26,022 --> 00:15:27,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting.

216
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:30,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.

217
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the way it looked.

218
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:42,988
[SPEAKER_11]: The cel-shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to go to make a really good-looking game.

219
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:45,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So, hope for that!

220
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:47,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

221
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:53,475
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but of course...

222
00:15:53,968 --> 00:16:13,316
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that, you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit wirelesssensorbar.com, and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt battery.

223
00:16:13,797 --> 00:16:17,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It will give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play.

224
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:21,740
[SPEAKER_11]: So interesting if you have, you know, projection TV, you know,

225
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:50,358
[SPEAKER_11]: projection screen setup for your Wii definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than the cord there so that might be the way to go or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy well speaking of other things for the Wii now this makes me particularly happy they are it's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii for anyone who doesn't know

226
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:58,575
[SPEAKER_05]: The Freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on your system.

227
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:01,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got one for my GameCube.

228
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabulous thing.

229
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:06,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul Calibur thanks to that.

230
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:14,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have not yet tried my Freeloader on the Wii, because our Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house.

231
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:15,601
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

232
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:23,395
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is soon.

233
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:25,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon.

234
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:29,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That means I get my cooking, Mama.

235
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:33,303
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be done when it's done.

236
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:35,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't worry, Mama will fix it.

237
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:42,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games.

238
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:44,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did.

239
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:48,551
[SPEAKER_10]: But one way or another, Europe has sold a lot of Wii's.

240
00:17:48,892 --> 00:17:51,153
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it just recently launched over there this past week.

241
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:56,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days.

242
00:17:56,677 --> 00:18:04,983
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, just like here in the U.S., Zelda Twilight Princess being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying off shelves.

243
00:18:05,305 --> 00:18:06,406
[SPEAKER_10]: at the retail price of £179.

244
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,628
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, that's $350 US.

245
00:18:09,648 --> 00:18:17,594
[SPEAKER_10]: And considering we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas getting screwed a little bit on the price point.

246
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:18,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, guys.

247
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:19,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know what to tell you.

248
00:18:20,136 --> 00:18:23,579
[SPEAKER_11]: So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii.

249
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:33,826
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people that might not have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter.

250
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,607
[SPEAKER_11]: But,

251
00:18:35,612 --> 00:18:45,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB Ethernet device from actual, like Newegg.

252
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:51,557
[SPEAKER_11]: They're selling one for $19.99, and it's an Ethernet adapter that you can buy.

253
00:18:51,637 --> 00:19:00,739
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Keenamax USB 2.0 to RJ45 Fast Ethernet 10100 Base T Network Adapter.

254
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,700
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty long name there, but...

255
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought my friend had this whole thing already

256
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:21,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo already had this stuff out on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?

257
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's a Wi-Fi Max.

258
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:25,108
[SPEAKER_11]: That's that USB thing for wireless internet.

259
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:28,891
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually plugs into your Wii and converts one of the USB ports to an Ethernet port.

260
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:30,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, I get it.

261
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:31,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So it works the other way.

262
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of plugging it into your computer, you plug it into the Wii.

263
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:34,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I get it.

264
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:38,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this is not for a wireless internet.

265
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,058
[SPEAKER_11]: This is wired internet.

266
00:19:39,098 --> 00:19:40,199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a converter.

267
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:41,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it work if you have a USB router?

268
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:44,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

269
00:19:44,162 --> 00:19:44,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

270
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:45,563
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good question.

271
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Try it.

272
00:19:47,517 --> 00:19:47,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Find out.

273
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:55,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email because we like to read emails every week here on this program.

274
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:58,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Katie's distracted.

275
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:13,103
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lounge Radio is that it's not just us because we're just some people on the Internet just like you, and we know you have an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and one of those is the mailbag.

276
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:19,941
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of our favorite emails and shares them with you in our little segment we call The Mailbag.

277
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,802
[SPEAKER_10]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

278
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:30,084
[SPEAKER_05]: First email comes from our friend AZHP.

279
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:31,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR.

280
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:38,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called The Year Ahead in Tech by some research analysts.

281
00:20:39,287 --> 00:20:40,387
[SPEAKER_05]: A choice quote from it.

282
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.

283
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:44,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Please do.

284
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:44,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So...

285
00:21:14,187 --> 00:21:15,008
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that was the quote.

286
00:21:16,028 --> 00:21:16,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I would actually believe that.

287
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,730
[SPEAKER_05]: How do people this stupid get jobs?

288
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:19,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I would believe it.

289
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me finish reading.

290
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:25,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot this guy is.

291
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I would myself, but the email would get too long.

292
00:21:28,738 --> 00:21:29,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Love your show, AZHP.

293
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:38,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, some of it... I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.

294
00:21:39,206 --> 00:21:41,648
[SPEAKER_05]: However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii...

295
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:49,031
[SPEAKER_05]: on a Wii game coming up, I have a feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii.

296
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a game in the Metal Gear family.

297
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:55,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I get the sense that Konami's willing to risk something on every platform, so I think they'll...

298
00:21:57,146 --> 00:22:03,430
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami and some of the other big publishers.

299
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:14,356
[SPEAKER_10]: But in regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down their... they would make online competitive play free for everyone, that's actually come up before, speculation-wise.

300
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:16,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So this person's actually not saying anything new.

301
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:25,383
[SPEAKER_10]: This whole thing started when Gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier, and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star Universe beta.

302
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:30,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different direction for a while now.

303
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:32,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's nothing new, actually.

304
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:37,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these.

305
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:42,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox Live kits and stuff, and now you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.

306
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:49,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining the bandwidth.

307
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:54,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for.

308
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:59,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the competitive play is going to stay on gold, and you're still going to have to pay for it.

309
00:22:59,788 --> 00:23:05,709
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three months, and then it's free afterwards.

310
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,429
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?

311
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:08,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

312
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:08,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it would work.

313
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in the long run.

314
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,201
[SPEAKER_10]: These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.

315
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:12,581
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.

316
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:20,806
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver.

317
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:23,888
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.

318
00:23:23,908 --> 00:23:25,409
[SPEAKER_05]: They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there.

319
00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:26,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Why the hell not?

320
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:29,312
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.

321
00:23:30,413 --> 00:23:34,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind of game.

322
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:35,636
[SPEAKER_05]: You just buy the game.

323
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:36,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

324
00:23:36,537 --> 00:23:36,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I think

325
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:40,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish they'd have more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.

326
00:23:41,122 --> 00:23:47,645
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you don't have to pay some monthly fee for.

327
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:50,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of people would be looking for something like that.

328
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:55,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Gravity, put Ragnarok online on Xbox 360.

329
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:57,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Dear Gravity, disregard what Jamie's telling you.

330
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Gravity, tell Rob to S-T-F-U-O-M-G.

331
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,151
[SPEAKER_05]: So shall I move on to the next email?

332
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:04,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

333
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:04,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, Rob.

334
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:05,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

335
00:24:06,452 --> 00:24:06,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, really.

336
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:07,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really?

337
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:09,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Way.

338
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, OLR, JeremyTodd1 is here yet again.

339
00:24:14,063 --> 00:24:14,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

340
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Insert JeremyTodd1's theme song here.

341
00:24:17,926 --> 00:24:22,629
[SPEAKER_10]: He probably has one because he manages to get on this program through different ways many times.

342
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:23,149
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's all right.

343
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,751
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a lot of good stuff to say.

344
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:28,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm reading email.

345
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I just made an Elebit noise.

346
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:31,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So did she.

347
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played Elebits yet.

348
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:36,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't die.

349
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:47,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking about this whole PS3 vs. Wii thing everyone is going off about and how Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.

350
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Too true.

351
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:49,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have an analogy.

352
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,084
[SPEAKER_05]: An analogy also has the word anal in it.

353
00:24:53,786 --> 00:24:56,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo generations.

354
00:24:56,748 --> 00:25:00,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.

355
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader except better.

356
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:08,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone knew what Nintendo was.

357
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, after those generations, look at Nintendo now.

358
00:25:11,488 --> 00:25:17,872
[SPEAKER_05]: They aren't exactly cheerleader worthy anymore, even though this could change this generation.

359
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:20,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Could the same thing happen to Sony?

360
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:24,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.

361
00:25:24,837 --> 00:25:31,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his boss a death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?

362
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:33,456
[SPEAKER_11]: He doesn't understand.

363
00:25:33,516 --> 00:25:35,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I could kick his ass any day.

364
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:39,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And he knows it, so there's no problem there.

365
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:44,359
[SPEAKER_05]: I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit, just like Nintendo's did after the Super Nintendo.

366
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:45,559
[SPEAKER_05]: They are already freaking headed that way.

367
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do the world-famous hosts of Orange Zones Radio, www.orangezonesradio.com, think of this.

368
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,580
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

369
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:56,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Put an M in the middle of the P.S., and that's what Rob is going through right now.

370
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:57,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, snap for reals.

371
00:25:58,462 --> 00:25:58,922
[SPEAKER_10]: PMS3?

372
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:03,338
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like some advanced form of PMS.

373
00:26:04,499 --> 00:26:05,900
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's mute.

374
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew Nami says it's PMS beyond.

375
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:09,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, anyway.

376
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It's UPMS.

377
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:12,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Uber PMS!

378
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:18,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I think that Sony's already heading down the pooper.

379
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:25,360
[SPEAKER_10]: In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons, just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?

380
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:42,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when, when we were doing the separate program, one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360, people were comparing it to Dreamcast, and I think the 360's showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast, so it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence.

381
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:43,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And one could say that

382
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:54,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo 64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge-based and didn't go on to the CD and all that stuff.

383
00:26:55,572 --> 00:27:01,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat.

384
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:03,658
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's still too soon to tell.

385
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:04,818
[SPEAKER_10]: The war ain't over yet.

386
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one.

387
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,342
[SPEAKER_10]: So you never know what games might come out next year.

388
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand.

389
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:12,544
How could Blu-ray fail?

390
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:13,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I...

391
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:21,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually liked Blu-ray, but I liked Betamax too, and what happened to that?

392
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:22,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Bastards.

393
00:27:23,555 --> 00:27:24,195
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny?

394
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:27,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Price aside, UMD's not bad either.

395
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:28,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Price aside.

396
00:27:29,058 --> 00:27:30,358
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the one problem I have with UMD.

397
00:27:30,378 --> 00:27:34,460
[SPEAKER_05]: But now you get a tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.

398
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,341
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good idea.

399
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:38,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, next one comes up from Misty.

400
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everyone, what's up?

401
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:40,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Misty here.

402
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:46,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to the Podline's service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th, St.

403
00:27:46,964 --> 00:27:49,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Louis time, of course, because I was up anyway.

404
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Like usual on my days off from work, I slept quite late.

405
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen to that.

406
00:27:54,229 --> 00:28:06,999
[SPEAKER_05]: I made it to the library before dark, but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading the podcast and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.

407
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again.

408
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: With a combination of the game center, the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online.

409
00:28:16,689 --> 00:28:20,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Heck, I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.

410
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:28,100
[SPEAKER_05]: With that gone, though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.

411
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:39,368
[SPEAKER_05]: That tends to get me out about midnight or 1am, depending on the day, being too wired, for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.

412
00:28:39,728 --> 00:28:40,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I can sympathize with that.

413
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:50,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.

414
00:28:50,055 --> 00:28:50,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't you going to ASUN?

415
00:28:53,346 --> 00:29:11,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris will be at ASIN I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio sweet she's got some promo cards in April we'll talk that's where the rest of this email is heading that reminds me the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening from pod lines from my cell phone

416
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:14,481
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

417
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:35,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing, because remember, we don't get paid for doing this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing houses do.

418
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, folks who run ASIN, send me a ticket.

419
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come out and do the panel.

420
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:44,945
[SPEAKER_10]: But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart, because she's already going for other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.

421
00:29:45,026 --> 00:29:47,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go there, and I will hand out lots of flyers.

422
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

423
00:30:06,926 --> 00:30:10,070
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I also want to mention what Misty refers to, the Podline service.

424
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:11,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, we don't support this.

425
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:14,576
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another organization, but I will give it a shout-out.

426
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:20,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Launch Radio over the telephone by calling this number.

427
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:22,966
[SPEAKER_10]: One for long distance.

428
00:30:23,207 --> 00:30:23,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Area code 650.

429
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,670
[SPEAKER_10]: 523-6855.

430
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, that's not an official endorsement of the service.

431
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:31,692
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't know much about them.

432
00:30:31,812 --> 00:30:36,835
[SPEAKER_10]: All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone.

433
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So use at your own risk.

434
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,756
[SPEAKER_10]: It's podlines.net.

435
00:30:40,457 --> 00:30:47,680
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that, where they can't listen to the show on the go.

436
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,961
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easier access to a computer 24-7.

437
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:49,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of neat.

438
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:56,670
[SPEAKER_05]: This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard.

439
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,030
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll read it anyway.

440
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:02,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, I'm drunk, I love you, Rob.

441
00:31:02,932 --> 00:31:03,992
[SPEAKER_05]: My girlfriend loves you, too.

442
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:07,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, DMN.

443
00:31:07,734 --> 00:31:08,554
[SPEAKER_04]: DMN needs a cookie.

444
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,935
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself in AA, okay?

445
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:12,655
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I have to say.

446
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:16,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the next step.

447
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:17,517
Yeah, be Lindsay Lohan, put a shirt on, too.

448
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,945
[SPEAKER_04]: and like Britney Spears, put some panties on.

449
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please DM him, put some panties on.

450
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,906
[SPEAKER_05]: That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.

451
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:28,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show.

452
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:30,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Plug, plug, plug.

453
00:31:30,148 --> 00:31:30,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

454
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:35,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, this one comes from Michael.

455
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Long time listener, first time emailer.

456
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:45,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style, and the vocal mix she played sometime is fantastic.

457
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:49,764
[SPEAKER_05]: However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.

458
00:31:50,124 --> 00:31:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate to hear any chance you could help.

459
00:31:54,626 --> 00:32:06,053
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a Vincent D'Amour compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, Fly Away, all of those on it.

460
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:07,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the Dance Manias do.

461
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.

462
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up.

463
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:21,367
[SPEAKER_10]: But I didn't say that.

464
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:25,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But seriously though, we would encourage that you get the originals.

465
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:32,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Go CD Japan, go to some of the... In fact, I remember seeing on one of the Transnation CDs...

466
00:32:34,568 --> 00:32:37,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was the Transnation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition.

467
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:44,695
[SPEAKER_05]: 04 has quite a number of really good trans stuff on it, and one of them is Flotation.

468
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:46,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Flotation, or was it Fly Away?

469
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:51,219
[SPEAKER_05]: The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.

470
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car!

471
00:32:57,463 --> 00:33:01,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last one... No, wait, god damn it, Rob left the room.

472
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.

473
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:08,437
[SPEAKER_05]: This actually was sent to us by our friend Rob with two B's.

474
00:33:12,122 --> 00:33:17,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a story from a blog that he sent us that

475
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:37,175
[SPEAKER_10]: This will make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout errors on our end, and I don't know if that's Live 365 fault or our fault, so I was just saying in studio, if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled, because I don't know what's going on.

476
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,976
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.

477
00:33:40,336 --> 00:33:43,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us, because he sent me several.

478
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.

479
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Gamasutra posted... posted...

480
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,752
[SPEAKER_05]: A story about Activision.

481
00:33:57,794 --> 00:34:01,236
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the NIMF E-grade given to ESRB.

482
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:04,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.

483
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB.

484
00:34:09,543 --> 00:34:11,405
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really good article and I'm going to link it in the chat room.

485
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:16,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, parents support the ESRB.

486
00:34:16,729 --> 00:34:17,670
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's a good idea.

487
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,913
[SPEAKER_05]: It certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think.

488
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,334
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it easier for them to

489
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Be able to judge what their children are playing.

490
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good idea.

491
00:34:27,094 --> 00:34:31,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this last one is interesting.

492
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,161
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to read it.

493
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:34,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And Rob has to pay attention.

494
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:36,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I should let Chris read it.

495
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:37,085
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

496
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:37,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

497
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:39,607
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point was for you to read it.

498
00:34:39,768 --> 00:34:40,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

499
00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:42,831
[SPEAKER_05]: This was sent to us by Chris.

500
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:48,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi guys, it's me, Chris.

501
00:34:48,737 --> 00:34:49,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big lesbian.

502
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:52,060
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not say that.

503
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It's true, but I didn't say that.

504
00:34:54,822 --> 00:34:56,884
[SPEAKER_05]: You people sure attract some weirdos.

505
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:02,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, riding in a sleigh.

506
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,870
[SPEAKER_05]: He asked me to send you this email.

507
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:07,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear OLR crew, You wrote ORL?

508
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:08,774
[SPEAKER_05]: He wrote ORL.

509
00:35:10,935 --> 00:35:11,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

510
00:35:11,536 --> 00:35:12,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the guy.

511
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:14,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, on your laptop.

512
00:35:15,748 --> 00:35:16,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, OLR.

513
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and good evening, chat room.

514
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.

515
00:35:22,612 --> 00:35:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room that they detected a strange anomaly.

516
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:33,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in all for your radio show, hoping for the best in the new year.

517
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:37,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.

518
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:38,701
[SPEAKER_05]: After a while, it came to me.

519
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:44,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift that I hope... that all hope will be of use...

520
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:46,871
[SPEAKER_05]: to help your show.

521
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:47,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

522
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:55,257
[SPEAKER_05]: From the wishes of the chat room to the wishes of the message board to the wishes of the listeners not known, I'll have a very special gift for you.

523
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:59,620
[SPEAKER_05]: To Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year from SC.

524
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,141
[SPEAKER_05]: P.S.

525
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:02,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I left the gift with a strange blue-haired girl.

526
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:03,884
[SPEAKER_05]: She should be handing it to you right now.

527
00:36:04,744 --> 00:36:05,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to open it.

528
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:07,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my.

529
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,792
[SPEAKER_04]: People attract the weirdest of guys.

530
00:36:09,972 --> 00:36:10,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my.

531
00:36:10,432 --> 00:36:11,492
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy was old.

532
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:13,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Rob that attracted me.

533
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:18,697
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air and I said, was he hot?

534
00:36:18,897 --> 00:36:26,121
[SPEAKER_10]: Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show and the first question I go, was he hot?

535
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:30,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh no, you like the old dude?

536
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:31,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob likes it.

537
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:32,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I okay to open this?

538
00:36:32,644 --> 00:36:33,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you have to open it.

539
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:33,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.

540
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:40,824
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an envelope, two OLR from Santa and the fans.

541
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:42,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I licked it, sorry.

542
00:36:42,886 --> 00:36:46,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have an oil fixation?

543
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

544
00:36:52,235 --> 00:36:53,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Hurry up, Rob!

545
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,419
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying, I don't want to ruin it.

546
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:55,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

547
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.

548
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:10,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, I... I didn't do it.

549
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:11,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa did.

550
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:23,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I... Like, I'm just, like, not paying attention to anything.

551
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,460
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually looking... I don't know what to say.

552
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm... Wow.

553
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:33,482
[SPEAKER_10]: That whole guy was cool.

554
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:34,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you sure?

555
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:43,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what to say.

556
00:37:47,283 --> 00:37:48,524
[SPEAKER_11]: This is embarrassing in a way.

557
00:37:49,965 --> 00:37:55,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their bodies.

558
00:37:55,627 --> 00:37:58,369
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's...

559
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:03,253
Can I say what it is?

560
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:03,954
I guess you could call it...

561
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:35,987
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm throwing it around the whole place.

562
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:42,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you could call it seed money to take OLR to the next level.

563
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:49,856
[SPEAKER_10]: And something I think a lot of us always, like we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.

564
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:56,660
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always... No, I'm sorry.

565
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just overwhelmed.

566
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit's on the right track.

567
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:07,742
[SPEAKER_05]: You're on the right track, I'll put it that way.

568
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:11,465
[SPEAKER_10]: It's basically $4,000 in scene money.

569
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:13,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds so strange to say.

570
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:24,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to bring you guys to do what we do here and really be able to take this to the next level.

571
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh god, I'm so embarrassed that

572
00:39:27,987 --> 00:39:30,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her permission to service you.

573
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I didn't, I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.

574
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:52,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I haven't, that I didn't know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about you guys want to do all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could do that.

575
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,605
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, it's for promotion.

576
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,247
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for anything you guys want to use it for.

577
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely at your disposal.

578
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

579
00:39:59,209 --> 00:40:00,490
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where to begin.

580
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where to begin.

581
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:05,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's kind of like that I'm looking at this.

582
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know.

583
00:40:08,816 --> 00:40:09,797
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where to begin.

584
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to set up that account now.

585
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:19,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now and maybe...

586
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe we'll be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon.

587
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:24,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

588
00:40:24,323 --> 00:40:24,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

589
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But thank you so much.

590
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:30,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm... Thank you.

591
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you okay, Loki?

592
00:40:35,471 --> 00:40:36,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not even looking at chat.

593
00:40:36,552 --> 00:40:37,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even want to know.

594
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:40,535
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all by allgames.com.

595
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:44,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's going to be happening.

596
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit's telling us to drop by 365.

597
00:40:45,898 --> 00:40:45,938
Uh...

598
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:52,196
[SPEAKER_10]: That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.

599
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:57,557
[SPEAKER_05]: My heart's racing very quickly.

600
00:40:57,617 --> 00:40:58,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

601
00:40:58,578 --> 00:41:02,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of... No, it's fine.

602
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:02,999
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

603
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:04,679
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't know what to say.

604
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:09,461
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this just doesn't happen.

605
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:11,581
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is.

606
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:12,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

607
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:13,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

608
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:14,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know what to say.

609
00:41:20,387 --> 00:41:22,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Read another fucking email already.

610
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:24,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the last email.

611
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it.

612
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:26,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Read another one.

613
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Make something up.

614
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Make something up.

615
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.

616
00:41:34,637 --> 00:41:35,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Love, The Queen.

617
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:39,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You play everything on Doctor Who.

618
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,701
[SPEAKER_04]: All you would play is Doctor Who.

619
00:41:41,862 --> 00:41:43,122
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd have like BBC Who.

620
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:46,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, I'll take it from here.

621
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:48,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

622
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,414
[SPEAKER_10]: If I had a story up, somebody else needs to do it.

623
00:41:50,434 --> 00:41:50,614
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

624
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:08,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Exchange Mii's.

625
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:20,913
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Mii to your remote, which you can do via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Mii exchange.

626
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:30,679
[SPEAKER_11]: It's actually available on wimodwii.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Mii's.

627
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:35,308
[SPEAKER_11]: Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca, Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc.

628
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:36,008
[SPEAKER_11]: God, Harry Potter.

629
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,094
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely check that out.

630
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:55,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that.

631
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:01,317
[SPEAKER_11]: And available also on WeModWe.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that.

632
00:43:01,637 --> 00:43:04,338
[SPEAKER_11]: And it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.

633
00:43:05,118 --> 00:43:06,298
[SPEAKER_11]: So definitely worth checking out.

634
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:12,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have Chuck Norris on my Wii console.

635
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:14,521
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a requirement.

636
00:43:16,362 --> 00:43:19,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story.

637
00:43:20,325 --> 00:43:21,566
[SPEAKER_10]: and then I'm going to run out of the room for a minute.

638
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:33,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.

639
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:42,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this week and the big shock, you know, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.

640
00:43:42,774 --> 00:43:46,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, these games are like of biblical proportions in Japan.

641
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:54,577
[SPEAKER_10]: But the fact that Dragon Quest IX Protectors of the Starry Sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.

642
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,378
[SPEAKER_10]: It will feature 3D graphics.

643
00:43:56,418 --> 00:43:57,919
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some screenshots released.

644
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:04,624
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks very similar in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was, of course, recently out on the PlayStation 2.

645
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:07,507
[SPEAKER_10]: And they are trying to make it ready by 2007.

646
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:12,851
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade.

647
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:14,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

648
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only am I crying, but I have hiccups, too.

649
00:44:16,206 --> 00:44:17,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Quest Monster Battle Road

650
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:48,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I've pretty much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Bros.

651
00:44:48,698 --> 00:44:50,039
[SPEAKER_11]: and Mario Kart.

652
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:57,163
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have games.

653
00:44:57,223 --> 00:45:00,084
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a lot of filler, it seems like.

654
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:08,488
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of ports of stuff that end up on the PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or Final Fantasy.

655
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:12,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's why their system is not doing this well.

656
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Airtost says Silent Hill Origins.

657
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:15,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, whenever that comes out.

658
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:24,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead we just have, yay, another Untold Legends, or yay, another Dynasty Warriors, yay.

659
00:45:24,407 --> 00:45:29,448
[SPEAKER_05]: GS191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon Quest IX for DS.

660
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:31,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Enis is going to sue somebody now.

661
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know what else to say about that.

662
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I was pretty surprised to hear that myself.

663
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:41,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

664
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:43,939
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so used to playing Dragon Quest on my television.

665
00:45:43,979 --> 00:45:47,602
[SPEAKER_10]: But then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon Quest on the Game Boy years ago.

666
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:49,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they ported one, too.

667
00:45:49,824 --> 00:45:53,687
[SPEAKER_11]: And there will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii.

668
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I forgot about that.

669
00:45:55,229 --> 00:45:55,589
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

670
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:56,810
[SPEAKER_10]: That was supposed to be a launch title.

671
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,051
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was in Japan.

672
00:45:59,913 --> 00:46:00,273
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

673
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I definitely want to check this out.

674
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on the DS.

675
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:11,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see any... Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate very well to the DS.

676
00:46:11,222 --> 00:46:13,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see why this will be a problem.

677
00:46:13,163 --> 00:46:13,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Toriyama.

678
00:46:14,284 --> 00:46:15,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go wrong with him.

679
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:15,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it'll be good.

680
00:46:16,046 --> 00:46:18,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it.

681
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:20,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is good news.

682
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:22,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Call Blimey!

683
00:46:23,773 --> 00:46:26,156
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, so now...

684
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:34,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for you guys, I thought I'd bring this up.

685
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:44,401
[SPEAKER_11]: You can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain program, you can make your Wii sound like a lightsaber when you swing it around.

686
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:53,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why someone created this, for the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so you know, to prevent

687
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:54,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Star Wars Kid

688
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:26,946
[SPEAKER_05]: WeSaber.

689
00:47:27,186 --> 00:47:28,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Heaven help us all.

690
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:30,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how about I redeem the world now?

691
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:31,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

692
00:47:32,387 --> 00:47:37,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you know who Kevin Smith is.

693
00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:38,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

694
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:41,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... Nugget of the Nooch!

695
00:47:42,709 --> 00:47:48,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That... Well, he's interested in making a game based on Jay and Silent Bob.

696
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:49,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

697
00:47:50,479 --> 00:48:02,428
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining, basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make the levels and stuff in it.

698
00:48:03,149 --> 00:48:04,870
[SPEAKER_05]: So he basically is going to be concept director.

699
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Welp.

700
00:48:10,936 --> 00:48:13,098
[SPEAKER_05]: rated M for Mature rated M for Mature

701
00:48:41,707 --> 00:48:42,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's great.

702
00:48:43,448 --> 00:48:44,988
[SPEAKER_05]: So she had Dogma the game.

703
00:48:45,448 --> 00:48:48,249
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to... That'd be awesome.

704
00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:50,410
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to fight legions of angels.

705
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:53,711
[SPEAKER_05]: And with Alanis as God.

706
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:55,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we get to watch Muse strip?

707
00:48:56,632 --> 00:49:00,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not going to watch him do the Silence of the Lambs dance.

708
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:01,614
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Muse.

709
00:49:02,864 --> 00:49:03,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Serendipity!

710
00:49:03,784 --> 00:49:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you meant... Selma Hayek, man!

711
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:08,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I thought you were talking about Jason Mewes because they referred to him by his last name in their interviews.

712
00:49:09,027 --> 00:49:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

713
00:49:09,767 --> 00:49:10,147
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mewes.

714
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:11,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Serendipity, yeah.

715
00:49:11,608 --> 00:49:12,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell yeah!

716
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:14,469
Boobies!

717
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:17,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Well... Boobies!

718
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:19,251
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

719
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:26,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Jay and Silent Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be a collective nerdgasm heard around the world with this type of game.

720
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:27,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god.

721
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:29,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

722
00:49:31,092 --> 00:49:32,653
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

723
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:56,993
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

724
00:50:26,775 --> 00:50:32,357
[SPEAKER_11]: After all, they have the ticket games based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.

725
00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:43,461
[SPEAKER_10]: No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.

726
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:47,503
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote DJ Dark Knight, No!

727
00:50:49,604 --> 00:50:55,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, to go back on a previous subject, to quote Gary Who Drive Car, Mallrats the game removed the kids sitting on the escalator level.

728
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:19,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur 3s that could be in these arcades, the Time Crisis 4s, the DDR Supernovas that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.

729
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:22,836
[SPEAKER_10]: And does this piss you off as much as it does us?

730
00:51:23,277 --> 00:51:25,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it makes us so mad we have to...

731
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:30,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Rant.

732
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:33,472
[SPEAKER_10]: The FUs of the week, DarkSakura.

733
00:51:34,252 --> 00:51:36,393
[SPEAKER_05]: The first FU of the week goes to Extrovert.

734
00:51:37,253 --> 00:51:42,596
[SPEAKER_05]: For not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity photo shoot butt bleaching.

735
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:48,938
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going to get Extrovert a gift certificate for intimate photographs.

736
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:51,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And an anal bleaching.

737
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:54,501
[SPEAKER_05]: That fell through.

738
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:02,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, however, like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful facial responses from my husband.

739
00:52:03,965 --> 00:52:04,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It was gorgeous.

740
00:52:05,606 --> 00:52:07,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching Dan squirm makes me happy sometimes.

741
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:10,109
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

742
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:12,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your FU.

743
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:19,654
[SPEAKER_11]: My FU goes to stupid people, and especially the amounts of stupid people out in abundance due to the holidays.

744
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:24,357
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I hate having to drive around and see you trying to, you know,

745
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:30,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Swerve into me and then realize, oh, you're just trying to change lanes, but you haven't figured out how to use the blinker yet.

746
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:32,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Stupid shit like that.

747
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and this one's definitely for Nelly.

748
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:51,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she could buy candy and had to count out her $4 worth of purchases with pennies in front of us.

749
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:53,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And she kept messing up.

750
00:52:53,809 --> 00:52:54,970
[SPEAKER_11]: and have to recount them.

751
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:56,671
[SPEAKER_11]: It was horrible.

752
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:59,073
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you get paper rolls first.

753
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:04,416
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was in college, we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll them and then go to movies.

754
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:07,818
[SPEAKER_11]: She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.

755
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:10,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, I know the rules.

756
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you don't mind me paying for the pennies.

757
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:17,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then we used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went where we were going.

758
00:53:18,586 --> 00:53:21,087
[SPEAKER_11]: See, that's what considerate people would do, but you forget she's a dumb bitch.

759
00:53:21,167 --> 00:53:21,207
Um...

760
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:28,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I had something, but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.

761
00:53:28,718 --> 00:53:30,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So, no, it's fine.

762
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:30,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Trust me.

763
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,084
[SPEAKER_10]: But I guess my FU would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on the radio program.

764
00:53:38,104 --> 00:53:39,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

765
00:53:40,025 --> 00:53:41,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I am so sorry, Rob.

766
00:53:41,526 --> 00:53:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

767
00:53:42,126 --> 00:53:42,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

768
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:43,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

769
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:44,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

770
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't feel sorry.

771
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:52,696
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a serious FU, and I seriously... Oh, I know what it was.

772
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:53,296
[SPEAKER_10]: I just remembered.

773
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:53,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I finally remembered.

774
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:57,018
[SPEAKER_10]: An FU to the fact I didn't go to bed until 6.30 in the morning yesterday.

775
00:53:57,158 --> 00:54:01,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's my own downfall, but it doesn't make me feel any better.

776
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:03,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my Sunday is, like, completely gone.

777
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:04,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, wait.

778
00:54:04,863 --> 00:54:05,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, shh.

779
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

780
00:54:05,824 --> 00:54:07,304
[SPEAKER_10]: We still have other people that have to do their FUs.

781
00:54:07,324 --> 00:54:07,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew.

782
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:08,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew.

783
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:18,055
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, FU to the World of Warcraft 2.0 patch for forcing me into the addiction relapse.

784
00:54:19,496 --> 00:54:24,299
[SPEAKER_07]: FU to certain parts of that patch that break all your interface add-ons.

785
00:54:24,439 --> 00:54:29,903
[SPEAKER_07]: When we say, remember, remember the 5th of December, the day all the add-ons were dropped.

786
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:32,227
[SPEAKER_07]: and F.U.

787
00:54:32,307 --> 00:54:41,374
[SPEAKER_07]: to not having my chat filter up until a week afterwards forcing me to actually deal with the dude speaking that is in WoW also F.U.

788
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:52,942
[SPEAKER_07]: to Burnout 3 which is on loan right now for being so incredibly addictive that's it alrighty Chris, you have some F.U.s of the week?

789
00:54:53,703 --> 00:54:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I've only got one and that's F.U.

790
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:58,907
[SPEAKER_04]: to Fred Seltz and the West Baptist Church

791
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:04,201
[SPEAKER_04]: All you people need to, like, shut the fucking hell up.

792
00:55:04,321 --> 00:55:07,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know if you guys know who the Phelps crowd is.

793
00:55:08,624 --> 00:55:14,126
[SPEAKER_04]: They are, like, the biggest retard, inbred retards I've ever come across.

794
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:18,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do they hate gay people, that, you know, that's kind of a given.

795
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:21,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Most, you know, church-based organizations do that.

796
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,573
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've got signs out there that say, you know, God hates fags, thank God for AIDS, that kind of shit.

797
00:55:27,313 --> 00:55:28,614
[SPEAKER_04]: They also protest.

798
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,802
[SPEAKER_04]: at soldiers' funerals.

799
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:34,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care how much you like this war or not.

800
00:55:34,484 --> 00:55:38,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not protest at dead soldiers' funerals, you fucking retards.

801
00:55:39,107 --> 00:55:40,548
[SPEAKER_10]: And didn't they protest the Amish, too?

802
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: They protested, okay.

803
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:43,810
[SPEAKER_10]: How can anyone hate the Amish?

804
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:50,055
[SPEAKER_04]: They protested, I'm sure all of you heard, some little girls got killed by this insane guy.

805
00:55:50,115 --> 00:55:51,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And the little girls were Amish.

806
00:55:51,356 --> 00:55:52,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Four little girls got killed.

807
00:55:52,857 --> 00:55:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: In a schoolhouse.

808
00:55:53,677 --> 00:55:54,578
[SPEAKER_04]: In a schoolhouse.

809
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:57,940
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy came and was gonna, you know, just kill them.

810
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,921
[SPEAKER_04]: He was going to rape them.

811
00:56:00,094 --> 00:56:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: The bastards were going to protest at an Amish, little girl Amish funeral.

812
00:56:08,558 --> 00:56:10,839
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you, no one hates the Amish.

813
00:56:10,979 --> 00:56:11,960
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they going to do?

814
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, knit a quilt at you?

815
00:56:14,021 --> 00:56:14,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really.

816
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:16,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, oh my God.

817
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:21,425
[SPEAKER_10]: You know when that happened, the Amish set up a fund for the murderer's family.

818
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:21,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, family.

819
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:24,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Who hates the Amish?

820
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:28,631
[SPEAKER_04]: They were going to have signs out there that were going to say your daughters are whores.

821
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,811
[SPEAKER_04]: They're burning in hell.

822
00:56:30,211 --> 00:56:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not do that.

823
00:56:31,632 --> 00:56:33,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a human being, goddammit.

824
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:35,093
[SPEAKER_04]: You treat people with fucking respect.

825
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:36,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Out there if you hate homosexuals.

826
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,194
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not go to a little girl's funeral.

827
00:56:39,674 --> 00:56:41,496
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, protest that kind of shit.

828
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:42,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the Amish.

829
00:56:42,617 --> 00:56:43,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Mentally ill people.

830
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:53,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Amish don't have, you know, I'm sure they keep up to date with some stuff, but it's not like they have a big scope of the world out all the frickin' time.

831
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,552
[SPEAKER_10]: What is there, the Westminster Batmobile?

832
00:56:56,592 --> 00:56:56,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, West...

833
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:58,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Baptist Church.

834
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,736
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't believe us, check this site out.

835
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:03,838
[SPEAKER_04]: GodHatesFags.com.

836
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:04,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's very interesting.

837
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:05,760
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disgusting.

838
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if you watch them... I don't take it seriously.

839
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:09,723
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't take it seriously.

840
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:11,065
[SPEAKER_10]: These people are seriously ill.

841
00:57:11,345 --> 00:57:13,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you should... Here's something fun.

842
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Type in Phelps or go to GodHatesFags.com and you can find his name.

843
00:57:19,052 --> 00:57:20,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Go put that shit on YouTube.

844
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:22,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Shirley Phelps is his wife.

845
00:57:22,795 --> 00:57:23,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the guy...

846
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:27,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Fox News Interviews with Shirley Phelps.com

847
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:47,459
[SPEAKER_04]: She obviously hasn't read the Bible.

848
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:48,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, seriously.

849
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And she looks like she got hit with a shovel, too.

850
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:52,522
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like... We've got to get back to games.

851
00:57:52,582 --> 00:57:54,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I went a little overboard.

852
00:57:55,024 --> 00:57:56,245
[SPEAKER_04]: They struck a chord in me.

853
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:57,946
[SPEAKER_10]: Merry Christmas, everyone.

854
00:57:57,966 --> 00:58:03,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you, Phelps.

855
00:58:03,249 --> 00:58:05,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus loves you, so worship him or he'll kill you.

856
00:58:05,911 --> 00:58:06,511
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote Chris.

857
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: To quote Junami, Jesus saves, everybody else takes half damage.

858
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:16,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I love D&D geek jokes.

859
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways.

860
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:21,269
[SPEAKER_05]: So, hey, Loki, what do you say we continue on with some stories?

861
00:58:21,489 --> 00:58:21,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

862
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:30,513
[SPEAKER_11]: So, if you don't have enough money to spend on a PlayStation 3 or, you know, a 360 or even a Wii for that matter, what can you do?

863
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:31,513
[SPEAKER_11]: What can you do?

864
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:33,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you can buy retro.

865
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:40,076
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, for the same amount of money, why bother buying virtual console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on?

866
00:58:40,736 --> 00:58:42,357
[SPEAKER_11]: So, shop eBay.

867
00:58:42,737 --> 00:58:44,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Shop your local thrift stores.

868
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:48,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper.

869
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:55,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, if you're in the California area here, go visit Tower or Hell.

870
00:58:55,116 --> 00:58:59,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're all around the country, but visit Tower Records.

871
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:03,500
[SPEAKER_11]: They're closing down, so you can probably get some old-ass games there if they have some used stuff.

872
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, eBay is your friend.

873
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:11,243
[SPEAKER_11]: You can find lots of consoles for cheap, especially when people are trying to earn some extra money to buy the new ones.

874
00:59:12,624 --> 00:59:13,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I like eBay.

875
00:59:13,644 --> 00:59:15,185
[SPEAKER_05]: eBay's been taking a lot of my money lately.

876
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:19,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800.

877
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:24,451
[SPEAKER_05]: The system that is most notoriously known for breaking!

878
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:29,052
[SPEAKER_05]: You can have a working AC adapter, those are pretty hard to come by too, but the systems?

879
00:59:30,112 --> 00:59:30,252
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

880
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:31,813
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

881
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of five that I've played, all of them broke.

882
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:36,794
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

883
00:59:37,254 --> 00:59:41,996
[SPEAKER_05]: But, some people have decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on the 7800.

884
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:42,636
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Pac-Man Collection.

885
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:46,961
[SPEAKER_05]: For the 7800.

886
00:59:47,021 --> 00:59:50,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the 7800 is a good system, don't get me wrong.

887
00:59:51,004 --> 01:00:01,974
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob DeCrescendo.

888
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:09,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And it includes Pac-Man, Puck-Man, Hangley-Man, which is the best name ever.

889
01:00:10,298 --> 01:00:12,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultra Pac-Man, Random Mazes Ms.

890
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:13,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, Ms.

891
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Attack and Ms.

892
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:37,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Random Mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate play options Junior Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man are both missing and it's a $30 package there is let's see there's apparently a link on AtariAge.com you can find it there

893
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,351
[SPEAKER_07]: A new Pac-Man for a system nobody plays anymore.

894
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:41,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Be still, my fleeting heart.

895
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:45,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually... Or nobody wants to play because it breaks so goddamn much.

896
01:00:45,373 --> 01:00:47,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year we did by Super Pac-Man for... Sorry, Ms.

897
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:49,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man for the 5200, the prototype.

898
01:00:49,874 --> 01:00:50,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a 5200.

899
01:00:50,274 --> 01:00:50,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

900
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:52,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love 5200.

901
01:00:52,635 --> 01:00:53,795
[SPEAKER_05]: 5200's freaking rad.

902
01:00:53,956 --> 01:00:54,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It has kicks on it.

903
01:00:58,657 --> 01:01:02,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken.

904
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:03,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's is broken.

905
01:01:04,597 --> 01:01:05,398
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but you know what?

906
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:11,902
[SPEAKER_10]: For somebody who's like an old school gaming collector type thing, they are going to be just simply amazed at this, you know?

907
01:01:11,982 --> 01:01:13,783
[SPEAKER_10]: And I kind of think... I pick it up.

908
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:16,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something like this, you know?

909
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:25,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Tease this game all you want, but just the fact that there is so much love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together, it's pretty rad.

910
01:01:25,511 --> 01:01:26,091
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty rad.

911
01:01:27,092 --> 01:01:27,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway...

912
01:01:28,635 --> 01:01:33,239
[SPEAKER_10]: What's not so rad is Nintendo having to do these programs recently.

913
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:35,221
[SPEAKER_10]: We talked about the strap thing earlier in the show.

914
01:01:35,761 --> 01:01:39,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they also, this is a full-fledged recall.

915
01:01:39,484 --> 01:01:47,951
[SPEAKER_10]: In Japan, not here, but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS Lights have been recalled overseas.

916
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:57,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do over here, so this news does not affect us here in the

917
01:01:57,694 --> 01:01:58,655
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

918
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:27,901
[SPEAKER_11]: or, you know, Xboxes causing home fires or, you know, stuff like that.

919
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:42,466
[SPEAKER_11]: But now, people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing some sort of brain damage or stuff like that.

920
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:44,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Why would people actually think this?

921
01:02:45,147 --> 01:02:51,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's like thinking that the Earth is flat or that, I don't know, that the...

922
01:02:52,791 --> 01:02:56,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Earth, or the sun revolves around the Earth, and vice versa.

923
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:00,154
[SPEAKER_11]: People are stupid.

924
01:03:00,174 --> 01:03:03,756
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why people fling remotes at the TV, because they're retarded.

925
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,037
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll believe this shit.

926
01:03:06,437 --> 01:03:07,378
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

927
01:03:08,278 --> 01:03:16,302
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, when this, that whole story with the Wii remotes, you know, them offering the extra thick strap for the Wii remote...

928
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:22,864
[SPEAKER_11]: So many people at my work came up to me and go, have you heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

929
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:28,686
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a good cross-section of the people of the United States, you know, the people I work with right here, and they're all idiots.

930
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:36,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, they just, unfortunately, they were, you know, getting the story spun by, you know, God knows what news program.

931
01:03:37,537 --> 01:03:37,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Gears of War

932
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:08,919
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's one million in the U.S.

933
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:09,279
[SPEAKER_05]: alone.

934
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:18,768
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the fastest selling next gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters.

935
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:29,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically there was an official press release put out about this just stating that

936
01:04:31,736 --> 01:04:47,500
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell, who's the corporate vice president of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation, was saying, Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title of must-have game of the year.

937
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:53,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Its phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360 is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday.

938
01:04:54,704 --> 01:05:00,547
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always had high hopes for Gears of War, but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and gamers all over the world.

939
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:02,628
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a quote from Michael Capps at Epic Games.

940
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:05,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's pretty cool.

941
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:21,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also said another fun stat on Xbox Live that the total of gameplay sessions online reached 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements.

942
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:23,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my gosh.

943
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,366
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have two of those.

944
01:05:26,886 --> 01:05:33,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Paid registrations on Xbox Live have gone over 50% more since the game has launched.

945
01:05:35,091 --> 01:05:35,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

946
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:36,692
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

947
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:40,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I know you guys have been dying to want to call into the show.

948
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:43,796
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a very interesting night tonight, to say the least.

949
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:49,099
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like our... What did we keep threatening to do last year?

950
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Were we going to do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that?

951
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:55,609
[SPEAKER_10]: It's certainly been a very interesting evening.

952
01:05:55,669 --> 01:05:59,611
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were going to want to do something that we already have a theme song, we could do, you know, Christmas in Hollis.

953
01:06:00,111 --> 01:06:01,652
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that song that Eazy-E did?

954
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:03,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Christmas in Compton?

955
01:06:04,033 --> 01:06:04,333
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

956
01:06:04,413 --> 01:06:05,533
[SPEAKER_10]: It was Christmas in Compton.

957
01:06:05,553 --> 01:06:05,774
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

958
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:09,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Run DMC did Christmas in Hollis.

959
01:06:09,455 --> 01:06:09,695
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

960
01:06:09,735 --> 01:06:13,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, anyway, we got to get to the voicemail of the week.

961
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:17,732
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got to play this real quick.

962
01:06:17,792 --> 01:06:21,533
[SPEAKER_10]: A voicemail here that was left us by a listener.

963
01:06:21,553 --> 01:06:22,973
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't get a lot of voicemails this week.

964
01:06:22,993 --> 01:06:24,314
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very disappointed.

965
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,594
[SPEAKER_10]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

966
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:27,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's stuff to give away this week, too.

967
01:06:28,075 --> 01:06:30,495
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to leave us your Sony commercial.

968
01:06:30,516 --> 01:06:34,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't know what the heck we're talking about, go to Part A. Here's the voicemail of the week.

969
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:35,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there.

970
01:06:35,857 --> 01:06:36,577
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Apollo.

971
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:41,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was just listening to last week's podcast when you guys were talking about the point system for the week.

972
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,444
[SPEAKER_12]: on downloading games.

973
01:06:43,844 --> 01:06:46,565
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wanted to note that I actually do have to pay tax.

974
01:06:46,705 --> 01:06:51,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in Nashville, Tennessee, and when I buy points online with my credit card, it does charge tax.

975
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:53,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Just thought it would be an interesting note.

976
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:54,129
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys later.

977
01:06:54,169 --> 01:06:54,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Love the show.

978
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:54,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

979
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:55,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

980
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:57,891
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have yet to really hear... Thank you for the voicemail, by the way.

981
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:07,736
[SPEAKER_10]: We have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down, because we know those of us in California aren't paying the tax on the Wii points, but now we know Tennessee, our listener here, Pennsylvania, and probably some other states are charging.

982
01:07:08,096 --> 01:07:10,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Very interesting how that's all breaking down.

983
01:07:10,757 --> 01:07:12,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whole lot said on that.

984
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a transaction.

985
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: You are paying for a service, so it's sensible.

986
01:07:18,872 --> 01:07:22,834
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, there's just a little bit of it that seems bizarre to me.

987
01:07:23,895 --> 01:07:24,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

988
01:07:24,235 --> 01:07:31,899
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd kind of be curious to know, like, do you get taxed on Xbox points, too?

989
01:07:32,399 --> 01:07:34,240
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be kind of what I'd be wondering about, so.

990
01:07:34,775 --> 01:07:36,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Paradox Vincent What's on your mind, buddy?

991
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:14,168
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky Well, I got the limited edition and I really liked that Everything that packaged together was really nice

992
01:08:33,698 --> 01:09:00,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't got a chance to watch the DVD yet because I don't have a region free but the game itself the skin for it I'd say is a great improvement over anything they've ever done and I like the fact that you can change the music when you're selecting the song my only gripe would really be the new difficulty setting but I haven't really gotten used to

993
01:09:01,223 --> 01:09:04,064
[SPEAKER_14]: to grading them by 12 instead of 8.

994
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:07,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, because that was new in Happy Sky, right?

995
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:22,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, I can only play on 7 on 2EX Red, and there was a really big gap between really easy 7 songs and really hard 7 songs.

996
01:09:22,927 --> 01:09:24,248
[SPEAKER_14]: That's about where I'm at, yep.

997
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:24,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

998
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:26,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

999
01:09:26,926 --> 01:09:31,129
[SPEAKER_14]: That's been pretty much split down between 7 and 8 difficulty now.

1000
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:35,292
[SPEAKER_14]: The song list itself, though, I was really happy with.

1001
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:47,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And my biggest complaint about the songs would be the difficulty of May and Zephyr, which were my two favorite songs.

1002
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:55,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're nearly impossible on 7Key and another.

1003
01:09:56,331 --> 01:10:00,633
[SPEAKER_14]: but on light mode they're just too easy.

1004
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:02,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1005
01:10:02,414 --> 01:10:04,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there.

1006
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:09,416
[SPEAKER_14]: In some songs there's a giant gap in difficulty.

1007
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:13,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Blue Mirage was another one of those.

1008
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Overall I was really happy with it.

1009
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:18,940
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good.

1010
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:22,082
[SPEAKER_10]: One other quick question I have for you then we've got to move on to some other calls.

1011
01:10:22,202 --> 01:10:25,443
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you say you would like to see Konami do if they put out

1012
01:10:25,999 --> 01:10:55,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Beatmania 13 or Beatmania Distorted out on the console what would you like to see them what do they need to most improve on with their next release most improve on with the next release hmm I stumped you I don't I'm yeah I'm really happy with the Beatmania system and you can't really change the note charts would you like to see an edit mode or something I don't know

1013
01:10:56,863 --> 01:11:25,747
[SPEAKER_14]: edit mode where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can key map them however you want might be interesting if they can make it work that might be interesting I'd say add something new because they have customized now they have class mode they have all these modes and I would really like to see them add some kind of new thing long long mixes might be kind of cool too

1014
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:27,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, we'll see.

1015
01:11:27,327 --> 01:11:29,548

[SPEAKER_10]: and you can call us again 877-GAME-OLR or username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

1021
01:11:47,689 --> 01:11:48,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1022
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:49,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1023
01:11:49,911 --> 01:11:53,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you know that you've pulled me away from a very important Zelda party to be here.

1024
01:11:53,895 --> 01:11:55,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, Megzy.

1025
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:56,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Long time no see.

1026
01:11:59,673 --> 01:11:59,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi!

1027
01:12:00,494 --> 01:12:00,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi!

1028
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:24,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, okay, where do I start?

1029
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:27,912
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, Nintendo makes high quality stuff.

1030
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:29,794
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't make faulty straps, I don't think.

1031
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:37,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And second, if you're throwing your Wiimote so hard that the strap's going to break, then you are abusing it in the first place.

1032
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:41,127
[SPEAKER_10]: You work at a game store, right?

1033
01:12:41,147 --> 01:12:43,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you heard customers complaining about this at all?

1034
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:52,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people, people have like come up and asked me like, so I heard that all the Wiimotes are recalled, is that true?

1035
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:55,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't heard anyone say like, my strap broke or something like that.

1036
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just a big, it's like a big game of telephone gone crazy.

1037
01:12:59,823 --> 01:13:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

1038
01:13:00,843 --> 01:13:03,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to ask this, what exactly do you do at a Zelda party?

1039
01:13:03,866 --> 01:13:05,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Without pants.

1040
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:08,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Play Zelda and play the song by System of a Down.

1041
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:11,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Without pants.

1042
01:13:12,577 --> 01:13:13,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Without pants.

1043
01:13:13,698 --> 01:13:17,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you eat, like, tortilla chips and call them Triforces?

1044
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:19,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hells yeah.

1045
01:13:21,588 --> 01:13:24,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I was curious what other little themed things you could do.

1046
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:24,972
[SPEAKER_05]: The Triforce of Dorito.

1047
01:13:24,992 --> 01:13:25,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1048
01:13:26,857 --> 01:13:27,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooler Ranch, The Wind.

1049
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:32,040
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, Megzie, since we're not doing a show next week, we wish you happy birthday on air.

1050
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

1051
01:13:33,561 --> 01:13:35,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I sang to you and you weren't there to hear it.

1052
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me to do it again?

1053
01:13:36,642 --> 01:13:36,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1054
01:13:36,962 --> 01:13:38,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it again.

1055
01:13:38,023 --> 01:13:39,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I want to hear it again.

1056
01:13:39,704 --> 01:13:43,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Megzie.

1057
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:49,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy birthday to you.

1058
01:13:52,651 --> 01:13:54,612
[SPEAKER_10]: What's going to be the party on your birthday, Megzie?

1059
01:13:54,632 --> 01:13:56,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to have a Princess Peach party or...?

1060
01:13:57,745 --> 01:14:00,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of.

1061
01:14:01,489 --> 01:14:03,712
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, then I better not elaborate on that.

1062
01:14:03,812 --> 01:14:04,934
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a family show.

1063
01:14:05,594 --> 01:14:06,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other thoughts?

1064
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:09,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other thoughts for our listeners, Megzi?

1065
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix Wright 2 should be out right now because Franziska von Karma is hot.

1066
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:17,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki says January.

1067
01:14:17,401 --> 01:14:18,161
[SPEAKER_03]: January 16th.

1068
01:14:18,181 --> 01:14:22,644
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason you put Drew in a giggle fit and he's curled up in a ball.

1069
01:14:22,704 --> 01:14:23,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you okay?

1070
01:14:24,044 --> 01:14:25,925
[SPEAKER_10]: He's gone fetal.

1071
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:28,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's headbanging on the floor.

1072
01:14:28,286 --> 01:14:29,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you ever see Screamers?

1073
01:14:29,907 --> 01:14:32,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll see you in two weeks, baby.

1074
01:14:33,089 --> 01:14:33,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'll see you then.

1075
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:36,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Maisie.

1076
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:37,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Have fun at the Zelda party.

1077
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:39,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1078
01:14:40,772 --> 01:14:41,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to another call.

1079
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:43,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:14:43,934 --> 01:14:44,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1081
01:14:48,346 --> 01:14:50,067
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry!

1082
01:14:50,087 --> 01:14:50,928
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm good.

1083
01:14:50,968 --> 01:14:55,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a little potty break while Jamie and Matt were doing some stories and I'm good now.

1084
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:18,318
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I don't know why, I was just overcome with a lot at once, so it was something else.

1085
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:20,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Better to be overcome than, sorry.

1086
01:15:23,923 --> 01:15:25,164
[SPEAKER_10]: That's debatable.

1087
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:26,885
[SPEAKER_10]: That's debatable.

1088
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:30,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, sorry Ranma, what's on your mind?

1089
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we lose him?

1090
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:34,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Is he there?

1091
01:15:34,971 --> 01:15:40,716
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to touch up on the whole thing about the brick consoles, you know, these things on the

1092
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:43,770
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, the connection's bad, Ranma.

1093
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sorry.

1094
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:48,015
[SPEAKER_01]: You're spending this much money for a system?

1095
01:15:49,777 --> 01:15:50,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1096
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:51,438
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so sorry, Ranma.

1097
01:15:51,478 --> 01:15:53,440
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't understand a damn thing you're trying to say.

1098
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,023
[SPEAKER_10]: It says something about the brick consoles.

1099
01:15:56,063 --> 01:15:56,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's speculate.

1100
01:15:56,884 --> 01:15:59,166
[SPEAKER_10]: What was Ranma trying to say about the brick consoles, you think?

1101
01:15:59,527 --> 01:16:01,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You should try to build a house out of Xbox 360s.

1102
01:16:04,482 --> 01:16:05,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven's Dolphin, how are you?

1103
01:16:05,182 --> 01:16:06,043
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not Ranma, go away!

1104
01:16:06,063 --> 01:16:06,603
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's fine.

1105
01:16:06,623 --> 01:16:07,443
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take your perspective.

1106
01:16:07,463 --> 01:16:08,043
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, dude?

1107
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:34,917
[SPEAKER_10]: You sure?

1108
01:16:35,077 --> 01:16:35,577
[SPEAKER_10]: You sure?

1109
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:36,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, what's up?

1110
01:16:36,818 --> 01:16:37,259
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to know.

1111
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:42,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to tell you, it's just been such a lovely year.

1112
01:16:43,084 --> 01:16:47,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Listening to OLR, we found you on PST Drive, September.

1113
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:49,269
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what day, but it's been great.

1114
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:55,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, you won the Wii, so you had a really good year in Orange Tops Radio-wise, didn't you?

1115
01:16:57,222 --> 01:16:57,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1116
01:16:58,243 --> 01:17:00,105
[SPEAKER_10]: What was your favorite gaming moment?

1117
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:01,726
[SPEAKER_10]: He didn't say that very convincingly.

1118
01:17:01,946 --> 01:17:03,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Bandit's telling us to hang up.

1119
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:04,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a rebuttal?

1120
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:06,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no, don't listen to the chat room.

1121
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:12,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Bandit said that I'm a quitter in chat, so Bandit can kiss my ass.

1122
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Wii was alright.

1123
01:17:14,937 --> 01:17:15,698
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1124
01:17:16,078 --> 01:17:18,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Ravensoft, what was the best gaming moment of 2006?

1125
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:23,965
[SPEAKER_02]: The best gaming moment of 2006 was actually winning that Wii.

1126
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:24,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I was

1127
01:17:25,192 --> 01:17:39,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would say your favorite moment of, oh, that's a good number one and two.

1128
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one is winning the Wii.

1129
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:43,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two is Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1131
01:17:44,202 --> 01:17:44,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1132
01:17:44,582 --> 01:17:44,883
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

1133
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:45,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1134
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:46,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1135
01:17:46,443 --> 01:17:46,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1136
01:17:47,044 --> 01:17:47,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1137
01:17:47,824 --> 01:17:48,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

01:17:48,204 --> 01:17:48,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

01:17:48,484 --> 01:17:48,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1140
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:51,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to turn around and smack you.

1141
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:52,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1142
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:52,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1143
01:17:53,007 --> 01:17:53,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob.

1144
01:17:53,988 --> 01:18:01,113
[SPEAKER_10]: With this seed money, I'm going to buy a big orange bat to clobber her with when she starts that shit.

1145
01:18:01,393 --> 01:18:04,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got one of those off eBay.

1146
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:05,555
[SPEAKER_10]: You just bought a rocket launcher?

1147
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:07,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a rocket launcher!

1148
01:18:07,897 --> 01:18:10,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's a USB rocket launcher on eBay.

1149
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:11,979
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, yes, Raven Stolfen.

1150
01:18:14,081 --> 01:18:16,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say, yeah, that is drunken rage.

1151
01:18:17,022 --> 01:18:17,943
[SPEAKER_02]: It lives on.

1152
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:23,591
[SPEAKER_10]: DMN is not even here and his tail's between his legs somewhere else.

1153
01:18:23,611 --> 01:18:24,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to say.

1154
01:18:25,972 --> 01:18:27,193
[SPEAKER_06]: He's drunk fapping on the internet.

1155
01:18:27,273 --> 01:18:28,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where he is.

1156
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:29,994
[SPEAKER_10]: He's drunk in a pod somewhere.

1157
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,915
[SPEAKER_05]: He's drunk fapping on the internet.

1158
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:34,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Raven's Dolphin, we gotta let you go to get to some more calls.

1159
01:18:34,937 --> 01:18:37,938
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it, though, and hope you have a good week.

1160
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:38,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, guys.

1161
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:40,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone else there, bye.

1162
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's go to this call.

1163
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this might be Ranma on the cell phone.

1164
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:46,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, can I even pick up another call?

1165
01:18:46,142 --> 01:18:47,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is it a little... Aw, damn it.

1166
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:49,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all right.

1167
01:18:49,484 --> 01:18:49,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, fine.

1168
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:50,525
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go to someone else.

1169
01:18:51,105 --> 01:18:52,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1170
01:18:52,105 --> 01:18:52,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1171
01:18:53,286 --> 01:18:54,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is Solar Wing.

1172
01:18:54,266 --> 01:18:55,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Solar Wing.

1173
01:18:55,027 --> 01:18:55,547
[SPEAKER_10]: What's on your mind?

1174
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Solar Wing, I'm sorry.

1175
01:18:58,448 --> 01:18:59,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said celery.

1176
01:19:01,049 --> 01:19:01,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1177
01:19:01,429 --> 01:19:02,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Celery's good for you.

1178
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:03,590
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good thing.

1179
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:05,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Solar Wing, what's on your mind?

1180
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:07,552
[SPEAKER_10]: We wish traps.

1181
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:11,774
[SPEAKER_10]: How can people even think that they would break?

1182
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:13,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because they have been.

1183
01:19:15,596 --> 01:19:16,296
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they haven't.

1184
01:19:17,801 --> 01:19:23,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're breaking, we assume.

1185
01:19:23,084 --> 01:19:24,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that they're in volition.

1186
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:27,307
[SPEAKER_10]: It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.

1187
01:19:27,607 --> 01:19:28,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1188
01:19:28,988 --> 01:19:31,610
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one.

1189
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:35,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And I tried it.

1190
01:19:36,173 --> 01:19:37,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I could not break it.

1191
01:19:38,055 --> 01:19:38,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried.

1192
01:19:38,655 --> 01:19:38,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

1193
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:43,799
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been kind of, like, ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been, like, kind of trying to break mine, and you can't.

1194
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:47,038
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how people do it.

1195
01:19:49,819 --> 01:19:53,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?

1196
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,280
[SPEAKER_10]: What kind of games do you want to get with it?

1197
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:56,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the classic Zelda.

1198
01:19:57,341 --> 01:19:59,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Elibits, I want to try that.

1199
01:20:01,022 --> 01:20:01,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Elibits is pretty fun.

1200
01:20:02,102 --> 01:20:02,563
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good game.

1201
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:06,964
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, good luck to you on your Wii quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.

1202
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:10,025
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.

1203
01:20:11,065 --> 01:20:12,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?

1204
01:20:13,846 --> 01:20:14,866
[SPEAKER_10]: Just happy holidays to you guys.

1205
01:20:15,285 --> 01:20:16,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1206
01:20:16,306 --> 01:20:16,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Same to you.

1207
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:19,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a wee under your tree.

1208
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:20,049
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be fun.

1209
01:20:20,589 --> 01:20:20,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1210
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:21,590
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1211
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:21,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

1212
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:22,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Good luck.

1213
01:20:23,132 --> 01:20:23,332
Bye.

1214
01:20:23,672 --> 01:20:23,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye-bye.

1215
01:20:24,413 --> 01:20:24,693
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1216
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:30,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.

1217
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:31,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1218
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:32,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

1219
01:20:33,340 --> 01:20:33,801
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Ron.

1220
01:20:33,861 --> 01:20:35,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I finally made it back on my cell phone.

1221
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:35,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally.

1222
01:20:36,002 --> 01:20:36,303
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1223
01:20:36,343 --> 01:20:38,144
[SPEAKER_10]: What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?

1224
01:20:39,445 --> 01:20:40,266
[SPEAKER_13]: My thing is this.

1225
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:42,588
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're spending so much money on these consoles...

1226
01:20:43,211 --> 01:20:46,872
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't kill you to drop an extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.

1227
01:20:47,372 --> 01:20:56,513
[SPEAKER_13]: That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through the rigmarole of shipping out your unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the hour.

1228
01:20:56,994 --> 01:21:00,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.

1229
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:04,395
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to be shoved down my throat.

1230
01:21:04,795 --> 01:21:09,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm one of those people that's like when somebody tells me I have to get something or I need it, I'm like, no.

1231
01:21:10,885 --> 01:21:11,785
[SPEAKER_10]: I know exactly how you mean it.

1232
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:12,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I do this for a living.

1233
01:21:12,926 --> 01:21:13,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I sell cameras and

1234
01:21:32,046 --> 01:21:36,348
[SPEAKER_13]: and laptops and stuff, I tell people about the warranty and I tell them the positives about it, you know?

1235
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:39,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I tell them, hey, you don't have to get it though, it's just a piece of mind.

1236
01:21:39,649 --> 01:21:40,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I completely understand.

1237
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:43,770
[SPEAKER_13]: I never force something like that down anyone's throat, you know?

1238
01:21:45,211 --> 01:21:52,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to you by your management and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?

1239
01:21:54,635 --> 01:22:01,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own personal experience is because I've been doing this for a very long time.

1240
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:02,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair enough, fair enough.

1241
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but you know, I don't know.

1242
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:04,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1243
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:08,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kind of finding the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's faulty, it's going to break in the first few days.

1244
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:14,579
[SPEAKER_10]: But I can understand why people are about the extended warranty, but I don't know.

1245
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:17,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.

1246
01:22:19,942 --> 01:22:22,604
[SPEAKER_13]: And to Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?

1247
01:22:22,624 --> 01:22:25,806
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.

1248
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:31,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he says it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will, you know.

1249
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:31,620
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1250
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:35,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Ranma, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling us back.

1251
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:36,421
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1252
01:22:36,521 --> 01:22:37,121
[SPEAKER_13]: No problem.

1253
01:22:37,141 --> 01:22:37,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Happy holidays.

1254
01:22:38,921 --> 01:22:39,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1255
01:22:39,182 --> 01:22:40,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have something for Ranma?

1256
01:22:40,462 --> 01:22:40,622
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1257
01:22:40,942 --> 01:22:41,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, all right.

1258
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:41,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye, Ranma.

1259
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:42,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Ranchan.

1260
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:44,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you when you're here in town.

1261
01:22:44,823 --> 01:22:45,663
[SPEAKER_10]: She'll give it to you later.

1262
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not like that.

1263
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:56,845
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have something to play for people because this is what's on my mind about work tomorrow.

1264
01:23:01,229 --> 01:23:03,390
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.

1265
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:05,170
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

1266
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,110
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people do.

1267
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,291
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people do, I'm sure.

1268
01:23:07,351 --> 01:23:07,771
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1269
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,212
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I get it, but I had to have it explained to me.

1270
01:23:10,572 --> 01:23:10,892
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1271
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:14,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories, boys and girls.

1272
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:17,273
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a story.

1273
01:23:18,574 --> 01:23:18,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1274
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:23,195
[SPEAKER_05]: My story has to do with a baseball player.

1275
01:23:24,896 --> 01:23:29,197
[SPEAKER_05]: The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaia, was...

1276
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:31,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1277
01:24:00,482 --> 01:24:05,806
[SPEAKER_05]: He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.

1278
01:24:06,746 --> 01:24:08,908
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I just thought it was funny.

1279
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:12,930
[SPEAKER_05]: That was pretty funny.

1280
01:24:13,911 --> 01:24:15,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1281
01:24:15,872 --> 01:24:16,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I have one.

1282
01:24:17,093 --> 01:24:18,334
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to piss people off.

1283
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:29,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So, with Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan, being one of the first online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.

1284
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:30,237
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1285
01:24:51,224 --> 01:24:56,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it says the problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.

1286
01:24:56,508 --> 01:25:00,110
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.

1287
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:02,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?

1288
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:07,556
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.

1289
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:15,070
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole, you know, people afraid about their kids, you know, whatever.

1290
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:23,234
[SPEAKER_10]: But seriously, it's simple enough that, like, both people have to have each other listed before they can even communicate with each other.

1291
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:24,455
[SPEAKER_10]: That's effective enough.

1292
01:25:24,635 --> 01:25:25,335
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

1293
01:25:25,816 --> 01:25:28,937
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no need for this, you know, 5,000 friend code stuff.

1294
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:30,058
[SPEAKER_10]: That's horrible.

1295
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:34,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?

1296
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:35,781
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because, I mean...

1297
01:25:36,224 --> 01:25:38,186
[SPEAKER_11]: After all, they launched a new next-gen system.

1298
01:25:38,206 --> 01:25:39,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Where's that report coming from?

1299
01:25:39,688 --> 01:25:43,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Four Color Rebellion, which they're pretty... That's a respectable source.

1300
01:25:43,452 --> 01:25:44,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man, that's horrible.

1301
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:56,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so... And the other thing, too, this is actually Four Color Rebellion's reporting IGN articles, so... That's even better.

1302
01:25:56,706 --> 01:25:56,867
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

1303
01:25:58,841 --> 01:25:59,782
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't get it, do they?

1304
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:01,323
[SPEAKER_11]: They just don't get the online.

1305
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

1306
01:26:03,244 --> 01:26:06,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.

1307
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:08,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody's going to call Nintendo the carpet over this one.

1308
01:26:09,429 --> 01:26:11,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, because this is ridiculous.

1309
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,511
[SPEAKER_11]: This whole friend code crap.

1310
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:15,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?

1311
01:26:15,993 --> 01:26:22,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send memes to each other, which, you know, only support one game so far?

1312
01:26:23,559 --> 01:26:23,679
[SPEAKER_11]: It's...

1313
01:26:24,841 --> 01:26:25,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Very disappointing.

1314
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:28,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Xbox really gets it in the online world.

1315
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:28,463
[SPEAKER_10]: They do.

1316
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:29,004
[SPEAKER_11]: They do.

1317
01:26:29,104 --> 01:26:29,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?

1318
01:26:31,345 --> 01:26:34,887
[SPEAKER_11]: They, of course, aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't.

1319
01:26:34,907 --> 01:26:37,369
[SPEAKER_11]: But, of course, there is no service to charge for.

1320
01:26:37,449 --> 01:26:40,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just very disappointed.

1321
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:40,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Me too.

1322
01:26:41,311 --> 01:26:43,052
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a bad thing to end on.

1323
01:26:43,092 --> 01:26:45,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.

1324
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:46,574
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1325
01:26:47,194 --> 01:26:49,096
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a heck of a thing to have as a last-minute story.

1326
01:26:49,796 --> 01:26:51,277
[SPEAKER_10]: That must have been just late-breaking, huh?

1327
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:54,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Was this just posted a little while ago or before we... I think it's today.

1328
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:55,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

1329
01:26:56,295 --> 01:26:56,636
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1330
01:26:56,696 --> 01:27:00,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, damn, that's the end of the show.

1331
01:27:00,938 --> 01:27:03,379
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1332
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:09,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.

1333
01:27:10,322 --> 01:27:11,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Really appreciate it a lot.

1334
01:27:12,063 --> 01:27:13,864
[SPEAKER_10]: And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

1335
01:27:14,184 --> 01:27:14,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, me first?

1336
01:27:15,225 --> 01:27:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1337
01:27:17,686 --> 01:27:18,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy holidays.

1338
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:19,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everyone has fun.

1339
01:27:21,032 --> 01:27:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so we're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.

1340
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:32,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Cute, that'll be fun.

1341
01:27:33,042 --> 01:27:35,524
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, you know, have fun, but not too much fun.

1342
01:27:36,645 --> 01:27:39,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be basically, ah, ah, you know.

1343
01:27:39,928 --> 01:27:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.

1344
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:44,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.

1345
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:47,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry you didn't get to participate in Part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.

1346
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Any final thoughts?

1347
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:52,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I didn't know I was invited.

1348
01:27:54,253 --> 01:27:55,453
[SPEAKER_10]: You can come whenever, it's fine.

1349
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:56,853
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm flattered.

1350
01:27:58,694 --> 01:28:00,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.

1351
01:28:00,834 --> 01:28:02,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Loki, your final thought?

1352
01:28:04,895 --> 01:28:09,416
[SPEAKER_11]: My final thought is I gotta return Far Cry, I'm thinking it's gonna suck.

1353
01:28:11,477 --> 01:28:13,417
[SPEAKER_10]: My final thought is Banana Muffin.

1354
01:28:15,178 --> 01:28:16,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Sakura, your final thought?

1355
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I was told one more.

1356
01:28:25,818 --> 01:28:27,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject false icons, bitches.

1357
01:28:30,762 --> 01:28:31,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I take that back.

1358
01:28:31,283 --> 01:28:33,784
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the best Far Cry Vengeance trailer.

1359
01:28:33,885 --> 01:28:35,165
[SPEAKER_11]: Jane has a rabbit in it.

1360
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:36,566
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, and.

1361
01:28:36,707 --> 01:28:36,887
[SPEAKER_11]: And?

1362
01:28:37,267 --> 01:28:38,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, Chris is awesome.

1363
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:39,769
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1364
01:28:40,169 --> 01:28:40,529
You're welcome.

1365
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:42,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you guys, I agree, I agree.

1366
01:28:42,811 --> 01:28:49,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, what's January 7th of 2007.

1367
01:28:50,953 --> 01:28:52,034
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1368
01:29:19,042 --> 01:29:20,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a great night, everybody.
