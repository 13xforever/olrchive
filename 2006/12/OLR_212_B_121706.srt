00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,400
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,800
This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B,

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,040
the last live segment of 2006.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,280
We'll still have some more stuff going to our audio archive, podcast, audio RSS, whatever

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
you call it.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,760
We'll still have some more audio going there.

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,240
We are going to bring you some specials for Christmas week and New Year's week, but since

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,760
Sunday our live night happens to be Christmas eve and New Year's eve, we're going to be

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,720
taking a couple weeks off from live.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,300
And I'll tell you what, for those of you guys that don't listen live, you missed a great

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,220
live only segment this week because we've got to do some special stuff for our live

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,120
listeners where we just had an amazing gift exchange and we were just all high on the

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,800
love in the studio and just gushing, so it was an amazing time.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,080
You can catch it on all games radio though.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
They get access to the live part too and that airs our rebroadcast Monday at 5 o'clock Pacific

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,520
Standard Time on allgames.com and then Tuesday I believe only one time at 9 o'clock because

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,840
we're so freaking long that they can only afford to air it one time.

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,680
Let's get back into some gaming news because our live listeners have been waiting a while

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,900
for us to get back into some gaming news.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,260
This was a huge story this week.

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,420
The Nintendo Wii Mote, now I got some email messages and some text messages and phones

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,980
from listeners and people going, did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,080
Somebody hit a panic button, so I want to clarify right now, the Wiis were not recalled.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,400
I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,040
What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps which

26
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,420
are six tenths of a millimeter in diameter for a new beefed up strap that is one millimeter

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,480
in diameter.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,620
This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,660
breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.

30
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,740
You've probably seen that site, wehaveaproblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up

31
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
there.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,340
I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo tested them, they withstand about 50 pounds

33
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,340
of pressure.

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,920
So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,420
that should be applied to these things.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,980
So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they are offering this program

37
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,420
for anybody who has a concern.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,660
I've been playing the Wii for a long time, I can't imagine how that thing would break.

39
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,820
If it was starting to break, I think I'd be able to tell pretty quickly.

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,260
So people have really got to be going crazy.

41
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,460
So let me ask a couple questions here first and a lot of questions people have been asking

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,160
themselves this week.

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,020
These people that have the broken Wii straps, are they doing something wrong?

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,200
Is it a fluke?

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
What's the issue?

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Mass stupidity.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Think across the board, you don't think there's flukes out there?

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,680
There may be very few if any.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,380
I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to

50
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,860
swing this just like a baseball bat.

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,260
I'm going to backhand this this way.

52
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.

53
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,220
The thing is, is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii

54
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,620
sports games or any of the others.

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,300
These people are basically using the system in a way other than, I think, intent because

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,420
there was even a warning put out for using the Wii mote.

57
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,420
If you give me a moment, I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal,

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,500
except she replaced Wii with penis.

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,660
They basically need to just, you know, calm down.

60
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,140
They're really kind of swinging the remote really fast.

61
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,580
I saw a video of one that went through like a wall or something like that because and

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,140
they were showing how they were playing with it.

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,620
The guy was like throwing like he was doing like a professional baseball toss or something.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,900
Question number two, would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional

65
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,640
videos we've seen from the Wii because Nintendo kind of says one thing that you don't need

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,060
to move the Wii mote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting

67
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,940
into it when it's like on the news and everything.

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,260
Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,100
Even though they may be flailing around like looking like complete idiots, they are not

70
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,860
doing it uncontrollably.

71
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,420
I mean, when they're showing them, you know, diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii

72
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,700
test, they're not swinging super hard.

73
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,660
They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.

74
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,620
Okay, here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.

75
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,080
Safety information for playing Wii.

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,220
As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii remote, we would like you to

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,100
take a few minutes to review some important safety information, which when followed will

78
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,540
help ensure a fun playing experience for all.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,180
One, wear the wrist strap.

80
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,840
Make sure that all players using the Wii remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has

81
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,300
been tightened using the strap lock.

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,880
When sharing the Wii remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,280
Wii remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.

84
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii remote from flying across the room

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,540
if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.

86
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,260
Now the second part is the important one.

87
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,740
Two, hold the Wii remote firmly and do not let go.

88
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,020
Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii remote during

89
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,540
gameplay and do not use excessive motion.

90
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,620
For example, in Wii sports bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,860
to release the B button on the Wii remote.

92
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,380
Do not let go of the Wii remote itself in bold letters.

93
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,700
If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.

94
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,460
If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii remote, the wrist strap may break

95
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,460
and you could lose control of the Wii remote.

96
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,600
This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,920
They said this in their warning.

98
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,720
You people are stupid!

99
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,040
Okay, interesting comments from chat, I want to say here.

100
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,240
BearWhoDriveCars says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,420
stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.

102
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,420
By the way, I love that nickname.

103
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Well, the thing...

104
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,760
Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangetonsradio.com.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,520
Airtoast says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.

106
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Interesting thought.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,440
It wouldn't have been any good if people were letting go of it anyway.

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,160
The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically, you're dealing

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,240
with basic laws of physics.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,960
You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,200
Darkknight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt happy fun Wiimote.

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Winner.

113
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,240
Question number three, will Nintendo get sued over this?

114
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
No.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes.

116
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Yes, they will.

117
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,760
And they will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.

118
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Amen.

119
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,960
No, okay.

120
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Will they attempt to get sued?

121
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,960
No.

122
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
Will it go through?

123
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
No.

124
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Okay, having taken business law...

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,400
Hold on, I'm getting Dark Sakura's soapbox, let's see, I'm going to pull it out of the

126
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
closet here.

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,840
Hey, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.

128
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,760
Anyway, the whole, all right, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,960
a while back in Oklahoma, and you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,680
There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker, and it said, do not

131
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,040
allow small children within so many feet of it.

132
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Well, the little kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped

133
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,340
off with a weed whacker when it recoiled off a rock.

134
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,720
Not a default in the object itself, but the company still got sued and they won.

135
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,120
The thing is, is that with any type of material object, any type of device, where Nintendo

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,240
is going to have to prove is that the device is being used improperly.

137
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,760
That enough warning was given for proper use of the system for them to have a defense against.

138
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,120
If Nintendo did not provide enough anti-stupidity warnings, because keep in mind, like Bill

139
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Engvall says, the reason why we have warnings on everything is because stupid people have

140
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,880
done it.

141
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,600
Legend of Zaku in Chat says, Tack Jomson says, Wiimote is a murder simulator.

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
Fuck simulating, dude, you'll throw it through someone's head, actual murder.

143
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,800
I think there was a YouTube video of that.

144
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,680
Anyway, we welcome your thoughts on that, Bill.

145
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,720
To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.

146
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,800
Nintendo's duty of responsibility is to make the warning available.

147
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,840
I'd like to mention though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about,

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:00,360
you know, federal government agencies looking into this, and apparently there have been

149
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:09,040
recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
That is it.

151
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,880
I mean, this isn't like killing people.

152
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,200
This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV, you know, I caused

153
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,080
a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week, I mean, just stupid shit like that.

154
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
I just want to say this real quick.

155
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,160
I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.

156
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,100
Funny Dale in our chat room says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering

157
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,800
a recall, and then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's

158
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
a problem.

159
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Well, they didn't, it's a gray area, they didn't admit there's a problem per se.

160
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,640
I see this as a cover your ass, I think it's a cover your ass, I think.

161
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,200
It's the same thing with, remember the Pokémon toys that Burger King was putting out, and

162
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,160
the babies were suffocating on the ball, when it clearly said, do not let anyone under three

163
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
years of age have a Poké Ball?

164
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
Or they might get trapped inside.

165
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,800
The duty of responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,280
Babymon, I choose you!

167
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:08,080
But hey, but it is a likely thing, babies will put stuff in their mouths.

168
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,840
They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.

169
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,640
So it was really the parents' responsibility, but Burger King still recalled the Poké Balls,

170
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,880
so that they would not be held further liable for damages.

171
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,880
And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.

172
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,400
Now here's the thing I have to ask you.

173
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,880
We have to keep it moving after this comment.

174
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Okay, if, like for example, if I have a baseball bat, and I throw the baseball bat and it hits

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,880
someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.

176
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,640
I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company for the injury caused by that baseball

177
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
bat.

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Same thing goes with the Wiimote.

179
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,040
I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,360
your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself, because you're an idiot.

181
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,360
It's as simple as that.

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,800
Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on

183
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,200
the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.

184
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,480
A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes, as the case

185
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,880
would be with one that was posted here on Joystiq showing how easily it can be done.

186
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,520
And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.

187
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw

188
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,920
you, you're not helping.

189
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,320
I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,600
I mean, what, I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills, and if you say

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
on it it's a fake or whatever, you know, then fine, you know, have fun with your Photoshop

192
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,720
abilities.

193
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,680
But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously,

194
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
screw you.

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Because you're not helping.

196
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
You're the same people who are the stupid, lame people who sell PS3s.

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,680
Why don't you make a sign that says, pay attention to me?

198
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Anyway.

199
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
Flip side of the argument is...

200
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,400
Oh, by the way, audio archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment, because

201
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
they don't know you're here yet.

202
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
So hi, Drew Nami.

203
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,040
Flip side of the argument is, okay, they're showing how easily it can be Photoshopped,

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,880
showing how easily the people who are bringing it to court could be faking it with quote

205
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,360
unquote photographic evidence.

206
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Oh, yeah, I don't have a problem with the demonstration.

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
There could be a public service in that way.

208
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't, I don't, I don't mind that.

209
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,440
I don't mind when they're saying, hey, look, look how easily this can be faked.

210
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,660
I mind the people that are trying to pass off the fake things as real.

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,880
That's what I mind.

212
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:35,520
They're the same people, they are in the same category as people who sell PS3s on eBay.

213
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
We can't go back to that subject.

214
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
We'll be here all night.

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
All right.

216
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Well, how about some good news?

217
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Yes, please.

218
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,800
Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,280
Please say Kid Icarus.

220
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Not yet.

221
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Guardian Legend.

222
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Crystalis.

223
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
Blaster Master.

224
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Bible Adventure.

225
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
No.

226
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,800
Street Fighter II is, the World Warrior is going to be heading to, Capcom finally loves

227
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
us.

228
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Another, though.

229
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,600
But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.

230
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
Yeah.

231
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
So what?

232
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,800
But a number of other games are going to be coming.

233
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,120
There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch Out, and hey Rob, Kid Icarus.

234
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
Fuck yes.

235
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Thank you.

236
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,320
So, but Capcom is starting to eke him out.

237
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
We love you, Capcom.

238
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Sort of.

239
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Leave my phone.

240
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,520
Hold on a minute.

241
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,240
If Street Fighter II comes out on virtual console, this will cost me eight dollars,

242
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
yes?

243
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Yeah.

244
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Could I not for two dollars more get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,580
Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?

246
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,000
What if you don't own an Xbox?

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,960
But that would be the only reason you should get this then.

249
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,680
Because if you have an Xbox- Not everybody is in the same financial bracket

250
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,440
or nerdom as us.

251
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
No, I understand that.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's fine.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm just saying, if you're in the- Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.

254
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,920
You have them both, okay?

255
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,000
Seriously.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why would you buy this?

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why not?

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why not?

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,160
Well, because you have a better version for two dollars more on the 360.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Rob.

261
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
What?

262
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
I have it on MAME.

263
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
I have it on the Genesis.

264
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,920
Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.

265
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,560
I have it on the fucking Saturn.

266
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,600
And you'll buy this on virtual console?

267
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Probably.

268
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
You sad, sad woman.

269
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Rob.

270
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Why would you buy Metal Slug?

271
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I don't really.

272
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,360
Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?

273
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,080
I have Metal Slug on Wii.

274
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,600
I hope- Why would people buy horse turds?

275
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Because they like the PlayStation 3.

276
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
Because they're large and smelly.

277
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Because they like to beat them to their dogs.

278
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Seriously.

279
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Hey, Chaz, you want some ice for that burn?

280
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Anyways.

281
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Seriously.

282
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
All right.

283
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,720
Well, I hope that game comes out soon.

284
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,560
Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,240
on another Zelda title for the Wii.

286
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,800
This one that they were making on GameCube was just going on and stuff, but this whole

287
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,880
time since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back

288
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,480
and made the Wii Hansmans or whatever you want to call it.

289
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,200
This all- It really does look like a GameCube game on

290
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
the Wii.

291
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,440
Well, that there is another Zelda game possibly sooner than you might think.

292
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,320
This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnezine.

293
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Very interesting.

294
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,040
I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.

295
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,620
I like the way it looked.

296
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,680
The cel shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't

297
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,160
really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to

298
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,480
go to make a really good-looking game.

299
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Hope for that.

300
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,080
Now, I mentioned I think a few weeks ago that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but

301
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,760
of course, if you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that,

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:08,200
you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit WirelessSensorBar.com,

303
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,040
and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt

304
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
battery.

305
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:23,860
It can give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play, so interesting if you have a projection screen

306
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,680
set up for your Wii, definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than

307
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,800
the cord there, so that might be the way to go.

308
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:39,040
Or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy.

309
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,120
Speaking of other things for the Wii, now this makes me particularly happy.

310
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,080
It's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii, and for anyone who doesn't know,

311
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,960
the freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on

312
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,680
your system.

313
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,040
I've got one for my GameCube, fabulous thing, I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul

314
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:12,400
Calibur thanks to that, and I have not yet tried my freeloader on the Wii, because our

315
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,260
Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house, but they don't

316
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,820
have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is,

317
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:42,560
I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games,

318
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,880
because you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did, but one way or another, Europe

319
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,360
has sold a lot of Wii's, you know, it just recently launched over there this past week,

320
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:59,020
and they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days, and of course, just like here in the US, Zelda

321
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,420
Twilight Princess, being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying

322
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:11,340
off shelves at the retail price of 179 pounds, by the way, that's $350 US, and considering

323
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,880
we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas

324
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,180
getting screwed a little bit on the price point, sorry guys, don't know what to tell

325
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
you.

326
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,900
So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii, I know people that might not

327
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:34,560
have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter,

328
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:41,140
but fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB ethernet

329
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:50,460
device with, from actual, like Newegg, they're selling one for $19.99, and it's an ethernet

330
00:18:50,460 --> 00:19:00,580
adapter that you can buy, it's Kinemax USB 2.0 to RJ45 fast ethernet 10-100 base T network

331
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,140
adapter, that's a pretty long name there, but at least that's going to be out now, whereas

332
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,740
the USB one from Nintendo probably won't be out until next year, so if you need wired

333
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,740
internet, that's the way to go.

334
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,180
I thought my friend had this whole thing already, like the Nintendo already had this stuff out

335
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,940
on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?

336
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,540
Well, that's the Wi-Fi Max, that's that USB thing for wireless internet, this actually

337
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,500
plugs into your Wii, and converts one of the USB ports to an ethernet port.

338
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,280
Oh, okay, I get it, so it works the other way, instead of plugging it into your computer,

339
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,940
you plug it into the Wii, I get it.

340
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,100
Well, this is not for a wireless internet, this is wired internet, it's just a converter.

341
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,660
Does it work if you have a USB router?

342
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,060
I don't know, that's a good question.

343
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,020
Try it, find out.

344
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,180
Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email, because we

345
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,140
like to read emails every week here on this program.

346
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:04,060
One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lawns Radio is that it's not just

347
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,100
us, because we're just some people on the internet just like you, and we know you have

348
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,860
an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and

349
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,580
one of those is the mailbag.

350
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,700
Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of her favorite emails

351
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,660
and shares them with you in our little segment we call the mailbag.

352
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

353
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:30,180
First email comes from our friend AZHP.

354
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,980
Hey, OLR, I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called the

355
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,700
year ahead in tech by some research analysts, a choice quote from it.

356
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,460
Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.

357
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,380
I should tell that to my co-workers.

358
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,660
Please do.

359
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,500
Sony will end up with egg on its face as Konami releases a Metal Gear game.

360
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,100
I only coveted Sony Playstation exclusive on the Microsoft Xbox 360.

361
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,420
Sony will also dramatically cut the price of its PSP handheld as a result of the constant

362
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,940
beating administered by the Nintendo DS Lite.

363
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:11,640
Microsoft will either cut or even completely eliminate the cost of its Xbox Live Gold online

364
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,540
gaming service.

365
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,940
So that was the quote.

366
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,220
I would actually believe that.

367
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,020
How do people this stupid get jobs?

368
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,220
I would believe it.

369
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,780
Well, let me finish reading.

370
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,180
Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot

371
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
this guy is.

372
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,860
I would myself, but the email would get too long.

373
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:35,420
Your show is now some of it.

374
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,260
I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.

375
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,660
However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii, on a Wii game coming up, I have a

376
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,380
feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii or a game in the metal in the Metal

377
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
Gear family.

378
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,940
I get the sense that Konami is willing to risk something on every platform.

379
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,500
So I think it will be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear

380
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,180
thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami

381
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,220
and some of the other big publishers.

382
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,460
In regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down that they would make online competitive

383
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,440
play free for everyone, that's actually come up before speculation-wise.

384
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,660
So this person is actually not saying anything new.

385
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,340
This whole thing started when gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier,

386
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,900
and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star universe beta.

387
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,660
Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different

388
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,900
direction for a while now.

389
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,580
So that's nothing new, actually.

390
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,420
I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially

391
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,100
if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these Xbox Live kits and stuff and now

392
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,700
you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.

393
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,980
I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining

394
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,740
the bandwidth.

395
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,060
I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for, so I think

396
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,660
the competitive play is going to stay on gold and you're still going to have to pay for

397
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
it.

398
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,020
You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three

399
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,620
months and then it's free afterwards.

400
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,980
That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?

401
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,700
I don't think it would work, not in the long run.

402
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,180
These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.

403
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
They are.

404
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,720
However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver

405
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
and silver.

406
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,980
That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.

407
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,500
They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there, why the hell not?

408
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,660
It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.

409
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,820
Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind

410
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,820
of game.

411
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,060
You just buy the game.

412
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Yeah.

413
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,460
I wish it had more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.

414
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,740
There's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you

415
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,060
don't have to pay some monthly fee for and I think a lot of people would be looking for

416
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:57,060
something like that.

417
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:38,460
I

418
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,580
was thinking about this whole PS3 versus Wii thing everyone is going off about and how

419
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:47,260
Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.

420
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
Too true.

421
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,820
Well, I have an analogy, an analogy also has the word anal in it.

422
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,940
Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo Generations.

423
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.

424
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,580
Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader

425
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,420
except better.

426
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,580
Everyone knew what Nintendo was.

427
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,540
Well, after those generations look at Nintendo now, they aren't exactly cheerleader worthy

428
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,580
anymore even though this could change this generation.

429
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,700
Could the same thing happen to Sony?

430
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,620
Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.

431
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,080
Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his bot

432
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,580
the death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?

433
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,460
He doesn't understand.

434
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:39,780
I could kick his ass at any day and he knows it so there's no problem there.

435
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,380
I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit just like Nintendo's did

436
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,140
after the Super Nintendo, they are already freaking headed that way.

437
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,860
So what do the world famous hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, www.orangetownsradio.com, think

438
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,860
of this.

439
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,220
PS, put an M in the middle of the PS and that's what Rob is going through right now, oh snap

440
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,220
for reals.

441
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
PMS3?

442
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,580
Is that like some advanced form of PMS?

443
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,780
Like it's mute to elbow.

444
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
Jiranami says it's PMS Beyond.

445
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Alright, anyway.

446
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
It's UPMS.

447
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
We built PMS.

448
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:18,740
Yeah, but I think that Sony is already heading down the pooper.

449
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,860
In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons.

450
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,500
Just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?

451
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,060
And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when when we were doing the separate

452
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,020
program one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360 people were comparing it to Dreamcast

453
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,620
and I think the 360 is showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast so

454
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,940
it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence and one

455
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:48,740
could say that Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo

456
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,300
64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge based and didn't go

457
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,240
on to the CD and all that stuff and one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake

458
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,940
here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat but it's still too soon to tell.

459
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,700
The war ain't over yet, like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one so you

460
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,500
never know what games might come out next year.

461
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:23,260
I actually liked Blu-ray but I liked Betamax too and what happened to that, bastards?

462
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,460
And you know what's funny, price aside, UMD's not bad either, price aside, that's the one

463
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
problem I have with UMD.

464
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:37,100
But now you go to Tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.

465
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,260
Next one comes up from Misty, hey everyone, what's up, Misty here, thanks to the Podlines

466
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,180
service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th St. Louis

467
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,700
time of course because I was up anyway.

468
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,740
Like usual on my days off from work I slept quite late, amen to that, I made it to the

469
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,300
library before dark but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading

470
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,620
the podcasts and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's

471
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,300
no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.

472
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,060
Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again, with a combination of the game center,

473
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,780
the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online, heck

474
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,120
I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.

475
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,540
With that gone though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little

476
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,660
time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.

477
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,260
That tends to get me out at about midnight or 1am depending on the day, being too wired

478
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,960
for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late

479
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,620
as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.

480
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,900
I can sympathize with that.

481
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:47,420
I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime

482
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,140
convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.

483
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
Aren't you going to ASUN?

484
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,140
Me?

485
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Yeah.

486
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Yes I am.

487
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
Chris will be at ASUN.

488
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,140
I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio.

489
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Sweet.

490
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,260
She's going to have some promo cards.

491
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,260
In April we'll talk.

492
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
Absolutely.

493
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,980
Well, that's where the rest of this is where this email is heading.

494
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,580
That reminds me, the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening

495
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,340
to, from Podlines from my cell phone.

496
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,800
I know this may be a stupid idea, but what the hell, I'm going to say it, why not come

497
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,700
to ASUN and do a panel or something?

498
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,580
I know the timing is not the best considering it's so soon after SakuraCon and halfway across

499
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,380
the country, but at least my conscience is clear on the subject.

500
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,940
Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing because remember, we don't get paid for doing

501
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:34,340
this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing

502
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
houses do.

503
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Hey, folks who run ASUN, send me a ticket.

504
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,420
I'll come out and do a panel.

505
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,300
But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart because she's already going for

506
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,980
other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.

507
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,100
I will go there and I will hand out lots of flyers.

508
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,820
Actually I was thinking, I was going to ask you guys permission if I could get a shirt

509
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
that said OLR on it.

510
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Of course.

511
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,820
I could go around and people will know who I am.

512
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Hopefully by that time next year, we'll have official shirts.

513
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,540
That's been an on and off again topic.

514
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,220
And I'm going to be doing interviews and stuff like that because I really...

515
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,220
Just look for the blue hair.

516
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Look for the blue hair.

517
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,100
Yeah, I will have blue streaks in my hair, so I've got to have brown and powder blue

518
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
hair.

519
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,820
By the way, I also want to mention that what Misty refers to the Podline service is... Now

520
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,100
we don't support this.

521
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,700
This is another organization, but I will give it a shout out.

522
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,740
Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio over the telephone

523
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:28,080
by calling this number, one for long distance, area code 650-523-6855.

524
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,540
Keep in mind that's not an official endorsement of the service.

525
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,840
We don't know much about them.

526
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,180
All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone,

527
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,420
so use at your own risk.

528
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,700
It's Podlines.net, but it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks

529
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,420
who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that where they can't listen to the show on

530
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:52,240
the go is easier, access to a computer 24-7, so that's kind of neat.

531
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,340
This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard,

532
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,340
but I'll read it anyway.

533
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,340
You're getting drunk.

534
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Dude, I'm drunk.

535
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,960
I love you, Rob.

536
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
My girlfriend love you too.

537
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Seriously, DMN?

538
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
That man needs a cookie.

539
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,060
DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself into AA, okay?

540
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,060
That's all I have to say.

541
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,980
And like Britney Spears, put some panties on.

542
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,260
Yes, please DMN, put some panties on.

543
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,900
That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.

544
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,300
Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show, plug, plug, plug.

545
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,940
Thank you.

546
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,340
Anyway, this one comes from Michael, long time listener, first time emailer.

547
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,700
I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style and

548
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,460
the vocal mix you played sometime is fantastic.

549
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,980
However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.

550
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,620
I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate here.

551
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,740
Any chance you could help?

552
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:02,780
There is a Vincent de Mor compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, what's the other

553
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,780
crap?

554
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,300
Fly Away.

555
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,300
All of those on it.

556
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,460
Some of the dance manias do.

557
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,300
So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.

558
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:17,460
Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday

559
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,700
night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up, but I didn't say that.

560
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,100
No, but seriously though, if you do, and we would encourage that you get the originals,

561
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,580
go CD Japan, go to some of the, in fact, I remember seeing on one of the TransNation

562
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
CDs.

563
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:42,260
I think it was the TransNation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition, has quite a number of

564
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,580
really good trance stuff on it and one of them is Flotation.

565
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,860
Was it Flotation or was it Fly Away?

566
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,380
The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.

567
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,500
I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car.

568
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,460
And the last one- No, wait, God damn it, Rob left the room.

569
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,860
Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.

570
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:12,140
This actually was sent to us by our friend, Rob, with two Bs.

571
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,820
It was a story from a blog that he sent us that-

572
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:28,780
Sorry, this won't make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout

573
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,340
errors on our end and I don't know if that's live 365 or our fault, so I was just saying

574
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,340
in studio if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled because

575
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,340
I don't know what's going on.

576
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,260
It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.

577
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,980
I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us because it sends me several.

578
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,660
Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.

579
00:33:47,660 --> 00:34:01,580
Gama Sutra posted a story about Activision, it's the NIMF e-grade given to a ESRB, and

580
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,060
let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.

581
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,820
Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB, so basically, and it's a really

582
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,060
good article and I'm gonna link it in the chat room, but basically parents support the

583
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:21,220
ESRB, they think it's a good idea, certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think,

584
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,740
makes it easier for them to be able to judge what their children are playing, I think it's

585
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
a good idea.

586
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:35,620
Now, this last one is interesting, I'm going to read it and Rob has to pay attention.

587
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,940
Maybe I should let Chris read it.

588
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,940
No.

589
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
Okay.

590
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,100
The whole point was for you to read it, dammit.

591
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,860
This was sent to us by Chris.

592
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Hi.

593
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,540
Hi guys, it's me, Chris.

594
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,860
I'm a big lesbian, I did not say that.

595
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,380
It's true, but I didn't say that.

596
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,580
People sure attract some weirdos.

597
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,860
Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, writing in a sleigh, he asked me

598
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,220
to send you this email.

599
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,500
Dear OLR crew, you wrote ORL?

600
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
It was the guy.

601
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Yeah.

602
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,900
On your laptop.

603
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Good evening, OLR.

604
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,980
Oh, and good evening, chat room.

605
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,620
I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.

606
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,620
It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room, that they detected

607
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,620
a strange anomaly.

608
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,580
It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in, all for your radio show, hoping for the

609
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,260
best in the new year.

610
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,900
This had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.

611
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,100
After a while it came to me, I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift

612
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:48,300
that I hope will be of use to help your show.

613
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,860
From the wishes of the chat room, to the wishes of the message board, to the wishes of the

614
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,420
listeners not known, all have a very special gift for you.

615
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,900
To Sky Loki and Dark Sakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year.

616
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,700
From SCPS, I left the gift with a strange blue haired girl.

617
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,820
She should be handing it to you right now.

618
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,380
And you have to open it.

619
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,940
Oh my.

620
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,900
People attract the weirdest of guys.

621
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,900
Oh my.

622
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,900
That's old.

623
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,300
That's Rob that attracted me.

624
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,140
You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air, and I said,

625
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
was he hot?

626
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,260
That's the question I asked.

627
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,080
Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show, and the first question

628
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,580
I go, was he hot?

629
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,420
No, you like old dudes?

630
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,540
Am I okay to open this?

631
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,060
It's an envelope, two O-L-R from Santa and the fans.

632
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,020
Oh, I licked it, sorry.

633
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,020
Do you have an oil fixation?

634
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,020
Yeah.

635
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
No, really.

636
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
Hurry up, Rob.

637
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
I'm trying.

638
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,020
I don't want to ruin it.

639
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
No, no, no, no.

640
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Yes, please.

641
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.

642
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:22,180
Chris, I- I didn't do it, Santa did.

643
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,660
I'm just not paying attention to anything, I'm actually looking.

644
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:33,580
I don't know what to say, I'm- Wow, that old guy was cool.

645
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,580
Are you sure?

646
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:49,980
I don't know what to say, I'm- This is embarrassing, in a way.

647
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,800
Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their

648
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,800
bodies, so-

649
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:04,580
For stuff that you need, because you guys said that you wanted to do a lot of promotion

650
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,740
and you guys might need some stuff, so I thought that I would- it's from the chat room and

651
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,380
from everybody, because it would be really hard to email every single person to ask if

652
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,540
they could donate.

653
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,660
So this is for anything that you guys might need, any trips you guys want to send, any

654
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,740
equipment that you might need, or something you want to buy.

655
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,300
So that's what it is for.

656
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,300
Can I say what it is?

657
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,380
It's- I guess you could call it- It's right there.

658
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm throwing it up, throwing it around the whole place.

659
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:44,380
I guess you could call it seed money to take a well art to the next level, and something

660
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,640
I think a lot of us always like, we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.

661
00:38:50,640 --> 00:39:00,460
It was always- No, I'm sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.

662
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
Bandit's on the right track.

663
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,160
It's a- Oh, you're on the right track, I'll put it that way.

664
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,900
It's basically $4,000 in seed money.

665
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,420
It sounds so strange to say.

666
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:23,860
That kind of- Just to bring you guys to do what we do here, and really be able to take

667
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
this to the next level.

668
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,540
Oh God, I'm so embarrassed that- I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her

669
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:36,380
permission to service you.

670
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,020
I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.

671
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,060
I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I didn't

672
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,980
know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about, you guys want to do

673
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,780
all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could

674
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,780
do that.

675
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:57,660
It's for promotion, it's for anything you guys want to use it for, completely at your

676
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
disposal.

677
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
Thank you so much.

678
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Strippers.

679
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
I don't know where to begin.

680
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,660
I don't know where to begin.

681
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,660
Yeah, strippers.

682
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:08,740
Now, it's kind of like that I'm looking at this, I'm like, I don't know.

683
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,740
I don't know where to begin.

684
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,820
I think we need to set up that account now.

685
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:21,140
I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now, and maybe we'll

686
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,580
be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon, who knows, I don't know, but thank you

687
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,580
so much.

688
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,620
Consider it on your hands.

689
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,620
Thank you.

690
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,420
Are you okay, Loki?

691
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,540
I'm not even looking at chat, I don't even want to know.

692
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:44,460
I don't buy all games.com, I don't think that's going to be happening.

693
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:49,300
And it's telling us to drop by 365.

694
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,260
That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.

695
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,500
My heart's racing very quickly.

696
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:03,980
I know, I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of, no, it's fine, it's fine, I don't

697
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,660
know what to say.

698
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,100
This just doesn't happen.

699
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
But it is.

700
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:20,460
I know, I know, I just don't know what to say, I'm sorry.

701
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
He's a little...

702
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,740
Read another fucking email, all right?

703
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,140
That was the last email.

704
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,180
God damn it, read another one, make something up, make something up.

705
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:34,800
Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.

706
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,340
Love the queen.

707
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,300
You play everything on Doctor Who.

708
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,980
All you would play is Doctor Who.

709
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,020
We'd have BBC Who.

710
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
No.

711
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,180
Anyways, I'll take it from here.

712
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,500
Please do, if I had a story up, somebody else needs to do that, I'm sorry.

713
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,220
I'll make up a story.

714
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,900
So anyways, we've got some pretty interesting stuff.

715
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,860
If you happen to have some sort of Bluetooth device, whether it be a USB support for your

716
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,620
computer or laptop, etc., you can actually exchange Miis.

717
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,980
There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Miis to your remote, which you can do

718
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:21,780
via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Miis exchange.

719
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:31,580
It's actually available on wimodwi.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Miis, and you

720
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,800
can actually submit your Miis there that you've created, as well as download other celebrity

721
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,260
Miis, including such things as Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca,

722
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,380
Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc., God, Harry Potter.

723
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,300
So definitely check that out.

724
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,540
Of course you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that, and available also

725
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,740
on wimodwi.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that,

726
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,180
and it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.

727
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,340
So definitely worth checking out.

728
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,380
I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have

729
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,780
Chuck Norris on my Wii console.

730
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
That is a requirement.

731
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,780
Chuck Norris would shatter your Wii.

732
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,860
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story, and then I'm going to run

733
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,860
out of the room for a minute.

734
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,860
Something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement

735
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,020
of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.

736
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,660
Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this

737
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,100
week, and the big shock, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.

738
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:49,740
These games are of biblical proportions in Japan, but the fact that Dragon Quest IX protectors

739
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,980
of the starry sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.

740
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,740
It will feature 3D graphics, there were some screenshots released, it looks very similar

741
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:06,500
in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was recently out on the PlayStation 2, and they are trying

742
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,940
to make it ready by 2007.

743
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:19,340
By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade game called Dragon Quest Monster Battle

744
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,340
Road.

745
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,940
Both these games being developed by Level 5.

746
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:29,100
This brings up a good point, and I hate Sony bashing, but I got to mention this.

747
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:32,800
There's games that come out on the DS and stuff, it's like games that you're looking

748
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,380
forward to coming out.

749
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,140
Can you name a game that you're looking forward to coming out on the PSP?

750
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,020
I can't, and that's pretty sad.

751
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,340
I own a PSP, and to be honest, I play the PSP a lot more than my DS, and I've pretty

752
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,060
much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Brothers and Mario Kart,

753
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:57,100
and I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have

754
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,100
games.

755
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:02,060
It's just a lot of filler, it seems like, a lot of ports of stuff that end up on the

756
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:08,900
PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or ooh, Final Fantasy.

757
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,340
I think that's why their system is not doing this well.

758
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:17,940
Ereto says Silent Hill Origins.

759
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,020
We just have another Untold Legends, or other Dynasty Warriors...

760
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,740
It's GS-191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon

761
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,740
Quest IX for DS.

762
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:37,700
Enus is going to sue somebody now.

763
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,500
So I don't know what else to say about that.

764
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,740
I was pretty surprised to hear that myself, because I don't know, I'm so used to playing

765
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,020
Dragon Quest on my television, but then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon

766
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,420
Quest on the Game Boy years ago, I mean, they ported one too, and all that.

767
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,380
There will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii, so...

768
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,900
Ooh, I forgot about that, that's right, that was supposed to be a launch title.

769
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,940
I think it was in Japan, so...

770
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,940
All right.

771
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:05,500
Well, I definitely want to check this out, I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on

772
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,140
the DS, I don't see any... you know, Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate

773
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,140
very well to the DS, I don't see why this will be a problem.

774
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,260
It's Toriyama, you can't go wrong with him.

775
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:19,940
I think it'll be good, and also that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it,

776
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,540
which is good news.

777
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,540
Call Blimey!

778
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:31,600
Anyways, so, now, bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for

779
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:39,980
you guys, I thought I'd bring this up, you can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain

780
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,740
program, you can make your Wii sound like a light saber when you swing it around.

781
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,940
Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why did someone create this?

782
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:54,980
For the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so, you know, the prevent from dropping it

783
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,860
on the ground, it senses that it's falling and shuts it off or whatever.

784
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:07,420
So that tilt sensor, using the app, you can actually, with the Darwin remote program,

785
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,700
and run this program called Wii Saber, and it's basically flinging your remote around

786
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,860
and makes the sounds of a light saber.

787
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,420
Completely useless, but I guess fun if you have a Mac and a Wii.

788
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,660
I foresee an entirely new generation of Star Wars, kid.

789
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,380
Oh, God.

790
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,380
Wii Saber.

791
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,380
Heaven help us all.

792
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,460
Well, how about I redeem the world now?

793
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,460
Please do.

794
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,380
Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you

795
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:38,220
know who Kevin Smith is.

796
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,220
Yes.

797
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,860
Noggin of the nooch.

798
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,460
That talk, well, he's interested in making a game based on J.N.

799
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,460
Silent Bob.

800
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:56,560
To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining,

801
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,840
basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make

802
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,220
the levels and stuff in it.

803
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,140
So he basically is going to be concept director.

804
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:16,320
Well, I think that Joystick pointed out something very good on this, that the things going against

805
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,300
him is the types of dialogue that he's known for and the types of humor that go in the

806
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,780
game, that will go in his stories.

807
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:30,060
I think it would definitely be an older crowd he'd cater to.

808
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:36,700
And I mean, I love how they say, especially if the game is based off of Blutland and Chronic,

809
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:41,760
it should definitely go, he should do it, but it's going to be an M game.

810
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,500
And that's great.

811
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,500
So she had Dogma the game.

812
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,380
We have to, that'd be awesome.

813
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,020
We have to fight legions of angels.

814
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,220
And with Alanis says God.

815
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:59,420
Do we get to watch Muse strip because we are not going to watch him do the silence of the

816
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,420
lambs dance.

817
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,420
No Muse.

818
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:02,420
No Muse.

819
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,420
Serendipity.

820
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
Oh, I thought you meant.

821
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,420
Selma Hayek, man.

822
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,420
Okay.

823
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,140
I thought you were talking about Jason Muse because they refer to him by his last name

824
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,140
in there.

825
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,140
Oh, no, no, no, no.

826
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,140
The Muse.

827
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
Serendipity.

828
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,140
Yeah.

829
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,140
Oh, yeah.

830
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,140
Boobies.

831
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
Well.

832
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,140
Boobies.

833
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,960
You know what, James Tom Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be

834
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,180
a collective nerdgasm heard around the world in this type of game.

835
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,180
Oh, my God.

836
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,180
Seriously.

837
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,180
Okay.

838
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,180
Wow.

839
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:37,220
Well, going to the complete opposite end of the spectrum into things maybe we don't want

840
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,020
to hear about.

841
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,820
Get this.

842
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,740
And I'm looking at something that's for sale at Barcade.com.

843
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,060
It's created by a company called Baytech Games.

844
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:52,700
It's an arcade version of American Idol Superstar.

845
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:56,140
It has a, quote, fun and addicting light pattern game.

846
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,460
It has artwork and audio from the American Idol game.

847
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:04,820
What you do is you press a stop button to light five stars in a row for a prize or you

848
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,260
can continue on and play for a stupid prize, a super prize.

849
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,580
You can go along and play for a super prize.

850
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,340
Once you get the light pattern down, you know, you can get it and light up all the things.

851
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,440
And if you get the super prize, though, it's a lot more difficult to be going for that.

852
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,840
So it's another one of those freaking ticket redemption games based off of American Idol.

853
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,900
Kill it with fire.

854
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:32,420
After all, they have this ticket game based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.

855
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,180
No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick

856
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:44,060
in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.

857
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:49,700
To quote DJ Dark Knight, NOOOOOOO!

858
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,260
And also, to get back on a previous subject, to quote Gara who Drive Car, Ma rats the game,

859
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,620
remove the kids sitting on the escalator level.

860
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:02,700
Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American

861
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:09,420
Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great

862
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,420
arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur IIIs that could be in these arcades, the Time

863
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:20,420
Crisis IVs, the DDR Supernovas, that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.

864
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:23,420
And does this piss you off as much as it does us?

865
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:33,700
Because it makes us so mad we have to rant large the FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.

866
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:41,020
The first FU of the week goes to Extrofer for not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity

867
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,420
photo shoot butt bleaching.

868
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,260
We were going to get Extrofer a gift certificate for intimate photographs.

869
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:53,940
And an anal bleaching.

870
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,540
That fell through.

871
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:01,340
I would however like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful

872
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,980
facial responses from my husband.

873
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,620
It was gorgeous.

874
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:33,940
Watching Dan's quorum makes me happy sometimes.

875
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,780
This one's definitely for Nellie.

876
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,540
Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she

877
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:50,140
could buy candy and had to count out her like four dollars worth of purchases with pennies

878
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:56,060
in front of us slowly and she kept messing up and had to recount them.

879
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,060
It was horrible.

880
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,180
That's why you get paper rolls first.

881
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,460
When I was in college we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll

882
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,460
them and then go to the movies.

883
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,220
She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.

884
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,220
I know the rules.

885
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,900
I hope you don't mind me saying that.

886
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,820
We used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went

887
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,820
where we were going.

888
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:24,140
See that's what considerate people would do but you forget she's a dumb bitch.

889
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,780
I had something but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.

890
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:33,060
So no it's fine trust me.

891
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,660
I guess my F.U. would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on a radio

892
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,660
program.

893
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,660
I'm so sorry.

894
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,660
I'm so sorry.

895
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,660
No, no, no.

896
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:49,940
Please, please don't feel sorry.

897
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,780
I had a serious F.U. and I seriously oh I know what it was I just remembered it I finally

898
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,540
remembered it and F.U. did in fact I didn't go to bed until six thirty in the morning

899
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,820
yesterday because that's my own downfall but it doesn't make me feel any better because

900
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,660
my Sunday is like completely gone.

901
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:07,460
Uh oh wait oh hello we still have other people that have to do their F.U.s.

First off F.U. to the World of Warcraft 2.0 patch for forcing me into a prediction relapse.

904
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,980
F.U. to certain parts of that patch that break all your interface add-ons.

905
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:32,420

943
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,900
say we continue on with some stories yes so if you don't have enough money to spend on

944
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:31,100
PlayStation 3 or you know a 360 or even a Wii for that matter what can you do what can

945
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:37,300
you do well you can buy retro and you know for the same matter why bother buying virtual

946
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,900
console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on so shop

947
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:48,540
eBay shop your local thrift stores find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper

948
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:55,820
hell go to if you're in the California area here go visit a tower or hell I think around

949
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:00,980
the they're all around the country but visit our records they're closing down so I get

950
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:07,020
some old ass games there if they have some used stuff but yeah eBay is your friend you

951
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,220
can find lots of consoles for cheap especially when people are trying to earn some extra

952
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:16,060
money to buy the new ones I like eBay eBay has been taking a lot of my money lately well

953
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:21,380
something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800 the system

954
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:27,380
that is most notoriously known breaking you can have a working AC adapter those are pretty

955
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:35,740
hard to come by too but the systems no no no out of five that I've played all of them

956
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:41,940
broke so yeah but some people decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on

957
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:49,980
the 7800 we have pac-man collection for the 7800 and again 7800 is a good system don't

958
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:59,780
get me wrong but it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob decrescendo

959
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:08,540
that don't decrescendo sorry and it includes pac-man puck man hangley man which is the

960
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:15,220
best name ever ultra pac-man random mazes miss pac-man miss pac attack and miss random

961
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:21,100
mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate

962
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:29,260
play options junior pac-man and super pac-man are both missing and it's a $30 package there

963
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:38,700
is a let's see there's apparently the link on Atari age.com you can find it there a new

964
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:43,260
pac-man for a system nobody plays anymore be still my fleeting heart I actually or nobody

965
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,580
wants to play because last year god damn much last year we did by super pac-man for as I

966
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:52,860
miss pac-man for the 5200 the prototype well that's a 5200 I know well I love this 200

967
01:00:52,860 --> 01:01:02,540
200 is freaking rad it has kicks on it well too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken

968
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,620
everybody's is broken no but you know what for somebody who's like an old school gaming

969
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,700
collector type thing they are gonna be just simply amazed at this you know and I kind

970
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:16,260
of think pick it up I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something

971
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:20,260
like this you know tease this game all you want but just the fact that there is so much

972
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,780
love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together it's pretty

973
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:32,700
rad it's pretty rad anyway what's not so rad is that Nintendo having to do these programs

974
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:38,220
recently we talked about the strap thing earlier in the show well they also this is a full

975
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:46,380
fledged recall in Japan not here but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS lights have

976
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:52,740
been recalled overseas keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do

977
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:59,340
over here so this news does not affect us here in the US but those are being recalled

978
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:04,200
so if you're in Japan you might want to look to your local press for some more information

979
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:09,180
on how you can do that usually you just take it into the store and all that stuff so interesting

980
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:16,780
yes and in case those exploding AC adapters don't kill you well then the Wi-Fi will yes

981
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:21,500
apparently everybody loves you know creating a scare where whether it be you know cell

982
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:28,620
phones causing cancer or you know Xboxes causing home fires or you know stuff like that but

983
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:37,820
now people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing

984
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:45,980
some sort of brain damage or stuff like that why would people actually think this I mean

985
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:53,740
that's like thinking that the earth is flat or that I don't know the that the earth or

986
01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:01,300
the Sun revolves around the earth and vice versa people are stupid this is why people

987
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:07,940
will fling remotes at the TV because they're retarded they'll believe this shit you you

988
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:13,420
know what I swear to God when this that whole story with the Wiimotes you know them offering

989
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:19,220
the extra thick strap for the Wiimote so many people at my work came up to me go have you

990
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:24,220
heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things this is a good cross

991
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,700
section of the people of the United States you know the people I work with right here

992
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:32,940
and they're all idiots so you know they just unfortunately they were you know getting the

993
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:39,100
story spun by you know God knows what news program and so they didn't get the you know

994
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:42,660
pure facts for it and that's unfortunately how people are gonna see this whole problems

995
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,660
and eventually when people catch on this whole Wi-Fi thing that they're gonna be like oh

996
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:55,540
my god oh my god get in the bomb shelter now the world is coming to an end so people suck

997
01:03:55,540 --> 01:04:01,660
yes they do but something that doesn't suck of gear is Gears of War the game has broken

998
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:10,060
two million copies worldwide and that's one million in the u.s. alone since the fastest

999
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:18,700
selling next-gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters

1000
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:28,780
but basically though there is an official press release put out about this just stating

1001
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:36,180
that that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell who's the corporate vice president

1002
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:41,300
of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation was saying

1003
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,780
corporation corporation was saying Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title

1004
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:50,820
of must-have a game of the year it's phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360

1005
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:55,060
is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday we've always

1006
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:58,900
had high hopes for Gears of War but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response

1007
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,300
from critics and gamers all over the world that's a quote from Michael cap set up at

1008
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:14,300
games so that's pretty cool and I also said another fun stat that on Xbox Live that the

1009
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:22,340
total of the gameplay sessions online reach 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements

1010
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:31,460
so oh my gosh and I have paid with those paid registrations on Xbox Live have gone over

1011
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:39,300
50% more since the game has launched wow all right well I know you guys have been dying

1012
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,340
to want to call into the show it's been a very interesting night tonight to say the

1013
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:49,340
least it's kind of like our um well what do we keep threatening to do last year we're

1014
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:53,380
gonna do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that it's certainly been a

1015
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,980
very uh interesting evening if we were gonna share if we were gonna want to do something

1016
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,460
that we already have a theme song we could do you know Christmas and Hollis what was

1017
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:04,580
what's that song that Eazy E did the Christmas was that Christmas in Compton that's it Christmas

1018
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,420
it was Christmas in Compton all right well Run DMC did um uh Christmas in Hollis all

1019
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,820
uh... well anyway well you know i get to the uh...

1020
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:15,720
voicemail of the week as well

1021
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,820
uh... we we got a lot of play this real quick a voicemail here

1022
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:23,000
uh... that was left us out by a listener we get a lot of voicemails this week a

1023
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,040
very disappointed

1024
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,440
one eight seven seven game or and there's a stuff to give away this week

1025
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:27,960
too

1026
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:31,100
so uh... you know you want to leave us your sony commercial if you don't know

1027
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,040
what the heck we're talking about the party

1028
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,420
uh... here's what's going on week

1029
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,660
either this is the poll and i was just looking a lot to be podcast when you

1030
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,300
guys were talking about

1031
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,400
the point system for the week

1032
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,660
on downloading game and i wanted to note that i actually do have to pay tax i

1033
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,460
live in nashville tennessee

1034
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,880
and when i buy point online with my credit card it does charge tax

1035
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,640
just thought it would be an interesting note

1036
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,380
you guys later love the show bye

1037
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,100
interesting so we have yet to really hear thank you for the voicemail by the way

1038
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,940
we have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down because we know

1039
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,300
those of us in california aren't paying the tax on the wee points but now we know

1040
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,060
tennessee our listener here pennsylvania probably some other states are charging

1041
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,340
very interesting how that's all breaking down not a whole lot set on that

1042
01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,540
it is

1043
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,680
a transaction you are paying for a service

1044
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,780
so it's sensible

1045
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,060
at the same time it's it

1046
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:23,780
there's just a little bit of it seems bizarre to me

1047
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,700
well i just

1048
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,660
icon

1049
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,300
i could be curious to know like

1050
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,380
do you get taxed on xbox points to

1051
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,740
that would be kind of what i'd be wondering about so

1052
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,160
uh... and and folks in the other areas as well that are getting taxed on the

1053
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,380
we points i'm kinda wondering what the differences

1054
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,580
cuz i'm not taxed on microsoft points either

1055
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,700
so i'm kinda curious why there'd be a difference what true

1056
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,260
an internet tax maybe i don't know

1057
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,460
all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now uh... our username on

1058
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:55,240
skype is orange lounge radio and our number one eight seven seven game o l r

1059
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,780

1060
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,620

1061
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:06,140

1062
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,140
i

1063
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,700
discard b mania two d x happy sky

1064
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:13,540
uh... that's right i think i've heard i've only heard that i talked to me

1065
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,620
clinton earlier this week and he had played it

1066
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,780
uh... and he said it was ok but there's been better releases what are your

1067
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:24,140
thoughts on b mania two d x happy sky

1068
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,080
well

1069
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,340
wake up a limited edition

1070
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,560
and uh... i would like that

1071
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,900
everything the package together was really nice

1072
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,580
uh... i haven't got a chance to watch the dvd yet because i don't have a

1073
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,020
region free

1074
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,020
but the game itself

1075
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,380
the uh... the skin for it

1076
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,140
i'd say the great improvement over anything they've ever done

1077
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,960
and i like the fact that you can change that

1078
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,960
music when you're selecting the song

1079
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:55,180
might only great

1080
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:01,180
really be the new difficulty setting but i haven't really gotten used

1081
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:03,780
to uh... creating them by twelve

1082
01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:04,940
that's eight

1083
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,980
all yeah i was new in happy sky right

1084
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,360
basically

1085
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,500
there was uh...

1086
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,520
i can only

1087
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,620
play on uh... seven on three x red

1088
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,460
and there was a really big gap between

1089
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:20,660
really easy

1090
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:25,860
seven songs and really hard seven songs that's about where i'm at yep

1091
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,900
yeah

1092
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:32,100
that's been pretty much split down between seven and eight difficulty now

1093
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,660
the song list itself though i was really happy with

1094
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,300
and uh...

1095
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,440
my biggest complaint about the songs

1096
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,300
would be the difficulty of uh...

1097
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,720
may and zephyr

1098
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,820
which were my two favorite songs

1099
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:49,660
and

1100
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,340
they're nearly impossible

1101
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,260
on

1102
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,100
seventy and another

1103
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,140
but

1104
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,280
on white mode

1105
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,620
they're just too easy

1106
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:06,660
interesting so there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there

1107
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,820
in some songs

1108
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:10,420
giant gap in difficulty uh...

1109
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:11,580
i think blue

1110
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:14,780
blue mirage was another one of those

1111
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:19,180
overall i was really happy with it

1112
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,740
uh... one other quick question i have for you to get a move on to some of the

1113
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,700
calls what would you say you would like to see konami do if they put out

1114
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:30,340
uh... beatmania thirteen or beatmania distorted out on the console would you

1115
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,340
like to see them

1116
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,820
what they need to most improve on with their next release

1117
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:42,700
most improve on with the next release

1118
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,140
i stopped you know i'm

1119
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,500
yeah i'm really happy with the beatmania system

1120
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,880
and you can't really change the note charts

1121
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,780
would you like to see an edit mode or something? I don't know

1122
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:59,660
edit mode

1123
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:03,020
where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can

1124
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,140
key map them however you want might be interesting

1125
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,820
if they could make it work

1126
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:11,380
that might be interesting

1127
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,900
i'd say add

1128
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,960
something new

1129
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:15,140
because they have

1130
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,660
customized now they have class mode

1131
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:21,460
they have all these modes and i would really like to see them add

1132
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,500
some kind of new thing

1133
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,720
long mixes

1134

01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,100
internet drop pitch problems we've been having so i think that's causing a bit

01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,740
of a delay so we'll do the best we can

1148
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,420

uh... first of all nintendo makes high quality stuff they wouldn't make faulty

1156
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,980
straps i don't think

1157
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:34,300
and second if you're throwing your we most so hard at the stress in a break

1158

sis says something about the brick consoles let's speculate what was rama

1224
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,420
trying to say about the brick consoles you think

1225
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,300
you should try to build a house out of xbox three sixties

1226
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,460
uh...

01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,900

01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:11,540
house that was built out of newspapers

1230

and the house that was built out of gravestones

1231
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:19,880

01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:25,180
I don't know what to say.

That's all right. Well, fine, we'll go to someone else.

1278
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,180
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1279
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,180
Who's this?

1280
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,180
Hey, this is Solarwing.

1281
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,180
Hi, Solarwing.

1282
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:57,180
What's on your mind?

1283
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:00,180
Solarwing, I'm sorry, I thought you said celery.

1284
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,180
Sorry.

1285
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,180
Celery's good for you.

1286
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,180
It's a good thing.

1287
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,180
No.

1288
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,180
Solarwing, what's on your mind?

1289
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,180
Wii straps.

1290
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,180
How can people even think that they would break?

1291
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:15,180
Well, because they have been.

1292
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:17,180
No, they haven't.

1293
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:22,180
Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're

1294
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,180
breaking, we assume.

1295
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,180
Not at their own volition.

1296
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,180
It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.

1297
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,180
Right.

1298
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:35,180
I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one, and I tried it.

1299
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,180
I could not break it.

1300
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,180
I tried.

1301
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:39,180
I know.

1302
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:42,180
I've been kind of, like ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been kind of trying

1303
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:45,180
to break mine, and you can't.

1304
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:49,180
I don't know how people do it.

1305
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,180
Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?

1306
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,180
What kind of games do you want to get with it?

1307
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,180
Of course, the classic Zelda.

1308
01:19:55,180 --> 01:20:00,180
At a bit, so I want to try that.

1309
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,180
Alibits is pretty fun.

1310
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,180
It's a good game.

1311
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,180
All right.

1312
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,180
Well, good luck to you on your Wii Quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.

1313
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:11,180
We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.

1314
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:13,180
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?

1315
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,180
Just happy holidays to you guys.

1316
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,180
Thank you so much.

1317
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,180
Same to you.

1318
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,180
I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a Wii under your tree.

1319
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,180
That would be fun.

1320
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,180
Oh, yeah.

1321
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,180
All right.

1322
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:23,180
Good luck.

1323
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,180
Bye.

1324
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,180
Bye-bye.

1325
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,180
All right.

1326
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:30,180
Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.

1327
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:31,180
Hi.

1328
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,180
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1329
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:33,180
Who's this?

1330
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:34,180
It's Ron.

1331
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:35,180
I finally made it back on my cell phone.

1332
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,180
Finally.

1333
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:37,180
All right.

1334
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,180
What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?

1335
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,180
My thing is this.

1336
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:44,180
If you're spending so much money on these consoles, it wouldn't kill you to drop an

1337
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,180
extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.

1338
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:51,180
That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through a rigmarole with shipping out

1339
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:56,180
the unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the

1340
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,180
hour.

1341
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,480
Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.

1342
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,540
It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to

1343
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:04,900
be shoved down my throat.

1344
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,540
And I'm one of those people that's like, when somebody tells me I have to get something

1345
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,060
or I need it, I'm like, no.

1346
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,060
Don't tell me.

1347
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:13,060
I don't know.

1348
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:17,620
There's a difference between friendly advice and people that are trying to pressure me

1349
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,600
so much into buying these warranties.

1350
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,020
And plus, it's tough because you do feel like it's wasted money when you don't use it, and

1351
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:25,020
it all adds up.

1352
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,540
You know what I mean?

1353
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,140
I know exactly how you mean it.

1354
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,140
I do this for a living.

1355
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,260
I sell cameras and laptops and stuff.

1356
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,540
I tell people about the warranty, and I tell them the positives about it.

1357
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:39,620
I tell them, you don't have to get it, but it's just a piece of mind.

1358
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:40,700
I completely understand.

1359
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:44,340
I never force it like it got in your throat.

1360
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:49,380
Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to

1361
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:53,180
you by your management, and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?

1362
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:57,980
Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own

1363
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:01,540
personal experience because I've been dealing with this for a very long time.

1364
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:02,540
Fair enough.

1365
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,540
Fair enough.

1366
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,540
I mean, but I don't know.

1367
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:07,300
I kind of find that the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's

1368
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,180
faulty, it's going to break in the first few days, but I can understand why people are

1369
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:14,580
about the extended warranty, but I don't know.

1370
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:20,180
I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.

1371
01:22:20,180 --> 01:22:22,620
To Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?

1372
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:25,940
No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.

1373
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:30,860
Well, you know, it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will,

1374
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:31,860
you know?

1375
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,860
All right.

1376
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,860
Yeah.

1377
01:22:33,860 --> 01:22:34,860
Rama, we got to let you get over so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for

1378
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,860
calling us back, all right?

1379
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:36,860
All right.

1380
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:37,860
Sure.

1381
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,860
Hey, no problem.

1382
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:39,860
Happy holidays.

1383
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:40,860
Bye.

1384
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,860
Do you have something for Rama?

1385
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,860
No.

1386
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,860
Oh, all right.

1387
01:22:43,860 --> 01:22:44,860
Do you have something here in town?

1388
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,860
She'll give it to you later.

1389
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:55,540
No, not like that, but I have something to play for people because this is what's on

1390
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:01,260
my mind about work tomorrow.

1391
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:03,780
You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.

1392
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:04,780
That's all right.

1393
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:05,780
A lot of people do.

1394
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,780
A lot of people do.

1395
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:07,780
I'm sure.

1396
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:08,780
That's fine.

1397
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,620
No, I get it, but I have to have it explained to me.

1398
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:14,540
All right, anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories,

1399
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:15,540
boys and girls.

1400
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:18,540
I have a story.

1401
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,120
Yes.

1402
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:24,940
My story has to do with a baseball player.

1403
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:32,060
The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaya, actually hurt his arm.

1404
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:38,220
He was complaining of aches and pains in his arm because he was playing too much Guitar

1405
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:39,220
Hero.

1406
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:43,740
When he examined his pain in his forearm, it was determined that it was more like that

1407
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:48,580
of the guitar player and suggested that he stopped playing Guitar Hero.

1408
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:51,580
It was actually severe masturbation.

1409
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,580
Fap attack.

1410
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:00,460
Anyway, he stopped, improved, and went on to play in the World Series.

1411
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:08,100
He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.

1412
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:11,820
I thought it was funny.

1413
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:12,820
That was pretty funny.

1414
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,580
Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?

1415
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,140
Yeah, I have one.

1416
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,860
This is going to piss people off.

1417
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:25,860
With Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan being one of the first

1418
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,740
online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.

1419
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,220
Guess what that would be?

1420
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,340
Another 12-digit friend code.

1421
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:37,860
Because apparently the friends list on Pokemon Battle Revolution is different than your normal

1422
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:42,820
friends list and you have to swap Wii codes with other people in other places.

1423
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:45,300
Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me.

1424
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:47,420
I thought they promised one friend code.

1425
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,020
They just meant for the system itself?

1426
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,380
Uh, yes.

1427
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,580
The problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.

1428
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:00,820
You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.

1429
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:03,660
Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?

1430
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:08,380
You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.

1431
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:13,780
I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole people afraid about their

1432
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:20,200
kids or whatever, but seriously, it's simple enough that both people have to have each

1433
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,580
other listed before they can even communicate with each other.

1434
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,580
That's effective enough.

1435
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,940
End of story.

1436
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:29,500
There's no need for this 5,000 friend code stuff.

1437
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,940
That's horrible.

1438
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:36,340
I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?

1439
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,140
After all, they launched a new next-gen system.

1440
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,780
Where's that report coming from?

1441
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,660
Forecolor Rebellion, which they're pretty good at.

1442
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:43,660
Respectable Source.

1443
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,660
Oh, man.

1444
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:45,660
That's horrible.

1445
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:52,300
Actually, and the other thing too, this is actually Forecolor Rebellion is reporting

1446
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:58,880
IGN articles, so that's even better.

1447
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,980
They don't get it, do they?

1448
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,460
They just don't get the online.

1449
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,340
I mean, that's what I'm thinking.

1450
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:06,900
Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.

1451
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,340
Somebody's going to call Nintendo to the carpet over this one.

1452
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:11,420
I mean, because this is ridiculous.

1453
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,980
This whole friend code crap.

1454
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:15,900
So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?

1455
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:21,100
Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send Miis to each other, which only support

1456
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,940
one game so far?

1457
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:25,940
Very disappointing.

1458
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:28,100
Xbox really gets it in the online world.

1459
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,100
They do.

1460
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,100
They do.

1461
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:35,060
They of course aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't, but of

1462
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:40,380
course there is no service to charge for, so I'm just very disappointed.

1463
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,380
Me too.

1464
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:43,060
That's a bad thing to end on.

1465
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:46,140
I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.

1466
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,340
All right.

1467
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:49,860
That's a heck of a thing to have as a last minute story.

1468
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:52,020
That must have been just late breaking, huh?

1469
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,940
Was it just posted a little while ago or before we...

1470
01:26:53,940 --> 01:26:55,940
I think it's today.

1471
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:56,940
Interesting.

1472
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:57,940
All right.

1473
01:26:57,940 --> 01:27:02,980
Damn, that's the end of the show, so we're going to go around and give everybody's final

1474
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:03,980
thought.

1475
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:10,460
Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.

1476
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:14,260
Really appreciate it a lot, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?

1477
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,740
Oh, me first?

1478
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,740
Yes.

1479
01:27:16,740 --> 01:27:17,740
Okay.

1480
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,740
Happy holidays.

1481
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,300
I hope everyone has fun.

1482
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,940
I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so I'll probably...

1483
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,900
We're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.

1484
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:31,900
Cute.

1485
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:33,260
That'll be fun.

1486
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,780
Just have fun, but not too much fun.

1487
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:39,700
It's going to be basically, ah, ah.

1488
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,620
Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.

1489
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:44,700
Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.

1490
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:48,540
Sorry you didn't get to participate in part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.

1491
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:49,540
Any final thoughts?

1492
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,540
Hey, hey, hey.

1493
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:54,300
I didn't know I was invited.

1494
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,300
You can come whenever.

1495
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,300
Oh, okay.

1496
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:57,300
I'm flattered.

1497
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,940
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.

1498
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:01,940
All right.

1499
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:04,940
Loki, your final thought?

1500
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:08,340
My final thought is, I've got to return Far Cry.

1501
01:28:08,340 --> 01:28:11,500
I'm thinking it's going to suck.

1502
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,380
My final thought is Banana Muffin.

1503
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:17,300
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

1504
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,300
Exterminate.

1505
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,300
Exterminate.

1506
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:24,300
Okay, I was told one more.

1507
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,860
Okay.

1508
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:30,700
Reject false icons, bitches.

1509
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:31,700
I take that back.

1510
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:34,180
This is the best Far Cry vengeance trailer I've seen.

1511
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,500
It has a rabbit in it.

1512
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:39,500
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and Chris is awesome.

1513
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,500
All right.

1514
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,500
You're welcome.

1515
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Just so you guys, I agree.

1516
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,500
I agree.

1517
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:48,220
Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, it's

1518
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:51,900
January 7th of 2007, but fear not.

1519
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:55,620
I know a lot of you guys listen to our audio archive podcast, audio RSS, whatever the hell

1520
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,900

1524
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:13,180
Just stay curled up under the blankets and I hope you have a, have fun drinking hot cocoa

1525

or whatever.

1526
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,180
Bite.

1527
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:16,180
Yeah.

1528
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:19,160
If it doesn't work, try adding a little vodka.

1529
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:20,160
Have a great night everybody.

1530
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,380
We'll see you next time on Orange Laundry.
