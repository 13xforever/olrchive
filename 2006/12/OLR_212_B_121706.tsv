0	22400	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
22400	27800	This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B,
27800	31040	the last live segment of 2006.
31040	35280	We'll still have some more stuff going to our audio archive, podcast, audio RSS, whatever
35280	36280	you call it.
36280	37760	We'll still have some more audio going there.
37760	41240	We are going to bring you some specials for Christmas week and New Year's week, but since
41240	44760	Sunday our live night happens to be Christmas eve and New Year's eve, we're going to be
44760	46720	taking a couple weeks off from live.
46720	51300	And I'll tell you what, for those of you guys that don't listen live, you missed a great
51300	54220	live only segment this week because we've got to do some special stuff for our live
54220	58120	listeners where we just had an amazing gift exchange and we were just all high on the
58120	61800	love in the studio and just gushing, so it was an amazing time.
61800	64080	You can catch it on all games radio though.
64080	70080	They get access to the live part too and that airs our rebroadcast Monday at 5 o'clock Pacific
70080	74520	Standard Time on allgames.com and then Tuesday I believe only one time at 9 o'clock because
74520	79840	we're so freaking long that they can only afford to air it one time.
79840	84680	Let's get back into some gaming news because our live listeners have been waiting a while
84680	86900	for us to get back into some gaming news.
86900	89260	This was a huge story this week.
89260	94420	The Nintendo Wii Mote, now I got some email messages and some text messages and phones
94420	98980	from listeners and people going, did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?
98980	104080	Somebody hit a panic button, so I want to clarify right now, the Wiis were not recalled.
104080	106400	I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.
106400	113040	What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps which
113040	118420	are six tenths of a millimeter in diameter for a new beefed up strap that is one millimeter
118420	119480	in diameter.
119480	123620	This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are
123620	127660	breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.
127660	132740	You've probably seen that site, wehaveaproblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up
132740	133740	there.
133740	141340	I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo tested them, they withstand about 50 pounds
141340	142340	of pressure.
142340	146920	So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress
146920	148420	that should be applied to these things.
148420	152980	So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they are offering this program
152980	158420	for anybody who has a concern.
158420	163660	I've been playing the Wii for a long time, I can't imagine how that thing would break.
163660	166820	If it was starting to break, I think I'd be able to tell pretty quickly.
166820	169260	So people have really got to be going crazy.
169260	172460	So let me ask a couple questions here first and a lot of questions people have been asking
172460	176160	themselves this week.
176160	180020	These people that have the broken Wii straps, are they doing something wrong?
180020	181200	Is it a fluke?
181200	183200	What's the issue?
183200	184200	Mass stupidity.
184200	187800	Think across the board, you don't think there's flukes out there?
187800	190680	There may be very few if any.
190680	195380	I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to
195380	197860	swing this just like a baseball bat.
197860	200260	I'm going to backhand this this way.
200260	206500	I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.
206500	211220	The thing is, is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii
211220	214620	sports games or any of the others.
214620	221300	These people are basically using the system in a way other than, I think, intent because
221300	226420	there was even a warning put out for using the Wii mote.
226420	230420	If you give me a moment, I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal,
230420	232500	except she replaced Wii with penis.
232500	235660	They basically need to just, you know, calm down.
235660	239140	They're really kind of swinging the remote really fast.
239140	243580	I saw a video of one that went through like a wall or something like that because and
243580	245140	they were showing how they were playing with it.
245140	250620	The guy was like throwing like he was doing like a professional baseball toss or something.
250620	255900	Question number two, would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional
255900	259640	videos we've seen from the Wii because Nintendo kind of says one thing that you don't need
259640	264060	to move the Wii mote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting
264060	265940	into it when it's like on the news and everything.
265940	268260	Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?
268260	272100	Even though they may be flailing around like looking like complete idiots, they are not
272100	273860	doing it uncontrollably.
273860	279420	I mean, when they're showing them, you know, diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii
279420	281700	test, they're not swinging super hard.
281700	285660	They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.
285660	292620	Okay, here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.
292620	294080	Safety information for playing Wii.
294080	298220	As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii remote, we would like you to
298220	302100	take a few minutes to review some important safety information, which when followed will
302100	304540	help ensure a fun playing experience for all.
304540	306180	One, wear the wrist strap.
306180	309840	Make sure that all players using the Wii remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has
309840	312300	been tightened using the strap lock.
312300	315880	When sharing the Wii remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the
315880	319280	Wii remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.
319280	321680	Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii remote from flying across the room
321680	323540	if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.
323540	325260	Now the second part is the important one.
325260	328740	Two, hold the Wii remote firmly and do not let go.
328740	332020	Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii remote during
332020	334540	gameplay and do not use excessive motion.
334540	338620	For example, in Wii sports bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is
338620	340860	to release the B button on the Wii remote.
340860	344380	Do not let go of the Wii remote itself in bold letters.
344380	348700	If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.
348700	352460	If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii remote, the wrist strap may break
352460	354460	and you could lose control of the Wii remote.
354460	357600	This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.
357600	359920	They said this in their warning.
359920	361720	You people are stupid!
361720	364040	Okay, interesting comments from chat, I want to say here.
364040	368240	BearWhoDriveCars says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that
368240	371420	stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.
371420	372420	By the way, I love that nickname.
372420	373420	Well, the thing...
373420	376760	Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangetonsradio.com.
376760	381520	Airtoast says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.
381520	382520	Interesting thought.
382520	386440	It wouldn't have been any good if people were letting go of it anyway.
386440	391160	The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically, you're dealing
391160	394240	with basic laws of physics.
394240	398960	You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.
398960	407200	Darkknight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt happy fun Wiimote.
407200	411800	Winner.
411800	414240	Question number three, will Nintendo get sued over this?
414240	415240	No.
415240	416240	Yes.
416240	417240	Yes, they will.
417240	419760	And they will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.
419760	420760	Amen.
420760	421960	No, okay.
421960	422960	Will they attempt to get sued?
422960	423960	No.
423960	424960	Will it go through?
424960	425960	No.
425960	426960	Okay, having taken business law...
426960	433400	Hold on, I'm getting Dark Sakura's soapbox, let's see, I'm going to pull it out of the
433400	434400	closet here.
434400	438840	Hey, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, shut up.
438840	445760	Anyway, the whole, all right, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened
445760	449960	a while back in Oklahoma, and you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.
449960	455680	There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker, and it said, do not
455680	458040	allow small children within so many feet of it.
458040	462040	Well, the little kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped
462040	466340	off with a weed whacker when it recoiled off a rock.
466340	470720	Not a default in the object itself, but the company still got sued and they won.
470720	477120	The thing is, is that with any type of material object, any type of device, where Nintendo
477120	482240	is going to have to prove is that the device is being used improperly.
482240	487760	That enough warning was given for proper use of the system for them to have a defense against.
487760	494120	If Nintendo did not provide enough anti-stupidity warnings, because keep in mind, like Bill
494120	499880	Engvall says, the reason why we have warnings on everything is because stupid people have
499880	502880	done it.
502880	510600	Legend of Zaku in Chat says, Tack Jomson says, Wiimote is a murder simulator.
510600	513600	Fuck simulating, dude, you'll throw it through someone's head, actual murder.
513600	515800	I think there was a YouTube video of that.
515800	517680	Anyway, we welcome your thoughts on that, Bill.
517680	523720	To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.
523720	527800	Nintendo's duty of responsibility is to make the warning available.
527800	531840	I'd like to mention though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about,
531840	540360	you know, federal government agencies looking into this, and apparently there have been
540360	549040	recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.
549040	550040	That is it.
550040	552880	I mean, this isn't like killing people.
552880	558200	This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV, you know, I caused
558200	562080	a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week, I mean, just stupid shit like that.
562080	563080	I just want to say this real quick.
563080	566160	I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.
566160	570100	Funny Dale in our chat room says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering
570100	574800	a recall, and then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's
574800	575800	a problem.
575800	580120	Well, they didn't, it's a gray area, they didn't admit there's a problem per se.
580120	583640	I see this as a cover your ass, I think it's a cover your ass, I think.
583640	587200	It's the same thing with, remember the Pokémon toys that Burger King was putting out, and
587200	592160	the babies were suffocating on the ball, when it clearly said, do not let anyone under three
592160	594640	years of age have a Poké Ball?
594640	596080	Or they might get trapped inside.
596080	599800	The duty of responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.
599800	602280	Babymon, I choose you!
602280	608080	But hey, but it is a likely thing, babies will put stuff in their mouths.
608080	610840	They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.
610840	617640	So it was really the parents' responsibility, but Burger King still recalled the Poké Balls,
617640	621880	so that they would not be held further liable for damages.
621880	625880	And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.
625880	627400	Now here's the thing I have to ask you.
627400	628880	We have to keep it moving after this comment.
628880	633200	Okay, if, like for example, if I have a baseball bat, and I throw the baseball bat and it hits
633200	636880	someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.
636880	642640	I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company for the injury caused by that baseball
642640	643640	bat.
643640	644640	Same thing goes with the Wiimote.
644640	648040	I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through
648040	653360	your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself, because you're an idiot.
653360	655360	It's as simple as that.
655360	659800	Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on
659800	664200	the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.
664200	669480	A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes, as the case
669480	675880	would be with one that was posted here on Joystiq showing how easily it can be done.
675880	680520	And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.
680520	685120	Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw
685120	686920	you, you're not helping.
686920	689320	I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.
689320	693600	I mean, what, I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills, and if you say
693600	697600	on it it's a fake or whatever, you know, then fine, you know, have fun with your Photoshop
697600	698720	abilities.
698720	703680	But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously,
703680	704800	screw you.
704800	705800	Because you're not helping.
705800	709240	You're the same people who are the stupid, lame people who sell PS3s.
709240	712680	Why don't you make a sign that says, pay attention to me?
712680	713680	Anyway.
713680	715440	Flip side of the argument is...
715440	719400	Oh, by the way, audio archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment, because
719400	720400	they don't know you're here yet.
720400	721400	So hi, Drew Nami.
721400	727040	Flip side of the argument is, okay, they're showing how easily it can be Photoshopped,
727040	731880	showing how easily the people who are bringing it to court could be faking it with quote
731880	733360	unquote photographic evidence.
733360	735360	Oh, yeah, I don't have a problem with the demonstration.
735360	737320	There could be a public service in that way.
737320	739120	I don't, I don't, I don't mind that.
739120	742440	I don't mind when they're saying, hey, look, look how easily this can be faked.
742440	745660	I mind the people that are trying to pass off the fake things as real.
745660	747880	That's what I mind.
747880	755520	They're the same people, they are in the same category as people who sell PS3s on eBay.
755520	756720	We can't go back to that subject.
756720	757720	We'll be here all night.
757720	758720	All right.
758720	759720	Well, how about some good news?
759720	760720	Yes, please.
760720	762800	Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?
762800	764280	Please say Kid Icarus.
764280	765280	Not yet.
765280	766280	Guardian Legend.
766280	767280	Crystalis.
767280	768280	Blaster Master.
768280	769280	Bible Adventure.
769280	770280	No.
770280	776800	Street Fighter II is, the World Warrior is going to be heading to, Capcom finally loves
776800	777800	us.
777800	778800	Another, though.
778800	781600	But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.
781600	782600	Yeah.
782600	783600	So what?
783600	787800	But a number of other games are going to be coming.
787800	794120	There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch Out, and hey Rob, Kid Icarus.
794120	795120	Fuck yes.
795120	796120	Thank you.
796120	802320	So, but Capcom is starting to eke him out.
802320	803320	We love you, Capcom.
803320	804320	Sort of.
804320	805320	Leave my phone.
805320	807520	Hold on a minute.
807520	811240	If Street Fighter II comes out on virtual console, this will cost me eight dollars,
811240	812240	yes?
812240	813240	Yeah.
813240	818000	Could I not for two dollars more get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on
818000	823580	Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?
823580	826000	What if you don't own an Xbox?
826000	827000	Okay.
827000	828960	But that would be the only reason you should get this then.
828960	832680	Because if you have an Xbox- Not everybody is in the same financial bracket
832680	834440	or nerdom as us.
834440	836000	No, I understand that.
836000	837000	That's fine.
837000	840440	I'm just saying, if you're in the- Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.
840440	842920	You have them both, okay?
842920	844000	Seriously.
844000	845000	Why would you buy this?
845000	846000	Why not?
846000	847000	Why not?
847000	851160	Well, because you have a better version for two dollars more on the 360.
851160	852160	Rob.
852160	853160	What?
853160	854160	I have it on MAME.
854160	855160	I have it on the Genesis.
855160	857920	Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.
857920	861560	I have it on the fucking Saturn.
861560	863600	And you'll buy this on virtual console?
863600	864600	Probably.
864600	865600	You sad, sad woman.
865600	866600	Rob.
866600	867600	Why would you buy Metal Slug?
867600	868600	I don't really.
868600	872360	Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?
872360	874080	I have Metal Slug on Wii.
874080	879600	I hope- Why would people buy horse turds?
879600	881400	Because they like the PlayStation 3.
881400	882400	Because they're large and smelly.
882400	883400	Because they like to beat them to their dogs.
883400	884400	Seriously.
884400	888400	Hey, Chaz, you want some ice for that burn?
888400	889400	Anyways.
889400	890400	Seriously.
890400	891400	All right.
891400	892720	Well, I hope that game comes out soon.
892720	898560	Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working
898560	903240	on another Zelda title for the Wii.
903240	908800	This one that they were making on GameCube was just going on and stuff, but this whole
908800	911880	time since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back
911880	915480	and made the Wii Hansmans or whatever you want to call it.
915480	918200	This all- It really does look like a GameCube game on
918200	919200	the Wii.
919200	922440	Well, that there is another Zelda game possibly sooner than you might think.
922440	926320	This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnezine.
926320	927320	Very interesting.
927320	930040	I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.
930040	931620	I like the way it looked.
931620	935680	The cel shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't
935680	941160	really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to
941160	945480	go to make a really good-looking game.
945480	947480	Hope for that.
947480	953080	Now, I mentioned I think a few weeks ago that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but
953080	957760	of course, if you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that,
957760	968200	you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit WirelessSensorBar.com,
968200	973040	and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt
973040	974040	battery.
974040	983860	It can give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play, so interesting if you have a projection screen
983860	987680	set up for your Wii, definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than
987680	991800	the cord there, so that might be the way to go.
991800	999040	Or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy.
999040	1006120	Speaking of other things for the Wii, now this makes me particularly happy.
1006120	1011080	It's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii, and for anyone who doesn't know,
1011080	1017960	the freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on
1017960	1019680	your system.
1019680	1025040	I've got one for my GameCube, fabulous thing, I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul
1025040	1032400	Calibur thanks to that, and I have not yet tried my freeloader on the Wii, because our
1032400	1038260	Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house, but they don't
1038260	1042820	have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is,
1042820	1062560	I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games,
1062560	1066880	because you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did, but one way or another, Europe
1066880	1071360	has sold a lot of Wii's, you know, it just recently launched over there this past week,
1071360	1079020	and they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days, and of course, just like here in the US, Zelda
1079020	1084420	Twilight Princess, being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying
1084420	1091340	off shelves at the retail price of 179 pounds, by the way, that's $350 US, and considering
1091340	1095880	we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas
1095880	1099180	getting screwed a little bit on the price point, sorry guys, don't know what to tell
1099180	1100180	you.
1100180	1106900	So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii, I know people that might not
1106900	1114560	have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter,
1114560	1121140	but fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB ethernet
1121140	1130460	device with, from actual, like Newegg, they're selling one for $19.99, and it's an ethernet
1130460	1140580	adapter that you can buy, it's Kinemax USB 2.0 to RJ45 fast ethernet 10-100 base T network
1140580	1146140	adapter, that's a pretty long name there, but at least that's going to be out now, whereas
1146140	1151740	the USB one from Nintendo probably won't be out until next year, so if you need wired
1151740	1154740	internet, that's the way to go.
1154740	1159180	I thought my friend had this whole thing already, like the Nintendo already had this stuff out
1159180	1161940	on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?
1161940	1165540	Well, that's the Wi-Fi Max, that's that USB thing for wireless internet, this actually
1165540	1169500	plugs into your Wii, and converts one of the USB ports to an ethernet port.
1169500	1173280	Oh, okay, I get it, so it works the other way, instead of plugging it into your computer,
1173280	1174940	you plug it into the Wii, I get it.
1174940	1180100	Well, this is not for a wireless internet, this is wired internet, it's just a converter.
1180100	1183660	Does it work if you have a USB router?
1183660	1187060	I don't know, that's a good question.
1187060	1189020	Try it, find out.
1189020	1193180	Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email, because we
1193180	1195140	like to read emails every week here on this program.
1195140	1204060	One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lawns Radio is that it's not just
1204060	1208100	us, because we're just some people on the internet just like you, and we know you have
1208100	1211860	an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and
1211860	1213580	one of those is the mailbag.
1213580	1216700	Dark Sakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of her favorite emails
1216700	1220660	and shares them with you in our little segment we call the mailbag.
1220660	1221660	Mailbag at OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
1221660	1230180	First email comes from our friend AZHP.
1230180	1235980	Hey, OLR, I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called the
1235980	1240700	year ahead in tech by some research analysts, a choice quote from it.
1240700	1244460	Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.
1244460	1246380	I should tell that to my co-workers.
1246380	1249660	Please do.
1249660	1253500	Sony will end up with egg on its face as Konami releases a Metal Gear game.
1253500	1259100	I only coveted Sony Playstation exclusive on the Microsoft Xbox 360.
1259100	1264420	Sony will also dramatically cut the price of its PSP handheld as a result of the constant
1264420	1266940	beating administered by the Nintendo DS Lite.
1266940	1271640	Microsoft will either cut or even completely eliminate the cost of its Xbox Live Gold online
1271640	1273540	gaming service.
1273540	1275940	So that was the quote.
1275940	1277220	I would actually believe that.
1277220	1279020	How do people this stupid get jobs?
1279020	1280220	I would believe it.
1280220	1281780	Well, let me finish reading.
1281780	1285180	Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot
1285180	1286180	this guy is.
1286180	1288860	I would myself, but the email would get too long.
1288860	1295420	Your show is now some of it.
1295420	1299260	I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.
1299260	1304660	However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii, on a Wii game coming up, I have a
1304660	1310380	feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii or a game in the metal in the Metal
1310380	1311380	Gear family.
1311380	1314940	I get the sense that Konami is willing to risk something on every platform.
1314940	1319500	So I think it will be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear
1319500	1322180	thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami
1322180	1324220	and some of the other big publishers.
1324220	1330460	In regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down that they would make online competitive
1330460	1334440	play free for everyone, that's actually come up before speculation-wise.
1334440	1336660	So this person is actually not saying anything new.
1336660	1342340	This whole thing started when gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier,
1342340	1345900	and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star universe beta.
1345900	1349660	Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different
1349660	1350900	direction for a while now.
1350900	1352580	So that's nothing new, actually.
1352580	1355420	I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially
1355420	1360100	if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these Xbox Live kits and stuff and now
1360100	1363700	you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.
1363700	1368980	I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining
1368980	1370740	the bandwidth.
1370740	1376060	I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for, so I think
1376060	1379660	the competitive play is going to stay on gold and you're still going to have to pay for
1379660	1380660	it.
1380660	1384020	You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three
1384020	1385620	months and then it's free afterwards.
1385620	1387980	That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?
1387980	1390700	I don't think it would work, not in the long run.
1390700	1393180	These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.
1393180	1394180	They are.
1394180	1400720	However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver
1400720	1401720	and silver.
1401720	1403980	That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.
1403980	1406500	They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there, why the hell not?
1406500	1409660	It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.
1409660	1413820	Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind
1413820	1414820	of game.
1414820	1416060	You just buy the game.
1416060	1417060	Yeah.
1417060	1421460	I wish it had more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.
1421460	1425740	There's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you
1425740	1430060	don't have to pay some monthly fee for and I think a lot of people would be looking for
1430060	1437060	something like that.
1460060	1478460	I
1478460	1482580	was thinking about this whole PS3 versus Wii thing everyone is going off about and how
1482580	1487260	Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.
1487260	1488260	Too true.
1488260	1493820	Well, I have an analogy, an analogy also has the word anal in it.
1493820	1496940	Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo Generations.
1496940	1500940	Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.
1500940	1505580	Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader
1505580	1507420	except better.
1507420	1508580	Everyone knew what Nintendo was.
1508580	1514540	Well, after those generations look at Nintendo now, they aren't exactly cheerleader worthy
1514540	1518580	anymore even though this could change this generation.
1518580	1520700	Could the same thing happen to Sony?
1520700	1525620	Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.
1525620	1529080	Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his bot
1529080	1531580	the death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?
1531580	1533460	He doesn't understand.
1533460	1539780	I could kick his ass at any day and he knows it so there's no problem there.
1539780	1543380	I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit just like Nintendo's did
1543380	1546140	after the Super Nintendo, they are already freaking headed that way.
1546140	1550860	So what do the world famous hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, www.orangetownsradio.com, think
1550860	1551860	of this.
1551860	1557220	PS, put an M in the middle of the PS and that's what Rob is going through right now, oh snap
1557220	1558220	for reals.
1558220	1559220	PMS3?
1559220	1564580	Is that like some advanced form of PMS?
1564580	1566780	Like it's mute to elbow.
1566780	1568780	Jiranami says it's PMS Beyond.
1568780	1569780	Alright, anyway.
1569780	1570780	It's UPMS.
1570780	1571780	We built PMS.
1571780	1578740	Yeah, but I think that Sony is already heading down the pooper.
1578740	1581860	In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons.
1581860	1585500	Just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?
1585500	1589060	And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when when we were doing the separate
1589060	1594020	program one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360 people were comparing it to Dreamcast
1594020	1598620	and I think the 360 is showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast so
1598620	1602940	it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence and one
1602940	1608740	could say that Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo
1608740	1613300	64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge based and didn't go
1613300	1619240	on to the CD and all that stuff and one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake
1619240	1623940	here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat but it's still too soon to tell.
1623940	1628700	The war ain't over yet, like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one so you
1628700	1634500	never know what games might come out next year.
1634500	1643260	I actually liked Blu-ray but I liked Betamax too and what happened to that, bastards?
1643260	1649460	And you know what's funny, price aside, UMD's not bad either, price aside, that's the one
1649460	1650460	problem I have with UMD.
1650460	1657100	But now you go to Tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.
1657100	1662260	Next one comes up from Misty, hey everyone, what's up, Misty here, thanks to the Podlines
1662260	1667180	service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th St. Louis
1667180	1669700	time of course because I was up anyway.
1669700	1674740	Like usual on my days off from work I slept quite late, amen to that, I made it to the
1674740	1679300	library before dark but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading
1679300	1683620	the podcasts and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's
1683620	1687300	no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.
1687300	1692060	Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again, with a combination of the game center,
1692060	1696780	the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online, heck
1696780	1701120	I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.
1701120	1705540	With that gone though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little
1705540	1708660	time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.
1708660	1713260	That tends to get me out at about midnight or 1am depending on the day, being too wired
1713260	1716960	for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late
1716960	1719620	as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.
1719620	1721900	I can sympathize with that.
1721900	1727420	I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime
1727420	1730140	convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.
1730140	1732140	Aren't you going to ASUN?
1732140	1733140	Me?
1733140	1734140	Yeah.
1734140	1735140	Yes I am.
1735140	1736140	Chris will be at ASUN.
1736140	1737140	I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio.
1737140	1738140	Sweet.
1738140	1741260	She's going to have some promo cards.
1741260	1742260	In April we'll talk.
1742260	1743260	Absolutely.
1743260	1745980	Well, that's where the rest of this is where this email is heading.
1745980	1749580	That reminds me, the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening
1749580	1752340	to, from Podlines from my cell phone.
1752340	1755800	I know this may be a stupid idea, but what the hell, I'm going to say it, why not come
1755800	1757700	to ASUN and do a panel or something?
1757700	1761580	I know the timing is not the best considering it's so soon after SakuraCon and halfway across
1761580	1764380	the country, but at least my conscience is clear on the subject.
1764380	1768940	Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing because remember, we don't get paid for doing
1768940	1774340	this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing
1774340	1775340	houses do.
1775340	1777340	Hey, folks who run ASUN, send me a ticket.
1777340	1778420	I'll come out and do a panel.
1778420	1781300	But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart because she's already going for
1781300	1784980	other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.
1784980	1789100	I will go there and I will hand out lots of flyers.
1789100	1791820	Actually I was thinking, I was going to ask you guys permission if I could get a shirt
1791820	1792820	that said OLR on it.
1792820	1793820	Of course.
1793820	1794820	I could go around and people will know who I am.
1794820	1796820	Hopefully by that time next year, we'll have official shirts.
1796820	1798540	That's been an on and off again topic.
1798540	1801220	And I'm going to be doing interviews and stuff like that because I really...
1801220	1802220	Just look for the blue hair.
1802220	1803220	Look for the blue hair.
1803220	1806100	Yeah, I will have blue streaks in my hair, so I've got to have brown and powder blue
1806100	1807100	hair.
1807100	1810820	By the way, I also want to mention that what Misty refers to the Podline service is... Now
1810820	1812100	we don't support this.
1812100	1814700	This is another organization, but I will give it a shout out.
1814700	1818740	Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Lounge Radio over the telephone
1818740	1828080	by calling this number, one for long distance, area code 650-523-6855.
1828080	1830540	Keep in mind that's not an official endorsement of the service.
1830540	1831840	We don't know much about them.
1831840	1837180	All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone,
1837180	1838420	so use at your own risk.
1838420	1843700	It's Podlines.net, but it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks
1843700	1847420	who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that where they can't listen to the show on
1847420	1852240	the go is easier, access to a computer 24-7, so that's kind of neat.
1852240	1858340	This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard,
1858340	1859340	but I'll read it anyway.
1859340	1860340	You're getting drunk.
1860340	1861340	Dude, I'm drunk.
1861340	1862960	I love you, Rob.
1862960	1863960	My girlfriend love you too.
1863960	1864960	Seriously, DMN?
1864960	1865960	That man needs a cookie.
1865960	1872060	DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself into AA, okay?
1872060	1875060	That's all I have to say.
1875060	1879980	And like Britney Spears, put some panties on.
1879980	1881260	Yes, please DMN, put some panties on.
1881260	1884900	That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.
1884900	1890300	Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show, plug, plug, plug.
1890300	1891940	Thank you.
1891940	1898340	Anyway, this one comes from Michael, long time listener, first time emailer.
1898340	1903700	I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style and
1903700	1906460	the vocal mix you played sometime is fantastic.
1906460	1909980	However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.
1909980	1912620	I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate here.
1912620	1914740	Any chance you could help?
1914740	1922780	There is a Vincent de Mor compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, what's the other
1922780	1923780	crap?
1923780	1925300	Fly Away.
1925300	1926300	All of those on it.
1926300	1928460	Some of the dance manias do.
1928460	1931300	So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.
1931300	1937460	Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday
1937460	1941700	night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up, but I didn't say that.
1941700	1946100	No, but seriously though, if you do, and we would encourage that you get the originals,
1946100	1951580	go CD Japan, go to some of the, in fact, I remember seeing on one of the TransNation
1951580	1952580	CDs.
1952580	1962260	I think it was the TransNation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition, has quite a number of
1962260	1965580	really good trance stuff on it and one of them is Flotation.
1965580	1968860	Was it Flotation or was it Fly Away?
1968860	1972380	The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.
1972380	1977500	I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car.
1977500	1981460	And the last one- No, wait, God damn it, Rob left the room.
1981460	1984860	Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.
1984860	1992140	This actually was sent to us by our friend, Rob, with two Bs.
1992140	1997820	It was a story from a blog that he sent us that-
1997820	2008780	Sorry, this won't make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout
2008780	2012340	errors on our end and I don't know if that's live 365 or our fault, so I was just saying
2012340	2016340	in studio if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled because
2016340	2017340	I don't know what's going on.
2017340	2020260	It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.
2020260	2023980	I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us because it sends me several.
2023980	2027660	Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.
2027660	2041580	Gama Sutra posted a story about Activision, it's the NIMF e-grade given to a ESRB, and
2041580	2045060	let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.
2045060	2049820	Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB, so basically, and it's a really
2049820	2056060	good article and I'm gonna link it in the chat room, but basically parents support the
2056060	2061220	ESRB, they think it's a good idea, certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think,
2061220	2065740	makes it easier for them to be able to judge what their children are playing, I think it's
2065740	2066740	a good idea.
2066740	2075620	Now, this last one is interesting, I'm going to read it and Rob has to pay attention.
2075620	2076940	Maybe I should let Chris read it.
2076940	2077940	No.
2077940	2078940	Okay.
2078940	2081100	The whole point was for you to read it, dammit.
2081100	2083860	This was sent to us by Chris.
2083860	2084860	Hi.
2084860	2088540	Hi guys, it's me, Chris.
2088540	2092860	I'm a big lesbian, I did not say that.
2092860	2095380	It's true, but I didn't say that.
2095380	2097580	People sure attract some weirdos.
2097580	2102860	Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, writing in a sleigh, he asked me
2102860	2105220	to send you this email.
2105220	2111500	Dear OLR crew, you wrote ORL?
2111500	2112500	It was the guy.
2112500	2113500	Yeah.
2113500	2115900	On your laptop.
2115900	2116900	Good evening, OLR.
2116900	2118980	Oh, and good evening, chat room.
2118980	2122620	I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.
2122620	2126620	It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room, that they detected
2126620	2127620	a strange anomaly.
2127620	2132580	It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in, all for your radio show, hoping for the
2132580	2134260	best in the new year.
2134260	2137900	This had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.
2137900	2141100	After a while it came to me, I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift
2141100	2148300	that I hope will be of use to help your show.
2148300	2151860	From the wishes of the chat room, to the wishes of the message board, to the wishes of the
2151860	2155420	listeners not known, all have a very special gift for you.
2155420	2158900	To Sky Loki and Dark Sakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year.
2158900	2162700	From SCPS, I left the gift with a strange blue haired girl.
2162700	2164820	She should be handing it to you right now.
2164820	2166380	And you have to open it.
2166380	2167940	Oh my.
2167940	2169900	People attract the weirdest of guys.
2169900	2170900	Oh my.
2170900	2171900	That's old.
2171900	2173300	That's Rob that attracted me.
2173300	2178140	You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air, and I said,
2178140	2179140	was he hot?
2179140	2182260	That's the question I asked.
2182260	2185080	Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show, and the first question
2185080	2187580	I go, was he hot?
2187580	2191420	No, you like old dudes?
2191420	2197540	Am I okay to open this?
2197540	2201060	It's an envelope, two O-L-R from Santa and the fans.
2201060	2204020	Oh, I licked it, sorry.
2204020	2207020	Do you have an oil fixation?
2207020	2208020	Yeah.
2208020	2209020	No, really.
2209020	2210020	Hurry up, Rob.
2210020	2211020	I'm trying.
2211020	2212020	I don't want to ruin it.
2212020	2213020	No, no, no, no.
2213020	2214020	Yes, please.
2214020	2224020	Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.
2224020	2242180	Chris, I- I didn't do it, Santa did.
2242180	2245660	I'm just not paying attention to anything, I'm actually looking.
2245660	2253580	I don't know what to say, I'm- Wow, that old guy was cool.
2253580	2254580	Are you sure?
2254580	2269980	I don't know what to say, I'm- This is embarrassing, in a way.
2269980	2274800	Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their
2274800	2275800	bodies, so-
2275800	2284580	For stuff that you need, because you guys said that you wanted to do a lot of promotion
2284580	2290740	and you guys might need some stuff, so I thought that I would- it's from the chat room and
2290740	2294380	from everybody, because it would be really hard to email every single person to ask if
2294380	2295540	they could donate.
2295540	2300660	So this is for anything that you guys might need, any trips you guys want to send, any
2300660	2303740	equipment that you might need, or something you want to buy.
2303740	2306300	So that's what it is for.
2306300	2308300	Can I say what it is?
2308300	2311380	It's- I guess you could call it- It's right there.
2311380	2317580	I'm throwing it up, throwing it around the whole place.
2317580	2324380	I guess you could call it seed money to take a well art to the next level, and something
2324380	2330640	I think a lot of us always like, we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.
2330640	2340460	It was always- No, I'm sorry, I'm just overwhelmed.
2340460	2341460	Bandit's on the right track.
2341460	2348160	It's a- Oh, you're on the right track, I'll put it that way.
2348160	2351900	It's basically $4,000 in seed money.
2351900	2355420	It sounds so strange to say.
2355420	2363860	That kind of- Just to bring you guys to do what we do here, and really be able to take
2363860	2364860	this to the next level.
2364860	2369540	Oh God, I'm so embarrassed that- I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her
2369540	2376380	permission to service you.
2376380	2380020	I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.
2380020	2385060	I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I didn't
2385060	2387980	know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about, you guys want to do
2387980	2391780	all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could
2391780	2392780	do that.
2392780	2397660	It's for promotion, it's for anything you guys want to use it for, completely at your
2397660	2398660	disposal.
2398660	2399660	Thank you so much.
2399660	2400660	Strippers.
2400660	2401660	I don't know where to begin.
2401660	2402660	I don't know where to begin.
2402660	2403660	Yeah, strippers.
2403660	2408740	Now, it's kind of like that I'm looking at this, I'm like, I don't know.
2408740	2409740	I don't know where to begin.
2409740	2412820	I think we need to set up that account now.
2412820	2421140	I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now, and maybe we'll
2421140	2425580	be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon, who knows, I don't know, but thank you
2425580	2426580	so much.
2426580	2430620	Consider it on your hands.
2430620	2432620	Thank you.
2432620	2435420	Are you okay, Loki?
2435420	2438540	I'm not even looking at chat, I don't even want to know.
2438540	2444460	I don't buy all games.com, I don't think that's going to be happening.
2444460	2449300	And it's telling us to drop by 365.
2449300	2456260	That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.
2456260	2457500	My heart's racing very quickly.
2457500	2463980	I know, I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of, no, it's fine, it's fine, I don't
2463980	2466660	know what to say.
2466660	2471100	This just doesn't happen.
2471100	2472100	But it is.
2472100	2480460	I know, I know, I just don't know what to say, I'm sorry.
2480460	2481460	He's a little...
2481460	2483740	Read another fucking email, all right?
2483740	2485140	That was the last email.
2485140	2490180	God damn it, read another one, make something up, make something up.
2490180	2494800	Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.
2494800	2497340	Love the queen.
2497340	2500300	You play everything on Doctor Who.
2500300	2501980	All you would play is Doctor Who.
2501980	2504020	We'd have BBC Who.
2504020	2505020	No.
2505020	2508180	Anyways, I'll take it from here.
2508180	2511500	Please do, if I had a story up, somebody else needs to do that, I'm sorry.
2511500	2513220	I'll make up a story.
2513220	2515900	So anyways, we've got some pretty interesting stuff.
2515900	2522860	If you happen to have some sort of Bluetooth device, whether it be a USB support for your
2522860	2529620	computer or laptop, etc., you can actually exchange Miis.
2529620	2533980	There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Miis to your remote, which you can do
2533980	2541780	via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Miis exchange.
2541780	2551580	It's actually available on wimodwi.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Miis, and you
2551580	2556800	can actually submit your Miis there that you've created, as well as download other celebrity
2556800	2564260	Miis, including such things as Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca,
2564260	2570380	Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc., God, Harry Potter.
2570380	2572300	So definitely check that out.
2572300	2576540	Of course you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that, and available also
2576540	2581740	on wimodwi.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that,
2581740	2585180	and it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.
2585180	2586340	So definitely worth checking out.
2586340	2591380	I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have
2591380	2593780	Chuck Norris on my Wii console.
2593780	2594780	That is a requirement.
2594780	2596780	Chuck Norris would shatter your Wii.
2596780	2600860	Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story, and then I'm going to run
2600860	2602860	out of the room for a minute.
2602860	2609860	Something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement
2609860	2614020	of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.
2614020	2617660	Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this
2617660	2623100	week, and the big shock, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.
2623100	2629740	These games are of biblical proportions in Japan, but the fact that Dragon Quest IX protectors
2629740	2634980	of the starry sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.
2634980	2638740	It will feature 3D graphics, there were some screenshots released, it looks very similar
2638740	2646500	in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was recently out on the PlayStation 2, and they are trying
2646500	2649940	to make it ready by 2007.
2649940	2659340	By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade game called Dragon Quest Monster Battle
2659340	2660340	Road.
2660340	2663940	Both these games being developed by Level 5.
2663940	2669100	This brings up a good point, and I hate Sony bashing, but I got to mention this.
2669100	2672800	There's games that come out on the DS and stuff, it's like games that you're looking
2672800	2674380	forward to coming out.
2674380	2678140	Can you name a game that you're looking forward to coming out on the PSP?
2678140	2680020	I can't, and that's pretty sad.
2680020	2685340	I own a PSP, and to be honest, I play the PSP a lot more than my DS, and I've pretty
2685340	2690060	much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Brothers and Mario Kart,
2690060	2697100	and I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have
2697100	2698100	games.
2698100	2702060	It's just a lot of filler, it seems like, a lot of ports of stuff that end up on the
2702060	2708900	PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or ooh, Final Fantasy.
2708900	2712340	I think that's why their system is not doing this well.
2712340	2717940	Ereto says Silent Hill Origins.
2717940	2723020	We just have another Untold Legends, or other Dynasty Warriors...
2723020	2727740	It's GS-191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon
2727740	2729740	Quest IX for DS.
2729740	2737700	Enus is going to sue somebody now.
2737700	2739500	So I don't know what else to say about that.
2739500	2742740	I was pretty surprised to hear that myself, because I don't know, I'm so used to playing
2742740	2746020	Dragon Quest on my television, but then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon
2746020	2750420	Quest on the Game Boy years ago, I mean, they ported one too, and all that.
2750420	2753380	There will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii, so...
2753380	2756900	Ooh, I forgot about that, that's right, that was supposed to be a launch title.
2756900	2759940	I think it was in Japan, so...
2759940	2760940	All right.
2760940	2765500	Well, I definitely want to check this out, I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on
2765500	2770140	the DS, I don't see any... you know, Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate
2770140	2773140	very well to the DS, I don't see why this will be a problem.
2773140	2775260	It's Toriyama, you can't go wrong with him.
2775260	2779940	I think it'll be good, and also that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it,
2779940	2781540	which is good news.
2781540	2783540	Call Blimey!
2783540	2791600	Anyways, so, now, bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for
2791600	2799980	you guys, I thought I'd bring this up, you can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain
2799980	2804740	program, you can make your Wii sound like a light saber when you swing it around.
2804740	2808940	Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why did someone create this?
2808940	2814980	For the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so, you know, the prevent from dropping it
2814980	2818860	on the ground, it senses that it's falling and shuts it off or whatever.
2818860	2827420	So that tilt sensor, using the app, you can actually, with the Darwin remote program,
2827420	2832700	and run this program called Wii Saber, and it's basically flinging your remote around
2832700	2836860	and makes the sounds of a light saber.
2836860	2840420	Completely useless, but I guess fun if you have a Mac and a Wii.
2840420	2844660	I foresee an entirely new generation of Star Wars, kid.
2844660	2846380	Oh, God.
2846380	2847380	Wii Saber.
2847380	2848380	Heaven help us all.
2848380	2851460	Well, how about I redeem the world now?
2851460	2852460	Please do.
2852460	2856380	Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you
2856380	2858220	know who Kevin Smith is.
2858220	2859220	Yes.
2859220	2862860	Noggin of the nooch.
2862860	2867460	That talk, well, he's interested in making a game based on J.N.
2867460	2869460	Silent Bob.
2869460	2876560	To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining,
2876560	2880840	basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make
2880840	2883220	the levels and stuff in it.
2883220	2887140	So he basically is going to be concept director.
2887140	2896320	Well, I think that Joystick pointed out something very good on this, that the things going against
2896320	2902300	him is the types of dialogue that he's known for and the types of humor that go in the
2902300	2904780	game, that will go in his stories.
2904780	2910060	I think it would definitely be an older crowd he'd cater to.
2910060	2916700	And I mean, I love how they say, especially if the game is based off of Blutland and Chronic,
2916700	2921760	it should definitely go, he should do it, but it's going to be an M game.
2921760	2923500	And that's great.
2923500	2925500	So she had Dogma the game.
2925500	2928380	We have to, that'd be awesome.
2928380	2932020	We have to fight legions of angels.
2932020	2934220	And with Alanis says God.
2934220	2939420	Do we get to watch Muse strip because we are not going to watch him do the silence of the
2939420	2940420	lambs dance.
2940420	2941420	No Muse.
2941420	2942420	No Muse.
2942420	2943420	Serendipity.
2943420	2944420	Oh, I thought you meant.
2944420	2945420	Selma Hayek, man.
2945420	2946420	Okay.
2946420	2948140	I thought you were talking about Jason Muse because they refer to him by his last name
2948140	2949140	in there.
2949140	2950140	Oh, no, no, no, no.
2950140	2951140	The Muse.
2951140	2952140	Serendipity.
2952140	2953140	Yeah.
2953140	2954140	Oh, yeah.
2954140	2955140	Boobies.
2955140	2956140	Well.
2956140	2957140	Boobies.
2957140	2961960	You know what, James Tom Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be
2961960	2966180	a collective nerdgasm heard around the world in this type of game.
2966180	2967180	Oh, my God.
2967180	2968180	Seriously.
2968180	2969180	Okay.
2969180	2970180	Wow.
2970180	2977220	Well, going to the complete opposite end of the spectrum into things maybe we don't want
2977220	2979020	to hear about.
2979020	2980820	Get this.
2980820	2984740	And I'm looking at something that's for sale at Barcade.com.
2984740	2987060	It's created by a company called Baytech Games.
2987060	2992700	It's an arcade version of American Idol Superstar.
2992700	2996140	It has a, quote, fun and addicting light pattern game.
2996140	2999460	It has artwork and audio from the American Idol game.
2999460	3004820	What you do is you press a stop button to light five stars in a row for a prize or you
3004820	3009260	can continue on and play for a stupid prize, a super prize.
3009260	3011580	You can go along and play for a super prize.
3011580	3016340	Once you get the light pattern down, you know, you can get it and light up all the things.
3016340	3019440	And if you get the super prize, though, it's a lot more difficult to be going for that.
3019440	3023840	So it's another one of those freaking ticket redemption games based off of American Idol.
3023840	3026900	Kill it with fire.
3026900	3032420	After all, they have this ticket game based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.
3032420	3038180	No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick
3038180	3044060	in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.
3044060	3049700	To quote DJ Dark Knight, NOOOOOOO!
3049700	3054260	And also, to get back on a previous subject, to quote Gara who Drive Car, Ma rats the game,
3054260	3056620	remove the kids sitting on the escalator level.
3056620	3062700	Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American
3062700	3069420	Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great
3069420	3074420	arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur IIIs that could be in these arcades, the Time
3074420	3080420	Crisis IVs, the DDR Supernovas, that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.
3080420	3083420	And does this piss you off as much as it does us?
3083420	3093700	Because it makes us so mad we have to rant large the FUs of the week, Dark Sakura.
3093700	3101020	The first FU of the week goes to Extrofer for not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity
3101020	3105420	photo shoot butt bleaching.
3105420	3110260	We were going to get Extrofer a gift certificate for intimate photographs.
3110260	3113940	And an anal bleaching.
3113940	3115540	That fell through.
3115540	3121340	I would however like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful
3121340	3123980	facial responses from my husband.
3123980	3125620	It was gorgeous.
3125620	3153940	Watching Dan's quorum makes me happy sometimes.
3153940	3155780	This one's definitely for Nellie.
3155780	3161540	Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she
3161540	3170140	could buy candy and had to count out her like four dollars worth of purchases with pennies
3170140	3176060	in front of us slowly and she kept messing up and had to recount them.
3176060	3177060	It was horrible.
3177060	3179180	That's why you get paper rolls first.
3179180	3183460	When I was in college we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll
3183460	3184460	them and then go to the movies.
3184460	3189220	She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.
3189220	3190220	I know the rules.
3190220	3192900	I hope you don't mind me saying that.
3192900	3196820	We used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went
3196820	3197820	where we were going.
3197820	3204140	See that's what considerate people would do but you forget she's a dumb bitch.
3204140	3208780	I had something but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.
3208780	3213060	So no it's fine trust me.
3213060	3217660	I guess my F.U. would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on a radio
3217660	3218660	program.
3218660	3219660	I'm so sorry.
3219660	3220660	I'm so sorry.
3220660	3221660	No, no, no.
3221660	3229940	Please, please don't feel sorry.
3229940	3233780	I had a serious F.U. and I seriously oh I know what it was I just remembered it I finally
3233780	3236540	remembered it and F.U. did in fact I didn't go to bed until six thirty in the morning
3236540	3241820	yesterday because that's my own downfall but it doesn't make me feel any better because
3241820	3243660	my Sunday is like completely gone.
3243660	3247460	Uh oh wait oh hello we still have other people that have to do their F.U.s.

3504900	3511100	PlayStation 3 or you know a 360 or even a Wii for that matter what can you do what can
3511100	3517300	you do well you can buy retro and you know for the same matter why bother buying virtual
3517300	3521900	console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on so shop
3521900	3528540	eBay shop your local thrift stores find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper
3528540	3535820	hell go to if you're in the California area here go visit a tower or hell I think around
3535820	3540980	the they're all around the country but visit our records they're closing down so I get
3540980	3547020	some old ass games there if they have some used stuff but yeah eBay is your friend you
3547020	3550220	can find lots of consoles for cheap especially when people are trying to earn some extra
3550220	3556060	money to buy the new ones I like eBay eBay has been taking a lot of my money lately well
3556060	3561380	something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800 the system
3561380	3567380	that is most notoriously known breaking you can have a working AC adapter those are pretty
3567380	3575740	hard to come by too but the systems no no no out of five that I've played all of them
3575740	3581940	broke so yeah but some people decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on
3581940	3589980	the 7800 we have pac-man collection for the 7800 and again 7800 is a good system don't
3589980	3599780	get me wrong but it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob decrescendo
3599780	3608540	that don't decrescendo sorry and it includes pac-man puck man hangley man which is the
3608540	3615220	best name ever ultra pac-man random mazes miss pac-man miss pac attack and miss random
3615220	3621100	mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate
3621100	3629260	play options junior pac-man and super pac-man are both missing and it's a $30 package there
3629260	3638700	is a let's see there's apparently the link on Atari age.com you can find it there a new
3638700	3643260	pac-man for a system nobody plays anymore be still my fleeting heart I actually or nobody
3643260	3647580	wants to play because last year god damn much last year we did by super pac-man for as I
3647580	3652860	miss pac-man for the 5200 the prototype well that's a 5200 I know well I love this 200
3652860	3662540	200 is freaking rad it has kicks on it well too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken
3662540	3667620	everybody's is broken no but you know what for somebody who's like an old school gaming
3667620	3672700	collector type thing they are gonna be just simply amazed at this you know and I kind
3672700	3676260	of think pick it up I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something
3676260	3680260	like this you know tease this game all you want but just the fact that there is so much
3680260	3684780	love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together it's pretty
3684780	3692700	rad it's pretty rad anyway what's not so rad is that Nintendo having to do these programs
3692700	3698220	recently we talked about the strap thing earlier in the show well they also this is a full
3698220	3706380	fledged recall in Japan not here but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS lights have
3706380	3712740	been recalled overseas keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do
3712740	3719340	over here so this news does not affect us here in the US but those are being recalled
3719340	3724200	so if you're in Japan you might want to look to your local press for some more information
3724200	3729180	on how you can do that usually you just take it into the store and all that stuff so interesting
3729180	3736780	yes and in case those exploding AC adapters don't kill you well then the Wi-Fi will yes
3736780	3741500	apparently everybody loves you know creating a scare where whether it be you know cell
3741500	3748620	phones causing cancer or you know Xboxes causing home fires or you know stuff like that but
3748620	3757820	now people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing
3757820	3765980	some sort of brain damage or stuff like that why would people actually think this I mean
3765980	3773740	that's like thinking that the earth is flat or that I don't know the that the earth or
3773740	3781300	the Sun revolves around the earth and vice versa people are stupid this is why people
3781300	3787940	will fling remotes at the TV because they're retarded they'll believe this shit you you
3787940	3793420	know what I swear to God when this that whole story with the Wiimotes you know them offering
3793420	3799220	the extra thick strap for the Wiimote so many people at my work came up to me go have you
3799220	3804220	heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things this is a good cross
3804220	3807700	section of the people of the United States you know the people I work with right here
3807700	3812940	and they're all idiots so you know they just unfortunately they were you know getting the
3812940	3819100	story spun by you know God knows what news program and so they didn't get the you know
3819100	3822660	pure facts for it and that's unfortunately how people are gonna see this whole problems
3822660	3826660	and eventually when people catch on this whole Wi-Fi thing that they're gonna be like oh
3826660	3835540	my god oh my god get in the bomb shelter now the world is coming to an end so people suck
3835540	3841660	yes they do but something that doesn't suck of gear is Gears of War the game has broken
3841660	3850060	two million copies worldwide and that's one million in the u.s. alone since the fastest
3850060	3858700	selling next-gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters
3858700	3868780	but basically though there is an official press release put out about this just stating
3868780	3876180	that that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell who's the corporate vice president
3876180	3881300	of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation was saying
3881300	3885780	corporation corporation was saying Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title
3885780	3890820	of must-have a game of the year it's phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360
3890820	3895060	is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday we've always
3895060	3898900	had high hopes for Gears of War but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response
3898900	3902300	from critics and gamers all over the world that's a quote from Michael cap set up at
3902300	3914300	games so that's pretty cool and I also said another fun stat that on Xbox Live that the
3914300	3922340	total of the gameplay sessions online reach 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements

3949340	3953380	gonna do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that it's certainly been a
3953380	3956980	very uh interesting evening if we were gonna share if we were gonna want to do something
3956980	3960460	that we already have a theme song we could do you know Christmas and Hollis what was
3960460	3964580	what's that song that Eazy E did the Christmas was that Christmas in Compton that's it Christmas
3964580	3969420	it was Christmas in Compton all right well Run DMC did um uh Christmas in Hollis all
3969420	3971820	uh... well anyway well you know i get to the uh...
3971820	3975720	voicemail of the week as well
3975720	3978820	uh... we we got a lot of play this real quick a voicemail here
3978820	3983000	uh... that was left us out by a listener we get a lot of voicemails this week a
3983000	3984040	very disappointed
3984040	3987440	one eight seven seven game or and there's a stuff to give away this week
3987440	3987960	too
3987960	3991100	so uh... you know you want to leave us your sony commercial if you don't know
3991100	3993040	what the heck we're talking about the party
3993040	3995420	uh... here's what's going on week
3995420	3998660	either this is the poll and i was just looking a lot to be podcast when you
3998660	4000300	guys were talking about
4000300	4002400	the point system for the week
4002400	4006660	on downloading game and i wanted to note that i actually do have to pay tax i
4006660	4008460	live in nashville tennessee
4008460	4011880	and when i buy point online with my credit card it does charge tax
4011880	4013640	just thought it would be an interesting note
4013640	4015380	you guys later love the show bye
4015380	4018100	interesting so we have yet to really hear thank you for the voicemail by the way
4018100	4020940	we have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down because we know
4020940	4024300	those of us in california aren't paying the tax on the wee points but now we know
4024300	4028060	tennessee our listener here pennsylvania probably some other states are charging
4028060	4032340	very interesting how that's all breaking down not a whole lot set on that
4032340	4033540	it is
4033540	4036680	a transaction you are paying for a service
4036680	4038780	so it's sensible
4038780	4041060	at the same time it's it
4041060	4043780	there's just a little bit of it seems bizarre to me
4043780	4045700	well i just
4045700	4046660	icon
4046660	4049300	i could be curious to know like
4049300	4052380	do you get taxed on xbox points to
4052380	4054740	that would be kind of what i'd be wondering about so
4054740	4058160	uh... and and folks in the other areas as well that are getting taxed on the
4058160	4060380	we points i'm kinda wondering what the differences
4060380	4062580	cuz i'm not taxed on microsoft points either
4062580	4065700	so i'm kinda curious why there'd be a difference what true
4065700	4068260	an internet tax maybe i don't know
4068260	4071460	all right we're gonna go to the skype line right now uh... our username on
4071460	4075240	skype is orange lounge radio and our number one eight seven seven game o l r
4075240	4077780	the calls are already coming in let's go to the first call higher on orange
4077780	4080620	launch radio is this
4080620	4086140	is production hi paradox vincent what's on your mind buddy
4086140	4087140	i
4087140	4089700	discard b mania two d x happy sky
4089700	4093540	uh... that's right i think i've heard i've only heard that i talked to me
4093540	4095620	clinton earlier this week and he had played it
4095620	4099780	uh... and he said it was ok but there's been better releases what are your
4099780	4104140	thoughts on b mania two d x happy sky
4104140	4105080	well
4105080	4107340	wake up a limited edition
4107340	4109560	and uh... i would like that
4109560	4112900	everything the package together was really nice
4112900	4116580	uh... i haven't got a chance to watch the dvd yet because i don't have a
4116580	4118020	region free
4118020	4120020	but the game itself
4120020	4122380	the uh... the skin for it
4122380	4126140	i'd say the great improvement over anything they've ever done
4126140	4128960	and i like the fact that you can change that
4128960	4131960	music when you're selecting the song
4131960	4135180	might only great
4135180	4141180	really be the new difficulty setting but i haven't really gotten used
4141180	4143780	to uh... creating them by twelve
4143780	4144940	that's eight
4144940	4149980	all yeah i was new in happy sky right
4149980	4151360	basically
4151360	4152500	there was uh...
4152500	4153520	i can only
4153520	4156620	play on uh... seven on three x red
4156620	4159460	and there was a really big gap between
4159460	4160660	really easy
4160660	4165860	seven songs and really hard seven songs that's about where i'm at yep
4165860	4166900	yeah
4166900	4172100	that's been pretty much split down between seven and eight difficulty now
4172100	4176660	the song list itself though i was really happy with
4176660	4178300	and uh...
4178300	4181440	my biggest complaint about the songs
4181440	4184300	would be the difficulty of uh...
4184300	4185720	may and zephyr
4185720	4188820	which were my two favorite songs
4188820	4189660	and
4189660	4192340	they're nearly impossible
4192340	4194260	on
4194260	4196100	seventy and another
4196100	4197140	but
4197140	4199280	on white mode
4199280	4201620	they're just too easy
4201620	4206660	interesting so there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there
4206660	4207820	in some songs
4207820	4210420	giant gap in difficulty uh...
4210420	4211580	i think blue
4211580	4214780	blue mirage was another one of those
4214780	4219180	overall i was really happy with it
4219180	4221740	uh... one other quick question i have for you to get a move on to some of the
4221740	4225700	calls what would you say you would like to see konami do if they put out
4225700	4230340	uh... beatmania thirteen or beatmania distorted out on the console would you
4230340	4231340	like to see them
4231340	4235820	what they need to most improve on with their next release
4235820	4242700	most improve on with the next release
4242700	4245140	i stopped you know i'm
4245140	4249500	yeah i'm really happy with the beatmania system
4249500	4252880	and you can't really change the note charts
4252880	4256780	would you like to see an edit mode or something? I don't know
4256780	4259660	edit mode
4259660	4263020	where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can
4263020	4268140	key map them however you want might be interesting
4268140	4269820	if they could make it work
4269820	4271380	that might be interesting
4271380	4272900	i'd say add
4272900	4273960	something new
4273960	4275140	because they have
4275140	4277660	customized now they have class mode
4277660	4281460	they have all these modes and i would really like to see them add
4281460	4283500	some kind of new thing
4283500	4284720	long mixes
4284720	4286200	might be kind of cool too
4286200	4287260	alright we'll see
4287260	4291860	i gotta let you go paradox vincent but thanks so much for the call have a great week alright

4748180	4752180	How can people even think that they would break?
4752180	4755180	Well, because they have been.
4755180	4757180	No, they haven't.
4757180	4762180	Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're
4762180	4763180	breaking, we assume.
4763180	4764180	Not at their own volition.
4764180	4768180	It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.
4768180	4769180	Right.
4769180	4775180	I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one, and I tried it.
4775180	4777180	I could not break it.
4777180	4778180	I tried.
4778180	4779180	I know.
4779180	4782180	I've been kind of, like ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been kind of trying
4782180	4785180	to break mine, and you can't.
4785180	4789180	I don't know how people do it.
4789180	4793180	Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?
4793180	4794180	What kind of games do you want to get with it?
4794180	4795180	Of course, the classic Zelda.
4795180	4800180	At a bit, so I want to try that.
4800180	4802180	Alibits is pretty fun.
4802180	4803180	It's a good game.
4803180	4804180	All right.
4804180	4807180	Well, good luck to you on your Wii Quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.
4807180	4811180	We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.
4811180	4813180	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?
4813180	4815180	Just happy holidays to you guys.
4815180	4816180	Thank you so much.
4816180	4817180	Same to you.
4817180	4819180	I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a Wii under your tree.
4819180	4820180	That would be fun.
4820180	4821180	Oh, yeah.
4821180	4822180	All right.
4822180	4823180	Good luck.
4823180	4824180	Bye.
4824180	4825180	Bye-bye.
4825180	4826180	All right.
4826180	4830180	Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.
4830180	4831180	Hi.
4831180	4832180	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4832180	4833180	Who's this?
4833180	4834180	It's Ron.
4834180	4835180	I finally made it back on my cell phone.
4835180	4836180	Finally.
4836180	4837180	All right.
4837180	4838180	What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?
4838180	4839180	My thing is this.
4839180	4844180	If you're spending so much money on these consoles, it wouldn't kill you to drop an
4844180	4847180	extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.
4847180	4851180	That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through a rigmarole with shipping out
4851180	4856180	the unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the
4856180	4857180	hour.
4857180	4860480	Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.
4860480	4863540	It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to
4863540	4864900	be shoved down my throat.
4864900	4868540	And I'm one of those people that's like, when somebody tells me I have to get something
4868540	4871060	or I need it, I'm like, no.
4871060	4872060	Don't tell me.
4872060	4873060	I don't know.
4873060	4877620	There's a difference between friendly advice and people that are trying to pressure me
4877620	4879600	so much into buying these warranties.
4879600	4884020	And plus, it's tough because you do feel like it's wasted money when you don't use it, and
4884020	4885020	it all adds up.
4885020	4886540	You know what I mean?
4886540	4888140	I know exactly how you mean it.
4888140	4890140	I do this for a living.
4890140	4893260	I sell cameras and laptops and stuff.
4893260	4896540	I tell people about the warranty, and I tell them the positives about it.
4896540	4899620	I tell them, you don't have to get it, but it's just a piece of mind.
4899620	4900700	I completely understand.
4900700	4904340	I never force it like it got in your throat.
4904340	4909380	Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to
4909380	4913180	you by your management, and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?
4913180	4917980	Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own
4917980	4921540	personal experience because I've been dealing with this for a very long time.
4921540	4922540	Fair enough.
4922540	4923540	Fair enough.
4923540	4924540	I mean, but I don't know.
4924540	4927300	I kind of find that the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's
4927300	4931180	faulty, it's going to break in the first few days, but I can understand why people are
4931180	4934580	about the extended warranty, but I don't know.
4934580	4940180	I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.
4940180	4942620	To Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?
4942620	4945940	No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.
4945940	4950860	Well, you know, it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will,
4950860	4951860	you know?
4951860	4952860	All right.
4952860	4953860	Yeah.
4953860	4954860	Rama, we got to let you get over so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for
4954860	4955860	calling us back, all right?
4955860	4956860	All right.
4956860	4957860	Sure.
4957860	4958860	Hey, no problem.
4958860	4959860	Happy holidays.
4959860	4960860	Bye.
4960860	4961860	Do you have something for Rama?
4961860	4962860	No.
4962860	4963860	Oh, all right.
4963860	4964860	Do you have something here in town?
4964860	4965860	She'll give it to you later.
4965860	4975540	No, not like that, but I have something to play for people because this is what's on
4975540	4981260	my mind about work tomorrow.
4981260	4983780	You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.
4983780	4984780	That's all right.
4984780	4985780	A lot of people do.
4985780	4986780	A lot of people do.
4986780	4987780	I'm sure.
4987780	4988780	That's fine.
4988780	4990620	No, I get it, but I have to have it explained to me.
4990620	4994540	All right, anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories,
4994540	4995540	boys and girls.
4995540	4998540	I have a story.
4998540	5000120	Yes.
5000120	5004940	My story has to do with a baseball player.
5004940	5012060	The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaya, actually hurt his arm.
5012060	5018220	He was complaining of aches and pains in his arm because he was playing too much Guitar
5018220	5019220	Hero.
5019220	5023740	When he examined his pain in his forearm, it was determined that it was more like that
5023740	5028580	of the guitar player and suggested that he stopped playing Guitar Hero.
5028580	5031580	It was actually severe masturbation.
5031580	5033580	Fap attack.
5033580	5040460	Anyway, he stopped, improved, and went on to play in the World Series.
5040460	5048100	He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.
5048100	5051820	I thought it was funny.
5051820	5052820	That was pretty funny.
5052820	5055580	Loki, do you have any last-minute stories?
5055580	5057140	Yeah, I have one.
5057140	5059860	This is going to piss people off.
5059860	5065860	With Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan being one of the first
5065860	5069740	online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.
5069740	5071220	Guess what that would be?
5071220	5073340	Another 12-digit friend code.
5073340	5077860	Because apparently the friends list on Pokemon Battle Revolution is different than your normal
5077860	5082820	friends list and you have to swap Wii codes with other people in other places.
5082820	5085300	Oh my god, you've got to be kidding me.
5085300	5087420	I thought they promised one friend code.
5087420	5090020	They just meant for the system itself?
5090020	5092380	Uh, yes.
5092380	5096580	The problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.
5096580	5100820	You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.
5100820	5103660	Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?
5103660	5108380	You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.
5108380	5113780	I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole people afraid about their
5113780	5120200	kids or whatever, but seriously, it's simple enough that both people have to have each
5120200	5123580	other listed before they can even communicate with each other.
5123580	5124580	That's effective enough.
5124580	5125940	End of story.
5125940	5129500	There's no need for this 5,000 friend code stuff.
5129500	5131940	That's horrible.
5131940	5136340	I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?
5136340	5138140	After all, they launched a new next-gen system.
5138140	5139780	Where's that report coming from?
5139780	5142660	Forecolor Rebellion, which they're pretty good at.
5142660	5143660	Respectable Source.
5143660	5144660	Oh, man.
5144660	5145660	That's horrible.
5145660	5152300	Actually, and the other thing too, this is actually Forecolor Rebellion is reporting
5152300	5158880	IGN articles, so that's even better.
5158880	5159980	They don't get it, do they?
5159980	5161460	They just don't get the online.
5161460	5163340	I mean, that's what I'm thinking.
5163340	5166900	Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.
5166900	5169340	Somebody's going to call Nintendo to the carpet over this one.
5169340	5171420	I mean, because this is ridiculous.
5171420	5172980	This whole friend code crap.
5172980	5175900	So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?
5175900	5181100	Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send Miis to each other, which only support
5181100	5184940	one game so far?
5184940	5185940	Very disappointing.
5185940	5188100	Xbox really gets it in the online world.
5188100	5189100	They do.
5189100	5190100	They do.
5190100	5195060	They of course aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't, but of
5195060	5200380	course there is no service to charge for, so I'm just very disappointed.
5200380	5201380	Me too.
5201380	5203060	That's a bad thing to end on.
5203060	5206140	I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.
5206140	5207340	All right.
5207340	5209860	That's a heck of a thing to have as a last minute story.
5209860	5212020	That must have been just late breaking, huh?
5212020	5213940	Was it just posted a little while ago or before we...
5213940	5215940	I think it's today.
5215940	5216940	Interesting.
5216940	5217940	All right.
5217940	5222980	Damn, that's the end of the show, so we're going to go around and give everybody's final
5222980	5223980	thought.
5223980	5230460	Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.
5230460	5234260	Really appreciate it a lot, and do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
5234260	5235740	Oh, me first?
5235740	5236740	Yes.
5236740	5237740	Okay.
5237740	5238740	Happy holidays.
5238740	5241300	I hope everyone has fun.
5241300	5245940	I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so I'll probably...
5245940	5250900	We're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.
5250900	5251900	Cute.
5251900	5253260	That'll be fun.
5253260	5255780	Just have fun, but not too much fun.
5255780	5259700	It's going to be basically, ah, ah.
5259700	5262620	Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.
5262620	5264700	Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.
5264700	5268540	Sorry you didn't get to participate in part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.
5268540	5269540	Any final thoughts?
5269540	5270540	Hey, hey, hey.
5270540	5274300	I didn't know I was invited.
5274300	5275300	You can come whenever.
5275300	5276300	Oh, okay.
5276300	5277300	I'm flattered.
5277300	5280940	Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.
5280940	5281940	All right.
5281940	5284940	Loki, your final thought?
5284940	5288340	My final thought is, I've got to return Far Cry.
5288340	5291500	I'm thinking it's going to suck.
5291500	5295380	My final thought is Banana Muffin.
5295380	5297300	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
5297300	5298300	Exterminate.
5298300	5299300	Exterminate.
5299300	5304300	Okay, I was told one more.
5304300	5305860	Okay.
5305860	5310700	Reject false icons, bitches.
5310700	5311700	I take that back.
5311700	5314180	This is the best Far Cry vengeance trailer I've seen.
5314180	5315500	It has a rabbit in it.
5315500	5319500	And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and Chris is awesome.
5319500	5320500	All right.
5320500	5321500	You're welcome.
5321500	5322500	Just so you guys, I agree.
5322500	5323500	I agree.
5323500	5328220	Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, it's
5328220	5331900	January 7th of 2007, but fear not.
5331900	5335620	I know a lot of you guys listen to our audio archive podcast, audio RSS, whatever the hell
5335620	5336900	you want to call it.

5339420	5343940	So we'll see you on the podcast and until then have a happy holidays, whatever it is
5343940	5347980	you celebrate, even if you don't celebrate anything at all.

5353180	5354180	or whatever.
5354180	5355180	Bite.
5355180	5356180	Yeah.
5356180	5359160	If it doesn't work, try adding a little vodka.
5359160	5360160	Have a great night everybody.
5360160	5361380	We'll see you next time on Orange Laundry.
5361380	5362820	Thank you for supporting independent radio.
5391380	5392380	Bye.
5392380	5421380	Bye.
