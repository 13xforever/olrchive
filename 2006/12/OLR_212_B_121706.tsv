15296	19138	and now the conclusion of this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
19698	22179	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
22279	29522	This is episode number 212 for this December the 17th and we're here with our part B, the last live segment of 2006.
30970	31350	DarkSakura.com
50188	50848	and DarkSakura.com.
79002	81644	Anyhow, let's get back into some news, some gaming news.
83445	86266	Because our live listeners have been waiting a while for us to get back into some gaming news.
86787	88448	This was a huge story this week.
89208	90669	The Nintendo Wiimote.
91049	98073	Now, I got some email messages and some text messages and phones from listeners and people going, Did you hear the Wiis are being recalled?
98413	99974	So somebody hit a panic button.
100175	101495	So we want to clarify right now.
101815	103577	The Wiis were not recalled.
103977	106018	So I realize some people took what happened and ran with it.
106298	119065	What happened is that Nintendo is offering for customers to exchange the old straps, which are six-tenths of a millimeter in diameter, for a new beefed-up strap that is one millimeter in diameter.
119385	127089	This is in response to those people that are breaking their televisions and the Wiis are breaking off and claiming that it's the straps that are causing them to do this.
127129	132812	You've probably seen that site, WeHaveAProblem.com, seeing the people that have been messing up there.
133737	139201	And I was going to say, real quick, I was going to say the old straps, Nintendojo actually tested them.
139562	141823	They withstand about 50 pounds of pressure.
141883	148308	So these people that are breaking these straps are going above and beyond the amount of stress that should be applied to these things.
148388	154553	So it should be said that Nintendo is not recalling, but they're offering this program for anybody who has a concern.
154993	159697	But again, I've been playing the Wii for a long time.
159757	161539	I can't imagine how that thing would break.
161919	162079	Yeah.
163041	164242	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
183067	183928	Mass stupidity.
184568	185609	Think across the board.
185629	186830	You don't think there's flukes out there?
187711	190573	There may be very few, if any.
190773	197398	I think that what it is is you've got people out there who are saying, oh, I'm going to swing this just like a baseball bat.
197979	200040	I'm going to backhand this this way.
200441	205225	I'm going to, you know, attach it to something else and use it, which I've heard of happening.
206486	211970	The thing is that you hardly need a flick of the wrist to do anything on the damn Wii Sports games.
212455	213215	or any of the others.
214536	231864	These people are basically using the system in a way other than I think intent because there was even a warning put out for using the Wiimote and if you give me a moment I'll find it because a friend of mine posted it in her live journal except she replaced Wii with penis.
232484	235565	They basically need to just calm down.
235585	236626	They're really kind of
237617	238358	Okay, question number two
251960	257084	Would you say that Nintendo encourages this behavior from the promotional videos we've seen from the Wii?
257304	265651	Because Nintendo kind of says one thing, that you don't need to move the Wiimote that much, but then you see these videos of people really getting into it when it's on the news and everything.
265912	267433	Is Nintendo encouraging that kind of behavior?
267673	273518	But even though they may be flailing around looking like complete idiots, they are not doing it uncontrollably.
273998	276140	I mean, when they're showing them, you know...
277166	279447	Diving on the couch or whatever to play Wii Tennis.
279768	281568	They're not swinging super hard.
281608	284790	They're just acting like a dipshit and diving across the couch.
285771	291554	Here's the safety information from the Nintendo customer service page.
292334	293975	Safety information for playing Wii.
294075	304160	As you become comfortable with the new and innovative Wii Remote, we would like you to take a few minutes to review some important safety information which, when followed, will help ensure a fun playing experience for all.
304976	305717	Wear the wrist strap.
306077	311363	Make sure that all players using the Wii Remote are wearing the wrist strap and that it has been tightened using the strap lock.
312204	318510	When sharing the Wii Remote between multiple players, be sure that each person using the Wii Remote takes the time to properly put on the wrist strap.
319111	323415	Wearing the wrist strap will help prevent the Wii Remote from flying across the room if you accidentally let go of it during gameplay.
323495	324717	Hold the Wii Remote firmly and do not let go.
328820	334345	Even while wearing the wrist strap, make sure that you don't let go of the Wii Remote during gameplay and do not use excessive motion.
334825	340529	For example, in Wii Sports Bowling, the proper way to let go of the ball while bowling is to release the B button on the Wii Remote.
340810	343512	Do not let go of the Wii Remote itself, in bold letters.
344309	348552	If you're having so much fun that you start perspiring, take a moment to dry your hands.
348632	354337	If you use excessive motion and let go of the Wii Remote, the wrist strap may break and you could lose control of the Wii Remote.
354577	357259	This could injure people nearby or cause damage to other objects.
357559	359501	They said this in their warning.
359881	361222	You people are stupid!
361782	363964	Okay, interesting comments from chat I want to say here.
364024	370389	BearWhoDriveCar says, just like the Guitar Hero 2 commercial, you don't need to act that stupid when you play, but it's a commercial, people.
371385	372428	By the way, I love that nickname.
372488	376316	Oh, wait, I want to say one other comment here real quick from chat.orangehaulsradio.com.
376858	380406	Airtos says, might have been a good idea to put rubber grips on the Wiimote.
381266	381786	Interesting thought.
382126	384587	It doesn't do any good if people are letting go of it anyway.
386428	393510	The combination of excessive motion, letting go of the controller, basically you're dealing with basic laws of physics.
394151	398772	You're pulling against the strain with a greater force than what the rope can handle.
399012	404074	Dark Knight says, stupid Americans, and DJ Morpheus says, do not taunt, happy fun we moat.
409336	409556	Winner.
411021	412281	Alright, question number three.
412681	413942	Will Nintendo get sued over this?
414702	414942	Yes.
415122	415622	Yes, they will.
415722	419323	They will get sued because people are stupid and they'll sue over anything.
419543	419943	Amen.
421043	421463	No, okay.
421803	423004	Will they attempt to get sued?
423064	423224	No.
423244	423844	Will it go through?
423904	424024	No.
424144	431545	Okay, having taken business law... Hold on, I'm getting DarkSakura's soapbox.
431665	432025	Let's see.
432066	433986	I'm going to pull it out of the closet here.
434266	435386	Hey, Rob.
435546	436366	Rob, Rob, Rob.
436386	436566	What?
436686	436947	Shut up.
438627	438967	Anyway...
441167	446972	The whole... Alright, I'm going to actually bring up another case that happened a while back in Oklahoma.
447252	449734	And you don't hold Oklahoma responsible for this, I guess.
450354	452856	There was a little kid walking behind someone using a weed whacker.
453757	457940	And it said, do not allow small children within so many feet of it.
458180	462744	Well, the kid was walking behind his uncle picking up sticks and got his arm chopped off with a weed whacker.
463559	464239	Thank you for watching!
481306	481947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
510489	511570	Fuck simulating, dude.
511590	512870	You'll throw it through someone's head.
513411	513831	Actual murder.
513911	515512	I think there was a YouTube video of that.
515892	517193	Anyway, we welcome your thoughts.
517213	522196	To tell a DDR dollar bill, people don't read the warnings, but that's not Nintendo's fault.
523017	527680	Nintendo's duty and responsibility is to make the warning available.
527760	537946	I'd like to mention, though, actually, there was a thing that they were talking about, you know, federal government agencies looking into this and
538280	547607	and apparently there have been recorded three injuries with the Wiimote that resulted in non-hospitalized injuries.
548848	549668	That is it.
550249	552510	I mean, this isn't like killing people.
552790	556133	This is like, oh, I'm throwing it through the wall, I'm breaking a TV.
557202	560165	I'm, you know, I caused a bruise on my hand that clears up in a week.
560265	561987	I mean, just stupid shit like that.
562007	562948	I just want to say this real quick.
562968	565450	I know we want to keep moving the story, but I think this is an interesting perspective.
566091	570895	Funnydale in our chatroom says, they admitted there was a problem with the straps by offering a recall.
571316	575360	And then goes on to say, first rule in corporate America, never admit that there's a problem.
575660	578082	Well, they didn't... It's a gray area.
578122	580104	They didn't admit there's a problem, per se.
580124	581606	I see this as a cover your ass...
583562	594225	It's the same thing with, remember the Pokemon toys that Burger King was putting out and the babies were suffocating on the ball when it clearly said do not let anyone under three years of age have a Pokeball.
595506	599387	The duty and responsibility was in the parents for allowing their child to have it.
599967	601367	Babymon, I choose you!
602988	605609	But it is a likely thing.
605669	607249	Babies will put stuff in their mouths.
607989	610050	They're learning what their mouth is for, basically.
610772	612793	So it was really the parents' responsibility.
613453	621356	But Burger King still recalled the Pokeballs so that they would not be held further liable for damages.
621837	625778	And I think that Nintendo is trying to take a precautionary step to avoid further problems.
625858	627299	Now, here's the thing I have to ask you.
627339	628679	Oh, we have to keep it moving after this comment.
628780	629540	Okay.
629780	636543	Like, for example, if I have a baseball bat and I throw the baseball bat and it hits someone in the head, I'm responsible for that injury.
637003	639524	I shouldn't be able to sue the baseball bat company...
640922	642683	for the injury caused by that baseball bat.
642863	644544	Same thing goes with the Wiimote.
644664	651529	I think that if you let go of the Wiimote and it flies out of your hand and through your TV, the only person you can blame is yourself because you're an idiot.
653330	654210	It's as simple as that.
654871	663916	Anyways, and speaking of people getting injured with the Wiimotes, not everybody you see on the internet actually injured by a Wiimote is actually injured.
664256	669620	A lot of people are actually photoshopping their injuries with the Wiimotes as would the case be
670713	675174	with one that was posted here on Joystick showing how easily it can be done.
675694	680475	And I got to say, that's pretty sad when you got to do that too.
680555	685316	Yeah, if this is one of you people, if you're one of those people doing it, seriously, screw you.
685436	686216	You're not helping.
687017	689277	I mean, and I hope you don't get any attention from it.
689417	693138	I mean, it's one thing if it's to show off your art skills.
693158	696659	And if you say on it it's a fake or whatever, then fine.
696679	697719	Have fun with your Photoshop skills.
698121	704083	But for those people that are trying to pass it off as legitimate stuff, you know, seriously, screw you.
704623	705624	Because you're not helping.
705644	709185	You're the same people who are the stupid lame people who sell PS3s.
709205	711306	Why don't you make a sign that says pay attention to me?
713506	713766	Anyway.
714207	720129	Flip side of the argument is... Oh, by the way, Audio Archive folks, Drew Nami joined us during the bonus segment because they don't know you're here yet.
720169	720989	So, hi, Drew Nami.
722145	722785	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
755523	756604	We can't go back to that subject.
756664	757484	We'll be here all night.
757524	757805	All right.
758165	759606	Well, how about some good news?
759666	760327	Yes, please.
760647	762528	Guess who's going to be heading to the virtual console?
762648	763649	Please say Kid Icarus.
764210	764610	Not yet.
764690	767172	Guardian Legend, Crystallis, Blaster Master.
767212	768113	Bible Adventure!
770655	770855	No.
771395	776900	Street Fighter 2, the World Warrior, is going to be heading to... Capcom finally loves us.
778181	781283	Another, though... But they love Japan more because it's already out over there.
781423	782164	Yeah, so what?
783170	787334	But a number of other games are going to be coming.
787574	792958	There's Kirby's Adventure, Pilotwings, Punch-Out, and hey, Rob, Kid Icarus.
793959	795160	Fuck yes, thank you.
797282	801405	So, but Capcom is starting to eke them out.
802326	803627	We love you, Capcom, sort of.
804968	805609	Hold on a minute.
807530	810393	If Street Fighter II comes out on Virtual Console, this will cost me $8, yes?
810413	810493	Yeah.
812386	823294	Could I not, for $2 more, get a version on Xbox that will allow me to play folks on Xbox Live, give me more features than the original Super Nintendo version did?
823514	824695	What if you don't own an Xbox?
825916	826196	Okay.
826676	828698	But that would be the only reason you should get this, then.
829258	834322	Because if you have an Xbox... Not everybody is in the same financial bracket or nerddom as us.
834622	835843	No, I understand that.
835903	836363	That's fine.
836744	840166	But I'm just saying, if you're in the... Let's say you're a Wii 60 person.
840386	841367	You have them both, okay?
841387	841467	Yeah.
842606	844607	Seriously, why would you buy this?
846848	847148	Why not?
848008	850470	Because you have a better version for $2 more on the 360.
851290	853071	Rob, I have it on MAME.
854191	855952	I have it on the Genesis.
856372	857673	Yeah, I do have it on Genesis.
858073	859854	I have it on the fucking Saturn.
861494	863075	And you'll buy this on Virtual Console?
863115	863675	Probably.
863715	865096	You sad, sad woman.
865496	867357	Rob, why would anyone buy Metal Slug?
869198	871839	Hey, we just got Metal Slug on Wii, okay?
872520	873960	I have Metal Slug on Wii.
874221	878623	I hope... Why would people buy horse turds?
879383	880944	Because they like the PlayStation 3.
881204	882525	Because they're large and smelly.
883145	886147	They like to feed them to their dogs.
888328	888648	Anyways.
889889	891750	Alright, well, I hope that game comes out soon.
892990	898333	Anyway, word is coming out that Nintendo has actually secretly this whole time been working...
898912	903014	on another Zelda title for the Wii.
903094	914217	This one that they were making on GameCube was going on and stuff, but this whole time, since the GameCube one's kind of been done for a little while, they just went back and made the Wii Handsmans, or whatever you want to call it.
915458	918419	It really does look like a GameCube game on the Wii.
918779	922100	Well, that there is another Zelda game, possibly sooner than you might think.
922360	925922	This whole rumor, by the way, being started by the latest issue of Game Informer Magnesine.
926022	927002	Very interesting.
927478	930000	I want to see another Wind Waker, to be honest.
930060	931341	I like the way it looked.
931601	942988	The cel-shading looked really good on the GameCube, and I think being that the Wii can't really push out too many high-res textures, that the cel-shaded way would be the way to go to make a really good-looking game.
944989	945870	So, hope for that!
947531	947871	Anyways.
949092	953475	Now, I mentioned, I think a few weeks ago, that I made a wireless sensor bar for my Wii, but of course...
953968	973316	If you don't want to go to Radio Shack and spend the $25 it takes to do that, you can spend a few more dollars, $31 after shipping and handling, and visit wirelesssensorbar.com, and you can purchase one made there for your Wii, and it uses basically a simple 9-volt battery.
973797	977658	It will give you 48 hours of wireless Wii play.
977838	981740	So interesting if you have, you know, projection TV, you know,
982270	1010358	projection screen setup for your Wii definitely you're going to need something a little bit longer than the cord there so that might be the way to go or you can put two candles up and it works just as easy well speaking of other things for the Wii now this makes me particularly happy they are it's in the works right now to make a freeloader for the Wii for anyone who doesn't know
1011053	1018575	The Freeloader will basically allow you to play games from any region, basically, on your system.
1019736	1021516	I've got one for my GameCube.
1021856	1022737	Fabulous thing.
1022857	1026078	I've been playing lots of Naruto and Soul Calibur thanks to that.
1026998	1034861	And I have not yet tried my Freeloader on the Wii, because our Wii is sort of disconnected right now because we took it to someone's house.
1035461	1035601	But...
1037791	1043395	They don't have any date or price on it yet, but the quote is soon.
1044897	1045597	Soon.
1045617	1049360	That means I get my cooking, Mama.
1052282	1053303	It'll be done when it's done.
1054444	1055685	Don't worry, Mama will fix it.
1058524	1062527	I don't know how many folks have been importing Wii's from Europe just to play their games.
1062547	1064589	Because, you know, they got some stuff earlier than we did.
1064669	1068551	But one way or another, Europe has sold a lot of Wii's.
1068892	1071153	You know, it just recently launched over there this past week.
1071253	1076117	And they sold 325,000 Wii's in two days.
1076677	1084983	And, of course, just like here in the U.S., Zelda Twilight Princess being a big contributor there to the reason why these Wii's are flying off shelves.
1085305	1086406	at the retail price of £179.
1088708	1089628	By the way, that's $350 US.
1089648	1097594	And considering we can buy the system here for $250, once again, unfortunately, our friends overseas getting screwed a little bit on the price point.
1097974	1098515	Sorry, guys.
1098655	1099376	Don't know what to tell you.
1100136	1103579	So, there's some interesting stuff definitely about the Wii.
1104199	1113826	I know people that might not have wireless internet are kind of shit out luck unless you buy the Nintendo Wi-Fi adapter.
1114367	1114607	But,
1115612	1125915	Fear not, because someone's actually discovered that you can purchase a compatible USB Ethernet device from actual, like Newegg.
1126455	1131557	They're selling one for $19.99, and it's an Ethernet adapter that you can buy.
1131637	1140739	It's Keenamax USB 2.0 to RJ45 Fast Ethernet 10100 Base T Network Adapter.
1141059	1142700	That's a pretty long name there, but...
1143444	1144786	I thought my friend had this whole thing already
1157583	1161726	Nintendo already had this stuff out on the market, or is that just because the DS ones are already out there?
1161886	1163167	Well, that's a Wi-Fi Max.
1163187	1165108	That's that USB thing for wireless internet.
1165128	1168891	This actually plugs into your Wii and converts one of the USB ports to an Ethernet port.
1169812	1170572	Oh, okay, I get it.
1170592	1171593	So it works the other way.
1171953	1174255	Instead of plugging it into your computer, you plug it into the Wii.
1174395	1174755	I get it.
1175136	1178098	Well, this is not for a wireless internet.
1178118	1179058	This is wired internet.
1179098	1180199	It's just a converter.
1180219	1181920	Does it work if you have a USB router?
1183862	1184142	I don't know.
1184162	1184502	I don't know.
1184923	1185563	That's a good question.
1186977	1187337	Try it.
1187517	1187937	Find out.
1189498	1195079	Anyway, maybe when somebody at home tries that, they'll send us an email because we like to read emails every week here on this program.
1195719	1198320	Katie's distracted.
1200840	1213103	One of the things we pride ourselves on here at Orange Lounge Radio is that it's not just us because we're just some people on the Internet just like you, and we know you have an opinion as well, so we welcome it through the interactive elements of our program, and one of those is the mailbag.
1213459	1219941	DarkSakura opens up the mailbag every week and picks out some of our favorite emails and shares them with you in our little segment we call The Mailbag.
1220321	1221802	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1225523	1230084	First email comes from our friend AZHP.
1231204	1231945	Hey, OLR.
1232545	1238707	I know how much you guys love analysts, and I came across this article called The Year Ahead in Tech by some research analysts.
1239287	1240387	A choice quote from it.
1240607	1242468	Remember, you can't spell analyst without anal.
1244448	1244728	Please do.
1244748	1244788	So...
1274187	1275008	And then that was the quote.
1276028	1276889	I would actually believe that.
1277109	1278730	How do people this stupid get jobs?
1279331	1279871	I would believe it.
1280132	1281012	Well, let me finish reading.
1281713	1285936	Please break these predictions down one by one and tell everyone how much of an idiot this guy is.
1286436	1288658	I would myself, but the email would get too long.
1288738	1289879	Love your show, AZHP.
1290679	1298906	Now, some of it... I honestly think Konami is going to stick with Sony because I think they have something.
1299206	1301648	However, being that you're seeing Solid Snake on Wii...
1302848	1309031	on a Wii game coming up, I have a feeling we might see a Metal Gear game on the Wii.
1309091	1310972	Or a game in the Metal Gear family.
1311432	1315714	I get the sense that Konami's willing to risk something on every platform, so I think they'll...
1317146	1323430	It'll be interesting to see what kind of happens with the whole Metal Gear thing, but I think you're going to see some PlayStation exclusives coming from Konami and some of the other big publishers.
1323790	1334356	But in regards to the whole thing about Microsoft taking down their... they would make online competitive play free for everyone, that's actually come up before, speculation-wise.
1334396	1336097	So this person's actually not saying anything new.
1336558	1345383	This whole thing started when Gold members started getting trailers earlier, demos earlier, and were like the only people that could participate in the Phantasy Star Universe beta.
1345731	1350796	Things of that nature have been making people talk that maybe gold is headed in a different direction for a while now.
1350836	1352558	So that's nothing new, actually.
1352598	1357443	I don't know if they can do that, though, because people get pissed off, especially if you're a retail store that's bought a bunch of these.
1357964	1362325	Xbox Live kits and stuff, and now you're shit out of luck with all this inventory.
1363185	1369846	I really don't think that it's going to go that way because you have to pay for maintaining the bandwidth.
1370806	1374747	I think that the gold membership will be part of how these services are paid for.
1374867	1379768	So I think the competitive play is going to stay on gold, and you're still going to have to pay for it.
1379788	1385709	You know, it would be interesting if gold would let you play online for the first three months, and then it's free afterwards.
1385969	1387429	That would be an interesting model, wouldn't it?
1387998	1388238	I don't know.
1388258	1388999	I don't think it would work.
1389479	1390320	Not in the long run.
1390600	1392201	These peanut butter cookies are delicious, might I say.
1392241	1392581	They are.
1393382	1400806	However, I think that they should do Guild Wars on Xbox and put that available for silver.
1401387	1403888	That's a strange suggestion, but I like it.
1403908	1405409	They're putting Final Fantasy XI on there.
1405429	1406050	Why the hell not?
1406430	1409312	It's not something I would have thought of otherwise, but I like it.
1410413	1414375	Well, I like that too because you don't have to pay an online service fee for that kind of game.
1414535	1415636	You just buy the game.
1416077	1416297	Yeah.
1416537	1416757	I think
1417341	1420982	I wish they'd have more free MMOs on there because that's what they really need to do.
1421122	1427645	I mean, there's not a lot of really good multiplayer games online that are like an MMO that you don't have to pay some monthly fee for.
1427965	1430646	And I think a lot of people would be looking for something like that.
1430826	1435108	Dear Gravity, put Ragnarok online on Xbox 360.
1435248	1437469	Dear Gravity, disregard what Jamie's telling you.
1437709	1440150	Dear Gravity, tell Rob to S-T-F-U-O-M-G.
1441910	1443151	So shall I move on to the next email?
1443791	1444331	Yes, please.
1444391	1444991	I love you, Rob.
1445491	1445832	Oh, really?
1446452	1446792	Yes, really.
1447338	1447798	Yeah, really?
1449259	1449560	Way.
1451041	1453963	Hey, OLR, JeremyTodd1 is here yet again.
1454063	1454483	Hooray.
1455204	1457185	Insert JeremyTodd1's theme song here.
1457926	1462629	He probably has one because he manages to get on this program through different ways many times.
1462649	1463149	No, it's all right.
1463830	1464751	He has a lot of good stuff to say.
1464831	1468293	I'm reading email.
1468333	1470615	I just made an Elebit noise.
1470655	1471235	So did she.
1473237	1474458	I haven't played Elebits yet.
1475859	1476339	Don't die.
1478294	1487021	I was thinking about this whole PS3 vs. Wii thing everyone is going off about and how Sony is partially relying on their brand name slash reputation to help sell the PS3.
1487141	1487661	Too true.
1488142	1489383	Well, I have an analogy.
1489603	1491084	An analogy also has the word anal in it.
1493786	1496628	Go back to the NES and Super Nintendo generations.
1496748	1500251	Everyone was talking about them and saying this is the system to get.
1500571	1506356	Nintendo's reputation was pretty much the status of a high school slutty cheerleader except better.
1507125	1508506	Everyone knew what Nintendo was.
1508786	1510948	Well, after those generations, look at Nintendo now.
1511488	1517872	They aren't exactly cheerleader worthy anymore, even though this could change this generation.
1518472	1520294	Could the same thing happen to Sony?
1520554	1524296	Just replace the NES of the PlayStation 1 and Super Nintendo with the PS2.
1524837	1531461	Could Sony's reputation break down faster than Loki's career after he gives his boss a death threat after playing GTA Vice City Stories?
1532776	1533456	He doesn't understand.
1533516	1535137	I could kick his ass any day.
1535597	1539317	And he knows it, so there's no problem there.
1539858	1544359	I could definitely see Sony's reputation dipping down quite a bit, just like Nintendo's did after the Super Nintendo.
1544379	1545559	They are already freaking headed that way.
1546079	1551220	So what do the world-famous hosts of Orange Zones Radio, www.orangezonesradio.com, think of this.
1552160	1552580	P.S.
1553241	1556701	Put an M in the middle of the P.S., and that's what Rob is going through right now.
1556801	1557762	Oh, snap for reals.
1558462	1558922	PMS3?
1560777	1563338	It's like some advanced form of PMS.
1564499	1565900	Like it's mute.
1566720	1568521	Drew Nami says it's PMS beyond.
1569162	1569982	Alright, anyway.
1570302	1571183	It's UPMS.
1571463	1572483	Uber PMS!
1575017	1578258	Yeah, but I think that Sony's already heading down the pooper.
1578718	1585360	In a way, it's tempting to make those type of comparisons, just like how everybody wanted to compare the 360 to the Dreamcast, right?
1585420	1602145	And there was a lot of, you know, remember way back when, when we were doing the separate program, one of the big stories in 2005 was the Xbox 360, people were comparing it to Dreamcast, and I think the 360's showing it's going to have a longer lifespan than Dreamcast, so it's tempting to make those comparisons based on all this circumstantial evidence.
1602545	1603765	And one could say that
1604944	1614971	Nintendo's big, big, big, big, big, big, big flaw they made with the Nintendo 64 that wrecked that system was the fact that they kept it cartridge-based and didn't go on to the CD and all that stuff.
1615572	1621636	And one could speculate that PS3's big, big, big mistake here is that they forced Blu-ray down everyone's throat.
1622076	1623658	But it's still too soon to tell.
1623918	1624818	The war ain't over yet.
1624999	1628001	Like I said, PlayStation 2 took me a while before I bought one.
1628421	1630342	So you never know what games might come out next year.
1630362	1631503	I don't understand.
1631523	1632544	How could Blu-ray fail?
1633565	1633585	I...
1635231	1641394	I actually liked Blu-ray, but I liked Betamax too, and what happened to that?
1642054	1642555	Bastards.
1643555	1644195	You know what's funny?
1644956	1647697	Price aside, UMD's not bad either.
1648017	1648798	Price aside.
1649058	1650358	That's the one problem I have with UMD.
1650378	1654460	But now you get a tower while they're closing all their stores and get them for a dollar.
1654780	1655341	That's a good idea.
1656581	1658322	Okay, next one comes up from Misty.
1659298	1660359	Hey everyone, what's up?
1660419	1660899	Misty here.
1660979	1666924	Thanks to the Podline's service, I caught part of the December 3rd episode around 1am December 5th, St.
1666964	1669286	Louis time, of course, because I was up anyway.
1669626	1672228	Like usual on my days off from work, I slept quite late.
1672588	1673229	Amen to that.
1674229	1686999	I made it to the library before dark, but combined the fact that I'm in the middle of catching up on downloading the podcast and the fact that I only got an hour and a half online for the visit, it's no wonder that I didn't get to listen to the rest of the episode on my borrowed computer.
1687839	1689962	Yes, I am actually working on getting a computer again.
1690302	1696609	With a combination of the game center, the crib, and the library to get online, I was mostly alright for getting online.
1696689	1700614	Heck, I was even able to listen live for about 45 minutes on Sunday nights for the most part.
1701055	1708100	With that gone, though, and with my transfer slash hour switch, I seem to have very little time online because most days for me seem to involve closing.
1708580	1719368	That tends to get me out about midnight or 1am, depending on the day, being too wired, for lack of a better word, and not falling asleep until sunrise and sleeping as late as I can before having to repeat it the next afternoon.
1719728	1720729	I can sympathize with that.
1724552	1730035	I definitely plan to have a computer and a laptop by the time I go to my usual anime convention, Anime Central, which is May 11th through 13th this time around.
1730055	1730716	Aren't you going to ASUN?
1733346	1751589	Chris will be at ASIN I will be there representing Orange Lounge Radio sweet she's got some promo cards in April we'll talk that's where the rest of this email is heading that reminds me the convention talk is about the last thing I can recall from listening from pod lines from my cell phone
1752398	1754481	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1764997	1775081	Yeah, unfortunately, it's just a cost thing, because remember, we don't get paid for doing this program, so we don't have a travel budget like your pals at Ziff Davis and other publishing houses do.
1775121	1777302	Hey, folks who run ASIN, send me a ticket.
1777342	1778183	I'll come out and do the panel.
1778263	1784945	But Chris is going out of the goodness of her heart, because she's already going for other stuff, so if we can't make it, she will be our official Orange Lounge representation.
1785026	1787587	I will go there, and I will hand out lots of flyers.
1788787	1790729	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1806926	1810070	By the way, I also want to mention what Misty refers to, the Podline service.
1810811	1811972	Now, we don't support this.
1812033	1814576	This is another organization, but I will give it a shout-out.
1814696	1820103	Apparently, there's a service where you can listen to Orange Launch Radio over the telephone by calling this number.
1820784	1822966	One for long distance.
1823207	1823667	Area code 650.
1826470	1827670	523-6855.
1827950	1830472	Keep in mind, that's not an official endorsement of the service.
1830532	1831692	We don't know much about them.
1831812	1836835	All we know is that apparently they let you listen to podcast feeds over the telephone.
1837135	1838296	So use at your own risk.
1838356	1839756	It's podlines.net.
1840457	1847680	But it's kind of neat that we're able to get the show out there to folks who maybe don't have an iPod, things like that, where they can't listen to the show on the go.
1847720	1848961	It's easier access to a computer 24-7.
1848981	1849621	So that's kind of neat.
1852128	1856670	This next email, I shouldn't read it because DMN's not in the chat room tonight, you bastard.
1858230	1859030	But I'll read it anyway.
1860311	1862912	Dude, I'm drunk, I love you, Rob.
1862932	1863992	My girlfriend loves you, too.
1866553	1867714	Seriously, DMN.
1867734	1868554	DMN needs a cookie.
1868574	1871935	DMN, you need to be like Lindsay Lohan and check yourself in AA, okay?
1871955	1872655	That's all I have to say.
1872675	1876617	Here's the next step.
1876677	1877517	Yeah, be Lindsay Lohan, put a shirt on, too.
1878144	1879945	and like Britney Spears, put some panties on.
1880085	1881265	Yes, please DM him, put some panties on.
1881305	1882906	That woman's cooch is not attractive, I'm sorry.
1884746	1888007	Anyway, that's a harken back to guys on the show.
1888648	1890108	Plug, plug, plug.
1890148	1890468	Thank you.
1892149	1895330	Anyway, this one comes from Michael.
1896390	1898091	Long time listener, first time emailer.
1898777	1905821	I've enjoyed the song Flotation all the way back from when I first played 2DX6 style, and the vocal mix she played sometime is fantastic.
1906382	1909764	However, after about two years of trying, I can't find it anywhere.
1910124	1913366	I know MP3 requests are frowned upon, but I'm desperate to hear any chance you could help.
1914626	1926053	There is a Vincent D'Amour compilation that's got Flotation, Green Heaven, Fly Away, all of those on it.
1926173	1927294	Some of the Dance Manias do.
1928397	1930659	So I would suggest looking for some of those compilations.
1931760	1939425	Yeah, because we can't really endorse the whole MP3 thing, but if you come by on a Wednesday night in the chat room, maybe I'll hook you up.
1940766	1941367	But I didn't say that.
1941667	1945850	But seriously though, we would encourage that you get the originals.
1946831	1952696	Go CD Japan, go to some of the... In fact, I remember seeing on one of the Transnation CDs...
1954568	1957891	I think it was the Transnation, either the 2003 or 2004 edition.
1958831	1964695	04 has quite a number of really good trans stuff on it, and one of them is Flotation.
1965515	1966936	Was it Flotation, or was it Fly Away?
1968858	1971219	The Flotation 2000 mix, that's actually a really good one.
1972460	1975622	I used to have that CD until someone stole it out of my car!
1977463	1981286	And the last one... No, wait, god damn it, Rob left the room.
1981326	1983267	Okay, okay, okay, I'll read another one.
1984733	1988437	This actually was sent to us by our friend Rob with two B's.
1992122	1997828	It was a story from a blog that he sent us that
2005609	2017175	This will make sense to the podcast listeners, but now I am starting to see dropout errors on our end, and I don't know if that's Live 365 fault or our fault, so I was just saying in studio, if anyone's doing any downloads or big transfers, those gotta get pulled, because I don't know what's going on.
2017215	2019976	It could be Comcast, it could be a number of things, so sorry about that, guys.
2020336	2023498	I lost the email, so I'll go to a different one that he sent us, because he sent me several.
2024379	2026660	Sorry to run out, but I was getting the messages we were dropping out.
2027640	2029361	Gamasutra posted... posted...
2033590	2035752	A story about Activision.
2037794	2041236	It's the NIMF E-grade given to ESRB.
2041617	2044039	Let me just pull up the story real quick because it's actually pretty interesting.
2045140	2049023	Activision survey finds strong parental support for the ESRB.
2049543	2051405	It's a really good article and I'm going to link it in the chat room.
2051985	2056689	Basically, parents support the ESRB.
2056729	2057670	They think it's a good idea.
2057690	2060913	It certainly makes their jobs a little bit better, I think.
2060933	2062334	It makes it easier for them to
2062990	2064732	Be able to judge what their children are playing.
2065433	2066193	I think it's a good idea.
2067094	2071319	Now this last one is interesting.
2072300	2073161	I'm going to read it.
2073601	2074602	And Rob has to pay attention.
2075483	2076544	Maybe I should let Chris read it.
2076784	2077085	No.
2077525	2077805	Okay.
2078366	2079607	The whole point was for you to read it.
2079768	2080048	Damn it.
2081029	2082831	This was sent to us by Chris.
2086796	2088317	Hi guys, it's me, Chris.
2088737	2089838	I'm a big lesbian.
2089858	2092060	I did not say that.
2092760	2094462	It's true, but I didn't say that.
2094822	2096884	You people sure attract some weirdos.
2097464	2102428	Some guy showed up at my house with a red suit on, riding in a sleigh.
2102488	2103870	He asked me to send you this email.
2105211	2107352	Dear OLR crew, You wrote ORL?
2107973	2108774	He wrote ORL.
2110935	2111336	Oh, really?
2111536	2112277	It was the guy.
2112537	2114158	Yeah, on your laptop.
2115748	2116889	Good evening, OLR.
2117469	2118810	Oh, and good evening, chat room.
2119050	2122192	I hope all have had a wonderful holiday season so far.
2122612	2127655	It was brought to my attention by my elves working in the wishes room that they detected a strange anomaly.
2128035	2133538	It seems hundreds of wishes have been piling in all for your radio show, hoping for the best in the new year.
2134059	2137200	Well, this had me perplexed on how to help, as wishes are my specialty.
2137781	2138701	After a while, it came to me.
2138781	2144925	I gathered all the wishes from your fans to create one gift that I hope... that all hope will be of use...
2146150	2146871	to help your show.
2146971	2147171	Sorry.
2148172	2155257	From the wishes of the chat room to the wishes of the message board to the wishes of the listeners not known, I'll have a very special gift for you.
2155357	2159620	To Sky, Loki, and DarkSakura, happy holidays and a wonderful new year from SC.
2159780	2160141	P.S.
2160481	2162162	I left the gift with a strange blue-haired girl.
2162643	2163884	She should be handing it to you right now.
2164744	2165665	And you have to open it.
2167170	2167630	Oh my.
2167690	2169792	People attract the weirdest of guys.
2169972	2170412	Oh my.
2170432	2171492	This guy was old.
2171532	2173253	That's Rob that attracted me.
2173273	2178697	You know what's funny is that she started to mention this encounter off air and I said, was he hot?
2178897	2186121	Some strange man came to the door talking about the radio show and the first question I go, was he hot?
2186141	2190683	Oh no, you like the old dude?
2190763	2191364	Rob likes it.
2191404	2192604	Am I okay to open this?
2192644	2193385	Yeah, you have to open it.
2193405	2193785	Go for it.
2197481	2200824	It's an envelope, two OLR from Santa and the fans.
2202046	2202866	Oh, I licked it, sorry.
2202886	2206049	Do you have an oil fixation?
2206870	2207311	Yeah.
2212235	2213156	Hurry up, Rob!
2213236	2215419	I'm trying, I don't want to ruin it.
2215439	2215799	Yes, please.
2217320	2221785	Rob pulls the thing apart, maiming the envelope, the poor defenseless thing.
2228396	2230416	Chris, I... I didn't do it.
2230797	2231257	Santa did.
2239439	2243820	I... Like, I'm just, like, not paying attention to anything.
2243860	2246460	I'm actually looking... I don't know what to say.
2246900	2251981	I'm... Wow.
2252201	2253482	That whole guy was cool.
2253582	2254162	Are you sure?
2262781	2263521	I don't know what to say.
2267283	2268524	This is embarrassing in a way.
2269965	2275507	Apparently this old guy gave us a location to where he killed Rob's family and left their bodies.
2275627	2278369	So he's...
2282253	2283253	Can I say what it is?
2283273	2283954	I guess you could call it...
2311363	2315987	I'm throwing it around the whole place.
2317728	2322411	I guess you could call it seed money to take OLR to the next level.
2323852	2329856	And something I think a lot of us always, like we always kind of thought to take this to the next level.
2330656	2336660	It was always... No, I'm sorry.
2336700	2337741	I'm just overwhelmed.
2340095	2341296	Bandit's on the right track.
2343518	2347742	You're on the right track, I'll put it that way.
2348082	2351465	It's basically $4,000 in scene money.
2351866	2353387	It sounds so strange to say.
2357731	2364937	Just to bring you guys to do what we do here and really be able to take this to the next level.
2365037	2366879	Oh god, I'm so embarrassed that
2367987	2370588	I'm calling your girlfriend and asking her permission to service you.
2375311	2379473	I just, I didn't, I wanted to do something really nice for you guys.
2379853	2392079	I mean, I didn't get to be all emotional, but you guys have done a lot for me that I haven't, that I didn't know how to reciprocate, and you guys are always talking about you guys want to do all of this stuff, and I thought that this was the best way to show you that I could do that.
2393024	2394605	and, you know, it's for promotion.
2394685	2396247	It's for anything you guys want to use it for.
2396667	2398248	Completely at your disposal.
2398288	2399129	Thank you so much.
2399209	2400490	I don't know where to begin.
2400550	2401811	I don't know where to begin.
2403212	2405253	Now it's kind of like that I'm looking at this.
2405333	2406774	I'm like, I don't know.
2408816	2409797	I don't know where to begin.
2409917	2412819	I think we need to set up that account now.
2413019	2419324	I think maybe setting up the work account would be a good idea now and maybe...
2420700	2423742	Maybe we'll be coming to a city near you after all sometime soon.
2423782	2424183	Who knows?
2424323	2424723	I don't know.
2425243	2426084	But thank you so much.
2426885	2430907	I'm... Thank you.
2434070	2435431	Are you okay, Loki?
2435471	2436492	I'm not even looking at chat.
2436552	2437732	I don't even want to know.
2438473	2440535	They're all by allgames.com.
2441795	2444277	I don't think that's going to be happening.
2444297	2445858	Bandit's telling us to drop by 365.
2445898	2445938	Uh...
2449075	2452196	That's never been a possibility before, but now maybe it is.
2456237	2457557	My heart's racing very quickly.
2457617	2458358	I know.
2458578	2462399	I'm so sorry for making a complete ass of... No, it's fine.
2462479	2462999	It's fine.
2463079	2464679	I just don't know what to say.
2464739	2469461	I mean, this just doesn't happen.
2471021	2471581	But it is.
2472661	2472982	I know.
2473122	2473382	I know.
2473482	2474342	I just don't know what to say.
2480387	2482408	Read another fucking email already.
2483649	2484970	That was the last email.
2485170	2486091	God damn it.
2486111	2486991	Read another one.
2487032	2488072	Make something up.
2488853	2489673	Make something up.
2490134	2493736	Dear Jamie, I think that you should rule my country.
2494637	2495397	Love, The Queen.
2496518	2499500	You play everything on Doctor Who.
2500260	2501701	All you would play is Doctor Who.
2501862	2503122	We'd have like BBC Who.
2505704	2506965	Anyways, I'll take it from here.
2508012	2508433	Please do.
2508473	2510414	If I had a story up, somebody else needs to do it.
2510434	2510614	I'm sorry.
2527825	2528946	Exchange Mii's.
2529466	2540913	There's a way, apparently if you transfer your Mii to your remote, which you can do via the Wii console, you can then log into a website for a Mii exchange.
2541733	2550679	It's actually available on wimodwii.com, that's W-I-I-M-O-D-W-I-I, and slash Mii's.
2551364	2555308	Ace Ventura, Albert Einstein, Hitler, Chuck Norris, Chewbacca, Dr. Evil, Dr. Phil, W. Bush, etc.
2555328	2556008	God, Harry Potter.
2570333	2572094	So definitely check that out.
2572294	2575315	Of course, you're going to need a program to be able to transfer that.
2575615	2581317	And available also on WeModWe.com, you can get the Wii Transfer Station, which will allow you to do that.
2581637	2584338	And it gives you instructions on how to set that up as well.
2585118	2586298	So definitely worth checking out.
2586558	2592981	I need to get a USB Bluetooth thing so I can actually do this, because I've got to have Chuck Norris on my Wii console.
2593681	2594521	That is a requirement.
2596362	2599443	Okay, I'm going to go ahead and try to do the next story.
2600325	2601566	and then I'm going to run out of the room for a minute.
2602066	2613230	Anyway, something else that almost drove me to tears when I heard about it was the announcement of Dragon Quest IX coming to the Nintendo DS.
2613991	2622734	Square Enix held a press conference to talk about the new Dragon Quest game earlier this week and the big shock, you know, nobody was surprised that Dragon Quest IX is coming out.
2622774	2626396	Hell, these games are like of biblical proportions in Japan.
2627611	2634577	But the fact that Dragon Quest IX Protectors of the Starry Sky would actually be coming to Nintendo DS was quite a bit of a surprise.
2634917	2636378	It will feature 3D graphics.
2636418	2637919	There were some screenshots released.
2637939	2644624	It looks very similar in style to Dragon Quest VIII, which was, of course, recently out on the PlayStation 2.
2645465	2647507	And they are trying to make it ready by 2007.
2649908	2652851	By the way, Square Enix is also making a card-based arcade.
2654092	2654572	Excuse me.
2654612	2655833	Not only am I crying, but I have hiccups, too.
2656206	2657286	Dragon Quest Monster Battle Road
2684416	2688638	I've pretty much stripped down all the DS games I have to New Super Mario Bros.
2688698	2690039	and Mario Kart.
2690059	2697163	I don't really play anything else on my PSP, but there's really not a lot of must-have games.
2697223	2700084	It's just a lot of filler, it seems like.
2700124	2708488	A lot of ports of stuff that end up on the PSP, but nothing that's just like, wow, a new Dragon Quest game, or Final Fantasy.
2709009	2712290	I think that's why their system is not doing this well.
2712390	2713851	Airtost says Silent Hill Origins.
2714605	2715705	Yeah, whenever that comes out.
2717466	2724307	Instead we just have, yay, another Untold Legends, or yay, another Dynasty Warriors, yay.
2724407	2729448	GS191, breaking news, Japan covered in white substance after announcement of Dragon Quest IX for DS.
2730309	2731969	Enis is going to sue somebody now.
2737634	2738955	So I don't know what else to say about that.
2739616	2741497	I was pretty surprised to hear that myself.
2741697	2741978	I don't know.
2741998	2743939	I'm so used to playing Dragon Quest on my television.
2743979	2747602	But then again, if you think about it, they did have Dragon Quest on the Game Boy years ago.
2747682	2749644	I mean, they ported one, too.
2749824	2753687	And there will be a Dragon Quest Swords coming out on the Wii.
2754208	2755189	Oh, I forgot about that.
2755229	2755589	That's right.
2755609	2756810	That was supposed to be a launch title.
2757130	2758051	I think it was in Japan.
2759913	2760273	All right.
2761252	2763314	Well, I definitely want to check this out.
2763394	2765876	I mean, I'm liking the Final Fantasy III on the DS.
2765917	2771161	I don't see any... Dragon Quest graphical style, I think, will translate very well to the DS.
2771222	2773083	I don't see why this will be a problem.
2773163	2773704	Toriyama.
2774284	2775165	You can't go wrong with him.
2775365	2775966	I think it'll be good.
2776046	2778849	And also, that means the really bad voice acting won't be in it.
2779930	2780951	Which is good news.
2781431	2782292	Call Blimey!
2783773	2786156	Anyways, so now...
2786974	2794077	Bringing you further information of what the Mac can do as far as gaming for you guys, I thought I'd bring this up.
2795077	2804401	You can use, using a Mac, a Wii, and a certain program, you can make your Wii sound like a lightsaber when you swing it around.
2804761	2813805	Apparently there's a program that's out there right now, and why someone created this, for the tilt sensor that's in the Mac laptop, so you know, to prevent
2814369	2814869	Star Wars Kid
2846346	2846946	WeSaber.
2847186	2848126	Heaven help us all.
2848526	2850627	Well, how about I redeem the world now?
2851307	2851747	Please do.
2852387	2857388	Well, everybody, I'm sure if you listen to our show, you have to be pretty cool so you know who Kevin Smith is.
2858109	2858369	Yes.
2859829	2861709	Um... Nugget of the Nooch!
2862709	2868151	That... Well, he's interested in making a game based on Jay and Silent Bob.
2869691	2869791	Um...
2870479	2882428	To quote, games in one field that I like to be entertained rather than try to be entertaining, basically stating that he'd come up with the concept and story if someone else would make the levels and stuff in it.
2883149	2884870	So he basically is going to be concept director.
2884890	2887212	Welp.
2890936	2893098	rated M for Mature rated M for Mature
2921707	2922687	And that's great.
2923448	2924988	So she had Dogma the game.
2925448	2928249	We have to... That'd be awesome.
2928369	2930410	We have to fight legions of angels.
2931951	2933711	And with Alanis as God.
2934191	2935652	Do we get to watch Muse strip?
2936632	2940093	We are not going to watch him do the Silence of the Lambs dance.
2941014	2941614	No, Muse.
2942864	2943604	Serendipity!
2943784	2945625	Oh, I thought you meant... Selma Hayek, man!
2945705	2948987	Okay, I thought you were talking about Jason Mewes because they referred to him by his last name in their interviews.
2949027	2949747	Oh, no, no, no, no.
2949767	2950147	The Mewes.
2950487	2951328	Serendipity, yeah.
2951608	2952188	Oh, hell yeah!
2954009	2954469	Boobies!
2955709	2957790	Well... Boobies!
2958951	2959251	You know what?
2959271	2966054	Jay and Silent Bob would be a pretty sweet video game and I think there would be a collective nerdgasm heard around the world with this type of game.
2966354	2967034	Oh my god.
2968595	2969055	Seriously.
2971092	2972653	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2996072	2996993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3026775	3032357	After all, they have the ticket games based off the Titanic, so that's not as bad, I guess.
3032397	3043461	No singing, no karaoke revolution tie-ins, just something else big and ugly to stick in my arcade to attract all the little rugrats who are celebrating somebody's birthday.
3044021	3047503	To quote DJ Dark Knight, No!
3049604	3055746	And also, to go back on a previous subject, to quote Gary Who Drive Car, Mallrats the game removed the kids sitting on the escalator level.
3057600	3079934	Well, while Jay and Silent Bob the video game may be a great thing, certainly this American Idol news of an American Idol game makes us very angsty because we think about the great arcade machines, you know, the Soul Calibur 3s that could be in these arcades, the Time Crisis 4s, the DDR Supernovas that will be taken out in favor of American Idol.
3080335	3082836	And does this piss you off as much as it does us?
3083277	3085218	Because it makes us so mad we have to...
3089910	3090310	Rant.
3091751	3093472	The FUs of the week, DarkSakura.
3094252	3096393	The first FU of the week goes to Extrovert.
3097253	3102596	For not letting us buy him the intimate celebrity photo shoot butt bleaching.
3105397	3108938	We were going to get Extrovert a gift certificate for intimate photographs.
3110239	3111079	And an anal bleaching.
3113801	3114501	That fell through.
3115660	3122964	I would, however, like to say that that conversation at TGI Fridays elicited the most beautiful facial responses from my husband.
3123965	3124705	It was gorgeous.
3125606	3127767	Watching Dan squirm makes me happy sometimes.
3129728	3130109	All right.
3131029	3132050	Loki, your FU.
3133290	3139654	My FU goes to stupid people, and especially the amounts of stupid people out in abundance due to the holidays.
3139674	3144357	You know, I hate having to drive around and see you trying to, you know,
3145049	3150010	Swerve into me and then realize, oh, you're just trying to change lanes, but you haven't figured out how to use the blinker yet.
3150951	3152131	Stupid shit like that.
3153111	3155192	Oh, and this one's definitely for Nelly.
3155732	3171036	Fuck you to the stupid grandma that brought her daughter to the Dollar Tree so that she could buy candy and had to count out her $4 worth of purchases with pennies in front of us.
3171917	3173137	And she kept messing up.
3173809	3174970	and have to recount them.
3176051	3176671	It was horrible.
3176691	3179073	That's why you get paper rolls first.
3179113	3184416	When I was in college, we used to save up all of our pennies in a semester and then roll them and then go to movies.
3184456	3187818	She saved them in grandma's medicine little bottles.
3188699	3190080	Oh, no, I know the rules.
3190160	3191781	I hope you don't mind me paying for the pennies.
3192462	3197525	Well, then we used to put them all in a gallon milk jar and then we'd count them out before we went where we were going.
3198586	3201087	See, that's what considerate people would do, but you forget she's a dumb bitch.
3201167	3201207	Um...
3204275	3208057	I had something, but I kind of forgot it amongst everything else that's been going on.
3208718	3210019	So, no, it's fine.
3210079	3210519	Trust me.
3212380	3218084	But I guess my FU would have to go to myself for crying like a little bitch on the radio program.
3218104	3219145	Oh, sorry.
3220025	3221466	I am so sorry, Rob.
3221526	3222106	No, no, no.
3222126	3222547	Please.
3222987	3223347	Please.
3224148	3224468	Please.
3225191	3226072	Don't feel sorry.
3230094	3232696	I had a serious FU, and I seriously... Oh, I know what it was.
3232776	3233296	I just remembered.
3233316	3233856	I finally remembered.
3234237	3237018	An FU to the fact I didn't go to bed until 6.30 in the morning yesterday.
3237158	3241321	Because that's my own downfall, but it doesn't make me feel any better.
3241661	3243162	Because my Sunday is, like, completely gone.
3244483	3244783	Oh, wait.
3244863	3245083	Oh, shh.
3245443	3245783	Hello.
3245824	3247304	We still have other people that have to do their FUs.
3247324	3247805	Drew.
3247885	3248125	Drew.
3251550	3258055	First off, FU to the World of Warcraft 2.0 patch for forcing me into the addiction relapse.
3259496	3264299	FU to certain parts of that patch that break all your interface add-ons.
3264439	3269903	When we say, remember, remember the 5th of December, the day all the add-ons were dropped.
3270806	3272227	and F.U.
3272307	3281374	to not having my chat filter up until a week afterwards forcing me to actually deal with the dude speaking that is in WoW also F.U.
3281414	3292942	to Burnout 3 which is on loan right now for being so incredibly addictive that's it alrighty Chris, you have some F.U.s of the week?
3293703	3295664	I've only got one and that's F.U.
3295685	3298907	to Fred Seltz and the West Baptist Church
3299799	3304201	All you people need to, like, shut the fucking hell up.
3304321	3307623	I mean, I don't know if you guys know who the Phelps crowd is.
3308624	3314126	They are, like, the biggest retard, inbred retards I've ever come across.
3314207	3318109	Not only do they hate gay people, that, you know, that's kind of a given.
3318149	3321090	Most, you know, church-based organizations do that.
3321450	3326573	But they've got signs out there that say, you know, God hates fags, thank God for AIDS, that kind of shit.
3327313	3328614	They also protest.
3329540	3331802	at soldiers' funerals.
3331882	3334223	I don't care how much you like this war or not.
3334484	3338627	You do not protest at dead soldiers' funerals, you fucking retards.
3339107	3340548	And didn't they protest the Amish, too?
3340588	3341849	They protested, okay.
3342229	3343810	How can anyone hate the Amish?
3343830	3350055	They protested, I'm sure all of you heard, some little girls got killed by this insane guy.
3350115	3351315	And the little girls were Amish.
3351356	3352636	Four little girls got killed.
3352857	3353497	In a schoolhouse.
3353677	3354578	In a schoolhouse.
3354598	3357940	This guy came and was gonna, you know, just kill them.
3357980	3358921	He was going to rape them.
3360094	3367538	The bastards were going to protest at an Amish, little girl Amish funeral.
3368558	3370839	How can you, no one hates the Amish.
3370979	3371960	What are they going to do?
3371980	3373701	You know, knit a quilt at you?
3374021	3374621	Yeah, really.
3375082	3376062	I mean, oh my God.
3376142	3381425	You know when that happened, the Amish set up a fund for the murderer's family.
3381445	3381965	Yeah, family.
3383289	3384429	Who hates the Amish?
3384449	3388631	They were going to have signs out there that were going to say your daughters are whores.
3388671	3389811	They're burning in hell.
3390211	3391332	You do not do that.
3391632	3393232	You are a human being, goddammit.
3393272	3395093	You treat people with fucking respect.
3395193	3396653	Out there if you hate homosexuals.
3397093	3399194	You do not go to a little girl's funeral.
3399674	3401496	and, you know, protest that kind of shit.
3401536	3402517	Especially the Amish.
3402617	3403899	Mentally ill people.
3403979	3413509	I mean, the Amish don't have, you know, I'm sure they keep up to date with some stuff, but it's not like they have a big scope of the world out all the frickin' time.
3413950	3416552	What is there, the Westminster Batmobile?
3416592	3416993	Uh, West...
3417552	3418253	Baptist Church.
3418333	3421736	If you don't believe us, check this site out.
3421756	3423838	GodHatesFags.com.
3423858	3424819	Yeah, it's very interesting.
3424859	3425760	It's disgusting.
3426180	3428923	Well, I mean, if you watch them... I don't take it seriously.
3429023	3429723	I don't take it seriously.
3430064	3431065	These people are seriously ill.
3431345	3433367	Yeah, you should... Here's something fun.
3433667	3437751	Type in Phelps or go to GodHatesFags.com and you can find his name.
3439052	3440533	Go put that shit on YouTube.
3440814	3442635	Shirley Phelps is his wife.
3442795	3443196	Like, the guy...
3445106	3447027	Fox News Interviews with Shirley Phelps.com
3466278	3467459	She obviously hasn't read the Bible.
3467619	3468299	Yeah, seriously.
3468460	3469921	And she looks like she got hit with a shovel, too.
3469941	3472522	It's like... We've got to get back to games.
3472582	3474403	I'm sorry, I went a little overboard.
3475024	3476245	They struck a chord in me.
3476725	3477946	Merry Christmas, everyone.
3477966	3483069	Fuck you, Phelps.
3483249	3485030	Jesus loves you, so worship him or he'll kill you.
3485911	3486511	To quote Chris.
3489633	3493236	To quote Junami, Jesus saves, everybody else takes half damage.
3495327	3496748	I love D&D geek jokes.
3497148	3497588	Anyways.
3498108	3501269	So, hey, Loki, what do you say we continue on with some stories?
3501489	3501749	Yes.
3502350	3510513	So, if you don't have enough money to spend on a PlayStation 3 or, you know, a 360 or even a Wii for that matter, what can you do?
3510633	3511513	What can you do?
3511653	3513034	Well, you can buy retro.
3513694	3520076	And, you know, for the same amount of money, why bother buying virtual console games when you can actually have the original console that was played on?
3520736	3522357	So, shop eBay.
3522737	3524558	Shop your local thrift stores.
3525572	3528653	Find those old consoles and find the games for even cheaper.
3528733	3535016	Hell, if you're in the California area here, go visit Tower or Hell.
3535116	3539058	I think they're all around the country, but visit Tower Records.
3539078	3543500	They're closing down, so you can probably get some old-ass games there if they have some used stuff.
3545301	3546801	But yeah, eBay is your friend.
3546821	3551243	You can find lots of consoles for cheap, especially when people are trying to earn some extra money to buy the new ones.
3552624	3553244	I like eBay.
3553644	3555185	eBay's been taking a lot of my money lately.
3555848	3559049	Well, something that hasn't taken a lot of my money in a long time is the Atari 7800.
3559509	3564451	The system that is most notoriously known for breaking!
3565271	3569052	You can have a working AC adapter, those are pretty hard to come by too, but the systems?
3570112	3570252	No.
3571333	3571813	No, no, no, no.
3572333	3576034	Out of five that I've played, all of them broke.
3576314	3576794	So, yeah.
3577254	3581996	But, some people have decided that it's a good idea to put a new game out on the 7800.
3582036	3582636	We have Pac-Man Collection.
3586280	3586961	For the 7800.
3587021	3590384	And again, the 7800 is a good system, don't get me wrong.
3591004	3601974	But it's a bunch of homebrew games that were compiled by Bob DeCrescendo.
3603595	3609240	And it includes Pac-Man, Puck-Man, Hangley-Man, which is the best name ever.
3610298	3612579	Ultra Pac-Man, Random Mazes Ms.
3612619	3613359	Pac-Man, Ms.
3613399	3614900	Pac-Attack and Ms.
3614940	3637087	Random Mazes has a full color manual you can play it in plus or fast mode which is alternate play options Junior Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man are both missing and it's a $30 package there is let's see there's apparently a link on AtariAge.com you can find it there
3637910	3640351	A new Pac-Man for a system nobody plays anymore.
3640551	3641691	Be still, my fleeting heart.
3642011	3645233	I actually... Or nobody wants to play because it breaks so goddamn much.
3645373	3647953	Last year we did by Super Pac-Man for... Sorry, Ms.
3647973	3649714	Pac-Man for the 5200, the prototype.
3649874	3650174	Oh, that's a 5200.
3650274	3650614	I know.
3650634	3652375	Well, I love 5200.
3652635	3653795	5200's freaking rad.
3653956	3654736	It has kicks on it.
3658657	3662438	Well, too bad my Atari 7800 is five times broken.
3662619	3663879	Everybody's is broken.
3664597	3665398	No, but you know what?
3665478	3671902	For somebody who's like an old school gaming collector type thing, they are going to be just simply amazed at this, you know?
3671982	3673783	And I kind of think... I pick it up.
3674043	3676985	I think it's cool that people would put the effort into something like this, you know?
3677326	3685151	Tease this game all you want, but just the fact that there is so much love for Atari out there that somebody would put something like this together, it's pretty rad.
3685511	3686091	It's pretty rad.
3687092	3687352	Anyway...
3688635	3693239	What's not so rad is Nintendo having to do these programs recently.
3693319	3695221	We talked about the strap thing earlier in the show.
3695761	3699244	Well, they also, this is a full-fledged recall.
3699484	3707951	In Japan, not here, but 200,000 AC adapters for the DS and DS Lights have been recalled overseas.
3708392	3717019	Keep in mind that things plug in differently over there than they do over here, so this news does not affect us here in the
3717694	3718655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3743559	3747901	or, you know, Xboxes causing home fires or, you know, stuff like that.
3748481	3762466	But now, people are worried that Wi-Fi might actually be killing you because the waves it uses causing some sort of brain damage or stuff like that.
3762686	3764967	Why would people actually think this?
3765147	3771710	I mean, that's like thinking that the Earth is flat or that, I don't know, that the...
3772791	3776693	Earth, or the sun revolves around the Earth, and vice versa.
3779214	3780154	People are stupid.
3780174	3783756	This is why people fling remotes at the TV, because they're retarded.
3784076	3785037	They'll believe this shit.
3786437	3787378	You know what?
3788278	3796302	I swear to God, when this, that whole story with the Wii remotes, you know, them offering the extra thick strap for the Wii remote...
3797143	3802864	So many people at my work came up to me and go, have you heard they're recalling those remotes because they keep breaking things, and blah, blah, blah, blah.
3803565	3808686	This is a good cross-section of the people of the United States, you know, the people I work with right here, and they're all idiots.
3808906	3816948	So, you know, they just, unfortunately, they were, you know, getting the story spun by, you know, God knows what news program.
3817537	3817977	Gears of War
3846016	3848919	and that's one million in the U.S.
3848979	3849279	alone.
3849379	3858768	It's the fastest selling next gen console game with lots of death and shooting and killing and bomb shelters.
3860770	3869218	But basically there was an official press release put out about this just stating that
3871736	3887500	that it's basically the quote on here from Jeff Bell, who's the corporate vice president of global marketing for interactive entertainment business at Microsoft Corporation, was saying, Gears of War has clearly won the battle for the title of must-have game of the year.
3887900	3893882	Its phenomenal success is one of many reasons why Xbox 360 is the ultimate place to get together with friends to play this holiday.
3894704	3900547	We've always had high hopes for Gears of War, but we never expected such an overwhelmingly positive response from critics and gamers all over the world.
3900887	3902628	That's a quote from Michael Capps at Epic Games.
3903829	3905049	So, that's pretty cool.
3907571	3921298	And it also said another fun stat on Xbox Live that the total of gameplay sessions online reached 10 million and unlocked 7 million achievements.
3922599	3923219	Oh my gosh.
3925225	3926366	And I have two of those.
3926886	3933890	Paid registrations on Xbox Live have gone over 50% more since the game has launched.
3935091	3935311	Wow.
3936332	3936692	All right.
3936972	3940494	Well, I know you guys have been dying to want to call into the show.
3940554	3943796	It's been a very interesting night tonight, to say the least.
3944516	3949099	It's kind of like our... What did we keep threatening to do last year?
3949119	3952161	Were we going to do a Christmas in Compton special or something like that?
3952768	3955609	It's certainly been a very interesting evening.
3955669	3959611	If we were going to want to do something that we already have a theme song, we could do, you know, Christmas in Hollis.
3960111	3961652	What's that song that Eazy-E did?
3962092	3963993	Christmas in Compton?
3964033	3964333	That's it.
3964413	3965533	It was Christmas in Compton.
3965553	3965774	All right.
3965914	3969095	Well, Run DMC did Christmas in Hollis.
3969455	3969695	All right.
3969735	3973057	Well, anyway, we got to get to the voicemail of the week.
3975951	3977732	We've got to play this real quick.
3977792	3981533	A voicemail here that was left us by a listener.
3981553	3982973	We didn't get a lot of voicemails this week.
3982993	3984314	I'm very disappointed.
3984334	3985594	1-877-GAME-OLR.
3985834	3987695	And there's stuff to give away this week, too.
3988075	3990495	So you want to leave us your Sony commercial.
3990516	3994117	And if you don't know what the heck we're talking about, go to Part A. Here's the voicemail of the week.
3995437	3995817	Hi there.
3995857	3996577	This is Apollo.
3996597	4001899	And I was just listening to last week's podcast when you guys were talking about the point system for the week.
4002563	4003444	on downloading games.
4003844	4006565	And I wanted to note that I actually do have to pay tax.
4006705	4011027	I live in Nashville, Tennessee, and when I buy points online with my credit card, it does charge tax.
4011047	4013128	Just thought it would be an interesting note.
4013629	4014129	You guys later.
4014169	4014549	Love the show.
4014649	4014869	Bye.
4015470	4015850	Interesting.
4015890	4017891	So we have yet to really hear... Thank you for the voicemail, by the way.
4018151	4027736	We have yet to really hear how this whole tax thing breaks down, because we know those of us in California aren't paying the tax on the Wii points, but now we know Tennessee, our listener here, Pennsylvania, and probably some other states are charging.
4028096	4030457	Very interesting how that's all breaking down.
4030757	4032158	Not a whole lot said on that.
4032429	4034450	It is a transaction.
4034510	4037792	You are paying for a service, so it's sensible.
4038872	4042834	At the same time, there's just a little bit of it that seems bizarre to me.
4043895	4044135	Wow.
4044235	4051899	I'd kind of be curious to know, like, do you get taxed on Xbox points, too?
4052399	4054240	That would be kind of what I'd be wondering about, so.
4054775	4056736	Paradox Vincent What's on your mind, buddy?
4086581	4094168	I just got Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky Well, I got the limited edition and I really liked that Everything that packaged together was really nice
4113698	4140588	I haven't got a chance to watch the DVD yet because I don't have a region free but the game itself the skin for it I'd say is a great improvement over anything they've ever done and I like the fact that you can change the music when you're selecting the song my only gripe would really be the new difficulty setting but I haven't really gotten used to
4141223	4144064	to grading them by 12 instead of 8.
4144104	4147384	Oh, yeah, because that was new in Happy Sky, right?
4150105	4162867	Basically, I can only play on 7 on 2EX Red, and there was a really big gap between really easy 7 songs and really hard 7 songs.
4162927	4164248	That's about where I'm at, yep.
4164288	4164388	Yeah.
4165928	4166228	Yeah.
4166926	4171129	That's been pretty much split down between 7 and 8 difficulty now.
4172170	4175292	The song list itself, though, I was really happy with.
4176853	4187581	And my biggest complaint about the songs would be the difficulty of May and Zephyr, which were my two favorite songs.
4189022	4195187	And they're nearly impossible on 7Key and another.
4196331	4200633	but on light mode they're just too easy.
4201933	4202353	Interesting.
4202414	4204434	So there's too much of a gap in the difficulty there.
4206735	4209416	In some songs there's a giant gap in difficulty.
4210457	4213378	I think Blue Mirage was another one of those.
4215119	4218120	Overall I was really happy with it.
4218620	4218940	That's good.
4219701	4222082	One other quick question I have for you then we've got to move on to some other calls.
4222202	4225443	What would you say you would like to see Konami do if they put out
4225999	4255232	Beatmania 13 or Beatmania Distorted out on the console what would you like to see them what do they need to most improve on with their next release most improve on with the next release hmm I stumped you I don't I'm yeah I'm really happy with the Beatmania system and you can't really change the note charts would you like to see an edit mode or something I don't know
4256863	4285747	edit mode where maybe like not necessarily you get to put the notes wherever you want but you can key map them however you want might be interesting if they can make it work that might be interesting I'd say add something new because they have customized now they have class mode they have all these modes and I would really like to see them add some kind of new thing long long mixes might be kind of cool too
4286366	4287006	Alright, we'll see.
4287327	4289548	I've got to let you go, ParadoxVincent, but thanks so much for the call.
4289588	4290388	Have a great week, alright?
4291889	4292609	Thanks for the review.
4293130	4295911	Thanks for the review of Beatmania 2DX Happy Sky.
4296811	4299633	Let's go to another call here on the Skype line.
4300923	4307289	and you can call us again 877-GAME-OLR or username Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
4307689	4308870	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4308910	4309291	Who's this?
4309911	4313695	I hope you know that you've pulled me away from a very important Zelda party to be here.
4313895	4315677	Hello, Megzy.
4315737	4316858	Long time no see.
4319673	4319953	Hi!
4320494	4320554	Hi!
4341648	4344930	Because, okay, where do I start?
4345711	4347912	First of all, Nintendo makes high quality stuff.
4347932	4349794	They wouldn't make faulty straps, I don't think.
4351195	4357519	And second, if you're throwing your Wiimote so hard that the strap's going to break, then you are abusing it in the first place.
4359766	4361127	You work at a game store, right?
4361147	4363469	Have you heard customers complaining about this at all?
4365291	4372056	I've heard people, people have like come up and asked me like, so I heard that all the Wiimotes are recalled, is that true?
4372537	4375879	And I haven't heard anyone say like, my strap broke or something like that.
4376160	4379242	So it's just a big, it's like a big game of telephone gone crazy.
4379823	4380263	Pretty much.
4380843	4383846	I have to ask this, what exactly do you do at a Zelda party?
4383866	4385607	Without pants.
4385767	4388870	Play Zelda and play the song by System of a Down.
4391095	4391936	Without pants.
4392577	4393358	Without pants.
4393698	4397843	Do you eat, like, tortilla chips and call them Triforces?
4398184	4399025	Oh, hells yeah.
4401588	4404111	Okay, I was curious what other little themed things you could do.
4404131	4404972	The Triforce of Dorito.
4404992	4405313	Okay.
4406857	4407898	Cooler Ranch, The Wind.
4408158	4412040	By the way, Megzie, since we're not doing a show next week, we wish you happy birthday on air.
4412800	4413461	Oh, thank you.
4413561	4415942	Yeah, I sang to you and you weren't there to hear it.
4415982	4416622	You want me to do it again?
4416642	4416902	I'm sorry.
4416962	4418003	I can do it again.
4418023	4419324	Yes, I want to hear it again.
4419704	4423566	Happy birthday, Megzie.
4425947	4429249	Happy birthday to you.
4432651	4434612	What's going to be the party on your birthday, Megzie?
4434632	4436453	Are you going to have a Princess Peach party or...?
4437745	4440769	Kind of.
4441489	4443712	Well, then I better not elaborate on that.
4443812	4444934	This is a family show.
4445594	4446736	Any other thoughts?
4447076	4449359	Any other thoughts for our listeners, Megzi?
4450640	4454385	Phoenix Wright 2 should be out right now because Franziska von Karma is hot.
4456107	4457048	Loki says January.
4457401	4458161	January 16th.
4458181	4462644	For some reason you put Drew in a giggle fit and he's curled up in a ball.
4462704	4463204	Are you okay?
4464044	4465925	He's gone fetal.
4466705	4468066	And he's headbanging on the floor.
4468286	4469587	Did you ever see Screamers?
4469907	4472548	Alright, I'll see you in two weeks, baby.
4473089	4473969	Alright, I'll see you then.
4474229	4476550	Bye, Maisie.
4476870	4477711	Have fun at the Zelda party.
4479412	4479672	Alright.
4480772	4481653	Let's go to another call.
4482813	4483914	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4483934	4484314	Who's this?
4488346	4490067	I'm sorry!
4490087	4490928	No, I'm good.
4490968	4495691	I made a little potty break while Jamie and Matt were doing some stories and I'm good now.
4514215	4518318	I'm sorry, I don't know why, I was just overcome with a lot at once, so it was something else.
4518338	4520220	Better to be overcome than, sorry.
4523923	4525164	That's debatable.
4526084	4526885	That's debatable.
4527285	4530148	Anyway, sorry Ranma, what's on your mind?
4533630	4534131	Did we lose him?
4534611	4534951	Is he there?
4534971	4540716	I wanted to touch up on the whole thing about the brick consoles, you know, these things on the
4541949	4543770	Oh, the connection's bad, Ranma.
4543810	4544471	I'm so sorry.
4544591	4548015	You're spending this much money for a system?
4549777	4550377	I'm sorry.
4550497	4551438	I'm so sorry, Ranma.
4551478	4553440	We can't understand a damn thing you're trying to say.
4553500	4556023	It says something about the brick consoles.
4556063	4556844	Let's speculate.
4556884	4559166	What was Ranma trying to say about the brick consoles, you think?
4559527	4561228	You should try to build a house out of Xbox 360s.
4564482	4565162	Raven's Dolphin, how are you?
4565182	4566043	You're not Ranma, go away!
4566063	4566603	No, it's fine.
4566623	4567443	We'll take your perspective.
4567463	4568043	What's up, dude?
4594376	4594917	You sure?
4595077	4595577	You sure?
4595938	4596618	Yes, what's up?
4596818	4597259	We want to know.
4598620	4602604	I just want to tell you, it's just been such a lovely year.
4603084	4607047	Listening to OLR, we found you on PST Drive, September.
4607748	4609269	I forget what day, but it's been great.
4609810	4615335	Yeah, I mean, you won the Wii, so you had a really good year in Orange Tops Radio-wise, didn't you?
4617222	4617743	Yeah.
4618243	4620105	What was your favorite gaming moment?
4620145	4621726	He didn't say that very convincingly.
4621946	4623648	Bandit's telling us to hang up.
4623708	4624488	Do you have a rebuttal?
4624688	4626330	Yeah, no, don't listen to the chat room.
4626730	4632035	Yeah, Bandit said that I'm a quitter in chat, so Bandit can kiss my ass.
4632895	4634717	Yeah, the Wii was alright.
4634937	4635698	No, I'm kidding.
4636078	4638140	Ravensoft, what was the best gaming moment of 2006?
4638300	4643965	The best gaming moment of 2006 was actually winning that Wii.
4644125	4644305	I was
4645192	4659980	So you would say your favorite moment of, oh, that's a good number one and two.
4660000	4661101	Number one is winning the Wii.
4661141	4663242	Number two is Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
4663402	4663642	Rob.
4664202	4664482	Rob.
4664582	4664883	What?
4665063	4665443	Rob.
4665763	4666283	Rob.
4666443	4666663	Rob.
4667044	4667304	Rob.
4667824	4668044	Rob.
4668204	4668364	Rob.
4668484	4668745	Rob.
4669245	4671626	I'm going to turn around and smack you.
4672006	4672226	Rob.
4672807	4672987	Rob.
4673007	4673127	Rob.
4673988	4681113	With this seed money, I'm going to buy a big orange bat to clobber her with when she starts that shit.
4681393	4684054	I just got one of those off eBay.
4684074	4685555	You just bought a rocket launcher?
4686296	4687436	I want a rocket launcher!
4687897	4690498	Oh, it's a USB rocket launcher on eBay.
4690939	4691979	All right, yes, Raven Stolfen.
4694081	4696782	I just want to say, yeah, that is drunken rage.
4697022	4697943	It lives on.
4700690	4703591	DMN is not even here and his tail's between his legs somewhere else.
4703611	4704252	I don't know what to say.
4705972	4707193	He's drunk fapping on the internet.
4707273	4708234	I don't know where he is.
4708254	4709994	He's drunk in a pod somewhere.
4710455	4711915	He's drunk fapping on the internet.
4712115	4714897	Alright, Raven's Dolphin, we gotta let you go to get to some more calls.
4714937	4717938	We appreciate it, though, and hope you have a good week.
4718138	4718839	Bye, guys.
4718879	4720339	Everyone else there, bye.
4721420	4722800	Alright, let's go to this call.
4722820	4724501	I think this might be Ranma on the cell phone.
4724841	4726002	Oh, can I even pick up another call?
4726142	4727963	Why is it a little... Aw, damn it.
4729124	4729464	That's all right.
4729484	4729844	Well, fine.
4729864	4730525	We'll go to someone else.
4731105	4732085	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4732105	4732485	Who's this?
4733286	4734106	Hey, this is Solar Wing.
4734266	4735007	Hi, Solar Wing.
4735027	4735547	What's on your mind?
4737608	4738408	Solar Wing, I'm sorry.
4738448	4739248	I thought you said celery.
4741049	4741369	Sorry.
4741429	4742270	Celery's good for you.
4742290	4743590	It's a good thing.
4744011	4745031	Solar Wing, what's on your mind?
4746772	4747552	We wish traps.
4750093	4751774	How can people even think that they would break?
4752814	4753955	Well, because they have been.
4755596	4756296	No, they haven't.
4757801	4763004	Well, the Wii straps, yes, have broken, but it's due to people's stupidity that they're breaking, we assume.
4763084	4764185	Not that they're in volition.
4764205	4767307	It may be a few fluke circumstances that doesn't happen, but yeah.
4767607	4768808	Right.
4768988	4771610	I don't own one yet, but I will be getting one.
4772571	4775293	And I tried it.
4776173	4777154	I could not break it.
4778055	4778475	I tried.
4778655	4778895	I know.
4779276	4783799	I've been kind of, like, ever since I've been reading these stories, I've been, like, kind of trying to break mine, and you can't.
4786078	4787038	I don't know how people do it.
4789819	4793120	Well, what are you going to be getting when you get your Wii?
4793160	4794280	What kind of games do you want to get with it?
4795161	4796501	Of course, the classic Zelda.
4797341	4799282	Elibits, I want to try that.
4801022	4801882	Elibits is pretty fun.
4802102	4802563	It's a good game.
4803383	4806964	All right, well, good luck to you on your Wii quest, and please don't break any Wii straps.
4807024	4810025	We don't want an Orange Lounge listener to be the first Wii casualty.
4811065	4812845	Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight, buddy?
4813846	4814866	Just happy holidays to you guys.
4815285	4816066	Thank you so much.
4816306	4816726	Same to you.
4817087	4819529	I hope you have a good holiday, and I hope you get a wee under your tree.
4819549	4820049	That would be fun.
4820589	4820990	Oh, yeah.
4821330	4821590	All right.
4821630	4821911	Thanks.
4822131	4822511	Good luck.
4823132	4823332	Bye.
4823672	4823952	Bye-bye.
4824413	4824693	All right.
4824753	4830418	Let's go to one more call here, and I think it's this one that I want.
4830638	4831639	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
4831659	4832079	Who's this?
4833340	4833801	It's Ron.
4833861	4835342	I finally made it back on my cell phone.
4835402	4835902	Finally.
4836002	4836303	All right.
4836343	4838144	What the hell were you saying about brick consoles?
4839445	4840266	My thing is this.
4840346	4842588	If you're spending so much money on these consoles...
4843211	4846872	It wouldn't kill you to drop an extra 20 or 30 bucks on the extended warranty.
4847372	4856513	That way, if it does happen, instead of having to go through the rigmarole of shipping out your unit, go to the store, get it exchanged, you come back, you're back gaming within the hour.
4856994	4860374	Let me tell you what I hate about the extended warranty thing, though.
4860394	4864395	It's not the warranty itself, but it's the fact that these things are always trying to be shoved down my throat.
4864795	4869996	And I'm one of those people that's like when somebody tells me I have to get something or I need it, I'm like, no.
4870885	4871785	I know exactly how you mean it.
4872166	4872906	I mean, I do this for a living.
4872926	4873546	I sell cameras and
4892046	4896348	and laptops and stuff, I tell people about the warranty and I tell them the positives about it, you know?
4896608	4899389	I tell them, hey, you don't have to get it though, it's just a piece of mind.
4899649	4900589	I completely understand.
4900609	4903770	I never force something like that down anyone's throat, you know?
4905211	4912514	Well, it's all about the way you sell it, but granted, all those pros were brought to you by your management and you probably have to do that to some extent, right?
4914635	4921077	Yeah, but I still do it from any other store, but the thing is, I tell people from my own personal experience is because I've been doing this for a very long time.
4921431	4922292	Fair enough, fair enough.
4922792	4924113	I mean, but you know, I don't know.
4924153	4924413	I don't know.
4924433	4928896	I'm kind of finding the basic warranty is usually enough to cover me because if it's faulty, it's going to break in the first few days.
4928956	4934579	But I can understand why people are about the extended warranty, but I don't know.
4934659	4937941	I guess you just have to make your own informed decision based on your needs.
4939942	4942604	And to Funnydale, it does cover that, okay?
4942624	4945806	No, Funnydale says the extended warranty won't help pay off all the doctor's bills.
4947367	4951089	Well, he says it won't help to replace the $5,000 on TV, but the right warranty will, you know.
4951340	4951620	All right.
4952300	4955741	Ranma, we've got to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you so much for calling us back.
4956201	4956421	All right.
4956521	4957121	No problem.
4957141	4957681	Happy holidays.
4958921	4959142	Bye.
4959182	4960242	Do you have something for Ranma?
4960462	4960622	No.
4960942	4961382	Oh, all right.
4961422	4961902	Bye, Ranma.
4961922	4962962	Sorry, Ranchan.
4963082	4964663	I'll tell you when you're here in town.
4964823	4965663	She'll give it to you later.
4966163	4967143	No, not like that.
4967583	4976845	But I have something to play for people because this is what's on my mind about work tomorrow.
4981229	4983390	You know what's sad is probably a lot of people don't even get it.
4984750	4985170	That's right.
4985190	4986110	A lot of people do.
4986130	4987291	A lot of people do, I'm sure.
4987351	4987771	That's fine.
4988411	4990212	No, I get it, but I had to have it explained to me.
4990572	4990892	All right.
4991032	4994953	Anyhow, this is the part of the show where we ask for any last-minute stories, boys and girls.
4996733	4997273	I have a story.
4998574	4998814	Yes.
5000094	5003195	My story has to do with a baseball player.
5004896	5009197	The pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, Joel Zumaia, was...
5010874	5011755	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5040482	5045806	He said it was probably to blame, but no one else really said anything.
5046746	5048908	So, I just thought it was funny.
5051730	5052930	That was pretty funny.
5053911	5055172	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
5055872	5056773	Yeah, I have one.
5057093	5058334	This is going to piss people off.
5059555	5069141	So, with Pokemon Battle Revolution coming out on the Wii in Japan, being one of the first online Wii titles, it comes with a little surprise for you.
5069636	5070237	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5091224	5096407	Yes, it says the problem is you cannot send the friend codes over the Wii Online system either.
5096508	5100110	You have to actually exchange your 12-digit friend code in real life.
5100210	5102952	Nintendo, what the hell is wrong with you?
5103533	5107556	You've been told enough times this friend code system is not effective.
5108506	5115070	I understand what you guys are trying to prevent here with this whole, you know, people afraid about their kids, you know, whatever.
5115110	5123234	But seriously, it's simple enough that, like, both people have to have each other listed before they can even communicate with each other.
5123334	5124455	That's effective enough.
5124635	5125335	End of story.
5125816	5128937	There's no need for this, you know, 5,000 friend code stuff.
5129297	5130058	That's horrible.
5130858	5134680	I don't think Nintendo really gets the online market, do they?
5134700	5135781	I mean, because, I mean...
5136224	5138186	After all, they launched a new next-gen system.
5138206	5139448	Where's that report coming from?
5139688	5143392	Four Color Rebellion, which they're pretty... That's a respectable source.
5143452	5144773	Oh, man, that's horrible.
5145314	5156286	Yeah, so... And the other thing, too, this is actually Four Color Rebellion's reporting IGN articles, so... That's even better.
5156706	5156867	But...
5158841	5159782	They don't get it, do they?
5159922	5161323	They just don't get the online.
5161523	5163184	I mean, that's what I'm thinking.
5163244	5166246	Their online service so far, well, it doesn't exist.
5166767	5168988	Somebody's going to call Nintendo the carpet over this one.
5169429	5171130	I mean, because this is ridiculous.
5171330	5172511	This whole friend code crap.
5172931	5175753	So what the fuck was the point of swapping those friend codes?
5175993	5182218	Oh, so I can just send back some messages and send memes to each other, which, you know, only support one game so far?
5183559	5183679	It's...
5184841	5185541	Very disappointing.
5185722	5188023	Xbox really gets it in the online world.
5188083	5188463	They do.
5188683	5189004	They do.
5189104	5189704	And you know what?
5191345	5194887	They, of course, aren't charging for their online service when Nintendo isn't.
5194907	5197369	But, of course, there is no service to charge for.
5197449	5200270	So I'm just very disappointed.
5200350	5200651	Me too.
5201311	5203052	That's a bad thing to end on.
5203092	5205413	I would have done more FUs if I knew this was coming.
5206234	5206574	All right.
5207194	5209096	That's a heck of a thing to have as a last-minute story.
5209796	5211277	That must have been just late-breaking, huh?
5211973	5214655	Was this just posted a little while ago or before we... I think it's today.
5214875	5215235	Interesting.
5216295	5216636	All right.
5216696	5220357	Well, damn, that's the end of the show.
5220938	5223379	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
5224680	5229702	Chris, thank you so much for being here tonight and everything that you've done.
5230322	5231743	Really appreciate it a lot.
5232063	5233864	And do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?
5234184	5234725	Oh, me first?
5235225	5237626	Okay.
5237686	5238506	Happy holidays.
5238566	5239527	I hope everyone has fun.
5241032	5250440	I'm going to Wisconsin for Megzi's birthday, so we're going to try and leave you guys a message or something for later on.
5252121	5252942	Cute, that'll be fun.
5253042	5255524	Just, you know, have fun, but not too much fun.
5256645	5259648	It's going to be basically, ah, ah, you know.
5259928	5262110	Remember, if you can't be good, be good at it.
5263171	5264732	Drew Nami, thanks for stopping by.
5264812	5267715	Sorry you didn't get to participate in Part A, but that's what happens when you're tardy.
5268471	5269291	Any final thoughts?
5269471	5272292	Hey, I didn't know I was invited.
5274253	5275453	You can come whenever, it's fine.
5275493	5276853	Okay, I'm flattered.
5278694	5280454	Merry Christmas to all and to all a good game.
5280834	5282655	Alright, Loki, your final thought?
5284895	5289416	My final thought is I gotta return Far Cry, I'm thinking it's gonna suck.
5291477	5293417	My final thought is Banana Muffin.
5295178	5296598	Dark Sakura, your final thought?
5301255	5302516	Okay, I was told one more.
5305818	5307380	Reject false icons, bitches.
5310762	5311243	I take that back.
5311283	5313784	This is the best Far Cry Vengeance trailer.
5313885	5315165	Jane has a rabbit in it.
5315406	5316566	And, and, and, and, and, and.
5316707	5316887	And?
5317267	5318908	And, and, Chris is awesome.
5319489	5319769	All right.
5320169	5320529	You're welcome.
5320630	5322171	Just so you guys, I agree, I agree.
5322811	5329496	Just so you guys know, our next live show is not all the way until January of, what's January 7th of 2007.
5330953	5332034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5359042	5360082	Have a great night, everybody.
5360102	5361643	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
5361663	5362824	Thank you for supporting Independent Radio.
5364044	5364384	Bye.
